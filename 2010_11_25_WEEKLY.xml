Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (9.30 am): I would like to raise a matter of privilege arising from the speech made by the Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading, the member for Southport, on 23 November, as recorded in <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
. The minister stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-998354"></A>
The member for Gaven wants a reduction in trading hours ... I will assume that you are not calling for a reduction in trading hours; the member for Gaven is. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998365"></A>
Those statements are untrue and I believe that the minister’s statements are misleading. I would ask that the minister be referred to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee for misleading the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, on 26 October 2010 I warned all ministers that answers to questions, either on notice or without notice, are required to adhere to the normal rules of this House with regard to personal reflections and parliamentary language. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998462"></A>
I also note that it is not the role of ministers in their answers to in effect impersonate the role of the Speaker by pronouncing that questions are in breach of standing orders. There are provisions in place to ensure conformity of questions, including editing. If a minister believes that a question does not conform with standing orders, they should raise that matter with me or my delegates and not take it upon themselves to make a ruling which has no authority and is of no effect. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998480"></A>
I make it clear that I will feel at liberty to rule answers out of order that contain personal reflections and unparliamentary language or that attempt to usurp the role of the Speaker. I will simply return them to the minister concerned for them to submit a new answer. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, standing order 114 regarding answers to questions on notice and standing order 125 regarding ministerial responses to petitions require that answers and ministerial responses shall be supplied to the Table Office within 30 calendar days. Where the 30th day is not a working day, the longstanding practice that has been adopted is that the answers should be provided by the next working day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998510"></A>
An answer is deemed to be tabled when it is received by the Table Office and its receipt is noted by the Clerk or their nominee. I wish to advise all honourable members that, due to the intervening Christmas-new year closure period, answers to questions on notice asked today are required to be supplied to the Table Office by Tuesday, 4 January 2011. Additionally, ministerial responses to any petitions tabled today are required to be supplied to the Table Office by Tuesday, 4 January 2011. </Hansard-Body>

 Honourable members, Brisbane’s Hash House Harriers running group will be undertaking their annual Red Dress Run on Monday, 13 December. This event will see over 200 ‘Hashers’ wearing red dresses while running through the city to raise some money for the Salvation Army’s Christmas Appeal. They have already received over $4,000 in donations for the Salvos and are aiming to raise more on the night. The Red Dress Runners will stop outside Parliament House at 7 pm on 13 December and sing some Christmas carols around the parliament’s Christmas tree.

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.37 am): News of a second large explosion at the Pike River mine in New Zealand yesterday afternoon was devastating. I think I speak for every member of the House when I say that our thoughts are with all of the families, particularly the families of the two Queenslanders--Joshua Ufer and William Joynson. This is a tragedy for the families, friends and loved ones of those Queenslanders and for the New Zealand community. But I think it is also a tragedy that will be felt very keenly by mining communities throughout the world. Here in Queensland, of course, many people in this House represent mining communities, and no doubt they will be feeling this very keenly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998747"></A>
What is happening in New Zealand is a reminder that mining, particularly underground coalmining, can be a very risky business and every one of us needs to make efforts to improve it wherever we can. I am pleased to advise the House that Queensland is deploying more mine rescue personnel and equipment to assist the recovery efforts at New Zealand’s Pike River mine. This is being done at the direct request of mine management following yesterday’s explosion. The new resources will include 15 experienced mine rescue staff from the Queensland Mines Rescue Service, comprising two crews of six, a manager, a coordinator and a counsellor. As members may know, the Mines Rescue Service is staffed by volunteers who are trained and who are employees of many of our major mining companies, and I thank those companies for making these people available. This team will set up and operate what is known as a GAG jet inertisation unit that is being sent to extinguish the underground fire at the mine. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000243"></A>
In addition, we are assembling, on a stand-by basis, a team of senior mine managers and government inspectors to provide relief and assistance at the mine if requested. As you can imagine, the mine staff have been working around the clock, 24 hours a day, for a number of days and we stand ready to provide them with relief personnel if further requested. I thank those who are now members of the team being deployed to New Zealand. On behalf of every member of this House, we send our thoughts and our prayers to those families. </Hansard-Body>

Solar Energy</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001340"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.39 am): In Queensland, our government aims to help householders reduce emissions, take meaningful action on climate change and generate their own power wherever possible. Over the past two years, there has been a huge growth in Queenslanders doing the bright thing and generating solar energy on their household roofs. Just three years ago, there were fewer than 1,000 solar panels on Queensland houses. There are now over 47,000. So in just three years, we have taken it from 1,000 solar panels to 47,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001341"></A>
In April, I announced that we would be aiming to double Queensland’s solar energy capacity and create a virtual solar power station by 2015. We wanted to make a virtual power station made up of the roofs of Queenslanders--soaking up and using solar energy rather than drawing from the coal fired power stations that feed our grid. In March, we were at 250 megawatts and we decided to double that to 500 by 2015. That was made up of 23,000 solar PV systems and 180,000 solar hot-water systems. There are now more than 47,000 solar PV systems and an estimated 206,000 solar hot-water systems. Our total solar energy use has now increased from 250 megawatts in April to 336 megawatts now. It is an extraordinary outcome. The Solar Bonus Scheme pays Queenslanders 44c for every excess kilowatt they feed into the grid. In total, over $9 million has been paid to Queenslanders in discounts on their bills. So Queenslanders who have invested in these PVs have got $9 million worth of savings on their electricity bills.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001342"></A>
There are over 8,800 solar PV systems in Brisbane, but they are all across Queensland. There are 4,500 on the Gold Coast, 1,400 in Cairns and, at the risk of starting another argument, I am sorry to tell the people of Cairns that they are being beaten by Townsville, which has 1,500 systems. I am sure that the local members will move that along. Those figures are just the solar panels. For our solar hot-water rebate, since April we have had 11,000 applications lodged and nearly 9,000 paid, including 1,500 rebates paid in Brisbane, over 1,000 on the Gold Coast, 200 in Cairns and more than 300 in Townsville.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001343"></A>
We announced in April that we wanted to see that enthusiasm to do the bright thing in homes rolled out into clubs and community groups. In May this year, we announced that we would set aside up to $3.3 million per year over the next three years from the Gambling Community Benefit Fund to assist sporting and community groups make the switch to solar. I am pleased to advise the House that these organisations have got as much enthusiasm as households for this initiative. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001346"></A>
For the funding round which closed on 31 August, the Gambling Community Benefit Fund received more than 1,250 applications requesting almost $30 million. Of those, 199 applications were from sport and community groups requesting solar projects worth $1.7 million. During the 12 months before the announcement that these funds were available, just 23 solar initiative applications were received. So demand for solar from our community groups has leapt from 23 applications in a 12-month period to almost 300 in three months. Applications have been lodged by all kinds of groups, including sporting clubs such as cricket, swimming, soccer, rugby, tennis and hockey, and a variety of child-care centres, kindergartens, schools, YMCAs and other not-for-profit organisations. These applications will be assessed by the gambling committee later this week and the next round will close in late February. It has never been easier to do the bright thing. You can reduce emissions in your home and now at your local club too. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.44 am): Our government is committed to having the best Public Service that we can--a Public Service that is professional, has integrity, provides high-quality advice to government and delivers responsive and timely services to the people of Queensland. As part of our integrity and accountability reforms, I committed to undertake a biennial State of the Service Report. I am pleased today to table for the benefit of the House Queensland’s inaugural State of the Service Report.</Hansard-Body>

 Queensland Public Service Commission, State of the Service Report 2010 [<HypertextLink>
<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=5310T3654" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL">3654</A></HypertextLink>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001351"></A>
This is a report about the Queensland Public Service, its people and its performance, and it sets out the achievements and the challenges of the Public Service as well as areas for improvement. The report draws on a survey of over 40,000 staff who are employed under the Public Service Act of Queensland. The survey results tell us that, overwhelmingly, public servants enjoy their jobs and care deeply about their work: 81 per cent of those surveyed enjoy the work in their current job, 84 per cent are motivated to do the best possible work they can and an overwhelming 96 per cent are willing to put the extra effort in when needed to get the job done.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001353"></A>
These are good results and they show that the Queensland Public Service is professional and committed to its work, but, as you would expect with a survey of this size and a report like this, it also identifies many areas for improvement. These include the need for our agencies to better manage major organisational change, and this survey was done at a time when major machinery of government changes were occurring; the need to improve the management of employee underperformance; and the need to build the capability of senior leaders. Many of the survey results pointed to public servants who hold a relatively low opinion of the capacity of some of their senior leaders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001355"></A>
The Public Service Commission has prepared an action plan to address these challenges and areas for improvement. Our government is implementing a range of integrity and accountability reforms, including a service-wide code of conduct and annual ethics training for all employees. These reforms will build on the strong practical commitment the Public Service has to ethical conduct. Even before the integrity and accountability reforms have been fully implemented, I was pleased to see that 76 per cent of all of those surveyed believed that their organisation actively encourages ethical behaviour by all of its employees.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001356"></A>
The State of the Service Report will be prepared every two years, and the 2012 report will allow us to track our progress as we respond to the issues identified in this inaugural report. A number of other states publish similar documents and the Commonwealth has done so for a number of years. The Public Service Commission is conducting information sessions for employees and unions about the report and will talk with staff in many regional centres over the coming months. The next survey will be conducted in 2012. It will be broadened to include surveys of staff in health, policing and emergency services who are employed under different legislation. That will give us an even more comprehensive review of the state of the service. I commend the report to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.46 am): Our government has been undertaking the serious reform needed to secure a strong future for Queensland. We have been committed to building the infrastructure of tomorrow, to generating jobs and to ensuring our long-term prosperity. That task never ends. Today, the government continues on the path of reform. Reform is never easy but that does not make it any less urgent. Our state, unlike any other state in Australia, has for a long time had the benefit of a fully funded superannuation scheme. While all other governments in Australia struggle against this challenge, we are determined to maintain that position of strength. Our state owned investment arm, QIC, the Queensland Investment Corporation, scours the world looking for suitable investments to ensure that our public superannuation scheme is well invested.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001362"></A>
Today I am pleased to announce that the government will enter into a transaction to transfer the state’s toll road business, QML, the owner of the Gateway and Logan motorways, to the Queensland Investment Corporation. This will keep the state’s toll roads in public hands, while strengthening our state’s finances. This is a win-win outcome. The government’s decision will maintain the legislative protections to ensure that tolls cannot increase by anything more than CPI. QIC owns a 25 per cent share of the M7 Motorway in New South Wales, and it also owns shares in the Thames Water company. The toll road business in Queensland is a natural fit for this investment organisation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001368"></A>
This decision, once again, is one for the long-term benefit of the state. With legislation already in place to protect against above-inflation toll increases, we will ensure that the interests of Queenslanders are protected. This is a sound decision. It is a decision that improves the state’s finances, takes us closer to our AAA credit rating, strengthens the government’s superannuation scheme and protects the public interest.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002557"></A>
In the same vein, today the government also releases the outcome of a review of the structure of our government owned electricity generators. As a result of this review we will overhaul the three generating companies--CS Energy, Tarong and Stanwell--and form two government owned generating companies. This will protect the value of our generating assets, while channelling $60 million back into our bill-busting ClimateSmart Home Service for another two years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002559"></A>
The existing ClimateSmart Home Service program has been a huge success. More than 240,000 households have already signed up, collectively saving up to $78 million in their water and power bills. The environment has also got the benefit. Our greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced by 4.3 million tonnes because of this program. Again, this is a reforming decision driven by a strong, reforming government--a government that refuses to stand still, a government that is focused on the future. We are committed to making the tough calls that need to be made. We are committed to delivering on building for the future, strengthening our state’s finances and generating the jobs of tomorrow--just like we said we would. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.51 am): The government put forward an economic plan to build a stronger state economy and protect Queensland jobs, and we are delivering on that plan. As we framed last year’s budget, this government took the tough decision to implement the biggest reforms of the state balance sheet in Queensland’s history. We put our eyes on the horizon, not on the next day. The decision was based on the principle that in the 21st century, with the increasing service needs of an ageing and growing population, the government should not be funding commercial port, rail and forestry businesses into the future at the expense of health, education and public transport. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002565"></A>
Our decision has been vindicated by the results that we have achieved. On Monday, the float of QR National exceeded the expectations of commentators around the country. Yesterday, the share price closed up again. It has outperformed the market once again. Individual investors who took part in the float, including over 9,000 QR National employees, stand to take this benefit. We have achieved strong outcomes for the long-term lease of both Forestry Plantations Queensland and the Port of Brisbane. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002567"></A>
These transactions have been conducted with one goal in mind--to put the state of Queensland on the path towards regaining its AAA credit rating. Throughout the global financial crisis our response was to protect jobs and to protect our nation-leading building program. Coming out of the global financial crisis, as we build the Queensland recovery, our response has been to maintain those core principles of protecting jobs and maintaining infrastructure investment while charting a course back to AAA. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002568"></A>
Today the government announces further steps on that path. As the Premier has just advised the House, the government will move to transfer the ownership of Queensland Motorways Ltd, the owner of the Gateway and Logan motorways, to the state’s investment arm, QIC. The decision delivers key outcomes. The toll roads will continue to benefit the public sector and taxpayers. It strengthens the state’s balance sheet and strengthens our claim to regain our AAA credit rating. It strengths the state’s superannuation scheme, with the business to be owned by QIC’s defined benefit fund. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002569"></A>
This decision is a strong, clear and determined demonstration of our commitment to govern for the long-term future for the state. Most importantly, it delivers on our commitment to chart a course back to AAA while protecting jobs and protecting our building program, just like we said we would. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002570"></A>
QIC is a natural owner of the toll roads business. It is already, as the Premier said, a 25 per cent owner of the Sydney tollway the M7. It has extensive commercial interests around the world. Most notably, it is a significant shareholder in the Brisbane Airport Corporation, privatised by John Howard, and one of Queensland’s fastest growing companies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002571"></A>
QML is a perfect fit for QIC. It has long-term CPI linked returns. It is exactly the sort of asset that QIC looks around the globe to purchase, especially for the DB mandate. It is on that front that I would remind members of the House that, as at the last actuarial review, the Queensland superannuation scheme remains fully funded. Obviously, the last three years have been challenging in investment markets, to say the least. An independent report published in the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 newspaper earlier this week shows that Australia’s state and federal governments had combined superannuation liabilities of around $156 billion. The report noted that Queensland accounted for not one cent of that money.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002572"></A>
While all other governments in Australia have to confront this tsunami of liability into the future, here in Queensland we have maintained our unique and enviable position of having a fully funded superannuation scheme. Future generations of Queenslanders will reap this benefit while the taxpayers of other states will be lumbered well into future with an ever-expanding liability. The Queensland superannuation scheme is without peer in Australia and, as far as we are aware, without peer around the world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002573"></A>
The next actuarial review is due for completion next year. This move will strengthen the fund, protecting the superannuation entitlements of 80,000 Queenslanders, including our teachers, nurses, police, front-line staff and other public sector workers. I can advise the House that, as with the other transactions the government is undertaking, this will be overseen by an independent probity adviser. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002574"></A>
Award workers and the equivalents in QML will receive the same entitlements as the workers of FPQ, the Port of Brisbane and QR National. There will be no change for motorists. The government has already legislated to ensure future tolls can only be increased by CPI annually. I expect Treasury and QIC to begin commercial negotiations immediately, with the process completed in the first half of next year. It is a strong, clear-eyed decision focused on the long-term interests of the state. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (9.56 am): On another matter, today I table the Genco review, which sets out the reforms to ensure that our fleet of state owned generators continues to provide secure supply to Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>

 Shareholder Review of Queensland Government Owned Corporation Generators, November 2010 [<HypertextLink>
<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=5310T3655" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL">3655</A></HypertextLink>
].</Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002580"></A>
As part of our program of ongoing economic reform, this government announced in the 2008-09 major economic statement a review of the structure of our government owned generators. The government resolved in 2006 to maintain public ownership of the generators, and this review has not altered that position. The continued ownership of the baseload fleet is a matter of settled policy for this government. The outcomes of the review will keep the generators in public ownership but restructure them to meet the challenging markets they now face. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002581"></A>
The electricity generation market has changed markedly. Our fleet provided more than 90 per cent of the market in 1998, when the national electricity market was introduced. Today, private investment has entered the market, particularly in gas, which sees our fleet accounting for around 59 per cent of the Queensland electricity generation market. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002582"></A>
The restructure will cut down corporate overheads, with a streamlining of the three generation companies into two. This will put similar generators in the same company and improve the ability to have more generating capacity contracted. In simple terms, it means that our generators will be better placed to meet future challenges. That will keep them operating longer with the jobs in the sector protected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002584"></A>
Today is good news for the workforce of our generation sector. We have commenced today formal consultation with unions about the restructure. We have also commenced formal discussions with the generators. Because of competition law requirements, each of our individual generation companies could not be briefed prior to the government’s announcement today. That process now commences with the government targeting a 1 July 2011 start date, pending the results of the consultation and regulatory approval process required in the national market. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002585"></A>
Today’s announcement and the proposed restructure will not impact on the electricity price paid by households. The government is determined not to add to the pressure facing households. The savings from the corporate streamlining are being applied to extend the bill-busting ClimateSmart Home Service, as the Premier has outlined. The review charts a course for the long-term future for our generators in public ownership and providing secure supply that will help meet our electricity requirements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002586"></A>
We are focusing on ensuring that private sector investment in funding and building new generation capacity will continue to be encouraged to ensure taxpayers do not have to bear this risk. We said in the major economic statement that we would target more private investment. We are on track to deliver on those targets. We said that we would ensure that our fleet of generators was ready to tackle the challenges of tomorrow, and this review delivers. It protects the jobs of the workers in our generators today and for the future, delivering jobs, not cuts--just like we said we would. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (9.59 am): We have one of the best health systems in the world. According to the World Health Organisation, Australia’s life expectancy of 81.4 years is second only to Japan’s at 82.2 years. This year’s Health budget is $9.99 billion--nearly a quarter of the overall state budget--and our massive $7.33 billion health infrastructure program is building and expanding hospitals and health services across the state, and we are getting on with the job of delivering. This year we turned the sod on the $354 million Translational Research Institute at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, which will be a one-stop shop for discovery, production, clinical testing and the manufacture of new biopharmaceuticals and treatments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002627"></A>
In Cairns we opened a new cardiac catheter laboratory in August, completed the new primary health-care centre at Yarrabah, officially opened the Cairns community health centre and the new car park, announced the successful tenderers for the managing contractor for the hospital redevelopment, and let the tender for the radiation oncology service in the new Liz Plummer Cancer Care Centre that will provide patients in the far north with cancer services for the first time from the middle of next year. In Townsville we unveiled the Townsville district clinical services plan in January, the revised master plan in October and a brand-new MRI machine. We ramped up on the new North Block, which will accommodate the largest emergency department in Queensland, construction works commenced for the expansion of the neonatal intensive care unit for the north’s sickest babies, and car parking at the hospital will get a boost with our announcement in November that we have purchased the old CSIRO land adjacent to the hospital.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002631"></A>
Further down the coast we opened a brand-new hospital at Yeppoon, turned the sod on the Mackay Hospital and opened the new Bundaberg Hospital emergency department. West in Mount Isa we released the updated Mount Isa district master plan, let the tender for the new Mount Isa Hospital redevelopment and opened new facilities for accommodation for renal dialysis patients, as well as let the tender for construction of the new multipurpose health service at Winton. In Toowoomba we opened a new birthing centre and released a tender for the emergency department redevelopment and we progressed the new Queensland Children’s Hospital, the Gold Coast University Hospital and other major hospital expansions at Cairns, Mackay, Mount Isa, Robina, Rockhampton and Townsville at a cost of $4.836 billion.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002632"></A>
Right across the state the Bligh government is building and expanding hospitals, and the evidence is there for all to see. But we know that health care is not just about bricks and mortar. That is why our $9.99 billion budget is providing more services to more Queenslanders closer to home. In the last half of 2009-10 we achieved our goal of reducing by 90 per cent the number of patients waiting more than one year for surgery. As reported in <Hansard-Italic>
The state of our public hospitals June 2010 report</Hansard-Italic>
, in 2008-09 we maintained our position of having the shortest median elective surgery wait times in the nation and we employed an additional 2,197 doctors, nurses and allied health professionals made up of 378 medical officers, 1,431 nurses and 388 clinical staff.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002634"></A>
In this year’s budget we funded a new $8.5 million mental health antistigma campaign and a $39.1 million four-year plan to implement a state-wide network of persistent pain services to commence in 2011 at the Gold Coast, Townsville, PA and Nambour. We funded doubling the number of cochlear implants for children, as well as funding language services for our deaf children through the Hear and Say Centre, the Mater and the Royal Children’s Hospital. We protected 931,729 Queenslanders against swine flu, including about 126,934 Queenslanders who were vaccinated at over 380 weekend school based swine flu clinics delivered by Queensland Health. What is more, we delivered a huge win for Queenslanders when we signed up to the national health reform, securing new funds of $755 million for better emergency departments, faster elective surgery and more hospital beds. We also secured commitments from the Commonwealth for an additional $4.1 billion of funding up to 2019-20.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002636"></A>
Queensland Health is not a perfect organisation. For example, the payroll issue has been a particularly challenging one, but fix it we will. Yet every single day we offer 50,000 occasions of service across the state in a massive area in a free health system in a country that has the second longest life expectancy on earth. We can all make our criticisms, but we should also celebrate our strengths, particularly that of our staff, and acknowledge that if a person is truly ill--regardless of whether they are a millionaire or a pauper--there is no better place for medical treatment on earth than Queensland or Australia. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (10.03 am): At the last election we made a commitment to keep 106,000 building workers in jobs and to keep building Queensland’s much needed infrastructure. In sharp contrast, the opposition promised to cut jobs, services and infrastructure and lost the election as a result. Accordingly, none of the following projects would have happened if Queenslanders had of voted differently. Last month alone on five major Public Works building sites around $67 million was spent and 2,364 jobs were provided. There would have been no $67 million nor 2,364 jobs had the opposition won.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002643"></A>
At the Gold Coast University Hospital, the area where the Leader of the Opposition comes from, expenditure in October was $24.7 million and the workforce on 31 October was 1,064 workers. Again, had the opposition won the last election, there would be no 1,064 jobs and there would be no $24.7 million being pumped into the Gold Coast economy, because those opposite promised that they would cut the building program.</Hansard-Body>

 Thank you, Mr Speaker. At the Gatton correctional facility October expenditure was $7.2 million and the October daily average workforce was 400 people. That is 400 people every day employed in the member for Lockyer’s electorate. That would not have happened had those opposite won the last election. Every one of those people of course are supporting a family and buying goods and services in that electorate. Not one of them would have had a job if the result had gone a different way at the last election. At the Lotus Glen correctional facility--I recently was in Cairns and the honourable member for Cairns and other members in that region have been talking about jobs and employment in that region--October expenditure was $7.5 million and the average workforce was 250 people. That is 250 people in Far North Queensland who would not have a job had the opposition won the last election. Had those members in Far North Queensland not been re-elected, there would be 250 people who would not have jobs and there would not have been $7.5 million last month going into that already burdened economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002658"></A>
At the Brisbane Supreme Court down the road expenditure was $13.5 million last month and average daily workers on site was 430.

With regard to the Carrara AFL stadium, the area where the honourable member who interjected before comes from--I do not know where he stands on it; some days he is for it and some days he is not--those opposite opposed it at the last election; that is one thing for sure.

 I just want to point out that every apprentice and every carpenter I have ever met on a building site still has a nail bag and a hammer. That just shows how irrelevant the opposition is. I have a 30-year-old swing hammer. I know I am an old building worker, but they still have them today. They are 20 ounces these days because they only use pine. We also officially opened the William McCormack Place stage 2 in Cairns and the local member, Mr Wettenhall, was with me at that opening. We had a great time at that opening, particularly the wonderful smoking session by the local Indigenous people.</Hansard-Body>

 We are going to continue with our capital works program the way we promised at the last election. There are 106,000 Queensland families who depend on it. We have continued to deliver it. The opposition lost the last election on the basis that Queenslanders could not put faith in them, because they knew that they were going to cut the building program. We are going to continue to build jobs and create a strong economy in this state. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (10.11 am): Can I commence my ministerial statement by following the Premier in acknowledging the tragic deaths of those 29 miners at Pike River in New Zealand. On behalf of the Queensland mining industry, I join with the Premier and all other people who have expressed their thoughts and condolences to the bereaved. It is an unfortunate reminder of how dangerous this industry is. But if anything comes out of such a tragedy it is for us to redouble our efforts to ensure that the industry in Australia, but in particular in Queensland, remains one of the safest mining industries in the world. That is a task that we should never relax from. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004249"></A>
It has been a busy and productive year in the portfolios of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Trade, and I am delighted to report to the House that the hard work done over the last 12 months has positioned Queensland for unprecedented growth and development over the next year. History will show that the policies introduced by this government in 2010 supported and encouraged a revived resource industry that helped protect our economy from the worst of the economic downturn experienced overseas. But it is important now to build on that base, and the government has in place initiatives across a wide range of sectors to ensure a stronger Queensland in 2011.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004250"></A>
Over the past year, Queensland has established itself as a world leader in coal seam gas exploration and development. Next year we will be well on our way to becoming one of the world’s biggest exporters of liquefied natural gas. Through this emerging industry the government is delivering thousands of jobs, as promised, and has encouraged billions of dollars in investment into our state. But we have said all along that this growth cannot come at any cost. This week the Premier released a second LNG blueprint, which is a road map for the industry’s growth over the next 12 months--sustainable growth, I might underline. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004251"></A>
We have framed legislation to ensure that our CSG industry is safe and sustainable and have new laws to ensure a fair balance between the interests of resource companies and the interests of landowners. We have also appointed a new gas commissioner, who will play a key role in the development of the gas industry in a safe, sustainable way.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004252"></A>
The government has also delivered food security for generations to come by protecting the best of the best of our farming lands through our draft strategic cropping policy framework, to be finalised in the near future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004253"></A>
I am proud to say that this government has led Australia with renewable energy initiatives through our $115 million solar budget package and Solar Bonus and Solar Hot Water rebate schemes. As the Premier mentioned this morning, we have paid more than 8,000 rebates this year alone, with about 1,500 rebates going to pensioners and low-income households to convert to solar hot water. We expect the uptake of this system to continue strongly into the new year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004256"></A>
Over the last 12 months this government also has delivered on its promise to protect Queensland’s most pristine rivers through our wild rivers legislation. We will continue to fight for that protection, despite the crash-through attempt by federal opposition leader Tony Abbott to overturn state laws.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004257"></A>
Another major achievement this year was the introduction of the Land Valuation Bill 2010. This legislation replaced a system of valuation introduced more than 65 years ago, and the benefits of this modern new legislation will be seen in 2011. From next year, non-rural property values in Queensland will be assessed under site value methodology, which is a modernised valuation approach in line with other Australian jurisdictions. The government started the year with a plan across the many areas of my portfolio. We have delivered on our promises and will stick to our plan to deliver a stronger Queensland in 2011. <Hansard-Speech-End>

A Flying Start for Queensland Children</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<A ID="pgfId-1004260"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. GJ WILSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (10.15 am): The Bligh government is committed to giving young Queenslanders a flying start to learning and life. We want our students to get a world-class education and to be among the highest performers in the country. That is why in February this year we announced one of the most significant proposed reforms to education in this state’s history. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004261"></A>
The education green paper contains three main objectives: getting ready for school, getting ready for secondary school and boosting performance for all schools. There was an overwhelming response from parents, principals, teachers and stakeholders during public consultation between February and June. Around 2,600 people attended 93 public forums across Queensland and more than 1,500 written submissions were received. The flying start website received around 90,000 hits and more than 9,500 copies of the online green paper were downloaded. I would like to thank all of the participants for their input and interest in the education of Queensland students. Their feedback is being carefully considered and will play a big part in our final decisions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004262"></A>
The biggest question raised in the green paper was: in the 21st century, what is the best learning environment to provide a first-class education for 12- to 13-year-old students? That is the key question parents want us to carefully consider and that is what we are doing. Opinion is mixed on this proposal and respondents put forward a wide range of valid points from across the spectrum that are all very worthy of consideration. It is not a simple, black-and-white issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004263"></A>
Many recognise that our year 7s, who will be at least six months older than they currently are, will be hungry for new challenges and knowledge. However, legitimate concerns raised include the readiness of students, adequate resources and the impacts on families in rural or remote areas. The challenge we face is to provide the best learning environment for the educational, social and emotional needs of 12- to 13-year-olds. The decision on whether students of this age are best placed in a primary or secondary school setting is a significant one and one that we will not be rushed into making.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004266"></A>
The Queensland Council of Parents and Citizens Associations, the Queensland Teachers Union and the Queensland Association of State School Principals have all indicated that they would like more time to consider the implications of this proposal and to continue to provide feedback from parents, teachers and principals. We are also continuing our consultation with the Catholic and independent sectors and our key stakeholders. We will continue to work together with our stakeholders on this important decision.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004268"></A>
I would like to thank everyone who is travelling this journey with us. Their contribution is invaluable, especially the contribution of parents, and will ensure that we continue to improve and enhance education for young Queensland. I look forward to updating the House on the future of education in Queensland in the new year.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Local Government, Rates and Charges</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004271"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. D BOYLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships) (10.18 am): In some of Queensland’s local government areas ratepayers have expressed confusion about their council’s budgets in relation to increases in various rates and charges. In fact, rates across Queensland’s local governments went up on average six to eight per cent this year. Nonetheless, within various local government areas there were rating differences according to factors such as rates equalisation through the amalgamation program, differential rating, growth pressures on council infrastructure and revenue losses due to the global financial crisis. What was apparent was that it was very hard for residents of one council area to compare what had actually happened across all of their rates, utilities and charges with the previous year and nor was it possible for residents in one council area to compare their council’s revenue decisions with those of a neighbouring council. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005696"></A>
We have been engaged with Queensland’s councils this year in a huge reform program and there is no doubt that there is more work to be done. It is our intention, in partnership with local government, to bed down these reforms in 2011. Nonetheless, a small reform that I announce today will be through the regulations attached to the Local Government Act 2009. This will be a mandatory requirement for the disclosure in all council annual budgets of one particular figure that is consistently calculated by all councils, and that is the percentage change in total rates and utility charges revenue for the year ahead.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005697"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Johnson:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Is that going to make a difference to the Central Highlands Regional Council? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005698"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BOYLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This figure represents the actual increase in revenue drawn from the ratepayers of the local government incorporating all general and differential rates, separate and special rates and utility--water, sewerage, waste--charges and includes the effects of any changes to discounts and remissions so that the ratepayers, the residents of Central Highlands and every other resident of Queensland’s 73 councils, will have a transparent figure whereby they can compare what is happening in this year’s rates and charges in their budget with what happened in the previous year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005699"></A>
By requiring this figure to be published by all councils, residents and ratepayers can see for themselves what the actual level of increase in revenue is regardless of ups and downs, discounts and remissions. Yes, it does mean--no doubt for very good reason--that when a council significantly increases revenue compared to the previous year this will be immediately apparent and, of course, the council will be expected to provide an explanation for this change. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005700"></A>
The change to the regulation, as attached to the Local Government Act 2009, will be within the reporting requirements and the local government principles. The publication of this figure in council budgets provides an apples-with-apples paradigm: it increases transparency so that residents and ratepayers can better understand what is happening in their council budget from one year to the next. I look forward to working with Queensland’s councils in 2011 to deliver for all Queenslanders. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005705"></A>
As members would know, this government has in recent years been active in the field of taxi reform. We have made drivers and passengers safer by introducing security cameras into every cab. We have raised industry standards by last year establishing a Taxi Compliance Unit for the first time and we have raised the bar on driver standards by introducing minimum standards so that drivers must be at least 20 years old and must have had an Australian licence for a year before being allowed to drive; from the first of this month drivers have to do a test to demonstrate that they meet the national minimum English standard for taxidrivers before being authorised to drive; and from this coming January new minimum training standards, delivered by a registered training organisation, will come into place.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005706"></A>
With this plan we are going further still. One of the key complaints I have heard is that drivers, many of whom are in a weak bargaining position, feel that they are being ripped off. Government is providing a direct response to that. Early next year we will amend legislation to make it a legal requirement for drivers and operators to have a written, signed bailment agreement. The agreement must stipulate the revenue share and how drivers are to be covered by insurance. Disputes about the agreement will be appealable to QCAT--an avenue which has never been used before. A new requirement for each taxi booking company to have transparent disciplinary processes for the issue and removal of PINs will be introduced through government contracts. Should PIN disputes continue to arise as an issue, the government will consider legislating to make these, too, appealable to QCAT. Drivers will be protected from exploitative work arrangements with new restrictions on set pay-in driving arrangements. Set pay-ins will only be available for drivers with a year’s experience and then only at the driver’s request.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015090"></A>
Police liaison officers will be established in every police district, giving drivers a contact who knows their complex industry and a new public education campaign, jointly funded by the government and the Taxi Council of Queensland, will be run to promote treating drivers with respect. The Taxi Compliance Unit will be doubled to 12 officers, increasing standards, and the mystery shopper will become a permanent fixture. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005708"></A>
This reform package will not give everyone everything they want. It does not fundamentally change the business relationship by stipulating revenue share, as the Workplace Rights Ombudsman requested, and it does not discriminate against foreign drivers as requested by the Cab Drivers Association. I table that request.</Hansard-Body>

It does, however, take very significant steps to protect drivers from exploitation and to continue the improvement in the quality of customer service. The plan is the result of the most comprehensive consultative process government has ever run in this industry, including direct connections with drivers, operators, booking companies, passengers and industry and it does strike a balance between improving quality and minimising the impact on fares. This is much needed reform to modernise an industry which carries the high expectation of the travelling public. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005711"></A>
Next year we will continue our efforts right across the transport sector to improve customer service and reliability. I believe this is the right balance in the public interest and I commend the plan to all involved in the taxi industry. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 Honourable members, today we will be visited by the students, teachers and parents from the Redland Bay State School in the electorate of Redlands, the Kumbia State School in the electorate of Nanango and, as I said earlier, Our Lady of the Rosary School, Kenmore, in the electorate of Moggill. </Hansard-Body>

Local Sport and Recreation Jobs Plan</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005790"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK </Hansard-Member-Up>
(10.29 am): My first question without notice is to the Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport. I refer to correspondence sent to Labor members of parliament on 28 October regarding funding allocations for the Local Sport and Recreation Jobs Plan in their electorates. Those letters were sent so members of parliament could advise local groups. Can the minister advise if he sent similar letters to non-government members of parliament? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005792"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question, because the Local Sport and Recreation Jobs Plan helps us to assist clubs from about five to eight clusters with recruiting and retaining volunteers. Yes, I promote that plan to everybody. In fact, I went to the electorate of the member for Kawana to attend a sports funding workshop. I invited him to speak at that funding workshop. I have spoken to many members with regard to a range of things. A couple of weeks ago I was in the electorate of the member for Noosa, although unfortunately he was not able to attend on that occasion. He sent his apologies. I do not have any hesitation in promoting the program because it promotes grassroots sport. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005793"></A>
The program aims to increase the numbers of volunteers who work with the sports clubs because, as we all know, if we do not increase volunteer numbers the future of sport is in doubt. That is what the Local Sport and Recreation Jobs Plan is all about. It is about jobs. It is not about cuts, which is what those opposite would do. Let us look at the UK, where the conservatives have cut funding to grassroots sport by 24 per cent while continuing to support elite sport. That is what conservatives do and that is what those opposite would do. We are about jobs and we are about supporting volunteers. I will continue to do that. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. It proves that he wants to support local sport and let us hope that he continues to do so. I have no hesitation in travelling to the Gold Coast to promote what we are doing for local grassroots sport, including in the electorates of the members for Surfers Paradise, Mermaid Beach, Burleigh and all other members. Talking about the Gold Coast reminds me about the AFL draft held there last week. I was thinking about what would happen if we had a political player draft, just as the AFL does. Clubs receive the pick based on their position on the ladder at the end of the season. We know that the LNP would receive the priority of picks. Why? Because it finishes last every year. It has no policy, no direction and no leadership. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005804"></A>
Things have been controversial over there. They always get the top picks, but why? Because all year they have been tanking on Queenslanders. Let us look at their No. 1 draft pick. No doubt that is the opposition leader. He barracks for the Bears, even though they have not been around for a while. He has had done all the team promo shots, but he will not go to a press conference because he is too busy having a rub down. He will not last the preseason. They have the best resourced football department, but they are oh so lazy. Let us look at their alternative: the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. We all know that he has already been delisted three times--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I understand that in this place it is an accepted practice that once the minister has answered the question the minister can then stray into other areas. The minister has not even attempted to address the question that was asked of him. That is a clear breach of standing orders. I ask you to rule accordingly. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1005810"></A>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I was talking about sport on the Gold Coast, which is what the question was about. The question was about how we support local sport. How we do that is just like the AFL draft. Let us look at the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who has been delisted three times, but he is trying to get up as a contracted player. Who was their No. 1 pick? Do honourable members remember the member for Gympie? He was sin-binned for showing too much promise. What about the member for Caloundra? Brendan Fevola has nothing on him off-field. The member for Moggill had a shot right in front of goal, but he kicked it out on the full. The member for Clayfield is sitting on the interchange bench because the numbers continue to let him down. There is no outstanding young talent over there. There is no great reveal. Their draft is full of tired old lazy players. Let us compare that to this side. We have strong leadership and a long list of achievements that will sustain us through the four quarters. </Hansard-Body>

Queensland Investment Incentives Scheme</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005814"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs SMITH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Premier and Minister for the Arts. ‘Queensland, Where Australia Shines’: tourism continues to be the lifeblood for many Queensland workers. Can the Premier update the House on the latest developments with the China Southern direct flights, which are a direct result of our Queensland Investment Incentives Scheme? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005816"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. Of course, coming from the Gold Coast the honourable member knows only too well that the tourism industry is one of our largest industries and one of the biggest employers in the state. It has been hit very hard by the global financial crisis, and in many cases it has been hit by bad weather and the Australian dollar is not helping. Therefore, recently I was very pleased to see the China Southern Airlines inaugural flights straight into Brisbane. We are very hopeful that we will see similar direct flights into Cairns before too long. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005818"></A>
This week I am very pleased to advise that we will have 17 key Chinese media representatives in town, showing visitors just how easy it is to travel directly to Brisbane. Arriving on a China Southern direct flight, hosted by Tourism Queensland and China Southern Airlines, the 17-strong media contingent will be coming from various prominent Chinese news outlets such as the <Hansard-Italic>
Beijing Times</Hansard-Italic>
, the <Hansard-Italic>
Beijing News</Hansard-Italic>
, <Hansard-Italic>
China Daily</Hansard-Italic>
, China Central Television and Radio China. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005823"></A>
This is a fantastic opportunity for us to showcase everything that South-East Queensland has to offer to millions of potential Chinese visitors. I expect to see them on the Gold Coast, in and around the city and on the Sunshine Coast. Obviously they will be filming and taking everything back to their programs in China. The Chinese market is an enormous tourism market. Visitation from China is up 14 per cent this year and we intend to do everything we can to grow it. It puts Queensland at the front of potential Chinese visitors’ minds and it puts our state on the global tourism map. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005824"></A>
I think it is fair to acknowledge, as the member did, that these flights are coming because we have an investment incentives scheme. We indicated that we would keep that scheme. We said it delivers jobs for Queenslanders, and that is exactly what it is doing. It is one of the schemes that those opposite would have cut under their election promises. But the success of these flights is also an example of what can be achieved when you have a government that is united and singing from the same song sheet. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005825"></A>
What would our Chinese visitors make of the Queensland opposition? We have had 63 days now since the vacancy on the front bench that is unfilled, and we are getting tantalised by the Leader of the Opposition about how he will fix this. We know that the member for Gregory said, ‘I’m not going to lay down for anyone.’ So he is not going. The member for Warrego vowed to hold his portfolio and said he would not leave without a fight. So he is not going. The member for Toowoomba South said, ‘I’m safe in a revamp. He’s not referring to me.’ So he is not out. We also know that Ted Malone said that he is not the MP seeking a reduction in responsibilities ahead of the election. So if it is not the member for Gregory and it is not the member for Toowoomba South and it is not the member for Warrego, who will be making way for the new blood? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Public Works. I refer to the ongoing and bamboozling mystery of where Labor intends to find a spare $210 million to fix its failed Health payroll system. In an answer in September last year, when he was asked about the cost of fixing the payroll system the minister said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1005865"></A>
We are not talking about a change in the amount of money, because it has been made very clear to me that there is no extra money.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1005866"></A>
Who made it clear to the minister that there was no extra money, and will the minister tell the House how it is that now a lazy $210 million has suddenly been found? </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005868"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I interjected on him earlier about his being here longer than me and being sillier than me, and that question just gives evidence of that. He has been here as long as I have, but he is certainly sillier. He is locked into September 2009. I really think he is locked into December 1989, because he has not changed since he came to this place. That question is evidence of that. Clearly, what he is proposing is that they would not spend any money to fix this system. Let us get that out on the agenda in Queensland. You would not commit to fixing this if you were in government. You would leave it like it is. Nothing could be more stark. </Hansard-Body>

It gave me food for thought when I heard the member for Dalrymple the other day talking about the happy clappers running the show over there.

That is their policy: ‘Pray to the Lord and let us bring something down that is a miracle.’ All of the propositions that they are making--do not borrow anything, do not increase taxes--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr PITT:</Hansard-Member-Up>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005891"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. As he knows, this year the Premier’s annual Christmas concerts will include a seniors concert in Cairns. I am very pleased that I will be visiting both Cairns and Toowoomba. These concerts are a way for the government to spread a little bit of cheer, particularly to some of our most elderly residents. Entry is free. However, places are limited and bookings are essential. I do encourage local people to RSVP as early as possible to secure their place, and I do encourage local members to let their local nursing homes and senior citizens groups know. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005892"></A>
Christmas is a time of year when most families around Queensland get together and strengthen the bonds that bind them. It is a time of goodwill and good cheer. But long before 25 December this year there will be another red-letter day on the calendar. It is of course the red-letter day of 6 December. Mark 6 December in your diaries. It is the day of the first public meeting of the Liberal Club in Brisbane. That is the day on which we will find out whether there are any Liberals left in Queensland. Are there any Liberals left--the true Liberal Club? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005893"></A>
Who might these Liberals be? Might they include the member for Surfers Paradise, who had this to say about his own electorate when elected in 2004--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1005895"></A>
This has always been a Liberal seat--it’s not the country anymore. And it used to drive us mad having to vote National when we were all Liberals. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005896"></A>
Now he is all National! It used to drive him mad in 2004. Have his views changed since that time? Earlier this year in February he told the House, ‘I am proud of my Liberal heritage.’ Will he be proud enough of his Liberal heritage to attend the inaugural meeting of the Liberal Club, or will he be worried that Bruce, the bovver boy, will be at the door threatening the preselections, turfing them out? Bruce the bouncer will be there saying, ‘You’re not--out.’ You know you are a National, we know you are a National and everybody else knows you are a National. </Hansard-Body>

Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Premier. I refer to the Premier’s announcement today that Queensland Motorways Ltd will be transferred to the Queensland Investment Corporation, an announcement that failed to put a price on the value of the deal. Will the Premier tell the House the value of the transaction and, given QML carries $2.9 billion in debt, what will be the net return to the government accounts? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008656"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. He clearly was not listening to the Treasurer’s ministerial statement in which the Treasurer outlined clearly that we will now embark on a commercial negotiation with QIC overseen by a probity auditor. That will be a fully commercial negotiation, as required by the legislation under which the Queensland Investment Corporation was established. It will be based on the current market value and it will be conducted fully at arm’s length. The current market value of the asset is around $3 billion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008658"></A>
We will advise the public and the opposition subsequent to the outcome of those discussions. If those negotiations had already occurred and we were able to give you anything more detailed, the opposition would accuse us of having secret discussions. We have been as open and public as we can about this and we will continue to do so.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008659"></A>
I am very pleased that the member for Clayfield has asked me a question, because what did the member for Clayfield have to say about the Liberal Party? He told the House earlier this year--just this year, mind you--‘I look forward to contributing to meeting that challenge by applying the values and principles of the Liberal Party.’ So he stood in this House as a member of the LNP and said that he would be using the values and principles of the Liberal Party. </Hansard-Body>

It will be a much photographed event, I suspect. We will be looking to see it in the social papers. What we have seen is that there are no Liberals left in Queensland because they have become completely subservient to the National Party. We have seen it all year in how they have voted. </Hansard-Body>

 My question without notice is to the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health. Can the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health update the House on progress developing health networks?</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1008674"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 An important part of our negotiations with the Commonwealth government in relation to the visionary Gillard health reforms is the formation of the local health networks. By 1 July 2011, subject to federal legislation getting through a recalcitrant parliament, hospitals across Queensland will be run by regional hospital boards and local executives. We are finalising consultation on the size, shape and geography of LHNs, with broad consultation with interested stakeholders and the broader public. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008677"></A>
We have had face-to-face and video conference consultations with over 2,800 people across 64 sessions, from the cape to Coolangatta, with over 150 sites visited. The feedback shows there is a level of interest in the reforms including support for networks based on our regional centres, with smaller hospitals linked to larger regional hospitals; support for the government’s recent decision to split Wide Bay-Bundaberg from the Sunshine Coast, recognising the growth in both areas; support for splitting the Darling Downs and West Moreton district in two, with one based in Toowoomba and one based in Ipswich; and across regional Queensland, local communities like Banana and Taroom, Gatton, Lockyer and Laidley, Miriam Vale and Collinsville have taken the opportunity to have their say about which network their community will be a part of.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008678"></A>
On the subject of networks and governance, we have the situation where earlier this year the Leader of the Opposition promised to have a reshuffle, and later this year he again promised to have a reshuffle. We have now had 63 days go by without an appointment of a shadow minister for infrastructure. We are spending $7 billion on infrastructure in Health but, clearly, those opposite do not think anything should be spent on infrastructure because they are not actually doing anything there. It is part of the continued ‘Balkanisation’ of the LNP. It is a very unhappy organisation and it is rotting from the head down, like a fish does. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008679"></A>
We heard comments the other day from the member for Dalrymple about the organisation that he is forming. We have always observed religious freedom and tolerance in this parliament. I do not care what people’s religious observations are on their own basis, but the member for Dalrymple said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1008680"></A>
... within the party structure too we have what they call, they call us the happy clappers, and we are a very, very powerful lobby group. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008681"></A>
The Labor Party learned in 1955 what happens when you have religiously based lobby groups active within a party under a weak leader, such as Dr Evatt. We now see what is happening with the so-called Liberal Club, again under a weak leader like the Leader of the Opposition. One thing is common. We learned in the Labor Party in 1955 what happens when you allow single-interest religious groups of their own to lobby within a party. I am not talking about having their own views, because they are entitled to that. We now know it is not just that group with fundamentalist lobby group factions but also the Liberal Club. What we know now is that we are not having a reshuffle because the Leader of the Opposition has no clout at all.</Hansard-Body>

Queensland Driver’s Licence</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008687"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Transport. I refer the minister to the $120 million new Queensland driver’s licence that has been hit by delays, cost blow-outs and design faults. Will the minister be upfront and honest with the Queensland public about any further technical issues that will delay this project or further blow its budget?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008689"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This government has been entirely transparent about this process and this product. Earlier this year I launched the new Queensland driver’s licence. Rather than just announce the price it would be when it arrived, this government took I think quite substantial steps in terms of transparency by publicly releasing a five-year price path for the new Queensland driver’s licence so that Queenslanders would know not just what the price will be in 2011 but also what the price would be in each of the next five years. That is a level of transparency far greater than the LNP in government ever displayed and it is far greater than is normal standard commercial practice.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008690"></A>
Further, the government has revealed all of the costs involved in this project in the budget papers. Most recently, when issues were raised through the staff trial of the licence, this government provided those issues formally to the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 so that the people of Queensland would be fully informed. Those staff trial issues were relatively minor. As we advised the state-wide newspaper, there were some issues with the plastic coating on the licence, and some people involved in the trial, of whom I was one, preferred a Qwerty keyboard to insert their passport into as opposed to the alphabetically ordered keyboard that was first produced. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008692"></A>
So what did we do? We ran a staff trial--we said that we were running a staff trial--and some minor changes happened as a result of that staff trial. So everybody knew what was going on. We emailed the staff and let them know and we told the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
. I think it is fair to say that that is a pretty widely open process. I think that is about as transparent as you can get. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008693"></A>
I also think the new Queensland driver’s licence will be a far better, far more secure licensing product for the benefit of all Queenslanders. Our driver’s licence, as we all know, is the primary form of identification that most Queenslanders use every day. There is no doubt that, in a sane world, an old laminated licence is not an appropriate form of ID for 2010 and the years ahead. What has this government done? We have developed a new, secure licence which will give Queenslanders the best protection against identity theft of residents of any jurisdiction in this country. We have taken substantial steps to modernise the licence and to protect Queenslanders from identity theft. I think we have been very open about the process we have gone through. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008694"></A>
Despite all that openness, where does our opposition stand? After years of this, this opposition cannot tell us what it would have done. It cannot tell us what this licence would cost under the LNP. It cannot tell us whether it agrees with the rollout of this process. That is typical of the quality of this opposition. The government has improved the quality of this licence, been open about it and announced a five-year price path. All this opposition and all this shadow minister can do is mindlessly moan. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010653"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Murrumba for the question. He, like all other members of this government, has stood steadfast in support of our reformist program this year. It is a program which has delivered a reduction in the deficit. We have lowered our debt forecast. We have returned billions of dollars to Queensland taxpayers through the transactions we have conducted. We have ushered in a whole new industry, the LNG industry, this year which will provide a generation of employment for the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010654"></A>
Today this government continues with its reformist program to secure value and jobs in our generation sector. Secondly, we are taking steps to strengthen the state’s superannuation scheme to ensure that it remains fully funded into the future for the long-term benefit of generations of Queenslanders to come. That is what we have been doing this year in the great tradition of reformist Labor governments. We have been stepping up to the mark, taking the tough decisions, taking on the challenges and governing for the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010655"></A>
It stands in stark contrast to what has occurred opposite. While we have been getting on with the job those opposite have only been talking about cutting jobs. We know that the Leader of the Opposition is under extraordinary pressure from both within and out with the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, old ‘Can Do’, wanting to shape up to come down to George Street. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010657"></A>
What we have seen is that the Leader of the Opposition is clearly going for product differentiation. He has decided to adopt the ‘Can’t Do’ attitude. While ‘Can Do’ is out there jumping up and down what do we see from the Leader of the Opposition? We have seen a whole lot of can’t do. He can’t do a reshuffle. He can’t do the appointment for an infrastructure shadow minister. He can’t do the policy work to put forward a plan. He can’t even answer a question that he has had 12 months notice of. He can’t even say now what he would do with the remaining QR National share. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010658"></A>
It is no wonder that the <Hansard-Italic>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1010660"></A>
... the LNP opposition under Gold Coast dentist John-Paul Langbroek has been practically antediluvian. His lament after the successful $4.6 billion float of coal hauler QR National--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1010664"></A>
the successful $4.6 billion float of coal hauler QR National ... suggests he is out of his depth. Such nonsense suits economically luddite unions, the Greens and the agrarian socialists of the National Party. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

What a dreadful stain on these people that the once proud Liberal Party is now just an insurgency and a fraction of what it was. What people have seen from this government all year is a government stepping up to the mark, governing for the future, delivering jobs not cuts, just like we said we would. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MALONE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Emergency Services. I refer to the fact that the Labor government has spent an entire decade considering whether fire vehicles should be fitted with GPS satellite navigation systems to help them urgently locate and attend emergency situations where people’s lives are at risk. Minister, when will systems be finally fitted to fire vehicles? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010674"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The issue of GPSs has been addressed with the Queensland Ambulance Service, as the member is aware, throughout last year. This year GPS units are being rolled out in ambulance vehicles. That was a good project, as the member is aware. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010675"></A>
The issue of locating and dispatching fire service vehicles is a different issue. Certainly over time I would expect that GPS devices will be fitted to Queensland Fire and Rescue vehicles. It is not its major priority at the moment. In fact, I spoke about this with representatives of the union recently. They have confirmed to my office that the installation of GPS devices is not the major priority. The major priority, as I have indicated to them, is to expand the nature of the network in terms of modern fire appliances and also expand the services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010676"></A>
The other thing which has been happening recently, as the member is aware--and he has criticised it on so many occasions--is that we have upgraded the emergency service computer-aided dispatch system, a $15 million system. In the South-East region we have added in the capacity of that system through automatic vehicle location technology to identify the closest vehicle to the incident to be dispatched. GPS is certainly an issue on the agenda. We have been working across all the emergency services agencies to identify in the medium to longer term a more comprehensive technology response to upgrade the existing system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010679"></A>
In terms of the member for Mirani, I want to take this opportunity to wish him well in the reshuffle which we understand might be occurring as early as tomorrow. The member for Mirani has been the shadow minister for emergency services for decades. I think he was the shadow emergency services minister when Minister Robertson was the minister. It is a little bit sad that the biggest impact that he has had on emergency services is when he reversed his vehicle into a parked ambulance in a driveway up in his electorate. I do wish him well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010680"></A>
This government has invested heavily in emergency services. The Ambulance Service is performing exceptionally well. We have invested heavily in the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service in terms of upgrades to technology, upgrades to vehicles, the provision of new stations, increased numbers of firefighters et cetera. We will continue to do that not just within the urban crews but also within the auxiliary services that receive significant support and for the Rural Fire Service volunteers who do a magnificent job right across the state. </Hansard-Body>

What we saw was the LNP coming over to this side of the House and supporting the government in its efforts to grow this industry. How that must have rankled certain members of the LNP like our good farmers’ friend the member for Condamine who has been out in his electorate campaigning as the farmers’ friend saying that he will do everything to stop this industry.

 I have not referred to the bill or the contents of that whatsoever. What I have done is referred to yesterday’s debate in this place, and what we see is yet another split emerge in the LNP. We have the happy clappers on their crusade, and like every crusade it is going to end in tears. Nevertheless, what we are seeing here is the emergence of the old One Nation rump of the National Party using religion as the lever to further its aims. All that will do is split the Libs from the LNP further and further. At that 6 December meeting what we will see is the Liberal club re-emerging and revisiting those things that have been sold off along the way, like the Liberal’s support for the banning of tree clearing and like the Liberal Party’s support for wild rivers legislation, of which Dr Flegg was such a passionate contributor.</Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Minister for Health. Minister, the emergency services minister has just admitted that fire vehicles are not equipped with GPS satellite navigation systems. Will the minister explain why such vehicles are not equipped with GPS systems yet his chauffeur-driven ministerial limousine was discarded by the minister because the GPS system had not been installed?</Hansard-Body>

 I thank the honourable member for his question. I am delighted that in a $9.99 billion Health budget with 78,000 staff, with 50,000 occasions of patient service every day, with a comprehensive health service spread across the largest decentralised area in the world and with a building program that goes from the far tip of the state to the bottom and then west he sees this as the big issue of the day to ask about. That really speaks volumes about what he sees as the important issues--what he sees as the important issues not just from Health but from the--</Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is what he sees not just from the Health point of view but also from the Emergency Services point of view. Is it any wonder that those opposite are disintegrating as a party, and his leader is no different in the ‘Balkanisation’ of the party: the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his Black Hand 2IC who is ready to fire the shot that will start off the most pointless exchange or conflict that man has ever seen--the First World War equivalent in the LNP.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012798"></A>
We know this about the LNP: it stands for nothing. When one stands for nothing, one has nothing internally to unite them. We know that this government--for example, the successful QR float--is about a leadership team that is united. When the Premier speaks in relation to these issues, she has both the Treasurer and myself absolutely behind her, and that has been acknowledged.</Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 When one wants to compare this parliamentary Labor Party to what exists, for example, in New South Wales or indeed the LNP opposite, I have been in politics for a long time and I have seen the unity that is so strong within this party. This vote went through the parliament with all members supporting it very strongly and we have now seen the benefits of it. As I said the other day, when I came to work I saw the hospitals getting built bigger and bigger and the coal trains are running through my electorate to the port as I speak.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012803"></A>
In relation to the particular issue raised by the honourable member, I simply say that when a car is ordered with something one expects those who supply it to deliver it. I do note that the Leader of the Opposition, as far as I am aware, has a GPS system in his car as well. Clearly he thought that was important. It is not for me to make the call in relation to emergency services issues. The minister indicated that he would see them rolled out in due course.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Redcliffe for the question. I am sure she is enjoying the new Ted Smout Bridge that we opened this year. We are about doing everything we can to keep motorists on the move. We are about to launch a new trial on some of our busiest roads in South-East Queensland. It is a concept that we hope will create the first congestion resilient roads in Queensland. It has been used successfully in the US, Japan, the UK and parts of Europe and it won an international award for reducing accidents by 70 per cent. I am talking about motorways that allow traffic to flow around accidents so that people can get to where they need to go to more quickly. In other words, if you are heading for an LNP leadership reshuffle any time, it will not take you 12 months to get there, and that is exactly what has happened on the other side--12 months! One only has to look at the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 from 16 November last year where it says ‘Fundamental differences are unsettling the LNP’. What do we find today in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 12 months later? ‘LNP split by disharmony’. The more things change the more they stay the same on the other side.</Hansard-Body>

Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 A tory is a tory. I take the interjection from the Treasurer; a tory is a tory. But if you are using our roads, we are going to make the job a lot quicker to get there and dispatch the leader. With our new trial, all drivers need to do is obey the overhead signs and lights. They may tell drivers to slash their speed, move out of a closed lane or pull back from entering an already crowded motorway. This way cars will flow better around pinch points on the motorway, and there are a few pinch points over there! We saw the old stager from Mirani get up and ask his valedictory question today. Yesterday we saw the member for Burdekin get up with her last question--a few pinch points over there!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012823"></A>
Eventually we could have 250 kilometres of new congestion resilient motorways, and wouldn’t those opposite mind reducing congestion over there on that front bench? That is what they have done for the last couple of months--they have reduced that congestion on the front bench but they have not built anyone new to replace it. That is very troubling. It is about waving goodbye to stop-start congestion, and that is what we are about--waving goodbye to stop-start congestion on our roads unlike the opposition, which has said hello to congestion, hello to those stops in the roadway and goodbye to those members of the front bench.</Hansard-Body>

On the subject of the LNP position on various issues, we have had it explained to us today. We do not know where they stand.

The other night in the debate on the amendments to the Liquor Act the member for Mermaid Beach, in response to my interjection ‘What’s your plan?’, said--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MULHERIN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I know that she is an avid animal lover, with a much loved corgi called Ellie Rose, and she is very supportive of animal welfare programs. As the festive season approaches, we are reminding pet owners of their responsibilities over the holiday period. A cat or a dog for a Christmas present might seem like a great idea, but the giver should also think about whether the receiver really wants to own a pet. Pets are for life, not for Christmas. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015135"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MULHERIN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the honourable member for Callide. There are many people out in the community who are concerned about animal welfare. We want to remind pet owners and people who are considering giving animals as gifts for Christmas of the responsibilities of pet ownership, because a gift of an animal is a gift for the life of that animal. You can always tell how people are: if they are nasty, they are probably not pet owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015136"></A>
As temperatures soar, we want to remind people to make sure that their pets have enough water, food and shelter available. With the approaching summer storms, we want to remind people that pets also get jittery as the storm approaches and to take extra precautions. We see a lot of unwanted pets and they end up being treated poorly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015137"></A>
It is a bit like the members opposite. There has been a lot of discussion about a shadow cabinet reshuffle all year. It is nearly Christmas. Who will be abandoned over Christmas? Who will be neglected? Who will be much unloved? Will it be my old adversary over there the member for Condamine, who has been on a crusade to have a moratorium and he got done over by his own mob? Will it be the member for Mirani? Will he be the neglected one? Or is it the member for Burdekin who is much unloved? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015138"></A>
As I said, the summer storm season is coming. No doubt, the Leader of the Opposition has been trying to weather the last few days of parliament to save his leadership. Much like pets, the members opposite are getting spooked in the lead-up to the political storm that is coming and they are trying to ride it out. No doubt, the opposition leader is also developing an emergency response to the political storm. He wants to save his leadership. I want to remind members and the community about the need, when you are giving pets as presents for Christmas, to think about the consequences. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms STRUTHERS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. It is Labor governments that have put housing and homelessness at the top of the agenda. It is this government, the Bligh government, and previous Labor governments in Queensland that have given consideration to those who are less fortunate, to those who have trouble meeting their housing costs, to those who are sleeping rough. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015145"></A>
When I look back on this year, one of the highlights for me is my attendance at the Magic Moonlight Ball at the convention centre. Who was at the Magic Moonlight Ball at the convention centre? Who were dressed up in their suits? Who had their glamorous outfits on? It was homeless people--700 or so homeless people and their support workers. How did that Magic Moonlight Ball come about? Because of a service funded by this government and funded by previous Labor governments. Micah services has had the decency, the compassion and the humanity to host this event year in, year out for the past 10 years. It is this government that has given the most support to homeless people of any other government in this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015148"></A>
If that crowd opposite us got into government, what would they do for homeless people? They want these people out of sight. That has been their practice in the past. They have scanned the state and they have looked around. When we have had tory governments in this state, what have they done? They have moved people on. Where have they moved them on to? Have they moved them on to a home? Have they given them shelter? What have they done? They have usually brought in the police and they have usually brought in the sniffer dogs. That is what they do to people who are sleeping rough in this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015149"></A>
Let us go back to the Magic Moonlight Ball that I attended a couple of months ago with 700 homeless people and their support workers. What did one of those fellows in his shiny suit tell me? I had a bit of a dance with him and he was having a chat to me. What did he say to me? He said to me, ‘Minister, you know what? This government actually cares about us. This government cares. I have been sleeping around the Riverside Centre for years and if it was not for Micah services and the support you give to Micah services, I would probably not be alive.’ All the time we were dancing away, having a little bit of a jive while we were talking. And guess what he said? He said that he now has a unit in Bardon. Isn’t that great news? I look back on this year and see that one of the great achievements of the Bligh government is our support for homeless people--our support for people in housing stress. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>

The Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010 seeks to amend various acts administered within the Mines and Energy portfolio to achieve three outcomes for Queensland: improved energy efficiency for gas appliances, enhanced safety and health measures for Queensland’s resource industry, and to provide a statutory authority for the collection of key royalty revenue estimates information. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021426"></A>
In 2004 the Ministerial Council on Energy released the ‘Switch on Gas’ strategy, detailing a 10-year pathway to improve the energy performance of gas appliances and equipment. Gas water heaters and space heaters were identified as products for which energy efficiency regulation was planned to occur during 2008 to 2011. Through the successful National Framework for Energy Efficiency, governments have been working with the gas industry to revise energy labelling and introduce mandatory minimum energy performance standards for gas appliances.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021427"></A>
From commencement, anticipated to be early next year, all domestic gas water heaters manufactured in or imported into Australia will be required to operate within a maximum gas consumption of 22,831 megajoules per year, when tested to Australian Standard 4552. This is equivalent to four stars on the current Australian Gas Association star rating scheme. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021428"></A>
On 1 January 2010 a ban was introduced in Queensland prohibiting the installation of electric storage hot-water systems as replacements in those areas where residents have access to reticulated gas supply. It is anticipated that this ban will lead to increased use of gas water heaters in Queensland, with approximately 430,000 gas water heater installations estimated by 2020. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021429"></A>
The introduction of energy performance standards for domestic gas water heaters is projected to decrease Queensland’s associated gas consumption by 1.01 petajoules and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 67 kilotonnes over the next 10 years. This initiative is the first of its kind for gas appliances and equipment in Australia and is expected to be followed with a regulatory proposal for minimum energy performance standards for other gas appliances, such as space heaters.</Hansard-Body>

On the day that we mourn the loss of those 29 miners at the Pike River mine in New Zealand it is important that we restate that safety and health in the state’s mining industry is a key priority for this government. Currently, the Coal Mining Safety and Health Act 1999 and the Mining and Quarrying Safety and Health Act 1999 place obligations on designers, manufacturers, importers and suppliers of plant equipment used at mine sites. These obligations ensure that the plant is designed, constructed, tested and examined to ensure that, if used properly, the safety risk is minimised for anyone using the machinery. Amendments in the bill seek to improve safety in the mining industry by extending these same obligations to the designers and constructors of earthworks such as tailings dams and berms. Under both of these mining safety and health acts, all mine operators are required to have a safety and health management system. The system includes systematic procedures, practices and policies to ensure the safety and health of persons who may be affected by the mining operations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021431"></A>
Instances have arisen where contractors working on mine sites have used their own safety and health management system, either on its own or in conjunction with the mine’s safety and health management system. This can cause confusion and uncertainty for workers by creating inconsistent safety procedures. Industry stakeholders have suggested, and a coroner has recommended, that amendments be made to the mining safety and health acts to make it clear that only one safety and health management system is to apply at each mine site. Consultation with industry stakeholders has demonstrated strong support for the amendments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021432"></A>
Amendments to the Mineral Resources Act 1989 and the Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004 included in the bill seek to formalise a previous longstanding practice of collecting future royalty revenue estimates from major producers. Historically this information was provided by producers voluntarily. Establishing a legislative requirement for holders of mining and petroleum production tenures to provide the government with future royalty revenue estimates will provide industry the assurance that data supplied will be protected by confidentially provisions of those acts.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021433"></A>
A large number of minor amendments are also proposed to the Mineral Resources Act 1989, the Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004, the Gladstone Power Station Act 1993, the Clean Energy Act 2008, the Geothermal Energy Act 2010, the Explosives Act 1999 and the Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 1999 for particular purposes. The bill delivers many positive benefits for the people of Queensland. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Mirani--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(11.37 am): It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on the Water and Other Legislation Bill 2010. This is another typical piece of legislation from a long-term dysfunctional Labor government. I commend the shadow minister on his speech raising the issues that the LNP see before us in terms of addressing this piece of legislation. There are many issues raised in this legislation in relation to coal seam gas, water pricing and wild rivers. As most members would be aware, the Queensland government is desperate for funds. The coal seam gas industry is on the cusp of huge expansion right across Queensland. It is a get out of jail poker card for the Queensland Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021441"></A>
The Queensland government is $85 billion in debt, with an $80 million a day interest charge, and from its perspective the coal seam gas industry and the huge investment that it is bringing to Queensland is part and parcel of trying to pay back some of that debt. The Queensland government is so desperate for mining royalties that I believe that it has rushed into the coal gas industry without putting in place the safeguards that are necessary. Quite frankly, this coal seam gas industry is quite new to the world and there has to be very strong safeguards for the protection of our environment and our farmlands. These farmlands can grow food for the next 2,000 years. Nothing should be done that will in any way mitigate the possibility of those farmlands continuing to produce food over a long period of time and be destroyed in one generation. I support any measures that can be put in place to stop that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021479"></A>
In terms of the shadow minister’s amendments, we will not agree to the Water Commission, which has so failed Queensland in terms of water infrastructure, to be the mediator over the gas wells. The Queensland Labor government has been very hypocritical in how it has treated farmers in relation to the Barrier Reef safeguards that have been put in place, while allowing mining companies to do whatever they like. They can go onto pristine farms and drill almost wherever they want with very little in the way of safeguards. From my perspective, at least this legislation is a step in the right direction and, hopefully with Labor’s acceptance of the shadow minister’s amendment, it will put in place some very strong safeguards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021480"></A>
At the bottom end of my electorate huge development is taking place on Curtis Island, from where gas lines radiate out to cover almost half of Queensland. As those gas fields develop, they will have more and more impact on the environment. Frankly, the development of this industry has created such a feeling of mistrust among farmers that they are almost in revolt. That is not a good environment for an industry to develop in. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021481"></A>
The LNP supports having an independent commission address the issues of LNG gas and overlook the concerns that a lot of people in regional areas have about the development of the gas industry. Most importantly, we have to satisfy people that money will flow back into the areas that are impacted on, for example, by large trucks travelling on and heavy equipment being transported over roads that were never developed for that use. In my area, bitumen roads are breaking up and have gone back virtually to how they were 100 years ago. It will cost a huge amount of money to put those roads back into some sort of order. There have to be guarantees that money will flow back into the regions through the councils, et cetera, so that they can achieve some real development and repair any damage done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021482"></A>
In terms of the south-east corner’s water supply and the pricing of it, the development of infrastructure has been totally irresponsible. Huge amounts of money--I believe it is in the vicinity of $9 billion--was expended to upgrade and put in place interconnecting pipelines, et cetera, across the south-east corner of Queensland. One of the issues, which has been highlighted here of course, is that the development of those pipelines was done with such urgency and in such a short time that a lot of the companies were invited to build the pipelines and charge at a later time. The term ‘invoice tendering’ comes to mind in respect of that matter. Before I came into this place I was a contractor, so I understand how easily that works. It is quite a good way of getting something done quickly. However, under those circumstances you can expect to pay twice or three times what you would normally. Earlier in the debate I heard the comment that wheelbarrows were being charged at about the same rate as a Mack truck. That really happens. The project was totally mismanaged and overpriced. As I have said, it was desperation infrastructure building. Now that we have had a return to a normal weather cycle, most of that infrastructure is irrelevant. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021483"></A>
I first came into the parliament in 1994. By that time the Goss government had consigned the Wolffdene Dam to the annals of time. Had the Wolffdene Dam been built, we would have had sufficient water for the next 20 to 35 years. At that time I sat on this side of the House and I can recollect my good friend Henry Palaszczuk suggesting that the National Party was a dinosaur because we wanted to build more dams. For five or six years--for almost 10 years--we sat here and listened to that sort of criticism. Suddenly, we had a drought cycle, as so regularly happens in Queensland, and we had to spend $9 billion to build infrastructure that, as I said, is almost irrelevant because we have gone back to a traditional weather system. It is short-sighted policy. Any farmer knows that you have to build up and maintain a property, and you also have to expand your watering points and those sorts of things. That is not greatly different to building infrastructure to cater for a state’s increasing population. We did not build the infrastructure and we got caught. The blame for that lies totally with the short-sighted policy of the Labor Party. Now we have a water supply management system that is totally at the behest of a number of entities. Individual salaries are huge, being in the vicinity of hundreds of thousands of dollars, and there are more than 100 bureaucrats running the system. In the south-east corner, water consumers are being led to the altar of high bureaucracy to be slaughtered in the cause of supplying water to their households. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021485"></A>
The other issue in the legislation before the House is wild rivers. The concept of wild rivers brings tears of joy to the eyes of the leftish, greenish, pinkish movement within the Labor Party. They envisage pure white water and lush backgrounds of pristine vegetation, with fish and animals living at peace in an idyllic environment. As many are aware--except those I have mentioned--the reality is that in Australia, and certainly Queensland, there are natural cycles of flooding rains and deep droughts. Most of the rivers in Queensland run dry throughout the course of a year. The grass and vegetation dies back, animals die because of lack of water, and pigs, dingoes, wild dogs and pests invade those so-called pristine areas. Of course, without natural fires occurring as they have done since time began, the landscape reverts to a jungle of pests and weeds, such as lantana and rubber vine, which basically destroy the country. </Hansard-Body>

 Mate, I have been there and I have seen it all. Some people on the other side of the House would not have a clue. Most people with a background in the environment understand what I am talking about. In our communities there is an epidemic of wild pigs and wild dogs, but the government is making no effort to control them. If and when--and I think it is only a matter of when--foot and mouth disease enters this country, it will destroy the grazing industry unless there is some control over the wild pig population. This government has displayed absolute hypocrisy. It is a government that cannot be believed. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr ROBINSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cleveland--LNP) (11.47 am): I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the government’s Water and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 on behalf of the people of the Cleveland electorate. I note that the objective of the government’s bill is to amend various pieces of legislation. It is to amend the Energy Ombudsman Act 2006, to amend the South-East Queensland Water (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) Act 2009, to make additional amendments to the D-R Act and Water Act 2000, to amend the Land Valuation Act 2010, to amend the Queensland Competition Authority Act 1997, to update and enhance the existing processes under part 5A of the QCA Act, to amend the Queensland Institute of Medical Research Act 1945, to introduce regulatory frameworks to improve the management of impacts arising from the extraction of underground water from petroleum activities, including coal seam gas activities, to amend the Water Supply (Safety and Reliability) Act 2008 and to amend the Wild Rivers Act 2005. I note that the bill addresses a number of important issues, of which three particularly stand out: groundwater issues concerned with the coal seam gas industry, the water distributor-retailers entities in South-East Queensland and the wild rivers legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021526"></A>
I wish to commend the shadow minister for natural resources, mines and energy, Jeff Seeney, for his most useful contribution to the debate and particularly for his efforts to expose the government for its many failures with respect to water management and the wild rivers legislation. My contribution attempts to build on the contribution of the shadow minister and other opposition members, with a focus on the two issues of South-East Queensland water management and, to a lesser extent, wild rivers legislation. For a greater treatise of all aspects of the legislation I commend the shadow minister’s speech. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021530"></A>
With regard to South-East Queensland water management, the majority of residents of Cleveland and the broader Redlands continue to be angry about the way this government mismanages water in South-East Queensland and particularly that it is at the expense of ratepayers. The people of Cleveland and the broader Redlands do not accept that they should pay, through their water rates, for the $9 billion water grid--a dysfunctional desalination plant, the Traveston Dam farce, pipelines going to nowhere and fat-cat bureaucrats. The residents of the Cleveland electorate are incensed by the extreme levels of waste, mismanagement and blame-shifting that continue to be the pattern of this failed Labor government. Instead of owning up to its failures and fixing the problems, this government has unsuccessfully tried to blame councils, and now through this bill the government attempts to shift the blame for water pricing to another scapegoat, the QCA. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021537"></A>
I make the following points in terms of local Redland perspectives to provide a contextualised understanding about water. First, Redland City is a water-rich area of South-East Queensland and contributes water to the South-East Queensland grid. Water supply and security have been high priorities for successive Redland councils, long before the area reached city status. The foresight of former councils and councillors ensured that the Redlands has always had sufficient water to provide for its community. Secondly, Redland residents are fiercely parochial with this resource. Thirdly, Redlanders are careful users of water, the precious commodity that it is. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021540"></A>
Fourthly, Redlanders are understandably angry at the government for taking control of Redland Water from the council and for not adequately compensating them. The state government took over the Redlands water infrastructure that was valued at approximately $130 million for approximately $80 million. Former mayor Councillor Don Seccombe represented the strong and persistent feeling among the people of Cleveland and the broader Redlands when he said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021542"></A>
All the investment this council has made over decades to secure water supply has been stripped from us. Redlands has planned ahead and paid for its water security over the years and now we are being penalised.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021543"></A>
Residents were incensed by the takeover of Redland Water by the state government. The mayor’s comments were echoed loudly by many in the community, and the unrest about the state government’s takeover continues to this day. The well-managed Redland Water has been replaced by an inferior management system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021544"></A>
Fifthly, Redlanders feel that the new structure, Allconnex, does not deliver a fair share of equity--only 10 per cent--for the Redlands community and, as a result, they will pay more for their water than they otherwise would have. It is estimated that the Redlands will be one of the regions that is hardest hit, with the bulk water price expected to double over the next seven years. I continue to condemn the government for its failed management of water in South-East Queensland, particularly Cleveland and the broader Redlands, that has caused a major increase in water prices, with further massive increases to follow. </Hansard-Body>

The second main area I wish to address is the Wild Rivers Act and the provisions in this bill that seek to amend this act with respect to the declaration of the rivers in the Lake Eyre Basin as wild rivers. The wild rivers legislation has little to do with protecting the rivers of the Lake Eyre Basin, with water quality issues of the rivers or with any other real environmental outcome and a lot to do with appearances and preference deals with the extreme left of politics in Queensland--</Hansard-Body>

 They do not like that. It is a lot to do with appearances and preference deals with the extreme left of politics in Queensland so that the inner-city latte-sipping, low-primary-vote-earning Labor MPs can be returned to the parliament at the next election. That is why wild rivers legislation exists and that is what it is really about. It has nothing to do with protecting any real environmental values and is in fact a cynical sellout of the rights of Indigenous Australians for extreme left Greens preferences. It is all about cynical political deals that trample over Indigenous rights for a political outcome. In effect, the government has transferred control of the Lake Eyre Basin from the rightful Indigenous custodians to the inner-city Greens--a very inappropriate transaction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021558"></A>
Under the pretext of improving the environment around the rivers, the government has robbed Indigenous Australians of a range of opportunities in the use of that land. To achieve this, the government has pitted Indigenous Australian against Indigenous Australian, and it has effectively used a divide-and-conquer strategy that pits elder against elder and community members against each other. Indigenous leaders such as Noel Pearson have rightly come out against the government’s wild rivers legislation. In so doing, this government violates Indigenous rights to placate their Far Left mates in seats like Ashgrove and Mount Coot-tha, because these members could not win the next election in a fair shoot-out against the LNP candidates. Is it any wonder the sustainability minister is a champion of this piece of legislation? She will not likely be returned to this House at the next election without the Far Left Greens preferences that she has been aiming for. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021568"></A>
North Stradbroke Island is part of my electorate. Unfortunately, the approach that this government has used to strip land from the Indigenous people of the Lake Eyre Basin in the wild rivers legislation is being repeated on North Stradbroke Island through the current Indigenous land use agreement process that the government is following. The government cared little about the Quandamooka people and more about getting control of the land under native title claim to lock it away in its mad rush to turn 7.5 per cent of Queensland into unmanaged national parks. Why? All for the sake of Greens preferences at the next election. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021571"></A>
Quandamooka elders, like elders in the Lake Eyre Basin, are being pitted against each other, and many of them are starting to speak out against the government and the Premier’s plan. I make this comparison as both wild rivers legislation and the North Stradbroke Island case illustrate the disgraceful way that this government treats Indigenous Queenslanders and why I do not support the way it has conducted itself via the wild rivers legislation. </Hansard-Body>

There is another article about the island headed ‘Bligh mutiny at the polls’. There was a 15 per cent swing in the booth at Dunwich, which is the booth most represented by Indigenous people of the island and miners on the island. It is very obvious why there would be a huge swing against the current Labor government. Why? For the way that it treats Indigenous people and for the way that it treats miners and workers, hardworking men. Many of the jobs that are going to be lost, or cut, are jobs for Indigenous people. That is how this government treats and rewards Indigenous people in this nation. It is a disgrace. It is disgusting. The elders and Indigenous community do not want the Premier’s will imposed on them, as is happening. </Hansard-Body>

 I am talking about Stradbroke Island. Keep up with it, Murray. I know it is hard. They do not want to be treated in the same way that the government has treated the people of the Lake Eyre Basin in the wild rivers legislation. They want a fair say in their future, a say that they are not yet receiving. The Premier appears to be pushing ahead, however, with her divide and conquer plan, just as she has done with the wild rivers legislation. In contrast to this government, the Liberal National Party is a party which supports land rights for our Indigenous communities. I call on the Quandamooka elders and community to not be bullied into submission by this arrogant Labor Premier and government. If we are fortunate, Labor will not be in government for much longer.</Hansard-Body>

In conclusion, the government has been tried and found guilty in the court of public opinion for mismanaging water in South-East Queensland. As a result, water prices are rapidly rising. Further, the government’s wild rivers amendments do not remove the injustice it imposes on the Indigenous people of the Lake Eyre Basin that robs them of opportunities to use their land. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr DOWLING </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Redlands--LNP) (12.01 pm): Today I rise to contribute to the debate on the Water and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. Before I commence, I would like to commend the students from Redland Bay State School who have joined us here this morning. They are a very attractive and intelligent group of students from my electorate. I hope they enjoy their day here. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021638"></A>
While this legislation covers a range of issues--coal seam gas, the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, wild rivers et cetera--I will limit my comments to the water issues that are most relevant to the electorate of Redlands, such as the bulk water pricing, the distribution and retail entities and the Energy Ombudsman. The amendments are an attempt, in my assessment, to address an escalating community feeling as the price for water continues to rise. We have seen a systemic failure and it is a reflection on this and previous Labor governments. Labor has raised the cost of all things without any regard for the community’s ability to pay.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021639"></A>
This amendment is just another carefully crafted piece of legislation to have someone else manage the mess. It is an attempt to teflon coat an incompetent, tired, long-term Labor government--a government that is responsible for mistake after mistake, one disaster after another. The evidence is there everywhere you look--look at electricity, local government amalgamations, water, health and the list goes on. I can still hear the line, ‘No-one will pay more for electricity,’ and wasn’t that a hollow commitment. The truth is that electricity now costs more--so much more that we now have an Energy Ombudsman to manage complaints against energy suppliers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021642"></A>
The Water and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 seeks to expand the role of the Energy Ombudsman. The legislation will amend the Energy Ombudsman Act 2006 to expand the ombudsman’s role to also manage water complaints. This will be a very busy office. Instead of fixing the issue, Labor distracts, disguises, redirects, dismisses, blames, denies--you name it, on any issue, Labor will find a spin, an angle. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021644"></A>
On the water issue, Labor true to form is playing the blame card and the redirect card. For the blame card, Labor has accused councils of gouging residents on water pricing, but residents of South-East Queensland are well aware of how they are paying for the mistakes made by Labor--not mistakes made by council, but by Labor. The price complaints are driven by bulk water prices set by Labor. The price is a reflection of the debt--debt raised by Labor, debt that needs to be serviced by water pricing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021646"></A>
For the redirect card, Labor’s answer to the pricing is to pass the buck. It will amend the Energy Ombudsman Act 2006 to expand the existing Energy Ombudsman’s role to include water and waste water disputes by small customers in South-East Queensland. Instead of fixing the problem, Labor is redirecting the problem to someone else. Complaints about water costs is a growth industry in Queensland. Labor governments have created a price point that is crippling family budgets, giving rise to a culture of complaint--a valid culture of complaint.</Hansard-Body>

The answer to any Labor problem is to handpass it to someone else, anyone, in this case the Energy Ombudsman. The Energy Ombudsman will become the scapegoat for Labor’s failure to plan, failure to manage and failure to deliver cost-effective water supply to the community. When we look at the South East Queensland Water (Restructuring) Act 2007, section 3 states the purpose of the act. It states--</Hansard-Body>

Amendments to the South-East Queensland Water (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) Act 2009 will provide additional customer protection provisions and offences. Unfortunately, those amendments do not protect the community from a greedy, incompetent, tired Labor state government. They cannot protect the community from all of Labor’s other expensive mistakes--for example, electricity costs, which are directly attributable to Labor, and local government amalgamation costs, which are directly attributable to Labor and which have continued and will continue to affect all local government areas that fell foul of amalgamation. Waste water charges will follow on from water, power, fuel, motoring costs, registration and tolls--you name it, Labor is squeezing it.</Hansard-Body>

The distributor-retailers have most of the necessary powers to deliver and manage the water process. However, they still lack the ability to accurately and equitably bill residents. Residents who live in some town house complexes or apartments rely on a guesstimate as to their actual water consumption and their subsequent bill. The reason is that there is no requirement to individually meter all properties. The Energy Ombudsman will be a busy ombudsman with the water complaints as water becomes the most expensive commodity in a family budget. There will be a necessity to meter all users, including residents of town houses and some unit dwellers.</Hansard-Body>

The bill declares that three South-East Queensland distributor-retailers will use part 5A of the Queensland Competition Authority Act to make enforceable water pricing determinations and moderate the impact of price increases on consumers, but that is too late. The consumers are already being hurt because of this government’s price path. Let me read an extract from the Allconnex Water Price Monitoring Submission 2010-11. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021668"></A>
Bulk water costs are determined by the Queensland Water Commission (QWC) which has set a ten year price path commencing 1 July 2008. A firm commitment to these prices has been provided for the first five years with prices expected to be subject to review by the QWC from 2013-14 onwards. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021669"></A>
Allconnex Water’s forecasts assume that bulk water costs will increase in line with the QWC’s published price path. The bulk water costs are forecast to increase on average 17.9% from 2010-11 to 2014-15. For the reporting year 2010-11, bulk water costs comprise approximately 68% of Allconnex Water’s operating cost budget for water services ... increasing to more than 70% by 2014-15. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021671"></A>
How is that possible under part 5A of the Queensland Competition Authority Act, which specifically indicates the need to moderate the impact of price increases on customers by implementing a price path? How is it possible when it is responsible for almost 70 per cent of the cost? How is it possible for them to adjudicate on both roles or be responsible for both areas? </Hansard-Body>

Labor is to blame for the water pricing and for the water bills that are going through the roof. Independent reports suggest that water prices are not only traumatic now but will double in the next seven years. Water bills have gone through the roof under Labor since the Premier and Treasurer took responsibility for water away from local governments. After doing nothing about water for a decade, the long-term, tired Labor government then had to build infrastructure in a mad panic, with projects experiencing budget blow-outs.</Hansard-Body>

Parts of the $9 billion water grid are not even being used. Labor’s decision to pursue the ill-fated and foolhardy Traveston Crossing Dam cost Queensland taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Then there is the desalination plant which one day I suspect will be nothing more than an expensive artificial reef. These are all failures by Labor--failures that we will pay for over the next 20 years. </Hansard-Body>

The AECgroup report for the Local Government Association of Queensland in November 2007 on assessing the drivers of recent water price increases in South-East Queensland says that there have been considerable increases in retail water bills across South-East Queensland since Queensland government water reforms were initiated, averaging between 15 and 20 per cent per annum, with Redcliffe in excess of 40 per cent per annum. The Queensland government’s bulk water price paths suggest bulk water prices of $3.36 per kilolitre in 2017-18. That is a considerable increase from the 2007-08 levels of generally well below a dollar per kilolitre. Actual increases in water bills have generally been greater than those initially forecast by the Queensland Water Commission at the time when the bulk water price was announced. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1021713"></A>
The issue facing councils is that the three distribution and retail businesses are council owned but not council controlled. QCA sets the base price path, not council. The average water bill has already jumped from $464 in 2007-08 to $769 in 2010-11, with more than double to come. </Hansard-Body>

Following an extended dry period and water levels dropping dramatically, panic set in. Then Premier Beattie decided that South-East Queensland needed a water grid to solve the problem created by him and his government’s inaction over 20 years when it comes to planning. So panic mode it is. The Bligh-Beattie government thrust water reform on Queensland residents. This panic mode has delivered a largely dormant water grid, a suspect desalination plant, a multimillion dollar Traveston Crossing Dam nonevent and a $9 billion debt, which does not include the cost of water. </Hansard-Body>

The state government took over the Redland shire water infrastructure worth well over $600 million, yet the Redlands council received only $83 million. The Beattie-Bligh government formed a water business that only Labor could. The South-East Queensland councils are shareholders in water businesses with accumulated debts of $9 billion. The Redlands had a well-run water business. It was a profitable business. It returned a dividend to the organisation which, in turn, allowed council to provide extra infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>

What does the future hold since Labor’s involvement? It involves higher prices for water absolutely guaranteed. There are eight years of price hikes to come because of Labor. Electricity costs will continue to rise. Sewerage costs will be the next major blow to the cost of living. The waste costs will also increase as those levies are introduced. </Hansard-Body>

Queensland has been a boom state over the last 30 years. This is long-term growth that state governments back in the 1970s and 1980s planned for. But the state Labor governments of the past 20 years have failed to plan for the tens of thousands of new residents travelling north to Queensland. While they were welcomed, they were not planned for. Water levels were dropping dramatically and Labor was crisis planning after 20 years in office and doing nothing. The most disastrous legacy is one that will continue to hurt Queenslanders financially for the next 20 years--the $9 billion debt. </Hansard-Body>

The Beattie-Bligh government’s water reform has so far delivered nothing but heartache and misery. The Beattie-Bligh government mangled viable water businesses and replaced them with Allconnex, Urban Utilities and Unitywater. Only Labor could trash water so completely. South-East Queensland councils are shareholders in a business which they have very little control over. Councils will continue to struggle to deliver services. Electricity costs will continue to rise. Sewerage costs will be the next major blow. </Hansard-Body>

There has been a champion in our community--a councillor by the name of Karen Williams. Councillor Williams represents Capalaba and has been fighting for a better deal for her community for years. Water and the knock-on effect of pricing is again an issue that Councillor Karen Williams is championing. There is a blog in Redlands that I will take some extracts from to highlight the depth of feeling in Redland City. I credit Councillor Williams for her work on the issue and for a large amount of the material contained on that blog. The site is called ‘The Redland water rip off’. It states--</Hansard-Body>

The State Government stated that Councils have got what they asked for. The only factor the Council of Mayors asked for was three distribution/retail entities rather that the State’s proposal of one distribution entity. This does not mean they asked for the water reform. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

REDLAND CITY HAS BEEN COMPENSATED?</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021747"></A>
There is an argument that Redland City Council was adequately compensated with $83million for its water assets. Considering that State Government clearly understood the cost of building brand new infrastructure such as desalination plants and pipe networks--it seems obvious that water infrastructure owned by Redland City in 2007, and costing $27million 40 years ago, would be worth considerably more than this in today’s dollars. My estimate is that brand new infrastructure and land to duplicate these water assets (if built in 2007) would have cost in excess of $600million. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1021749"></A>
The latest rhetoric from the State Treasurer Andrew Fraser is that the Council owned retail entities should be transparent and show their price path for water through to 2017. The problem is that for any commercial entity to forecast their prices they need to have guaranteed cost of their product. So when the State “guarantees” their price path for water through to 2017, perhaps the Council owned retail entities can do the same. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1021752"></A>
It is true that Council’s profit from water. No surprise really--they always have to offset the rates. The fact remains that Redland City Council would have offset rates by an extra $10million this year if they still controlled water. So “profits” are down, council rates are up and water bills have increased even more. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Councillor Williams has been very proactive on this issue and she is getting considerable community support and, quite rightly, through this forum--the blog--and others locally. The blog for those interested is ‘The Redland water rip off’. It is just like the Health pay system--we buy a system for $65 million yet we have to spend $210 million over three years to try to fix it. Create a water infrastructure problem and the rest of the community has to pick up that $9 billion tab. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr NICHOLLS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Clayfield--LNP) (12.19 pm): The Water and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is a fairly substantial piece of omnibus legislation that deals with a variety of substantial matters. I will deal with only a couple of them. I have had the opportunity to read the contribution to the debate made by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Callide. For anyone who needs to understand clearly how to discharge his or her duties as a parliamentarian, the member for Callide’s speech is an exemplary and salutary read. On the issue of the amendments dealing with coal seam methane, the member for Callide has cogently put forward the LNP’s thoughtful and persuasive position--of course, a position that I fully support. We in this House--</Hansard-Body>

Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I hear the member for Toowoomba North asking, ‘What about me?’ When he puts forward a cogent and compelling argument I will certainly agree with that, but I am yet to experience it. I am yet to experience it, but I do live in hope. I live in hope. Every day I come in here and hope for something from that side to be persuasive and cogent and I am always disappointed--always disappointed. But I am also generous, so I will come back and listen to the member for Toowoomba North at another time.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021787"></A>
At this stage I want to deal with the amendments in relation to the Water Act and coal seam methane or coal seam gas. We in this state generally need to move away from the practice of creating victims--a practice that is engaged in by such political harlots as Drew Hutton, a failure in the city who, like an olden-day snake-oil salesman, has gone on the road to rural and regional Queensland to spread his benighted gospel of half-truths and fatuous facts, someone who has no solution except to say, ‘Stop everything,’ and to enter into a false utopian period of bucolic atrophy and decline. No-one with the interests of landholders at heart should engage in the type of short-sighted populism that seeks to whip up fear and mistrust and no-one with the interests of all Queensland at heart would or should seek to unreasonably stop an industry that has so much promise for the state and especially for rural and regional Queensland.</Hansard-Body>

Make no mistake: handled properly, the CSG to LNG industry not only has the potential to provide direct royalties to the Queensland state budget of hundreds of millions of dollars to pay for schools, roads, police, doctors, nurses and teachers; it has the benefit of increased economic activity and employment prospects for thousands and also has the potential to contribute to the rejuvenation of rural and regional Queensland--rural and regional Queensland that until now has been so shamefully neglected by this long-term Labor government. New jobs, better education, prosperity and a sustainable future--the hallmarks of an optimistic state with its eye firmly fixed on the future but a future that has been and is jeopardised by this long-term Labor government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021793"></A>
This morning I heard the Premier talk about mining communities and the interests of mining communities. I would argue that, in fact, mining companies are all over this state. They are not just in the areas where the well heads are. They are not just in the port of Gladstone. They are not just in the electorates where the pipelines run. Mining communities are throughout this state. There are residents in my part of the world in Clayfield who fly in and fly out to the mining communities for work, and they live in my part of the world because they can get to the airport quickly. They can fly in and fly out. Brisbane is a mining town if one looks at the range of services that are provided to the resource and extractive industries. So when we talk about mining communities and we talk about the benefits of mining, we talk about all of Queensland, not just parts of it. Queensland is one state, not a federation of regions. As one state we need to benefit from the extraction and the exploitation of our resources in a sustainable way.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021795"></A>
The best way to make a clear contribution to the issues in the CSG debate--and there are issues and they are validly held--is to engage in the science and deal with the reality, not to spread fear and loathing. It is for those reasons that I support the policy put forward by John-Paul Langbroek, the Leader of the LNP, to deal with the impacts of resource development on agricultural land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021796"></A>
I welcome the contribution that will be made to all of Queensland by the proper development of the CSG to LNG industry under stringent and appropriate controls. Indeed, when one considers the billions of dollars to be invested in this industry and the jobs and the skills to be created, we need to be careful as parliamentarians--as legislators--to maintain a minimal sovereign risk profile and to offer security and certainty to all those involved, both the companies and the landholders. In that respect I welcome the commitments that have been made by QGC, Santos, Australia Pacific LNG and others to the LNG industry and acknowledge their commitment to both economic development and sustainable development of Queensland’s resources. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021800"></A>
It is indeed the case that this long-term Labor government has not assisted anyone involved in the CSG debate because of its tardiness and inability to take the necessary steps to protect landholders while charting a clear path for industry. It has been dragged to the party kicking and screaming and in many cases has followed ideas put forward by the LNP and our members who, on the ground, have to deal with the impacts on a day-to-day basis and who represent the interests of their constituents.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1021801"></A>
Moving on, I want to deal in the main now with the amendments to the acts dealing with South-East Queensland water supply and distribution, and these include changes to the Queensland Competition Authority Act and the Energy Ombudsman Act. As the minister put forward in his speech, he made the somewhat, I think, unsupported claim that they are necessary in light of dishonest and tricky campaigns that have been launched by some councils in South-East Queensland and that, through confusing water bills, some councils have deliberately set out to blame the state for water charges levied by council owned water and sewerage businesses. In fact, that is the nub of the entire matter. This is a political response to a political problem that the government has brought on itself.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021806"></A>
So far as the retail water amendments are concerned, the omnibus amendments essentially have two major purposes. Firstly, the bill intends providing the Queensland Competition Authority, the nominated regulator under the national competition policy of South-East Queensland’s three statutory water supply and distribution monopolies, with some authority to regulate these entities in addition to its current monitoring functions. So at the moment its position is one of monitoring. It just looks at it; it cannot actually set the price. It now is the case that the government wishes to give the Queensland Competition Authority the power to actually set a price.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021810"></A>
The QCA is professionally and technically competent to regulate South-East Queensland water entities. It is the case, however, that it is constrained from doing so by a number of excluding instructions from the government. So the QCA does not have a free hand. The ministers responsible--in this case the Premier and the Treasurer--issue instructions--and they are on the QCA website--about the matters that the QCA is to take into account when it determines the price. So the government sets the political constraints within which the QCA has to operate. It sets the direction in which it must head in terms of consideration of matters about setting the price. As I say, it is constrained in performing this task at the moment by excluding instructions. So, in effect, the QCA cannot do its job to protect consumers because the government chooses not to allow it to do so.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021813"></A>
The changes in this legislation make some marginal changes to the QCA’s status, but I have to say that it is extremely doubtful that the QCA will receive the unfettered direction and power that is needed to be an effective regulator in the interests of consumers, because it would then be highly likely that 20 years of Labor’s incompetence in water planning and mismanagement in the delivery of water to South-East Queensland would be exposed to public view. Secondly, the legislation pretends to increase transparency. It does this by making impositions on local government, and we know that this government has no love of local government. It has had no love of local government for a long period of time. If it did, it would not have embarked on the forced amalgamation, it would not have embarked on the forced acquisition of local authorities’ water resources and it would not have embarked upon the restructure that left local governments out of pocket and wearing the blame.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021815"></A>
Local governments will have a statutory obligation to forecast water prices 12 months prior to their imposition and to publish the wholesale cost of water on invoices that they send out to their customers. This is simply a blame-shifting provision, with the state government seeking to transfer the responsibility for the break-out in water prices to local governments. It is a political response to the reality that the public of South-East Queensland knows--that this long-term, lacklustre Labor government is wholly responsible for the massive increase in water costs. Having made a flawed decision in the first place about how to structure the South-East Queensland water distribution entities, the government now wants to avoid being seen to be responsible.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021852"></A>
We need to look at the problem with retail water. I am extremely concerned about the rising cost of retail water for consumers and small business. The water reform process, which began in earnest over two years ago, is now forcing on South-East Queensland consumers exponential increases in water prices. How is it that a family of four in my electorate of Clayfield, already struggling to keep up with the recent increases in fuel, tolls, electricity and registration charges, must now find the extra money needed to pay for basic services such as water? The cost of treated bulk water as it appears in a typical Brisbane water bill has exploded from 63c per kilolitre in 2007-08 to $1.52 in 2010-11, whereas the retail water distribution cost--that is the cost that the councils are charging--has only gone up from 56c per kilolitre to 65c per kilolitre. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021853"></A>
To give members an exact picture of what I am talking about, let me review what an annual Brisbane water bill will show. I tabled the document in a debate in the House on 10 September. For 2007-08, the state bulk water will be $157.50, the access charge $140, the tier 1 usage charge $140 for a total of $437.50. In 2010-11, the bulk water charge will be $380. That is a 141 per cent increase. The tier 1 access charge will go up by 16 per cent and the access charge will go up by 16 per cent for a total bill of $705.46. The bill goes from $437 to $705--a 61 per cent increase, most of which is attributable to the increase in the bulk water cost and that is from the bulk water entities set up by the state government under the reform process. Bulk water goes from making up just 36 per cent of the price in 2007-08 to over 54 per cent of the price in 2010-11. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Before the state government reforms, councils provided water services at much cheaper rates, and I have just detailed that. So it does not matter whether you sell a rail network, increase land tax or increase tolls: Labor cannot manage the money, it cannot manage the assets and it cannot really even manage the process of a new Health payroll system. This just demonstrates that. The real issue in regard to the price of water is that the price of water is no longer determined by the cost of producing the water; it is, in fact, determined by state government debt. That situation is not assisted by the high level of service guarantee mandated by the Queensland Water Commission--an inefficient regulatory structure with massive operational inefficiencies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021855"></A>
I turn now to debt. Under this government, the price of water in Queensland is mainly determined by the cost of servicing and repaying the overwhelming and growing toxic debt of $8.5 billion that was incurred in putting together the failed and failing water grid. This debt has been generated by the government to finance the water infrastructure because structural deficits and mismanagement has meant that the government has no resources of its own to be able to plug into the system to fix it. It had to go out and borrow money in order to build the water grid, the desalination plants and the treatment plants. Quite frankly, the magnitude of the debt held by water entities in South-East Queensland is daunting. The regulated asset base--known as the RAB--which is notionally representative of the water infrastructure assets, is estimated at $9 billion. The value of the assets is $9 billion. But, according to the Queensland Treasury Corporation’s annual report, total water entity debt amounts to $8.127 billion, in addition to SunWater debt at $226 million and the Traveston debt at some $250 million, which has been parked in the Department of Infrastructure and Planning. This means that the debt being carried by water entities exceeds $8.5 billion and that $8.5 billion debt is projected to grow over the forthcoming years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021858"></A>
In financial terms, the water infrastructure is geared in excess of 95 per cent. Taxpayers own less than five per cent of Somerset Dam, Wivenhoe Dam, North Pine Dam and all the other minor storages and infrastructure in South-East Queensland. Speculative property developers do not gear to 95 per cent. Banks do not lend to that amount. A fiscally responsible government would not incur that level of debt. But it has been done in Queensland and done under Labor. It exposes Queenslanders to an unsustainable debt position and that is why water prices are rising at the rate at which they are. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021860"></A>
The taxpayers own something less than five per cent of all the non-performing assets as well. That includes the Tugun desalination plant--which barely runs at all but which still has to be paid for; it does not generate any income--the waste water pipeline, the northern interconnector, the failed Traveston Dam project, the advanced waste water treatment plants, which are not even operational. In other words, the people of Queensland have little or no equity in their water supply infrastructure. All they have is an $8.5 billion debt that has to be paid, and that follows years of investment in water facilities by generations of Queensland’s taxpayers. It shows that that has been squandered and replaced by a toxic debt under Labor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021861"></A>
This is typical of Labor’s financial mismanagement and that mismanagement is a resort to the excessive gearing of taxpayers’ assets--borrowing too much. As an example, most taxpayers believe that the government is selling the Gateway bridges--the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges. In fact, we heard an announcement about that transfer--that dodgy deal--this morning. But the reality is that those bridges were sold years ago to the lenders. The fact is that the debt owed on that facility exceeded its asset value and tolls had to be raised prior to the sale to ensure the recovery of at least the moneys owing. That means that assets already paid for by ratepayers are being paid for again through the bulk water price path, because the debt is built into that price path. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021863"></A>
The second item that needs to be addressed in relation to the cost of water is the operational structure. The incompetence of this government in planning and building central water infrastructure is replicated in the unnecessarily complex structures set up to administer water assets and deliver water to customers. Six separate entities manage the assets and three retailers sell and deliver water to customers. Each is a monopoly in its own right and there is no competition. Millions of dollars have been spent and large tranches of debt generated in trying to give statutory water monopolies the appearance of operating in a competitive market when quite clearly they do not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021864"></A>
Ultimately, Queenslanders still have a monopolistic statutory supplier of bulk water--the Water Grid Manager--and vertically single-desk water retailers with mutually exclusive customer bases. The government’s efforts to create the false illusion of a competitive market have been costly and complex and have not delivered any benefit for consumers. The beneficiaries have been the government, because a portion of water entity debt, while attributable to the public sector, is not directly on the government’s balance sheet, and the other people who benefit are those executives--and we have heard story after story about their pay rises--who are employed to run these entities and who have recently received substantial wage increases. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021865"></A>
Taxpayers should be aware that the water retailers are purchasing bulk water from the grid manager at prices below the cost of producing the wholesale water. So the current water prices do not represent the full cost of producing water. More concerning for consumers is that this inherent subsidy is not being funded out of recurrent expenditure from consolidated revenue but is being capitalised each and every year at the rate of $407 million per year. So the interest is not being paid; it is just being rolled over and added to the debt year on year on year. That is an incredible amount that is being added to the taxpayers’ tab each and every year by this government. That means that the subsidy is deceptive, because the capitalised debt is factored into future water price increases. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021866"></A>
The other issue is about control. We talk about councils’ control of the prices. We know that councils cannot control the price that is set by these independent retail businesses and that they have to act commercially, because that was the policy of the state government. Again, I covered that issue some time ago when we had a debate in this place about water pricing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021867"></A>
So the continuing issue for South-East Queenslanders will be the rising cost of basic household needs like water and electricity. Water pricing is of great concern. This bill, despite its size, is not significant legislation. A close examination indicates that it is intended to create a false perception that the water price path can be improved over the medium term when the reality is that the amendments do not have the capacity to effect the necessary reform that would benefit the consumer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021868"></A>
In summary, there has been too little planning and too much sleazy politics. When the drought hit, the response was too expensive. The cost of the solution far outweighed the benefits and no proper cost-benefit analysis was done. There was no money in the bank to pay for the government’s solution, so $8.5 billion debt was taken on. The spaghetti-and-meatballs operational structure was more about theory than reality. So there has been confusion, no responsibility and increased costs. This bill will not solve any of those problems. It is no cure and is another political fix. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(12.39 pm): In rising to participate in the debate on the Water and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010, I would like to address the further implementation of the second stage of the South-East Queensland water reform program and the key additional customer protection provisions for residential and small business water customers. Stage 2 of the South-East Queensland water reform program, which commenced in July this year, involved the separation of the distribution and retail water and waste water functions from the 10 South-East Queensland councils and the establishment of three separate council owned distributor-retailers under the South-East Queensland Water (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) Act 2009. The three distributor-retailers are Allconnex Water, owned by Gold Coast, Logan and Redlands councils; Queensland Urban Utilities, owned by Brisbane, Ipswich, Scenic Rim, Somerset and Lockyer Valley councils; and Unitywater, owned by the Sunshine Coast and Moreton Bay councils. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025679"></A>
Under the South-East Queensland Water (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) Act, each distributor-retailer has been required to develop a customer service charter that sets out a customer’s rights and obligations; implement a hardship policy to assist customers who may have difficulties in paying accounts; and comply with the Australian standards for complaints handling. In addition to these provisions, this bill will strengthen this act to improve the information content provided to customers and ensure a high level of accountability is imposed upon the distributor-retailers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025680"></A>
The government is now implementing a strengthened package of transparency and regulatory protections for customers. Under these amendments customers will be informed about their distributor-retailer’s governance and accountability arrangements in respect of its participant councils; be notified of proposed and final water and waste water prices and charges; be better informed about the contents of their water and waste water bill including identifying when it has been based upon an estimated meter read; and have access to an independent dispute resolution process provided by the Energy and Water Ombudsman Queensland in accordance with the Customer Water and Wastewater Code. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025681"></A>
This bill amends the Energy Ombudsman Act 2006 to expand the existing Energy Ombudsman Queensland role to include water and waste water disputes for customers in South-East Queensland from 1 January 2011. The jurisdiction and powers of the Energy and Water Ombudsman Queensland are not dissimilar to the current Energy Ombudsman’s powers and that of utility ombudsmen in other states. The Energy and Water Ombudsman Queensland will be able to investigate billing issues, disputed usage, payment difficulties including debt collection, delays in connection, meter-reading and testing disputes, restricted supply, sewage spills and actions of a distributor-retailer that may impact on a customer’s property. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025682"></A>
The ombudsman cannot investigate complaints about the fixing or setting of prices or eligibility for rebates or subsidies. The customer must first seek to rectify their concerns with their distributor-retailer. If the customer remains unsatisfied and the dispute is an identified dispute, the customer may contact the Energy and Water Ombudsman Queensland for advice and investigation. The ombudsman is a free complaint resolution service. It will not charge small customers. The three retailers will contribute to the funding of this expanded scheme to address water and waste water complaints. This expanded role will provide small customers with a free and independent dispute resolution service from a dedicated utility based dispute resolution organisation. Together with the customer code, this arrangement encourages a stronger focus on customer service delivery.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025683"></A>
The government has recently requested that the Queensland Water Commission work with the distributor-retailers to implement a standard billing template that is clearly understood by customers. Part of the work will include the development of customer information, explaining the customer account to ensure residents receive straightforward and readily explained information on their water bills. Further amendments to the South-East Queensland Water (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) Act also require that customer accounts clearly identify when a meter read is estimated and that estimated meter reads cannot occur for consecutive billing cycles whilst allowing for reasonable excuses to apply. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025684"></A>
Following the amendment to the South-East Queensland Water (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) Act, all South-East Queensland distributor-retailers will now be legislatively required to publish their prices and charges on their websites. The retailers must publish notice of their proposed charges in a relevant newspaper and the details of their charges on their websites by 31 March for each financial year. By 30 June each year the distributor-retailers must also publish notice of their final charges to apply from 1 July each year in a relevant newspaper and full details of all charges on their websites. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025685"></A>
Under amendments to the South-East Queensland Water (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) Act, the distributor-retailers and their local government owners will also be required to publish their participation agreements on their websites. Members of the public will be able to view agreements between the distributor-retailers and their participating councils which set out each party’s accountabilities and their corporate governance arrangements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025686"></A>
Following the commencement of the distributor-retailers on 1 July 2010, the Queensland government has been considering options to accelerate the implementation of the strengthened package of transparency and regulatory protections for customers. The bill fast-tracks these planned measures, including the Energy and Water Ombudsman Queensland and the customer code, to give greater protection of South-East Queensland water and waste water consumers’ rights from 1 January 2011. I commend the bill to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

(12.46 pm): When this government has a crisis it creates a bureaucracy. It is this spaghetti network of water bureaucracy that is adding to bloated water bills gouging ratepayers. Half-a-million-dollar salaries for water bureaucrats, multiple water empires and a high cost of governance is adding to the pain that ratepayers are already feeling with the skyrocketing cost of living under the Bligh Labor government. The hike in water bills that my constituents and others across South-East Queensland are facing is unconscionable. The cost of the bulk assets and the blowout in the construction of the South-East Queensland water grid are the main reasons for the added costs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025689"></A>
This week Deputy Premier Paul Lucas said that, if you blow your budget, someone else pays. It was a quotable quote. For once it told the truth. This government blew its budget and taxpayers are paying the price. The government blew its budget on the bungled Health payroll system, a $60-million system that will cost more than $210 million to fix. Queenslanders are paying for this mistake. The government blew its budget on a new Queensland driver’s licence that started out at zero cost, we were told. Then it was $20 million and now it is more than $120 million. I note that the transport minister claims that she was being honest about any problems or cost issues. Given the large number of documents the government is blocking under RTI laws, her protestations of innocence are hard to swallow. Release the business cases and then we will see the truth. Release the cost blowouts that have happened since then. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025690"></A>
In relation to the water infrastructure assets, I would call for the business cases to be released as this is about value for money. The problem is that the majority of the water infrastructure that was constructed under the $9 billion water grid had no business cases. There were no business cases, except for one piece of infrastructure that I am aware of. This government did not do its due diligence in regard to ensuring value for money or ensuring there was a cost-benefit analysis that demanded that that was done in a way that did not end up costing ratepayers an outrageous amount of money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028357"></A>
I table one document that confirms that they did not do business cases in regard to these measures, even though some of these so-called water grid assets that it blew money on in the name of drought were started after the drought had broken. </Hansard-Body>

 Copy of letter, dated 28 May 2010, from Ms Karen Waldman, Executive Director, Queensland Water Commission to Ms Fiona Simpson MP, member for Maroochydore, regarding information requested at a meeting with Mr Daniel Spiller, former Acting Executive Director of the Queensland Water Commission on 1 February 2010 [<HypertextLink>

In regard to the business case issues and this government’s wanton disregard for value, I refer to Minister Robert Schwarten who recently said in the parliament that business cases were ‘pious nonsense’. That was said by a senior minister of this government. Once again, we see that there is a systemic issue with the government’s disregard of its spending of taxpayers’ money. Remember, if you blow the budget somebody pays for it. Taxpayers are paying for this government’s disregard for blowing budgets and spending money in a way that could not be sustained, while failing to demand value for money in the water assets it is building. This government blew billions of dollars on wasteful, poorly planned and rushed infrastructure. If you are running a business, you would sack the people who made those bad decisions; you would not allow them to keep making them. However, as we have seen, this government has continued with a litany of such mistakes. There was the $600 million blown on the Traveston Dam, $450 million was blown on NPI2 and $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion was blown on the western corridor recycled water pipeline, which did have a business case but cost over $700 million more than was initially estimated. The Gold Coast desalination plant blew more than $1.2 billion and the list goes on. Most of those pieces of infrastructure are either not delivering water or are failing to deliver water in a cost-effective way. Despite that, the government is still planning the Marcoola desalination plant, which should be rejected on many grounds, not least of which is the fact that there is now time to consider all other water options for the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028435"></A>
I bring to the attention of the House the fact that this government has no aviation strategy. It published one in about 2002 and then promptly ignored it. The government puts water infrastructure in locations such as airports without giving any consideration to a properly planned general aviation strategy for Queensland. This government has no critical planning in regard to infrastructure delivery and cost-effectiveness into the future. We have seen that also with the Gold Coast site. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028436"></A>
There is a lot of concern that this government continues to make mistakes in regard to how it costs, assesses and delivers infrastructure. Certainly taxpayers are paying the price. The government has one hell of a cheek to stand in this place and try to defend the costs that it has foisted upon taxpayers, when still it has no business cases for the infrastructure that it built. It blew the budgets on those projects and now asks people to pay. We continue to raise issues and concerns about the way the government is mismanaging water policy in this state, because our constituents are paying a heavy price for the way that it has mismanaged the budgets. Ultimately, our constituents pay for it through their rates. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (12.52 pm), by leave: It has long been the case in Queensland that building owners are responsible for ensuring their buildings continuously meet fire safety standards. However, it has come to my attention and the attention of the Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services that some pressure and leakage reduction programs might be having an impact on fire safety in South-East Queensland. It is possible that actions by councils or distributor-retailers to reduce water pressure may have contributed to some buildings being non-compliant with fire safety requirements. The exact extent of possible impacts is not known at this stage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028444"></A>
Since 2004 councils in South-East Queensland have been introducing pressure and leakage management programs. Such programs are part of normal good management for water service providers. Councils were implementing them long before the Water Regulation set a 60-megalitres a day savings target for South-East Queensland in August 2006. In January 2006, pressure and leakage reduction programs were in place in Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Toowoomba, Pine Rivers, Caboolture, Ipswich and Wide Bay councils. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028446"></A>
Before a target was introduced by the regulation in 2006, a memorandum of understanding, aimed at reducing distribution losses and leakage, was signed between all South-East Queensland councils and the state in April 2006. In May 2006, then Minister Henry Palaszczuk reminded the Local Government Association of Queensland that it was up to water service providers to ensure adequate fire flows. I table a copy of the text of that letter from Minister Palaszczuk. </Hansard-Body>

Planning guidelines for water supply and sewerage</Hansard-Italic>
, which contains information about how to ensure fire safety, has been in place since 2005. In 2007 those guidelines were revised to provide more detail on best-practice fire safety. That revision was undertaken in partnership with the Local Government Association of Queensland. The guidelines emphasised the importance of consultation with potentially affected building owners in ensuring fire safety.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028453"></A>
The Water Regulation did not specify how councils should achieve the 60-megalitre a day savings target, nor did it require councils to reduce system pressures to any building or area. It is important to note that reducing water leaks can be undertaken without simply reducing overall water pressure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028454"></A>
In terms of going forward, parts of the Water Regulation will be repealed. This is in light of the successful completion of the projects and our current water security position. That includes the 60-megalitres a day pressure and leakage reduction target. South-East Queensland councils, distributor-retailers and the Local Government Association of Queensland will be contacted, requesting the help of those organisations in ensuring pressure reduction programs are fire safe. I will also be asking South-East Queensland water service providers to ensure they are compliant with DERM’s long-standing planning guidelines for water supply and sewerage, as soon as possible. State agencies stand ready to assist water service providers in complying with the guideline. I encourage water service providers to work proactively with their customers, as building owners are ultimately responsible for fire safety. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr CRIPPS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Hinchinbrook--LNP) (12.56 pm): I rise to contribute to the debate on the Water and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. The bill is an omnibus bill that proposes to amend a large number of separate and distinct acts, many of which are unrelated to each other. Many of the separate and distinct amendments deal with very important issues for different areas of the state of Queensland, and I endorse the contribution of the member for Callide to this debate on those many diverse issues. Amongst the proposed amendments in this bill are amendments to the Wild Rivers Act to create a new category of wild river declaration that seeks to provide for the extension of a wild river declaration over the Lake Eyre Basin river system. I intend to confine my contribution to the debate on this bill to the proposed amendments to the Wild Rivers Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028459"></A>
My interest in the Wild Rivers Act goes right back to the very first round of declarations of wild river areas in February 2007, which included the declaration of Hinchinbrook Island, in my electorate of Hinchinbrook, as a wild river area. Hinchinbrook Island was declared a wild river area under the provisions of the Wild Rivers Act established in 2005.  In the 2005 act, the definition of a wild river was intended to apply to river systems that could be reasonably well defined. Existing wild river declared areas are made up of high-preservation areas, being areas within and immediately adjacent to the river, its major tributaries and any identified special features, such as wetlands and preservation areas, being the balance of the declared area outside the high-preservation area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028460"></A>
Such a definition cannot be readily applied to the intended wild river declaration of the Channel Country in Western Queensland within the Lake Eyre Basin, which includes the Georgina River Basin, the Diamantina River Basin and the Cooper Creek Basin. The definition of those watercourses as proposed wild river areas will relate much more to the expansive flood plains that are strongly connected to those river systems. Therefore, it will be much more difficult to develop a physical description of a wild river area in the Channel Country for the Lake Eyre Basin declaration. As a result, a new definition of a wild river is required and the amendment in this bill will facilitate the declaration of the Channel Country as a wild river area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028464"></A>
Therefore, it is clear that the Wild Rivers Act will be amended from time to time at the whim of the Bligh government to satisfy whatever political prerogative it has at the time. That is precisely what this amendment bill and the Channel Country declaration within the Lake Eyre Basin are designed to achieve: a political prerogative of the Bligh Labor government. The promise to declare this area as a wild river was made to satisfy the Greens in the lead-up to the 2009 state election. Since it was first established in 2005, the Wild Rivers Act has always been a political tool of the Queensland Labor Party. For example, take the ridiculous declaration of Hinchinbrook Island, in my electorate, as one of the original wild river areas in February 2007. <Hansard-Speech-End>

That the bill be now read a second time.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033706"></A>
The Neighbourhood Disputes Resolution Bill 2010 is the conclusion of the review of neighbourly relations project. The review considered the current laws, processes and remedies available to neighbours and their practicality when applied to common neighbourhood disputes about dividing fences and trees. The review was undertaken with the aim of encouraging the people of Queensland to be good neighbours and to support neighbours to resolve their disputes in a friendly, timely and accessible manner. I believe that the current bill has stayed true to this intention. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033707"></A>
The Neighbourhood Disputes Resolution Bill 2010 encourages neighbours to resolve neighbourhood disputes informally and uses easy to understand and simplified drafting styles and language. It also provides more effective and accessible remedies for neighbours to help them resolve the most common causes of disputes in neighbourhoods--those relating to dividing fences and trees. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033708"></A>
More particularly, this bill will modernise Queensland law in relation to dividing fences legislation, it changes the common law of abatement in relation to overhanging tree branches, and it introduces a simplified remedy to deal with trees. The bill confers jurisdiction on the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal in relation to these matters.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033709"></A>
The bill contains two distinct chapters--one dealing with fences; the other with trees. The Dividing Fences Act 1953, which has been the statutory authority on dividing fences for almost 60 years, will be repealed. This act will be replaced by a chapter on dividing fences. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033710"></A>
Another separate chapter will introduce new state based tree legislation which will provide a simple statutory remedy for the resolution of disputes about trees likely to cause serious injury, serious damage or substantial, ongoing and unreasonable interference with a person’s use and enjoyment of the person’s land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033711"></A>
The bill addresses most of the concerns raised during a broad public consultation process on the draft bill undertaken over an eight-week period from May to July 2010. Most submissions related to the proposed new tree legislation and were very supportive of the new provisions for notices to trim overhanging branches to the boundary line. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033712"></A>
The proposed bill provides clear direction about a tree keeper’s responsibilities and reflects the strong community view that a tree owner, known as the ‘tree keeper’ in the bill, should be responsible for the proper care and maintenance of a tree growing on their land in the neighbourhood. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033713"></A>
While the bill sets out the paramount principle of public safety, the importance of considering the contribution trees make to the environment is also reflected in the bill. QCAT is required to consider several matters in relation to a tree before deciding any application for removal or pruning. These matters include any contribution the tree makes to the protection of waterways or foreshores and any contribution the tree makes to the local ecosystems, biodiversity and public amenity. If a tree is ordered to be removed by QCAT then the bill provides that QCAT may order that another tree be planted in its place.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033714"></A>
This bill will revolutionise the law about trees. It will provide a statutory remedy for nuisance caused by a tree which historically has been a difficult remedy to access for the average Queenslander because of costs associated with bringing matters in the higher courts.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033715"></A>
The bill will bring greater certainty to the community by clarifying that the ownership of a dividing fence on a common boundary line is shared equally between neighbours. A distinction will also be clearly made between retaining walls and fences. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033716"></A>
Two new forms will be made available to neighbours to enable them to effectively communicate to resolve a potential dispute. A ‘Notice for Contribution to Fencing Work’ and a ‘Notice for Overhanging Branches’ will provide guidance to neighbours wanting to act within the provisions of the bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033717"></A>
There is a focus throughout the bill on informal resolution of disputes about trees and dividing fences. Conciliation will be the alternative dispute resolution process used to resolve fence and tree disputes. A conciliation process involves a conciliator assisting participants to identify issues in dispute, develop options, consider alternatives and try to reach an agreement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033718"></A>
A conciliator will be able to provide advice on matters in dispute and options for resolution but will not make a determination. In keeping with the intention of the bill, it will be up to the neighbours to reach mutual agreement on issues.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033719"></A>
Prior to its commencement, the government will implement a strategy to ensure that Queenslanders are aware of the important changes brought about by this bill. The bill will be reviewed three years after its commencement to assess whether it has achieved its objectives.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033720"></A>
Friendly, tight-knit communities are one of Queensland’s great strengths. This bill helps preserve the great lifestyle that Queenslanders have come to enjoy, and it will make it easier for neighbours to avoid and reduce disputes before they escalate. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr CRIPPS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Hinchinbrook--LNP) (2.36 pm): Hinchinbrook Island sits just off the coast of my electorate, with its northern most point adjacent to the town of Cardwell and its southern most point adjacent to the town of Lucinda. Hinchinbrook Island is 39.3 square kilometres in size and, as such, is Australia’s largest island national park. The island has been separated from the mainland by the deep, narrow, mangrove fringed Hinchinbrook Channel for about 100,000 years and has remained in relatively uninhabited, pristine condition. It is this unique pristine environment that has resulted in state and federal governments choosing to make a range of conservation declarations on and around the island to preserve its natural values.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033728"></A>
The environmental value of Hinchinbrook Island was quite rightly recognised early, and the island itself was declared a national park in 1932. I wholeheartedly support the ongoing preservation and conservation of Hinchinbrook Island. This has been substantially achieved by the early declaration of the island as a national park. In addition, Hinchinbrook Island is surrounded by World Heritage declared areas--on one side by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and on the other by the Wet Tropics. How much more protected can you get than a national park surrounded by World Heritage?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033729"></A>
So why was Hinchinbrook Island in my electorate declared in the first round of wild river declarations in February 2007, when its declaration is obviously so completely superfluous to the ongoing preservation of the conservation values of the island? The answer is politics--pure, cynical and blatant politics designed to benefit the Queensland Labor Party at the ballot box. The Queensland Labor Party needed to deliver agreed numbers of wild river declarations, now numbering 10, mostly in North Queensland and including Hinchinbrook Island, to secure the preferences of the Greens at both the 2006 and 2009 state elections, which has helped it cling to power.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033730"></A>
It has been part of the same grubby political agreements that have led to a whole raft of vindictive, onerous and oppressive regulations being imposed on North Queensland in recent years by the Bligh Labor government, supposedly to protect the environment but, in truth, to protect the majority of the Queensland Labor Party in this parliament. At the most recent state election, the centrepiece of this grubby political deal was the so-called Great Barrier Reef Protection Amendment Bill--a blatant, dishonest and shameless attack on farmers and graziers in North Queensland. The rationale behind that legislation is fraudulent and fabricated. It has put North Queensland farmers and graziers in the same regulatory class as sewage treatment plants and heavy metal refineries and has demanded compliance with this complicated new red tape under threat of massive fines and even jail terms.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033768"></A>
The pay-off was the locking in of Greens preferences behind the Bligh government at the last state election--another horrific example of the Bligh government playing politics with the livelihoods of Queenslanders. So imagine my disbelief when I read media reports recently of Premier Bligh accusing the Leader of the Opposition and the leader of the Liberal-National coalition in the federal parliament, Tony Abbott, of playing politics by introducing his private member’s bill to overturn Labor’s Wild Rivers Act in Queensland. Surely this is the most shocking example of the pot calling the kettle black, even by the Bligh government’s standards. Surely the hypocrisy of this government has reached a new level. The political nature of the Wild Rivers Act goes right down to the fundamentals of the policy, and it has affected my electorate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033772"></A>
One of the programs attached to the wild river declarations is the Wild River Rangers Program. The Wild River Rangers Program itself is a good program. It provides some opportunities to local traditional owners to be engaged in efforts to preserve the environmental and cultural values of the landscape within the wild river areas. The Wild River Rangers Program was provided for after the passage of the Cape York Peninsula Heritage Bill that passed through this parliament in October 2007. As I mentioned previously, Hinchinbrook Island was declared a wild river area in February 2007, along with Fraser Island, Gregory River, Morning Inlet, Settlement Creek and Staaten River--eight months before the Wild River Rangers Program was established. These six wild river areas, declared together in February 2007, all presumably met the same criteria to attract such a declaration, exhibiting the same conservation values and supposedly needing protection under the Wild Rivers Act. It follows, therefore, that they should all be treated equally in terms of their ongoing management.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033782"></A>
In June 2008, the Bligh government delivered wild river rangers to the wild river areas on Cape York Peninsula and the Gulf of Carpentaria that it had declared in February 2007 and after the Wild River Rangers Program had been established after the Cape York Peninsula Heritage Bill passed through the parliament in October 2007. I have no quarrel with that. However, the Bligh government did not simultaneously deliver the Wild River Rangers Program to the Hinchinbrook Island wild river area, despite it being declared at the same time as those wild river areas on Cape York Peninsula and in the Gulf of Carpentaria. I certainly have a quarrel with this neglect by the Bligh government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033787"></A>
In fact, I had written to the then minister for natural resources and water, who is the current Minister for Main Roads, in April 2008 asking for the Wild River Rangers Program to be delivered to the Hinchinbrook Island wild river area, given that the program had been established in October 2007. When the minister replied to my correspondence he came up with the rather lame excuse that the Wild River Rangers Program on the cape and in the gulf was a trial and that, if the trial went well, Hinchinbrook Island might get some wild river rangers later. Why was the Hinchinbrook Island wild river area denied access to the Wild River Rangers Program when it was declared at the same time, met the same criteria and had the same conservation values that supposedly needed protection? The answer, once again, is politics. Hinchinbrook Island was being treated as a second-class wild river area by not having the Wild River Rangers Program delivered in it--while that program was delivered in the other wild river areas on the cape and in the gulf that had been declared at exactly the same time. </Hansard-Body>

Mr CRIPPS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Sure. Not only did the Bligh government fail to deliver the Wild River Rangers Program in the Hinchinbrook Island wild river area at the same time as all the other wild river areas that were declared in February 2007; it failed to deliver the program before it went ahead and declared three more wild river areas in April 2009, being the Stewart River, the Archer River and the Lockhart River wild river areas. So much for these declared wild river areas being pristine environments desperately requiring immediate protection. Not until July 2009, more than 2 years after being declared a wild river area and almost two years since the Wild River Rangers Program had been established, did the Hinchinbrook Island wild river area have wild river rangers allocated to it. It was totally unfair for the Wild River Rangers Program to be rolled out in certain areas of Queensland and not others.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033804"></A>
I wonder whether the Bligh government would have delivered the Wild River Rangers Program to Hinchinbrook Island at all had I not written to the former minister for natural resources and water for a second time in June 2008 and spoke in the parliament about it in August 2008 and again in June 2009. How do I know that? Fraser Island was declared a wild river area at the same time as Hinchinbrook Island, in February 2007. Three years and nine months after that declaration and three years and one month after the Wild River Rangers Program was established, I am not aware of a single wild river ranger being allocated to Fraser Island despite the fact that it was amongst the first to be declared. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033808"></A>
So we really have two classes of wild river declared areas in Queensland--one where the Bligh government thinks it can get a local political advantage by delivering the Wild River Rangers Program ahead of others that have been similarly declared and another where the Bligh government has just made a declaration for political purposes to make up the numbers to satisfy the demands of the Greens in exchange for preferences at election time. I wonder which category the proposed declaration of the Channel Country in Western Queensland, as part of the Lake Eyre Basin, as a declared wild river area, will fall into? Will the Channel Country get wild river rangers soon after it is declared, or will it wait for years as Hinchinbrook Island did and as Fraser Island still is? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033813"></A>
The whole Wild Rivers Act is a cynical, political farce and it is a real shame that a worthwhile program like the Wild River Rangers Program is associated with it. The rangers themselves undertake valuable conservation work and strengthen cultural connections between themselves as traditional owners and the declared areas in which they work.The program has been successful within the Hinchinbrook Island wild river area, where the wild river rangers have been belatedly deployed under the auspices of the Girringun Aboriginal Corporation, a well-established, reputable, practical and progressive organisation representing traditional owners in my electorate. It is a real shame that this program was not established independent of the politically tarnished Wild Rivers Act. I reiterate my support for the contribution to the debate by the member for Callide in relation to the proposed amendments to the Wild Rivers Act and the diverse range of other acts that are proposed to be amended by the various provisions in this bill.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr JOHNSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gregory--LNP) (2.47 pm): I rise to speak on the Water and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. This bill bundles together nine pieces of legislation to be considered by the House. Each of these nine acts has to be amended and each has water as a common denominator, but there are three separate water policy areas. These three different policy areas should stand as separate pieces of legislation and should not be bundled into one. The amendments to the Energy Ombudsman Act 2006, the South-East Queensland Water (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) Act 2009, the Water Act 2000 and the Queensland Competition Authority Act 1997 have a separate policy intent to the Land Valuation Act 2010, the Petroleum Act 1923, the Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004, the Water Supply (Safety and Reliability) Act 2008 and, last but not least, the Wild Rivers Act 2005. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033827"></A>
Obviously, these bills were bundled so the government could avoid the scrutiny of the House. Three separate bills should have been brought before the House so that there could be considered debate on the policy intent. Full scrutiny should be given to the policy intent of these amendments. It seems that the government’s intent is to avoid considered scrutiny. The quick political fix of bundling has been applied, instead of allowing for considered debate on important policy areas. The omnibus or bundling approach allows scrutiny to be avoided. This is not a new tactic. It is the same approach the Labor government used to avoid public scrutiny of the privatisation of assets and the junking of the fuel subsidy in favour of a fuel tax. I remind the House of the contentious legislation wrapped into the Appropriation Bill--namely, the Infrastructure Investment (Asset Restructuring and Disposal) Bill and the Fuel Subsidy Repeal and Revenue and Other Legislation Amendment Bill--and the fact that we were allowed only 24 hours to debate it. This bill before the House has the same hallmarks--that is, to avoid public scrutiny of the government’s failed policies and to deter close examination of legislation which amounts to a political fix for its failing policies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037091"></A>
I turn now to the amendments to the South-East Queensland Water (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) Act and the Queensland Competition Authority Act. The amendments include providing the Queensland Competition Authority with some authority to regulate the water entities in addition to its monitoring functions. It seems the amendments make some changes to the Queensland Competition Authority’s regulatory status, but it is doubtful whether this government will give the QCA the necessary powers needed to be an effective regulator. It is another political fix in the same way as this Labor government insisted the QCA set electricity prices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037096"></A>
The amendments give the impression that transparency in water pricing will be increased by imposing a statutory obligation on local governments to forecast water prices 12 months prior to their imposition. Further, local governments will be required to publish the wholesale cost of water on invoices to customers. This is the political fix--transferring the responsibility for an increase in water prices to local governments and being able to blame local government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037097"></A>
The government has been spruiking that these amendments have the potential to provide some relief to increasing prices for Queenslanders. It is a real fallacy. The ugly reality is that the cost of water to the consumer is now mainly determined by the cost of water infrastructure debt racked up by Labor governments as part of a knee-jerk reaction to the drought and the abandonment of planning and policy over the last two decades. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037098"></A>
It is instructive to reflect on the fact that our water infrastructure assets are estimated at $9 billion and, according to the Queensland Treasury annual report, the debt of all water entities exceeds $8.5 billion. This means that Queenslanders only have some $500 million equity in these assets. The reality is that this debt is escalating, and no matter which entity it is allocated to, it will have to be repaid by water consumers. In three years time, the debt will exceed the regulated asset base of $9 billion and Queenslanders will have no equity in the infrastructure assets of South-East Queensland. This debt will peak in about 2017-18. Considering this government’s approach to water management, it is a bit like the Harvey Norman principle--purchase the product now and pay later. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037101"></A>
It is my general understanding that this current $8.5 billion is not included in the state debt of $85 billion. The water infrastructure asset will be paid for by water consumers. The price of water is now determined by debt--some $8.5 billion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037102"></A>
The amendments before the House are made of fairyland stuff and designed for the political fix to address consumer alarm at the increasing price of water. They do not address the cause of water price increases, which is debt. Water is an essential utility and traditionally Queensland governments have accepted the responsibility for providing this essential service efficiently and carefully and managing the cost because it impacts both quality of life and standard of living.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037103"></A>
Now, in the 21st century, two challenges must be faced. How do we ensure reliability and security of supply and how do we do this on a basis that does not compromise the quality of life and standard of living that Queenslanders have traditionally enjoyed and have a right to expect? The answer is not through the political fix amendments before the House but through a change of government to one that can make the hard decisions. There should be reform, as the Lord Mayor of Brisbane suggested, starting with the three vertically integrated water entities with enormous overheads. Consumers bear the costs of these overheads in their water charges. If this precedent or experiment with South-East Queensland water is applied across the state then rural and regional Queenslanders will face the same costs and uncertainties that South-East Queenslanders are now battling. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037107"></A>
I turn now to the legislative amendments that address issues pertaining to the introduction of the regulatory frameworks to improve management impacts arising from the extraction of underground water from petroleum activities, including coal seam gas activities. We know the wealth of this state will be in part determined by how wisely and responsibly we manage the precious water resource. These amendments confront the critical issue that faces this state of developing a coal seam gas industry while, at the same time, ensuring food security for some 10 million Queenslanders by 2050. The challenge is to develop a new export industry to an energy hungry world without endangering agricultural production and food security. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037108"></A>
The Coordinator-General in recent reports has identified the issue of subterranean water as one that needs to be addressed, which includes that risk mitigating strategies have to be put in place to protect the artesian water resources. The legislative amendments do not provide the statutory competence to manage the risk that our subterranean water is exposed to by the CSG industry. Regrettably, this legislation does not provide that statutory hedge that is needed to ensure that this state has food security and it does not manage the risks to our priceless artesian water supplies or our precious prime agricultural lands. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037109"></A>
As I mentioned earlier, the wealth of this state and its standing in the Federation and internationally will be judged by how wisely and responsibly we manage Queensland’s priceless water resources. These amendments do not have the capacity to apply either great wisdom or judgement to one of the great problems of the 21st century. That is the balance between food security and protecting our natural resources and a new export industry for an energy hungry world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037110"></A>
A major concern is that it can be interpreted that this government has sanctioned the accelerated development of the CSG industry with some hastily applied regulations but without a comprehensive assessment of long-term risks to the strategic interests of the state, the state economy and agriculture. There are three long-term risks that must be addressed to give confidence to all stakeholders--the CSG industry players, the communities, the towns and the agricultural producers. These include the risks that may occur to our water and arable land resources and agricultural production. The second is the risk to our future state prosperity and economy. The third is the transgenerational consequences in terms of food security for a projected population of 10 million people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037111"></A>
The reality must be faced that there is a risk that there is the long-term threat that CSG operations may irreversibly deplete accessible subterranean water resources and damage arable land. In turn, this has the potential to critically contract agricultural production with implications for food security. Any contraction of the agricultural sector and loss of economic capacity will lead to greater exposure to the global mineral resources. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037112"></A>
According to industry economic modelling, the economic life of the CSG industry is some 30 years. The current situation is that there is uncertainty about the legacy of the CSG industry and its impacts on the economy and agriculture. On current information, it is difficult to evaluate. A further risk is to the state’s economy and its long-term prosperity and its ability to meet sustainably the demand for food for a population of some 10 million by 2050, to maintain exports and to ensure a balanced economy. It is important that these issues be addressed now. It is too late when the damage is done. I trust the minister and I trust his government that this will be done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037113"></A>
As said before, the CSG industry’s exposure is limited to 30 years. It will pack up and move out, leaving the state with a legacy that is unknown if we do not get it right now. I remind the House that 30 years ago we were unconcerned about asbestos in construction materials, but it is now known to be a toxic substance with deadly health consequences. We do not know the consequences of specific CSG drilling, its operations on the agricultural industry and the subterranean water. It may be zero or it may prove to become unsustainable, incurring a risk to food security. Based on current information, the risks are unmanageable and incalculable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037114"></A>
Following the expiry of the CSG project in some 30 years, rehabilitation may be possible to surface agricultural land, but the impact on the subterranean water and aquifers may prove to be permanent due to CSG drilling and operations exacerbated by possible climate change volatility. What happens if, like the deadly asbestosis in housing construction materials, the real impact on the subterranean water resources becomes apparent after 30 or more years? That is after the CSG industry has vacated Queensland. Who will pay for the full cost of recovery? The answer is that the cost to future generations of Queenslanders cannot be recovered. At present there is uncertainty. There is no scientific evidence that says that there are no potential risks to subterranean water and the consequential impacts to the agricultural sector, food security and exports. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037150"></A>
The CSG industry must be enabled to progress but from a position of certainty. These amendments do not address the risk or give certainty to all current stakeholders or to future generations. Certainty can only occur when the impacts of CSG drilling into subterranean water, the impacts on agricultural land and food production are based on informed decisions and science rather than assumptions. All stakeholders need certainty, and this state government is not providing the necessary leadership to provide that total confidence to all stakeholders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037154"></A>
I turn now to the amendments to the Wild Rivers Act 2005 and related legislation primarily for the purpose of extending wild rivers protection to the Lake Eyre Basin rivers which make a number of operational amendments. This bill is one of contradictions and conflict. On one hand the amendments to the Wild Rivers Act protect pristine rivers so that there cannot be future risk from mining or harmful agricultural production. On the other hand this bill allows potential risk to pristine subterranean waters by the CSG industry. However, it is clear that the extension of the Wild Rivers Act to the Lake Eyre Basin is another political fix so that the government can repay the Greens for its preferences at the last state election.</Hansard-Body>

Generations of Queenslanders have been protectors of the rivers without cause for alarm and without legislation. We have done that well for the last 150 years. I am a product of that country. I live in that country and I hope that I will be buried in that country one day. Now, to repay the debt to the Greens, the government imposes legislative requirements on the property owners through which the rivers flow. That country is unique country. It is precious country. It is fragile country, but it is resilient country--just like the people who are the custodians of it today and our Indigenous brothers and sisters who were the custodians before. That country is a generator of wealth through the beef industry. Tourism is a very big industry in that country, and I note that the Minister for Tourism is in the House and is nodding in agreement. That country is fragile country. In dry times it is destocked. It is managed properly and professionally. I can assure the House and I can assure the minister in his absence that those people who work and run cattle operations on that country are very protective of the resource and are very much aware of the fragility of that resource, and I can assure future generations of Queenslanders that nothing will change.</Hansard-Body>

We talk about environmental managers in Western Queensland, but I want to talk about environmental managers in a different area which is an environmental master piece--that is, the Curragh mine at Blackwater owned by the Wesfarmers group and managed by Mr Rod Bridges, the general manager, and his team of personnel. On 15 November my colleague and good friend the honourable member for Bundamba, Jo-Ann Miller, and I were invited by Wesfarmers group to Blackwater to open the diversion channel at Blackwater mine which covers some 11 kilometres. At a cost of $129.6 million, the Blackwater Creek diversion represents a major development in the life of the Curragh mine and now allows access to an additional 47 million tonnes of low-strip coal suitable for processing into hard coking coal for export.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037171"></A>
Approximately 200 people were involved in the project, and this number included Curragh personnel, Downer EDI Mining, Ostwald Bros, Lanyonscapes, Salmon Earthmoving Services and Persal and Co. Wesfarmers resources personnel also provided key support during this project. With regard to key points of this project, the civil works were completed in September 2009; the diversion was opened in December 2009; the rehabilitation was ongoing until May 2010; and the project was delivered 12 months ahead of schedule and $15 million under budget. Any member of this parliament who gets the opportunity to visit the Curragh mine at Blackwater to see firsthand that deviation channel should because it is an environmental master piece. Wesfarmers group and the management of Curragh mine, especially Mr Rod Bridges and his team, must be congratulated for the way they have embraced the environment, for the way they have addressed ecological issues with Blackwater Creek and for showing the people of Queensland that the mining industry is alive and well and working very ably with the environment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037185"></A>
In closing, I hope that the CSG industry can take a leaf out of Wesfarmers’s book at Blackwater and have the same regard to the environmental issues that have been addressed at the Blackwater Creek diversion. This will show the people of this state and future generations of this state that they are here for the long haul and that there will be financial benefits to all people in this state as a result of the proper management, the proper structuring and the true vision that they have for the future of this great industry while working with the agricultural industry, the environment, local governments and local communities to ensure that the CSG industry and all other mineral industries in this state can progress in an open and harmonious way for the outcome of all and sundry. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind) (3.05 pm): In rising to speak to the Water and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010, I, too, would like to acknowledge visitors in the gallery--Rob Marshman and John Russo who are advocates from Bundaberg and Childers who are here to meet with representatives from the Treasury to talk about the Wide Bay-Burnett draft plan. In speaking to the Water and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, this legislation has wide-reaching effects. In fact, the Wide Bay draft plan is a classic example of how water infrastructure is affecting the development of our region. The fact that this government has dropped the 40 per cent subsidy for major infrastructure for local council has been reflected in the Wide Bay draft plan. It appears to have constricted development and ensured that development would occur in a much smaller area because of the lack of that 40 per cent discount on water infrastructure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037201"></A>
The bill amends the Energy Ombudsman Act 2006. It also amends the South-East Queensland Water (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) Act 2009 to provide for greater additional customer protection provisions and offences and greater transparency of distributor-retailers operations. It makes amendments to the Water Act 2000 to ensure that distributor-retailers have all of the necessary powers to effectively perform their functions. It amends the Land Valuation Act. It is an all-encompassing bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037205"></A>
The reaction to this bill has not been favourable. After listening to members of the LNP and others on the crossbenches, I think it would be very difficult for members of the LNP and also members of the crossbenches to vote for this bill. The principle of ‘if in doubt throw it out’ applies. There have been many problems highlighted with this legislation. The Queensland Farmers Federation has commented on its weekly online bulletin on 22 November that landholders have good reason to be concerned about the potential impacts upon groundwater sources on the Darling Downs in light of the expectant expansion of the coal seam gas industry. In the words of the Queensland Farmers Federation--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037213"></A>
The Water and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 provides for ‘learn by doing’ ... management approach backed by requirements on project companies to ‘make good’ on any impacts on farm or other bores.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1037215"></A>
The QFF further states in its bulletin that--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037217"></A>
While the Bill is a very positive step toward protecting groundwater, it does not alleviate all concerns. A negotiated agreement about making good these impacts will be of little value if there is no way to prove water extraction is the result of CSG extraction. Likewise, in the unfortunate event of a major catastrophe befalling the underground water, there is a risk that the ‘make good’ provisions may not be adequate to undo the damage caused from these activities. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040573"></A>
In recent days there has been much debate about the CSG industry--the threats that it poses to the environment, to the people who live and work on that land and to their produce and the flow-on effects. Let us be very clear about this. Last night we debated a motion to put a moratorium on this industry. The Independents suggested that we have a moratorium. We were talking about four to 4 per cent of the land mass of Queensland. It is prime agricultural land where this activity of CSG exploration is being carried out. Why should we gamble and risk this sort of activity that still has unknown scientific disbenefits? Why should we do that? Why should we gamble with our children’s future with such a still dangerous activity? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040574"></A>
We should protect that prime agricultural land and the farmers who live and work there and the communities that rely on them. There is no way that we should be introducing policy, procedures and regulations that make it more difficult for those farmers to do their jobs and make it more unsafe for those farmers to do their jobs and the broader implications of that. Cancer-causing chemicals have been recorded in underground water after the CSG activity is over. A large part of the community is still uncertain about the effects of this process. Certainly, the farmers are literally manning the barricades as we speak and trying to prevent this mining activity from being carried out on their prime agricultural land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040575"></A>
One thing that I learned when on an overseas delegation to Malaysia to attend a parliamentary conference was that the rest of the world appreciates the concept of food security. It appears that we in Australia, particularly in Queensland, do not appreciate the concept of food security. Food security will only come by having reliable water sources. The rest of the world is talking about food security and we are not valuing the prime agricultural land that will ensure food security and ensure that future generations will be able to grow healthy food for Queenslanders and Australians to eat. I guess food security is largely not in our psyche. It is very difficult to appreciate food security when you have such talented caterers who work in this environment and you are speaking on a full belly. But I remember talking to my grandfather and my father about the Great Depression, when people literally starved and found it hard. If you talked to people who have come from European countries, you would find that food security is ingrained in their psyche, because they went through World War II and the famine that resulted. The concept of food security, as it is with people in Europe, should be ingrained in our psyche in Australia and we should be doing everything to protect our food security. Quite frankly, this bill is not doing enough to protect our food security. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1040576"></A>
The Queensland Labor Party has a horrific history of managing water infrastructure in our state. That lesson was rammed home to me when I visited the Fred Haigh Dam, which is just north of the Bundaberg region and in the northern part of the Burnett, which is just beside it. At that dam there is a plaque that says who Fred Haigh was. He was a water commissioner who was employed by the government--he was actually an engineer--from 1955 to 1974. In that 19-year period there were 12 major pieces of water infrastructure built in Queensland. That is 12 dams. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040578"></A>
I got the library to do a little study and found out how many dams had been built in that 19-year period starting with Wayne Goss and Labor coming to power in 1989. There was one piece of major infrastructure built in that time and that was Paradise Dam, which is to the west of Childers. That is the reason Queensland got into the trouble it was in. Successive Labor governments failed to plan and failed to properly build the water infrastructure that we desperately needed in Queensland. As one taxidriver said to me, ‘If you don’t want to drink water then don’t build dams.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040580"></A>
The reality is that there has to be prudent planning and the building of dams. We saw how much of our money was wasted by this government making a political statement at Traveston, knowing full well that all of the engineers and all the experts said that that dam should not be built, and we saw all the lives that this government disrupted and ruined and the deaths that came about because of that. That just goes to prove how irresponsible and heartless this government is when it comes to planning for future infrastructure. You have ask the question: why? Are they that stupid? It really comes back to a matter of political survival rather than a practical delivery of water infrastructure. It was a gesture to the Greens and an attempt to stay in power, because they wanted the Greens preferences flowing back to them. It had nothing to do with prudent planning for future water for our communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040581"></A>
As I have mentioned, Paradise Dam is the largest piece of water infrastructure that has been built recently. It provides a huge economic boost to my region. Developers will tell you that the Wide Bay-Burnett area will be their preferred area to build, because the Wide Bay-Burnett area does not have the major infrastructure problems that the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast have because the area has water infrastructure guaranteed because of that dam. There have been many people and many reports saying that that area is going to be a high-growth area. Of course it will, and one of the reasons for that is that the area is guaranteed water. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040582"></A>
One of the things that we want in the Wide Bay-Burnett area is a guarantee that that water is transferred to the farmers who, when the water levels get low, still have to pay for 100 per cent of their water allocation even though they receive only 50 per cent of their water allocation. It is an unfair system, and those farmers in the Childers and Isis districts should receive their water allocations. If they pay for 100 per cent, they should get their 100 per cent and it should be guaranteed. There have been rumours and plans that that water from Paradise Dam will be siphoned off to other communities. That is an outrage. It must stop. We must first guarantee the water supply to the Isis community and the farmers in that area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040583"></A>
The other issue that is worth raising is the whole issue of climate change. All of this water infrastructure and all of these plans are being put in place because of the horrible effects of climate change. The reality is that we have had politician after politician on the Labor side saying--and I can remember former Premier Beattie getting up and holding his hand on his heart and saying this--that the world is getting hotter and drier. That is a complete lie--I withdraw that word; it is an untruth. It is a well-known scientific fact that for every degree increase in temperature there is a one per cent increase in rainfall around the world. If you subscribe to the theory that it is getting hotter, it is actually getting wetter. That is pure physics kicking in. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040584"></A>
It seems as though those on the other side will have whichever argument they want. If they are talking about climate change, they can always explain it away as it is getting hotter and wetter or hotter and drier--whatever mood seems to take them. It comes back to making the point that their decisions have not been based on science. They have been based on flawed modelling processes, and a lot of those processes have been taken from the IPCC--that famous international body that has been discredited time and time again. Just recently in the Wide Bay draft plan we read that the prediction for the rising sea level was going to be 0.8 of a metre. That prediction comes from this state government’s reliance on the IPCC figures. We are making plans for water infrastructure and the like based on these flawed international assessments. That has to be redressed as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040586"></A>
There are other concerns in the community about this legislation before the House. There are concerns from the chair of the Basin Sustainability Alliance, Mr Ian Hayllor, who states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040590"></A>
Within 18 months or so there will be thousands of bore owners forced into make good agreements covering thousands and thousands of water bores. We are already seeing unexplained impacts on groundwater quality and water levels in CSG areas of Queensland. We struggle with the fundamental issue of how on earth CSG companies are going to make good high-security water in 10 to 50 years time. The BSA is strongly of the view that every attempt must be made by the CSG industry to preserve the local and regional water balance if this industry is to have any chance of making good water long term. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040626"></A>
One of the issues that has come up in my community, and it is not being directly affected by the CSG industry, is the fact that the Bundaberg Regional Council draws about 70 per cent of its water from our underground supplies. The remaining 30 per cent is sourced from surface water supplies. ‘Where does that water come from?’, has been asked time and time again. That is a question that has been asked in my office. Many long-term residents and those people in the know will tell you that that water comes from around the Darling Downs area. It actually flows through those inland watercourses and exits near Fraser Island and surrounding areas.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040630"></A>
The point I am making is that any contamination of underground water sources has an effect not only on the immediate area and the Darling Downs area but also on communities that are quite a distance away from it. This is an issue that all members of the community and all members in the south-east and central area of Queensland will relate to. I make the point again: why conduct these activities on four per cent of our prime agricultural land? What about the other 96 per cent of the land mass? Why would they not explore for those mining opportunities on that other 96 per cent? Let us put greater protection and security on the four per cent of our prime agricultural land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040632"></A>
According to the article, Queensland Farmers Federation chief executive Dan Galligan noted that, while the existing legislation was not perfect, it was important for a groundwater management regime to be established to ensure the cumulative impacts of the three major CSG export projects approved for Queensland could be properly considered. He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040635"></A>
Part of the problem we have all got is that we all want a perfect system but we all want a system implemented so further procrastination may well be worse by not doing anything and waiting for the perfect system. Our greatest concern is that nothing is looking at cumulative impact on groundwater. This will start to look at it but it certainly won’t start until the legislation is passed so everyone has been caught between a rock and a hard place. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040636"></A>
I would simply suggest that Queensland Farmers Federation chief executive Dan Galligan should apply the precautionary principle and also listen to his farmers and understand that right now the farmers are manning the barricades and risking jail sentences to protect their family livelihoods, property, stock and the environment. It is time that not only the Queensland Farmers Federation listened to its grassroots members but also that the LNP listened to its grassroots members. There are many good people in the LNP--the National Party members--who instinctively understand that we must protect our prime agricultural land, but it seems as though their voices are being drowned out by big business. It worries me that big business--the millionaires’ clubs, the mates of the people who will profit from these mining activities--are having too much of an input into the policy that comes into this place. We should go back to listening to the grassroots people who are the people who understand just exactly what is going to happen here. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040637"></A>
In closing, I would simply mention that this legislation will touch on every aspect of our life, including the Wide Bay draft plan. I table some key points of concern regarding the Wide Bay Burnett Regional Plan from the Childers Chamber of Commerce by Mr John Russo and ask that the Treasurer hear what Mr Russo has to say. This Wide Bay draft plan is coming in. There has not been enough consultation with the community. A number of community groups have expressed serious concerns and reservations. We would like to lobby the Treasurer to delay the final submission date for complaints and concerns about this plan. It needs to be delayed by at least a month. The closing date is 24 December. We all know that things slow to a halt in December. I would ask that the Treasurer postpone the closing date for that particular plan. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.24 pm): I rise to speak to the Water and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. I have often stood in this House and spoken about the experience in the Kingaroy area. Today I will not concentrate on that and the problems that arose with regard to UCG and other issues. I congratulate the member for Callide. I listened to his speech very carefully the other day. He said there needs to be a reality check and that things need to slow down just a little bit. He is right. I would like to see the moratorium. As we all saw, though, that was hailed down last night. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040641"></A>
We can stand in this chamber for days and weeks and listen to people who perhaps do not understand the bill in its entirety, who are not lawyers, who have not sat down and deciphered it. They may have just taken the party room viewpoint on the bill itself. What I would like to do today is present a submission and quote considerably from it in relation to what I will call the WOLA Bill--because it is so easy to say rather than pronouncing the name of the whole bill. It is from a firm of solicitors in Dalby, Shannon Donaldson Province Lawyers. It outlines how they see the bill and its effect on people in general, not necessarily the people on the Downs, and how little protection there really is for our water supply. If members will bear with me, some will find it perhaps a little tedious but I think it needs to be read into <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
. The submission states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040643"></A>
To me there is an extremely important issue flying under the radar here. I cannot overstate its relevance. The problem arises because I think there is a genuine intention in the drafting of this legislation to minimise the exposure of the companies to liability for damage to water quality and quantity and shift that risk onto the people of Queensland. Let’s be clear, the gas companies have readily disclosed in their EISs that they will be sucking out enormous quantities of water from the underground aquifers. They have then received their approvals notwithstanding that disclosure. The Coordinator-General has imposed various conditions but on my reading of them they are completely inadequate to address underground water (as opposed to above ground water). In particular a combination of these conditions, the amendments proposed in the WOLA Bill and the existing provisions, have the end result of shifting risk as I have indicated. The Coordinator-General obviously thinks that the issue of underground water will be addressed in the WOLA Bill--in fact he says as much in his report. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1040644"></A>
I actually have that report attached to the back of this submission. The submission goes on to state--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040645"></A>
The existing conditions he has imposed don’t adequately address underground water presumably because of that attitude. Take for instance Condition 9 which lumps a very general obligation to provide an assessment of intended ‘mitigation measures’. It places some emphasis on above ground water and vaguely refers to the underground water by asking the proponent to advise, before they start production: mitigation measures that address the potential impacts on the quality and quantity of supply to existing users including make-good options such as reinjection, reconfiguration of extraction regimes, use of offsets (such as replacing other water users’ take with associated water from the project), and rehabilitation of existing bores to address potential induced inter-aquifer leakage (that could be a result of depressurisation caused by the project).</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040646"></A>
Given the attitude in the Coordinator-General’s response presumably all the proponent need do is say that it will comply with the ‘demanding’ provisions of the WOLA Bill. There is another general obligation to monitor etc but no clear direction not to pollute or damage the quality of underground water. This is an essential requirement that is simply missing. It shouldn’t be a condition issue anyway--it is so important that it should be reflected in the legislation given that the rest of the legislation focuses so heavily on drops in the water table. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040678"></A>
In particular, the WOLA Bill is woeful in how it addresses damage to water quality and its affect will be to limit the companies’ liability at law dramatically.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040679"></A>
Much has been made of the ‘make good’ provisions in the Bill. The make good obligation contained in the Act in respect of damage to water quality--the most critical concern of all--only arises where there is a decline in the aquifer and a breach of the trigger thresholds etc. It provides in section 412 the circumstances in which liability arises as follows: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1040680"></A>
(1) 	An existing water bore has an impaired capacity if </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1040681"></A>
(a) 	there is a decline in the water level of the aquifer; ... and </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1040682"></A>
(b) 	because of the decline, the bore can no longer provide a reasonable quantity or quality of water for its authorised use or purpose. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040683"></A>
The American experience makes clear that quality can be affected by methane transfer through aquifers, mobilisation of dangerous compounds, increased salinity etc. And all that can arise purely as a result of the lawful extraction of unlimited quantities of water. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040684"></A>
There is absolutely no reason to tie affect on quality specifically to a reduction in the water table and even then to a drop below the trigger thresholds. Quality could well be affected before that occurs anyway. It is illogical to have isolated damage to quality in this manner. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040685"></A>
Further, there is in fact a specific provision in the Petroleum and Gas Act which allows these companies to interfere with and take water in unlimited quantities as follows:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

If the EPA don’t prosecute, then any member of the public can take prosecution themselves and a breach of the general environmental duty would be prima facie evidence of negligence. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

However, that is not the case when it comes to activities authorised by an environmental authority as will be the case with the gas industry. The Environmental Protection Act also specifically provides as follows: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

As this legislation will allow. There is no redress for landholders affected in this way. He continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040708"></A>
This makes clear how critical the terms of any environmental authority for the gas industry is ... Even if the damage isn’t authorised by the activity ... there is still a defence available under that section that the damage was just an incident or inevitability of extracting water from the underground aquifer ... Just pumping water out and drilling won’t be grounds to prosecute. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040709"></A>
So where quality damage arises the only protection will be where it can be shown to be purely due to a drop in the water table ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1040710"></A>
The writer has clearly outlined that the reduction in the watertable does not necessarily relate to whether something could be contaminated or the quality lessened. It can happen at any level. He goes on to say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040712"></A>
My concerns are aggravated by DERM’s disclosure that DERM did not consider itself (and therefore the EPA as well) as having any jurisdiction over underground water. Further, the model conditions for level 1 EAs make no mention about underground water but to talk about surface water etc. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040713"></A>
All this leads to a few absolutely critical factors in my book: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1040714"></A>
1 	WOLA must state that the provisions of the EPA still apply to damage to aquifers, that any other rights at law are not compromised AND specifically the EAs must state that they do NOT authorise any damage to underground water quality </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1040715"></A>
2 	The make good obligations must be expanded to allow review of any make good agreement by the court at large where equity requires it and to make clear landowners or anyone else that would have standing under the EPA can still take other action under the EPA in the event of damage to water quality at large AND that the make good obligations do not restrict other rights at law </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1040716"></A>
3 	The Dept MUST have the right to cease all operations at any time where water quality is compromised or reasonably suspected of being compromised</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1044148"></A>
4 	Very significant security bonds for the specific potential of water damage Must be held by the government AND not just insurance bonds where they have get out clauses in the case of a company breaching its EA etc</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1044149"></A>
5 	Assigning a PL a PPL or any other relevant tenure does not exclude a company from liability for damage done during its time</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1044150"></A>
6 	The company will be presumed to have caused contamination unless it can prove otherwise </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1044145"></A>
He finishes by saying--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040721"></A>
I am also concerned by the apparent lack of clear power in the Chief Executive to suspend activities if they breach the provisions etc and I am not sure he could do so anyway. It is obvious that they still don’t quite know how they are going to go about the management because they have placed so much discretionary power in the CE to decide what’s required of them.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040722"></A>
Above all however, we must make sure that the make good obligations aren’t the only recourse that Landowners have or for that matter, the government itself, to protect the water.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

As members can see, those concerns are expressed by someone who understands the law and has studied the WOLA Bill in its entirety. He has said a lot more, but I will not go into it tonight. This is relevant, because if a lawyer has those sorts of concerns about a bill then it must raise a lot of issues. I ask that the minister obtain a copy of that document so that he can read those concerns. Perhaps, at the very least, he will ask his legal advisers about the issues that have been raised by that law firm. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040727"></A>
It is very obvious that there is a lot of hysteria surrounding this issue. Some of that is based on elements of truth, but, as with global warming, nobody knows where the exact truth lies because there is so much information available. If one view does not suit a particular person’s point of view, it is labelled as hogwash and the people who question whether there may be an ounce of truth in it are belittled. The obligation on each of us is to question things. It is our obligation to question the intention of every company that wants to drill or explore land, or whatever it might be. This government and all in this House have an obligation to protect the people on the land. In some instances there must be a right to pre-existence, but that does not seem to come to the fore in any way, shape or form. Most importantly, landholders must have confidence in their government. They must have confidence that the government has the power to react and will react very quickly. The consequences of not doing so can be severe. It is too late to lock the gate after the horse has bolted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040728"></A>
This bill focuses on securing our water, which is very important and very right. However, as Peter Shannon has stated, it is not very secure. It needs to be strengthened in many ways. When it comes to these more recent forms of gas exploration, it seems to be that we will learn as we go along. I do not believe that is appropriate. I do not believe it is right for a government to play Russian roulette. Companies play Russian roulette all the time with landholders, but I do not believe the government has the right to do it. It is the government’s role to protect the people of Queensland, not the rights of gas or mining companies of any description. The people must come first in the government’s thought processes. They must be protected. In a country as dry as ours, their water supply must be protected at all costs. It should be seen as the primary focus for any government to protect our resources.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040729"></A>
We know that water usage will be enormous. We know that there is the potential for this industry to have a devastating impact. But people have to be made aware of exactly how the government plans to face that and, when alternative opinions come forward with questions to be asked, it is the minister’s obligation to check it out at the very least and find the answers. The questions that are raised in this particular legal opinion need to be put to bed before anyone who has anything to do with the gas industry can feel any peace at all in Queensland. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. DM WELLS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Murrumba--ALP) (3.40 pm): The bill before the House is one for which the arguments are reasonably obvious. The bill itself is a workmanlike piece of legislation. I would hesitate to speak on the bill were it not for the fact that I am moved simply by humanitarian motives, because if somebody from this side of the House does not speak there will be absolutely no break whatsoever to the mindnumbing repetition of the crawling flatteries of honourable members opposite, who for two days running, one after the other in obedient succession, made ritualistic obeisance to the longwinded bombast of the honourable member for Callide, making out that his thoughts were in fact the revealed word. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WELLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thus encouraged by the honourable minister, may I say that there is nothing more terrifying than to see a gaggle of fawning tories bowing and scraping in the direction of the honourable member for Callide singing <Hansard-Italic>
How Great Thou Art</Hansard-Italic>
. I think we have had pretty much enough. If you look at this list you see that they have at least stayed on message. One after the other they have all got up and said the same thing. They have had only one idea and that was wrong. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044454"></A>
It was a pleasure to hear the deviation of the honourable member for Burnett, who came out and said that we built a lot of infrastructure in response to our fears about climate change. Let us get real. Climate change had nothing to do with it; it was a really big drought. We were not engaged in any scientific presaging there. We built a lot of infrastructure because there was a drought. Indeed, if you take a historical perspective on this, in 100 years time the history book might read something like this: ‘Towards the end of the first decade of the 21st century there was an unprecedented severe drought. The people of the day responded with determination that it would never occur again. A great deal of infrastructure was embarked upon. Necessarily, the price of water went up and a number of administrative rearrangements had to be made. The matter finally settled down in 2013 when, as a result of amendments made in 2010 to the Queensland Competition Authority Act, the Queensland Competition Authority began setting the price of water.’ That is probably what an objective historian in 100 years time is going to write about this period of time. It is very, very likely that that historian will not pay any ritualistic obeisance to the wit and wisdom of the honourable member for Callide. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044457"></A>
It was in fact in 1997 that the Queensland Competition Authority was set up. It was set up in response to the national competition policy, which was the policy that was implemented under both the Keating and the Howard governments. Under the national competition policy, there was a requirement of the federal government upon the state government to ensure there was competitive neutrality. Wherever there was going to be a monopoly, it was necessary for that monopoly to be competitively neutral and there had to be full cost recovery. That places certain strictures on governments. That means that when you have to put in a lot of infrastructure then, one way or the other, the price is going to go up.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044458"></A>
However, the decision which this government has taken, which is encapsulated in the bill which is now before the House, is to amend the Queensland Competition Authority Act--as a matter of fact part 5A of that act--in order that the water entities which have now been set up can be brought within the ambit of the price-setting regimen. When that happens, when it is clear that an objective umpire is making determinations--</Hansard-Body>

 I thank the honourable member for Brisbane Central for her perspicacious observation. As I was saying, this is a really significant and really worthwhile reform, along with the other changes that are going to make the billing system a great deal more transparent. The putting of the determinations relating to water pricing in the hands of an impartial umpire will be extremely valuable and extremely important. I do not wish to go too long on that particular point. I would hate to disappoint the opposition, however, by failing to refer to the amendment to the wild rivers legislation. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1044469"></A>
If we go back to our objective historian who will be writing in 100 years time, we can say that he will probably write something along the lines: ‘2010 was a very significant year for the rivers that flowed into Lake Eyre. The amount of water that went through in that particular year as a result of a deluge meant that there was an extraordinary increase in the number of birds and other wildlife that inhabited that part of the world. The movement of the water through the river system at that time freshened and cleansed the waterways and gave that part of Australia a significant opportunity to sustain its biodiversity.’</Hansard-Body>

 Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The objective historian might go on to point out, ‘With the slow and apparently irrevocable degradation of the Murray-Darling Basin, those particular catchments are incredibly important for the preservation of the biodiversity of many species of creatures.’ The preservation of those rivers, the preservation of those species and the preservation of that habitat is going to be achieved as a result of this declaration. It is a really important and really significant move that is being made for which the people of our nation in the future will feel a degree, I think, of gratitude that we took this decision now. The proposition of the honourable member for Callide, repeated as it was through the mouths of his various acolytes in an inevitable contrapuntal chorus over a period of tedious days--</Hansard-Body>

 And nights indeed. They continued with their proposition that the wild rivers legislation had nothing to do with rivers; it has a very great deal to do with rivers, it has a very great deal to do with our ecosystems. This continent is one interconnected ecosystem and it is incumbent upon us, given the severe difficulties that are faced by those who are trying to look after the Murray-Darling system, to preserve other systems and this is one which will make a big difference. </Hansard-Body>

Mr HORAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba South--LNP) (3.51 pm): No amount of beautiful flowing English prose and alliteration will lessen the pain for the good people of Murrumba who face the increasing water bills and electricity bills that are occurring in this state. This is a serious debate about the livelihoods of people and about where people live.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047788"></A>
I want to speak today about two issues that are addressed in the bill--the coal seam gas on the Darling Downs and Surat Basin area and the water issues of the South-East Queensland water grid. I wish to highlight the government’s mismanagement in this area, because this bill is about water issues, the Competition Authority, water grids and the mining of underground resources and tacked into it is a section about the Queensland Institute of Medical Research. That wonderful organisation needs to be recognised on its own in a smaller piece of legislation where people can speak about what happens there. It should not be lumped in with a resources and water bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047792"></A>
I live in a city that has always relied on agriculture for its base. That agricultural base has made Toowoomba into Australia’s second biggest inland city after Canberra. It is a beautiful city based on not only agriculture and the servicing of agriculture but also education and the servicing of the Darling Downs and south-west Queensland through services like legal, accountancy, medical, education and so forth. We have seen a massive blooming of Toowoomba and the Darling Downs--towns like Oakey, Dalby, Chinchilla, Miles, Roma, Surat and others to the north like Injune and Wandoan--and a growth in opportunity for many people in addition to the traditional jobs in agriculture and grazing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047795"></A>
We have to work through this in a very practical way. The first thing we have to do is look after agriculture and particularly the lifeblood of agriculture--that is, the water supplies. The water supplies in that part of the world are very rarely above ground; they are mostly underground. Every single property has a windmill, a diesel operated bore or artesian bores a little further out, and the reliance on dams and above ground supplies is tenuous at times. So that is a very important obligation. We need to be realistic and pragmatic about this and look at where we are now. This whole issue of coal seam gas, coalmining and everything else that has happened has galloped ahead faster than we can almost comprehend. It is only in recent years that the issue of access to people’s properties has come up and there has finally been legislation, protocols and regulations about it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047798"></A>
The protection of the quality and quantity of water is addressed in this bill--not completely and not properly, as our shadow minister pointed out, but it is a start. That has been brought about greatly through the agitation, quite correctly, of people in the area, of rural organisations like AgForce and QFF and of the local members in those areas. I commend the work of the member for Warrego and the member for Condamine who understand this. They have worked very hard on these issues for their electorates. They are right in the midst of it and they have worked in conjunction with our shadow minister.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047801"></A>
We are seeing some of the biggest investment the world has seen; it is hard to comprehend the sheer size of it. One company, British Gas, is going to invest $15 billion, with $1 billion of that in the construction of reverse osmosis plants to deal with and treat water it extracts in that area. I know of firms in Toowoomba that employ 600 or 700 people. There are earthmoving firms, real estate agents, people selling four-wheel drives, the trucking industry that is hauling the pipes to these areas, the professionals who are involved in the various mining activities. Young people are able to come out of our university with degrees that can be used in the area. Young men and young women are going away to university and are able to come home and find jobs and opportunities that would not have been there for them 10 or 15 years ago.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047804"></A>
So we have to balance the magnificent agriculture, the intensive grain industry, the livestock industries and the grazing areas with this opportunity that has come to the area and has brought prosperity. Sure, it will bring some income eventually one day to those people who have shares in these companies, but along the way it is the local companies that are doing the work, the local people who are getting the jobs, the local people who are now getting work as land officers, and the young apprentices who, as soon as they finish their apprenticeship, are able to go and find work and make some substantial money to get themselves and their young wife or partner established and in a position to buy a house.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047805"></A>
This whole issue of coal seam gas has to be approached with great compassion and care. For those people who live on the land, it is their home and their livelihood and water is the most precious thing for them. At the same time, we have this massive industry that is providing a livelihood and jobs for hundreds and thousands of people and rejuvenating the towns throughout this area. You can see it in the sporting teams. Clubs that struggled to have a footy team can now have three or four grades from under-19 up to A grade playing in competitions. You can see it in the revitalisation of the towns. So we have to be pragmatic about this issue. One of the major things about this bill is addressing these problems so as to allow this resource industry of coal seam gas to be able to work in conjunction, in parallel and in cooperation with agriculture without ruining the livelihood and the lifeblood of those people involved in agriculture. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047806"></A>
Some of the issues that have been a problem in the past have been better or worse with different companies--such as the issue of access, where subcontractors blindly went on to people’s properties without permission. That has been addressed in recent times by legislation and it has been addressed by companies being told what to do and becoming more aware that they cannot do that, that they have to treat people with respect and they have to deal with people properly when they access their property. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047807"></A>
There is also a greater realisation that we are dealing with different zones in this area. Some of the more extensive grazing areas are able to more easily accommodate wells on their property. In many instances, they have been provided with a small amount of income per well. In many instances, they have been able to have bores put on their place, have fencing improvements done and so forth in cooperation with the companies. On those more extensive areas, it does not appear as intrusive and, generally speaking, in many cases there has been a good system of cooperation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051149"></A>
The issues change as we move into some of the more intensive farming areas, some of the best farming areas in the world--areas like the deep cracking Waco black soils between Dalby and Cecil Plains. The farming is intensive. They are absolutely world class. They are laser levelled. All the machinery operates on GPS systems and is semiautomated in some instances. Some have lateral move or centre pivot irrigators. One cannot just drive on to a farm in a four-wheel drive and peg out an area and say, ‘We will put down a well here.’ It may be in the middle of 500 acres or 1,000 acres of irrigated, laser levelled black soil for the production of food and fibre. Areas are different when it comes to water. There are the more shallow underground waters in the Condamine Alluvium. There are subartesian areas a little further out. Generally, below the coal seam gas there is artesian water. Naturally there is great concern about this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051152"></A>
What happens in the future when they move on to other wells? We need to bear in mind that the resource that is being discovered now could last for 300 years or even longer. What happens when wells are abandoned and they move on to others? What happens in terms of the rehabilitation of those wells? They may go through one level of water down into the coal seam. Will the pumping of concrete into that well be adequate or will the casing rust away because of the high salt content and allow for interaquifer transfer? Is there a better system of rehabilitation? Could we put concrete on the outside and on the inside? These are the unknown issues because this has happened so quickly.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051154"></A>
Some very serious concerns have been expressed by Peter Shannon, an experienced lawyer in Dalby. He has lived and worked in the area and understands the whole area. Many of his concerns, if not most of them, are dealt with in the amendments that our shadow minister will move this afternoon. The amendments will ensure that proper and due legal opportunities can be provided to landholders who suffer any damage either in terms of the quantity or quality of their water supplies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051156"></A>
The legislation we have before us today really only provides opportunities to take limited action in the case of a drop in bore level of three metres in one case and five metres in another case. It does not provide real opportunities under the law for people to be able to seek reparation in the case of problems with the quality of their water. Quality issues could involve poisonous compounds through to high salt contents. There is a whole range of things that could happen. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051157"></A>
That legal opportunity should be there because these people have been farming in these areas. They have bought their properties. They have borrowed money. The water is their lifeblood whether it is for stock or domestic or irrigation purposes. If that is destroyed in any way, shape or form by the mining of coal seam gas then they should receive absolute compensation. I believe the system should include a fund where the money is there so companies cannot walk away or run away from their obligation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051158"></A>
The criticisms and the recommendations that have been made by Peter Shannon of Shannon Donaldson Province Lawyers in Dalby are quite detailed. They are incorporated in the amendments that will be moved by our shadow minister today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051160"></A>
We are on the cusp of an unbelievable opportunity for the state and for the area of the Darling Downs and the Surat Basin. But we are also on the cusp of a real tragedy for people on the land if this is not monitored and managed properly. The legislation should provide absolute protection for their water and absolute protection for some of the best agricultural lands in world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

That is why the LNP has put in place a five-point plan covering property rights and water. Under that plan, we provide for a gas fields water and land authority. That authority would be made up of local people with local knowledge, local councillors and others appointed by this parliament. They would ensure that this massive industry that has almost overtaken everybody in terms of its development does not impinge upon the property rights and water rights of people who own precious farming land. They need to be able to live there and earn a living. </Hansard-Body>

This bill also deals with the South-East Queensland water grid and in particular the Queensland Competition Authority which will be given the right to determine water prices. We have seen what has happened with the Competition Authority when it comes to electricity prices. The last three years we have seen electricity prices in Queensland go up by around 44 or 45 per cent. It adds to the cost of living. </Hansard-Body>

As this government drowns under debt which is approaching $85 billion, of necessity the petrol tax, electricity prices, water prices, gas prices, stamp duty, registration costs and driver’s licence fees have increased. Everything we can name has had to be jacked up to try to deal with the drowning impost of interest, let alone any repayment of the debt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051168"></A>
The water grid in South-East Queensland is probably one of the greatest examples of the waste, mismanagement and gross lack of care of the Labor government in Queensland in dealing with the money of the people of Queensland. This $9 billion expense in South-East Queensland is being used as the basis for the increase in the cost of water. There has to be a return on that investment of $9 billion. That is what in part is jacking up the price of water throughout South-East Queensland. That $9 billion has huge chunks of investment that are nothing short of dud and wasteful investments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051171"></A>
Take the western corridor recycled water pipeline that had over $1 billion in overruns, for example. The waste and mismanagement that occurred there is unbelievable. Take the Tugun desalination plant and the hundreds of millions of dollars wasted there. Take the $500 million or more wasted on Traveston Dam. This was wasted even before it had approval. Take the money that has been wasted on the northern interconnector pipeline to the nonexistent Traveston Dam. The story goes on and on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051174"></A>
This waste and mismanagement by the Labor government is costing ordinary people more when it comes to the price they are paying for water. The government is demanding a return on the investment. Whether the investment was good or whether it was a dud or whether it wasted billions of dollars, it is costing Queenslanders in terms of the price they are paying for water. That is probably one of the best examples of the mismanagement that has occurred under this government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051175"></A>
Toowoomba is now connected into that system through a pipeline. That cost about $178 million. The government contributed $112 million to that pipeline to bring water from Wivenhoe to Cressbrook Dam. Despite putting in $112 million of the $178 million Toowoomba had taken away from it $6 million a year in water and sewerage grants as part of the $196 million reduction in grants to councils throughout Queensland. It gave on the one hand and took away on the other. The consequence of that is that the people of Toowoomba have had their access fee to the water pipeline going past their front fence doubled and the cost of water has doubled, and that of course has added to the cost. The city already has to lift its water about 680 metres or more in a vertical lift in those two stages of lift to bring it to the top of the range.</Hansard-Body>

 It would be very easy to say thank you if the government did not take away the $6 million a year. That was the most cynical thing that could have happened--$6 million a year taken away. The government provides roughly two-thirds of the cost and then says, ‘We’ll take away $6 million from the council every year from now on.’ That is the cynical exercise that has to be exposed, and the people are well and truly aware of that.</Hansard-Body>

As I said, if anything describes the gross mismanagement and the absolute flushing away of hundreds of millions of dollars by this government as it climbs its way to an $85 billion debt it is the monumental waste in South-East Queensland on the South-East Queensland water grid dud projects and mismanaged projects. As a consequence, the ordinary working-class people have to pay--people on fixed incomes, people on low incomes, pensioners and all of those people who have seen their cost of living go through the roof because they have had an incompetent government that has wasted their precious money. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (4.10 pm), in reply: First of all, I thank all members for their participation in this debate. It is fair to say that over the last three days that this debate has extended over there have been contributions of varying quality across the parliament. It is fair to say that a number of members of the opposition have made thoughtful contributions. That does not necessarily mean that I agree with them, but they were thoughtful nonetheless. More to the point, it became clear that there are also quite a number of members--and I welcome the member for Buderim into the House because I am just about to refer to him--who do not understand for one moment or refuse to accept or are deliberately misleading in terms of their contributions to the debate. I thought it was a golden moment when the member for Buderim made the observation that there is no minister responsible for water and then proceeded to demand a whole range of answers from me. If there is no minister for water in this parliament, how could he possibly expect to receive answers to his questions? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054602"></A>
That was just one of a number of inconsistencies and downright untruths, I have to say, from the member for Buderim. A number of others of his colleagues would have to come in for dishonourable mention, including the member for Gaven, whose particularly interesting view of the world knows no bounds given the topics it can be applied to in this parliament. I also make an observation about the member for Toowoomba South, who spoke last. It seems to me that, according to his view of the world, somehow people should not pay the full cost for the assets that they take advantage of. For some reason there is, in their view, this magic pudding that comes from the state government out of nowhere that gets applied to subsidised infrastructure. As I have made the observation on a number of occasions, the difference between a taxpayer and a ratepayer is paper thin, in my view. At the end of the day, somebody has to pay for infrastructure. It can come out at the time that you pay your bills for whether it be water infrastructure or electricity infrastructure, or it can come through other means to ensure that subsidies get provided.</Hansard-Body>

 The simple fact is that, for the first time, people like you, member for Toowoomba South, have to pay your full bills and can no longer rely on taxpayer subsidies for the services that you clearly take for granted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054606"></A>
As we consider this bill it is important to remind the parliament that, while we now have an abundance of water, it was only three years ago that South-East Queensland dams were at 17 per cent supply capacity, with predictions that that level might go as low as six per cent. How quickly members opposite have forgotten that lesson! We get lectured by the agrarian socialists opposite on a regular basis about how good they are at preparing for the bad years, but they seem to not apply the same logic when it comes to investing in something as important as the water grid. That is, whilst it may not be operating at full capacity during the good years, it is a great investment for when those bad years inevitably return--the very same bad years for which the people they represent are planning in terms of how they go about their farming operations. But, no, let us not get into a consistent view of the world here! Let us have one rule for us and one rule for them! That is clearly at the heart of so many contributions by members opposite in relation to this debate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054609"></A>
The government has shown leadership and has taken responsibility to rectify the long-term water mismanagement and poor planning and underinvestment in water infrastructure that existed at the time at local government level. That is a point worth noting, because members opposite have said consistently during this debate that it is local government that has historically provided water supplies for its communities. Yet what did we see? What did we see only a number of years ago? A failure by those same local governments to invest in that water infrastructure. It took the state government to step in and coordinate that investment, and that is why we are proud of the South-East Queensland water grid. It has won 16 industry achievement awards but, more importantly, even though we have had above-average rain in recent months and our dams are full, the grid has provided long-term insurance against future droughts and water security for the region’s rapidly growing population. Whilst those members opposite want to make short-term political capital out of the change in our fortunes in respect of rainfall, I am confident that history will judge us as being absolutely correct in terms of the investment of money in the creation of the South-East Queensland water grid.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054612"></A>
As I listened to the debate on this bill it became very apparent that many of those opposite clearly do not understand who is responsible for billing and who collects profits from household water bills. The entities responsible for this are the South-East Queensland council owned water distributor-retailers--Queensland Urban Utilities, Unitywater and Allconnex. They make a profit from water and they pass that profit on through a dividend to the councils that own them. Let us take into account what Councillor Eddy Sarroff has said publicly about how much water the Gold Coast council will take out as dividends from Allconnex--$94 million this year. That is $94 million of profit that the mayor could put back into lower water prices for the people of the Gold Coast.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054622"></A>
Contrast that with what this government has done in terms of bulk water prices--that is, where we have set them. We will still run at a loss of $407 million this year. We are not even achieving cost recovery, yet, because of our commitment to keep water prices as low as possible, we are taking a loss this year of $407 million while the councils continue to take dividends. Of course, when we talk about the $9 billion water grid there is that little matter of $2.2 billion that represents the money councils were given by this state government in exchange for taking over their assets. The question of course arises: what happened to that $2.2 billion that was handed back to councils in consideration of the assets that we took over? Where did the money go? In each and every one of those councils that have been out there whingeing and complaining, what did they do with the $2.2 billion that they received?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054624"></A>
What did Brisbane City Council do with the $1.023 billion that it received for its assets? What did the Gold Coast do with the $560 million that it received? Did it apply that to lower water prices? No, it did not. What about Redlands, since there has been so much concern about that? It picked up a tidy little $81.7 million. What did it do with that money? The Sunshine Coast picked up a very handy $86 million. Did it apply that to lower water prices? No. It just stuck it in the back pocket. Meanwhile, its ratepayers are having to pick up the bill for its refusal to pass on that money in lower water prices. That is why we have said, ‘Yes, they’re tricky. Yes, they’re half-smart and they haven’t been prepared to do what we’ve done and take it as a loss to put downward pressure on water prices.’ They are the facts that not one of the members opposite alluded to in any way. Why? Because it does not suit their political argument, but they are facts nonetheless.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058102"></A>
This bill proposes a number of reforms to the way in which these distributor-retailers will deal with their customers. The bill amends the South-East Queensland Water (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) Act 2009 to provide for additional customer protection and greater transparency of the operations of the distributor-retailers, including publishing participation agreements and prices and charges. There were also additional requirements for mentoring and customer accounts. A key element of the reforms to the distribution and water sector of South-East Queensland is the development of a robust economic regulatory regime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058105"></A>
From establishment, the distributor-retailers have been regulated by the QCA, which has investigated and reported on the costs and other factors behind the annual increases in water prices. At this point I recommend to members opposite that they visit the QCA website, because they will find there some really interesting documents. They are the documents that have been put forward by the three distributor-retailers in terms of their submissions to the QCA. You only need to go through those documents to see exactly how much water prices are going to go up to meet an accelerated capital works program by those three entities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058106"></A>
It is quite simple. All the councils have to do is direct those distributor-retailers to put in place a price path that would smooth those capital works projects over a longer period. That would immediately put downward pressure on council related water prices. But no, what they are doing--and the councils know this and they are prepared to let them get away with it--is front-ending all of that capital works program. So when you look at the amount of capital works that these three distributor-retailers have published in these reports, you will see massive increases this year, next year and the year after and then it fades away. A sensible thing to do would be to smooth that capital works program over a longer period. That would overnight put downward pressure on council related water prices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058107"></A>
But do we see councils taking a leadership role? No, we do not, even though they have representatives sitting on the boards of those distributor companies. That is why I say that the local government campaign has been tricky and dishonest because, once again, the facts speak for themselves. I say to the opposition members to go to the QCA website and see that for themselves before they again stand up in this place and carry on with the nonsense that they have during the course of this debate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058108"></A>
I would like to take this argument just a little further in terms of the ongoing dishonest campaign by the LGAQ in particular. Yesterday, I had the unfortunate experience of viewing a crass little video that makes the LGAQ’s official website look like a reject out-take of the <Hansard-Italic>
Benny Hill Show</Hansard-Italic>
. That is probably not being fair to Benny Hill. This video is not funny in any way. It is plainly pathetic and highlights the level at which the LGAQ will, firstly, waste ratepayers’ money on this kind of nonsense and, secondly, hide the real truth about water prices. The truth is that councils are making huge profits from water and the truth is that councils are responsible for driving up household water and sewerage bills. But perhaps we should not be surprised that the LGAQ would stoop so low as to politicise and demean pregnant women, young children and teenage boys. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058110"></A>
Let us not forget that it was just two weeks ago that the LGAQ paid for a jaundiced report by the AECgroup on water. If the LGAQ video is bad <Hansard-Italic>
Benny Hill</Hansard-Italic>
, then this LGAQ-commissioned report resembles a scene from <Hansard-Italic>
Steptoe and Son</Hansard-Italic>
--one giant load of rubbish. It was a misleading, paid-for report--a waste of scarce ratepayers dollars--by the LGAQ and any fair-minded council would have to start asking the LGAQ why it is wasting council dollars on this kind of nonsense. It defied belief that the report ignored the councils’ own waste water sewerage charges. The fact is that 75 per cent of the average household bill is council related charges for water and sewerage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058113"></A>
It also defies belief that the LGAQ seems to have also forgotten--as I mentioned before--that its member councils were paid $2.2 billion in compensation by the state government for their water assets. Does the LGAQ also forget in 2007 what Paul Bell, its then president and current president, said in a media release issued on 28 April 2007 in relation to the proposed institutional arrangements that were being put in place for water across South-East Queensland? I think it is useful to remind members opposite what the President of the LGAQ, Paul Bell, had to say back in 2007, because he said this--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1058116"></A>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1058119"></A>
However, South-East Queensland mayors have expressed major concerns about the level of compensation--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1058120"></A>
that is okay--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1058122"></A>
being offered by the government for their water assets. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058123"></A>
At that time they were talking about a figure between $1 billion and $2 billion. What was the final figure? It was $2.2 billion. So they received the maximum amount of compensation that was laid on the table. Yet when you go to the LGAQ website and see the video called <Hansard-Italic>
Beattie’s Wet Dream</Hansard-Italic>
, this stands as a mark of the absolute hypocrisy of the LGAQ and, in particular, the current president who, back in 2007, said that the institutional arrangements, which are the subject of this nasty little video, were contemporary and were consistent with national and international trends. I table that media release from 2007 as testament to the level of dishonesty that the current LGAQ campaign continues to exhibit.</Hansard-Body>

The bill will enable the QCA to commence the price determination process in order to have the first set of price determinations for the distributor-retailers in place from the period commencing 1 July 2013. The economic regulation of water pricing is an open and transparent process and is common practice applied across other jurisdictions. Remember where we have come from. We have come from a situation where historically councils have not been transparent in their price-setting policies. Rather, they have consistently skimmed profits off water rates for other purposes. This is the first time that we will see in place a transparent pricing process by both the state government and the council entities that follow the money trail. That is why, as Councillor Sarroff said in relation to the Gold Coast City Council, we know for the first time just how much the Gold Coast has been skimming this year alone--$94 million. Imagine what $94 million reinvested back into lower prices would do for the ratepayers on the Gold Coast.</Hansard-Body>

What did Eddy Sarroff get for his trouble of being the most honest local government politician on the Gold Coast? He got the sack.

Rather, the mayor sticks it in his back pocket and applies it to whatever projects he wants. Meanwhile, the people of the Gold Coast are hurting.

A lot of discussion during this debate has gone on about the development of our CSG to LNG industry. I do not think it is necessary for me to comment too much in relation to that, except to restate my pleasure that the LNP has been able to whip themselves into shape and commit themselves to the development of this industry so that we can finally see an end to the nonsense campaign in some parts of the south-west by one or two members of the LNP who have gone down the path of populist politics rather than having a vision for this state. Should those members stick up their head in the future and carry on with that nonsense then they can expect to be reminded, in every way that I possibly can, about what they did yesterday evening in supporting the government motion to support this industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061658"></A>
Finally, I will cover matters in relation to the wild rivers legislation. I will restate, for the purposes of history, exactly where the LNP has come from. They were quite happy to support the wild rivers legislation back in 2005, particularly the Liberal Party under the leadership of Dr Flegg. He stood in this place and said that, after much research and much thought, he could only come to the conclusion that the wild rivers legislation was a good thing. Lawrence Springborg, the then Leader of the Opposition, reminded parliament that his party supported the wild rivers legislation when it was debated in parliament. The <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
 record speaks for itself. But, of course, now that Tony Abbott has gone on the path that he has--without the consent of traditional owners, I might add--we now see the LNP flip-flopping, having to be seen to be supportive of the interesting nuances that make up the Leader of the Opposition. It is without much conviction. We see these pathetic attempts to rewrite history in relation to their original support back in 2005. This includes the member for Dalrymple, if I remember correctly, who was part of the happy band of clappers who put up their hand and said, ‘Yeah, we’re with you, Minister, with the wild rivers legislation. We think it’s a little ripper.’ Not now. You have obviously had a conversion on the road to Damascus driven by the mad monk from Canberra.

Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 You are right; he is not my friend. I withdraw. History will judge the LNP on this issue very badly. When the Liberal Club meets on 6 December, that will be one of the issues on the agenda. The old Liberal Party had such a proud history of supporting the environment, supporting the Queensland Labor government by banning tree clearing. This will be just one of a number of issues as they discuss the good old times over a Pimm’s or two, or perhaps a cheeky little Kooroomba verdelho from my good friend Bob Carroll--a tasty little drop it is, too. They will enjoy that and think about the old times--the old times when the Liberal Party stood for something, not the blancmange that makes up the Liberal Party tonight. How those former Liberals can sleep at night--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (4.39 pm), by leave: I wish to bring the House’s attention to another victim of the unscrupulous Brendan McKennariey, who recently gave evidence against a now disgraced former member of this House, Gordon Nuttall. This time the victim is a brilliant young scientist, Ben Kele, who is a Rockhampton citizen. It seems Mr Kele was conned by McKennariey into providing a design for sewage treatment for the company GBG which, as I understand it, has McKennariey as its sole director. The other two directors of GBG, Gary Fenlon and Graham Doyle, have since quit the company. In a classic case of thieves falling out, Mr Doyle is suing Mr McKennariey. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061718"></A>
When I became Minister for Public Works in July 1998, Mr Doyle was already ensconced in 80 George Street as the secretary of an organisation known as Quality Water. This was supposed to be a joint venture that had its own board. Mr McKennariey’s company, BHF, was selected as the program coordinator. This structure was established by the then Director-General of Public Works, Kevin Davies, after a proposal was submitted by Mr McKennariey. This occurred while Liberal Party minister Ray Connor was at the helm. At that time, Mr McKennariey was working as a consultant in the office of the National Party Minister for Emergency Services, Mick Veivers. Mr McKennariey was touring the state, selling the Borbidge government’s message to firefighters following a sleazy deal between the National Party and a ginger group in the UFU--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061722"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Robertson:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 I remember that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061723"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I remember it very well--which saw the then Fire Commissioner, Geoff Skerrit, removed from office. At that time Mr McKennariey was so influential that he was put on the panel that chose Mr Skerrit’s replacement. Mr Doyle and Mr McKennariey, both professing to be Labor stalwarts, were doing their best to help the Borbidge government. There was Mr McKennariey sitting up in a National Party minister’s office, choosing the next fire commissioner while proclaiming his Labor Party credentials. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061725"></A>
When the government changed in June 1998, one of the first people to try to see me was Mr McKennariey, but all my diary records prove he did not get to the door, much less past it. Because I have never trusted turncoats, my natural reaction was to distrust McKennariey and Doyle. It is now a matter of history that my inquiries to the director-general of the Department of Public Works prompted an internal audit, which revealed that Mr McKennariey had been dishonest in not revealing his directorship of JMC Plumbing, which had picked up about $300,000 worth of work from contracts awarded by Mr McKennariey. It was for that reason that Quality Water came to an end, and Doyle and McKennariey left the ALP. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061726"></A>
However, that was not the end of it--far from it--as this pair sought out another minister who, as history shows, was corruptible. Mr Doyle and Mr McKennariey also found mates on the other side of politics who were eager to help, and I refer particularly to the members for Callide and Maroochydore, who used this parliament to advance the case of this pair of unconvicted criminals. Other opposition members, such as Lingard and Laming, are on the record of this parliament as agents for McKennariey and Doyle. The opposition leader has conducted no inquiry into the behaviour of those frontbench cronies, who were most vociferous in their support of this crooked pair. This tells me he lacks the courage to look under the rock that concealed Mr Doyle’s and Mr McKennariey’s direct influence on people who now want to be ministers. The question is whether the Leader of the Opposition wants these sort of people to stay on his front bench.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061727"></A>
There is no doubt that Doyle and McKennariey are well connected with the now LNP. There is ample evidence that the opposition was in close contact with Mr McKennariey and Mr Doyle, and opposition members misused their positions in this parliament to attack me on their behalf. I was reported by Mr McKennariey to the then CJC, as was the director-general of Public Works and the internal auditor, when I put an end to this rort. I was also reported to the privileges committee by the member for Maroochydore and subject to relentless attack by those opposite who were defending a man who took bags of cash to a minister in the same way their hero, Joh, acted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061728"></A>
It would be very interesting to know whether LNP members have had any business dealings or invested money in any of Mr McKennariey’s money-laundering ventures. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to tell the House what inquiries he has made to determine what involvement his members, past and present, had with McKennariey and Doyle. I also call on him to apologise to Queenslanders for his party’s role in trying to protect the corrupt activities of those people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061729"></A>
It comes as no surprise that McKennariey continues to use Ben Kele’s intellectual property, contrary to the terms established in the agreement between CQU and GBG. I am advised that Mr Kele has not provided permission for his design to be used in recent projects such as the $800,000 Redlands City Council contract. This means that warranty may be void and could leave ratepayers exposed to financial risk. Moreover, I am not surprised to hear that McKennariey was dudding his partners and investors. In evidence, Mr McKennariey said that he got Gordon Nuttall to organise a $1.6 million contract to provide training in Aboriginal communities, but I have been told that McKennariey pocketed the bulk of that. Furthermore, I am told that some decent people have lost their investments in Mr McKennariey’s company to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars. It is high time that ASIC took a close look at Mr McKennariey’s directorship. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061730"></A>
Former National Party ministers, current local government councillors, Order of Australia recipients and, of course, the former Labor member for Greenslopes, Gary Fenlon, whose initial was one of the Gs in GBG, all should be contacting ASIC. They should be providing evidence about how unfit Mr McKennariey is to hold a director’s position. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061731"></A>
My instincts were right about McKennariey and Doyle. They were proven to be dishonest 12 years ago when I became a burr under their saddle and they used everything they could to try to discredit me, with the help of those who sit opposite. They were able to convince the opposition, including current serving shadow ministers, that they were honest people and were being victimised. It would be refreshingly honest to see those shadow ministers admit and apologise for their lack of judgement. One can only wonder at what sort of ministers they would make. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061733"></A>
This dishonest duo also conned the media, particularly the gullible Mike Munro who took up their case with relish. The <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail’s</Hansard-Italic>
 Darrell Giles rated Gordon Nuttall more highly than the then Premier, Peter Beattie, proclaiming him to be a top ministerial performer in his assessment of the cabinet in 2004. A lot of people were duped by this corrupting trio. I endured at least three years of torment from McKennariey and Doyle, who lied to the Public Works Committee over what I said--</Hansard-Body>

Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I withdraw it. I endured at least three years of torment from McKennariey and Doyle, who told untruths to the Public Works Committee over what I said in the Strangers Bar to McKennariey. They leaked confidential reports that I had never seen, briefed journalists with untruths and sent out bogus greeting messages purporting them to come from me. They tried to mislead the CJC, rang up talkback radio to condemn me, and all manner of threats came my way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061739"></A>
Recently I have been advised that McKennariey had a long association with the works department that came to an end when his lack of honesty saw him shown the door. All sorts of stories have come to light of his parties where he would ply public servants with booze and strippers and so on. His recent threats to Michael McKenna, from the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
, about suing me show how delusional he is. Here is a man who gave evidence on condition of indemnity against someone who had been a co-conspirator. He is someone who plays both sides of the political fence, who is dishonest to the core but who still suggests he should be able to carry on working for this government--not while I am breathing, Mr Speaker. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (4.53 pm): Clause 187 deals with the functions of the Water Commission in relation to the provisions of this bill. As members will recall from listening to the second reading debate, the proposal contained in this bill is to appoint the Water Commission--a body set up here in South-East Queensland to address a water crisis that was caused by this government--to a role of oversight of the underground water issues in the gas fields as the coal seam gas industry develops. That power is given to the Water Commission under this particular clause, clause 187. The way the legislation does that is to insert a new section 345 to do with the functions of the commission in which paragraph (b) states that powers of the commission shall be extended to ‘the functions given to the commission under chapter 3’. Chapter 3 of the bill adds a new part to the Water Act. So the oversight role of all of the functions that are listed in the new chapter 3 of the Water Act which is contained in this bill is given by clause 187 to the Water Commission--a body, as I said, that was set up here in South-East Queensland to deal with the water crisis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065511"></A>
I well remember when the Water Commission was set up. I said at the time in a debate in this House that the Water Commission was simply a political foil. It was a political shield. It was an organisation that was set up to shield the government from the responsibility that was rightly theirs--the responsibility for the water crisis that was engaging so much of our time and effort as regulators and legislators and so much of the attention of the people of South-East Queensland. So a political ploy was used by the then Premier to shield the government from that responsibility, from that attention, and part of that political ploy was to set up this body called the Water Commission. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065513"></A>
Over the years that have passed since then, there has been many an occasion when I have commented on the roles and activities and achievements, or more particularly the lack of achievements, of the Water Commission in this House. The amount of money that the Water Commission absorbs in running costs every year has also been part of a number of discussions in this House. So in recent weeks I have made it very public that we in the LNP believe that this is an organisation totally unsuited to the oversight role of those functions that are contained in the new chapter 3 of the Water Act--the substantive changes introduced to the management of underground water in those gas field areas. I need not remind members that that is a particularly sensitive issue causing a particular degree of community concern at the moment. That community concern is not allayed in any way by the proposal of this government to appoint the Water Commission here in Brisbane to an oversight role of the new framework that this bill introduces. No-one can blame the people of the gas fields community for having doubts about how effective such an organisation would be in that oversight role. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065515"></A>
It is, in my view, a ludicrous proposition. I said so at the time when it was first announced by the minister, and I say it again here in the parliament today. It is a ludicrous proposition to appoint the Queensland Water Commission--a body that was set up as a political foil a number of years ago to shield the government from political responsibilities for a water crisis--to an oversight role of what is without doubt the most sensitive issue in Queensland at the moment. A number of members in the second reading debate referred to the extent of community concern, the community angst, the community fear in a lot of cases. It is a huge problem. It is a huge issue for those individuals, for those communities and for all of the organisations that represent them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065518"></A>
To suggest that that concern and that anger is going to be allayed by the appointment of the Water Commission to an oversight role of the framework that this bill puts in place is ludicrous and absurd. I have suggested that we in the parliament should appoint a statutory authority that can be seen to be independent from the government, that can be seen to be answerable to nobody but this parliament, that can have the authority that is necessary to seek the information and have the oversight role that is so essential to give the confidence that is required to those people who are suffering under the burden of that concern throughout the Darling Downs and throughout the gas field communities at this time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069603"></A>
I believe that is an essential part of making this legislation work. It is an essential requirement to turn around the community engagement disaster that is undoubtedly out there in those communities. If this government is going to recover some of the community confidence it has lost because of its slowness to act and because of the degree to which it lagged behind the industry in implementing the necessary regulation and legislation--if it is going to recover any of that ground--then the government needs to reconsider the appointment of the Water Commission. The government needs to reconsider clause 187 that provides that oversight role to the commission.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069604"></A>
The parliament needs to take decisive action to address this very real problem, just as many members indicated in their speeches during the second reading debate. The only effective way to fix that problem of all-consuming community concern is to ensure that the body that oversees these provisions is not just independent of government but also seen to be independent of government and seen to have the authority that it needs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069605"></A>
I believe that we need to give those communities some involvement--almost some ownership--in the roles that the commission is assigned under the later provisions of the bill. I am not suggesting that the statutory authority should be made up of completely local people, but local community leaders should be appointed to some of the positions on the statutory authority. The statutory authority should be made up of a range of people with management experience and expertise, but most importantly there should be an opportunity for community leaders from those areas to be part of that commission and part of that oversight role. The people involved could be one or more of the local mayors, leaders of landholder groups, leaders of industry groups or people like that. They could be people who know the area, people who know the issues, people who know the concerns of the community and people who can give their own communities confidence that they will represent them on that statutory authority which would have the oversight role that is so important to make this framework effective.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069607"></A>
As I said in my contribution during the second reading debate on this bill, this government is genuinely attempting to do what it should have done some time ago. There is a genuine effort to try to catch up, if you like, on its responsibilities. The intent of this legislation reflects a genuineness on the part of the government to address these concerns, but that intent is going to be lost. Those efforts are much less likely to succeed unless the minister heeds the message I am giving him today during the consideration of clause 187. Unless the minister and members of the government understand the extent to which it is essential that this oversight body is independent of the government, is seen to be independent of the government and is able to provide opportunities for community leaders to be involved, then the rest of the government’s efforts will not achieve the outcomes we all want to see. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069608"></A>
The option that is open to me is to oppose this clause because it does assign those powers to the commission. I oppose the clause, foreshadowing that we will be moving an amendment to replace it if our opposition now is successful.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As the member for Callide has said, the bill amends the Water Act to establish a new role for the independent Queensland Water Commission in the assessment and management of the risks of regional impacts on groundwater levels from coal seam gas production. I think it is useful to remind the member that the commission was established as a statutory body under section 342 of the Water Act. Section 343 and 343A of that act--and these are important sections to note when looking at the standing of the Water Commission--provide that, whilst the commission represents the state, it is not subject to direction by an entity of or representing the state, thereby ensuring its independence.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069612"></A>
So the point of difference between our preferred model and what is being put forward by the member for Callide narrows substantially when you consider that the Water Commission was established as a statutory authority and is not subject to ministerial direction. It has that level of independence. That is why I believe it is a ready-made body that can do the necessary work that the member for Callide seeks in his alternative statutory authority. By building on the already established commission--an existing statutory authority with water expertise--it avoids, in my view, the need to establish an additional water body and provides an opportunity to focus on the implementation of the new functions rather than starting from taws and establishing a new statutory authority with its corporate governance arrangements.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069613"></A>
We have heard a lot in the debate over the last three days about how long it has allegedly taken us to put in place new laws, regulations and bodies. Going down the path that the member for Callide seeks to go down would add to the frustration that he claims the landholders have suffered as a result of the government allegedly not moving quick enough. We have an existing independent authority in place that can and is getting out there now on the ground doing the necessary work.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069615"></A>
Expansion of the functions of the commission delivers reduced establishment costs, which is something that has been mentioned by members opposite repeatedly during this debate. It will expedite the implementation of the new groundwater management regime while meeting the requirement for independence. The commission has the organisational capability to establish new specified scientific skill sets. It has a high level of independence to ensure recommendations on accumulative groundwater impacts are fair and reasonable. To ensure further independence, activities relating to the groundwater regime are structured within a separate work unit in the commission, supported by an officer at Senior Executive Service level. This will ensure the appropriate level of administrative and project management is applied and industry interaction is undertaken at a very senior level.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069616"></A>
The commission has moved quickly to build capacity to carry out this new role. The commission has filled two lead positions--a general manager to lead the team and a director of policy and projects. The officers are technically qualified and highly experienced in groundwater management and regulation. Three other experienced groundwater specialists are now in place and permanent appointment processes will be completed next month. Three other positions have been established to support policy and business functions, and one position has already been filled on a permanent basis. So we have moved quickly to provide the Queensland Water Commission with the resources and technically qualified staff to conduct the work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069618"></A>
By using the established structure of the QWC and its recognised independence as a statutory body, we have gone a long way towards meeting, in my view, the concerns of the member for Callide. Rather than offering an alternative structure that represents a significant gulf between the government’s position and that of the opposition, as I have explained, that gulf narrows quite significantly when you take a considered view of what the QWC already provides and what it provides in terms of its independence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069655"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It disappoints me greatly that the minister is determined to persist with the course of action that he had decided upon before bringing this bill before the House. It disappoints me greatly that, from his comments, he is not able to understand the significance of the alternative that I am suggesting. As I said, the option open to me in the parliamentary process is now to oppose this clause because this is the clause that, as I indicated, appoints the Water Commission as the oversight body for all of those powers that are contained in the new chapter that is to be added to the Water Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069658"></A>
I think the minister failed in his response to understand the necessity for that body to be seen as being independent from the government. It does not really matter how the structure is interpreted legally with regard to the ability of the minister to direct the commission, which the minister explained in his response to my first contribution to the consideration of this clause. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069659"></A>
The legalities of the situation do not really matter in this particular case. It is about the perception in the community. It is about the way that this will be seen. It is about the way that the Water Commission will be seen given its political history, given it was a political decision, given it was a political strategy to set up the Water Commission at the time and given the fact that the Water Commission over those intervening years has been a political player here in South-East Queensland in the water issue. It is impossible for me to see that that Water Commission will ever be accepted as an independent body able to oversee the framework that has been put in place by this bill in a way that can give the community the confidence that I believe they deserve. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069664"></A>
It is even more impossible to see how that is going to succeed given that the commission will be starting its work and this legislation will start its implementation from a position where there is already an enormous degree of community upset and there is already an enormous degree of community concern. There is an incredible amount of community distrust. The community at the moment do not trust anyone. They do not believe anything, it seems to me at times, and yet the minister is going to seriously ask that community to believe that this politicised Water Commission can serve as an independent overseer of the framework that this bill puts in place. It is nonsense. It is ludicrous. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069666"></A>
I understand the realities of this place and I understand that this clause will stand as part of the legislation. But I would like for the minister to give some assurances that there will be some sort of community reference group, some sort of community reference panel and there will be a commitment from him at the very top that it is at least his intention that the Water Commission will engage as closely as possible with the community in some sort of formal structured way so we do not just have a vague commitment to consultation or we do not have some vague commitment or vague assurance that they will be listening. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069668"></A>
Can the minister give us an assurance that there will be a formal structured system of engagement so that at least there is a community consultation committee that meets regularly, that the commission is required to meet with regularly, that the commission is required to consult with, that the commission is required to take advice from? So lacking the outcome that I would have liked in defeating the provisions of this clause and seeking to amend the legislation to replace it with a statutory authority appointed by this parliament, can the minister give me some assurances at least that the structure that he puts in place will have a formal engagement process with the community? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069669"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am happy to respond to the member for Callide. On 23 August this year we announced that the Surat Basin landholders will have a strong voice on new high-level consultative committees being established to progress coal seam gas related issues. We are creating the Surat Basin coal seam gas consultative committee. The head of that committee will be former AgForce chair John Cotter. As well, there will be two local district committees for Dalby and Roma. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069673"></A>
These new consultative committees are being established to formalise discussions already underway between the government and companies and communities in the Surat Basin. They will ensure that the community, industry and government have an ongoing and high-level capability to consult and progress coal seam gas related issues. The Water Commission will be a member of the new coal seam gas consultative committees. It will provide an opportunity for the commission to explain its activities to local community members and to hear the views in relation to those activities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069676"></A>
Section 360C of the Water Act also provides the commission with the ability to establish advisory bodies it considers appropriate to give the commission advice on the performance of its functions. To provide quality assurance for the community in relation to their coal seam gas related functions, the commission and DERM will have key technical matters reviewed by an expert panel. The commission and the department are in the process of forming a scientific advisory panel in consultation with Commonwealth agencies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069677"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I was aware of that press release when I raised the issue with the minister. However, what concerns me is the lack of any formal requirement in the legislation or any sort of formal requirement in the appointment of the commission with regard to the engagement of those bodies. Across regional Queensland especially we have seen plenty of examples where organisations are formed but they become meaningless. Organisations are formed that sound good and they are given very important sounding names, but the real issue is how much involvement they have. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069678"></A>
What concerned me when I read the press release that the minister referred to was that what we were seeing was another situation where a similar example may come to pass. We would have the community consultation committee formed. We would have the expert panel formed but without any guarantee of a formal engagement process, without any guarantee of a formal requirement for the oversight body--in this case the Water Commission--to engage in any set way with those community bodies. That is my concern. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069680"></A>
There is nothing in the appointment of the commission to the roles in this bill, in this clause. There is nothing later on in the legislation--in new part 3--that gives me any comfort in that regard. We are being asked to trust the Water Commission itself, I would suggest. The minister indicated earlier that he contends at least that there is a degree of independence. I would not suggest that the power of instruction is there. I would not suggest from the comments made earlier by the minister that he would believe that the power of instruction is there to instruct the Water Commissioner and to instruct the Water Commission to ensure that there is that level of engagement with those bodies that are being formed. I would have liked to have seen in the legislation some reference to those entities. I would have liked to have seen some formalisation of the responsibility that the commission has not just to consult but to advise and to make information available and to take notice of those opportunities for community input that are being set up in the formation of those community consultation committees and the expert committee. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069684"></A>
Once again I say that I am aware of the realities of this parliament. The structure will be set up as the minister indicated. I will oppose this clause because I think it is not the best option. I oppose the clause foreshadowing, as I said before, an amendment that I would have moved had I been successful in changing the wording of this clause to ensure that there was a statutory authority formed that was appointed by this parliament and answerable to this parliament and very clearly independent of the government and very clearly independent of any ministerial direction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073723"></A>
I believe that a statutory authority would have given those communities a lot more confidence. It would have given the opportunity for the community leaders in those areas to be involved and to be part of that statutory authority in a much more direct way. I would have given that statutory authority some very defined powers and a much greater involvement in the oversight of the framework. I would not suggest that the statutory authority should seek to duplicate the roles of the department, but I would suggest that, given that the issues we are dealing with are so contentious and so complex--as we saw in the debate here in the House, few people understand the complexity of the issues--that reinforces the need for a high-level statutory authority that should have been appointed to this role that is being given to the Water Commission in clause 187. I will oppose clause 187. I will oppose the appointment that it makes of the Water Commission to that role, and I do so foreshadowing that I would have moved an amendment to replace it with a statutory authority that would be a lot more suitable.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073728"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Just very briefly, and respecting the right of the member to oppose the clause--and that will obviously be decided one way or the other--the member, however, does make a useful point that I am prepared to give consideration to, and that is whether those consultative bodies that I outlined should receive recognition in legislation to give them a status that gives confidence to the community so that, as the member says, they are not just being set up for the short term. As the member well knows, we debate these omnibus bills on a fairly regular basis. I would envisage that I will be coming back in the new year with another one, and I will use that opportunity to give consideration to that suggestion of perhaps hard-wiring those consultative bodies or recognising them in legislation.</Hansard-Body>

 Water and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, explanatory notes to Mr Seeney’s amendments [<HypertextLink>
<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=5310T3677" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL">3677</A></HypertextLink>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073743"></A>
I move those four amendments together because they all relate to the underground water impact plans. Division 2 of clause 195 sets up this planning instrument called an underground water impact report. It is, as I indicated in my speech during the second reading debate, a very essential part of the framework that the government is putting in place to manage the impacts of the underground water extractions in this particular area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073745"></A>
These underground water impact reports are in fact the essential instrument that makes the whole framework work. So it is important that we look at the structure of the underground water impact reports and ensure that they are suitable for the considerable task. I think the minister would agree that these underground water impact reports are an essential part of the framework. They are an essential part of the framework that the bill puts in place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073747"></A>
Throughout clause 195 in division 2 there are some quite detailed definitions. It begins with defining the obligation to provide the underground water impact report. Proposed new section 371 defines when that obligation is triggered, proposed new section 372 defines the obligation to give the notice of closure in a situation where a tenement is being closed and proposed new section 376 deals with the content of the underground water impact report.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077815"></A>
My amendment No. 1 proposes to add to that content. The amendment proposes to add another requirement in relation to the content. The content that is required in an underground water impact report as it stands in the bill is quite extensive, and so it should be. The content as it stands includes, for the area to which the report relates, the quantity of water produced or taken from the area and an estimate of the quantity of water to be produced or taken because of the exercise of the relevant underground water rights; then for each aquifer affected or likely to be affected by the exercise of the relevant underground water rights, a description of the aquifer, an analysis of the movement of underground water to and from the aquifer, including how the aquifer interacts with other aquifers, and an analysis of the trends in water level change for the aquifer because of the exercise of the rights.</Hansard-Body>

I think it is very important that people understand what those words mean. Essentially, they are asking for some very detailed information. They are asking for information that a lot of people stand up and say that we need and that we should stop the industry somehow until this information is available. They fail to understand the extent of the requirements that are in this process--the requirement to provide that sort of information, the requirement to provide an analysis of the aquifers, a description of the aquifers and an analysis of the movement of the underground water to and from the aquifer, including how the aquifer interacts with other aquifers. They are easy words to say, but it is an incredibly complex task to establish. All of the people who have expressed concern about those interaquifer transfer issues, both in this debate in the past couple of days and in the community over the past couple of months, should take some comfort from the fact that that is an essential requirement of what is the main planning instrument of the framework that this bill puts in place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077818"></A>
As I said, amendment No. 1 proposes the inclusion of a new section (da) to include in that requirement an estimate of the likely decline in the level and quality of water in each bore and a determination of the sustainable yield of each bore. I think the concept of a sustainable yield is missing from the provisions of the bill. There is no requirement to measure the sustainable yield of a bore in any circumstance in this bill. All the measurement that is required is based on a simple water level measurement in the bore. I think that that does not go far enough. There should be some sort of measurement of the yield of the bore, because that is what is important to the owner of the bore. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077819"></A>
I know in the discussions that I have had about this issue that there are issues about defining what a sustainable yield means and there are issues of definition and there are issues about the test that would need to be applied before a yield would be considered to be sustainable. There could easily be a lot of argument about that. But some attempt to determine a sustainable yield is a lot better than no attempt at all. Some indication of the sustainable yield, some test that could be replicated at a later date to measure the difference in the yield, would be a valuable inclusion. So that is the reason for my first amendment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077820"></A>
The second amendment seeks to amend the requirements for a water monitoring strategy, which is part of the requirement of this planning document. Proposed section 378 provides for the content of a water monitoring strategy. I suggest in this amendment that a new subsection 2A be added to ensure that a water monitoring strategy must also include a plan for minimising the impacts of the exercise of underground water rights in the area to which the report relates, including clear indications about how a proponent is going to minimise the quantity of water to be produced or taken because of the exercise of the underground water rights and the proponent’s plans to prevent pollution or damage to the aquifers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077822"></A>
To those members who recall, in my contribution to the seconding debate I explained in some detail the difference between water rights that are granted under the Water Act and water rights that are available--they are not actually granted--to tenure holders under the petroleum and gas act. As I indicated then, the entitlement to take water under the petroleum and gas act is only an entitlement to take water as a consequence of extracting the petroleum or the gas. It is not a stand-alone right, if you like. There is no statement in either the petroleum and gas act or this bill before the House that clearly addresses what should be an essential responsibility of any tenure holder who takes water under those conditions. It is not a right to take water on its own; it is a right to take water as a consequence of extracting the resource. That should be recognised in a clear statement that requires the tenure holder to do what is reasonably possible to minimise that take. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077825"></A>
Similarly, the second part of that amendment requires a plan to prevent pollution or other damage to the aquifers. I also know--and the minister may well indicate--that that issue is probably dealt with by the environmental authority that the tenure holder would have, but I believe that it is valuable to also make it clear in this legislation that there is a clear obligation, there is an overriding obligation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077826"></A>
The third amendment deals with that part of the clause that provides the circumstances for approval of that essential planning instrument by the chief executive. The bill as it stands allows the chief executive to either approve it or to require additional conditions. There is no stated section in that clause that indicates specifically that the chief executive has the power, or the obligation, or the responsibility to refuse to approve an underground water impact plan. That is what my third amendment seeks to do--to insert that provision into the bill to make it clear that the chief executive should have the clear power to refuse to approve the report if the report indicates that there would be excessive hardship caused to the owner of the land, or the impaired capacity of existing water bores cannot reasonably be made good. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077827"></A>
The fourth amendment is simply to change a word in subsection 4. The amendment is to change the word ‘may’ to ‘must’ so that it reads that the chief executive must confer with the commission rather than may. It is a change of a single word but I think it reinforces the view that I was expressing before that the role of the commission has to be seen to have some integrity and some power. </Hansard-Body>

Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As the member for Callide probably noted, I was conferring with my officials, particularly in relation to his contribution with respect to sustainable yield. There is no disagreement in terms of what the member is saying. It was their intention, in terms of the guidelines that they were to issue following the passage of this bill, that that would be contained in a guideline. Having again listened to your argument--and I am not being churlish at all when I say this--I respect your argument but I do not want to agree to your amendment because I think that, whilst your argument to me has merit, I would want to take the opportunity to have it considered by experts. I just checked. There will be another WOLA bill early next year. To give the member due respect in terms of his argument, I will give a commitment that, in addition to containing sustainable yield as part of a guideline or practice note that would be developed following the passage of this, I would be prepared to put an amendment such as you are proposing to the department for analysis and recommendation in the development of WOLA next year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082092"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the minister for that. I hope that we will see the fulfilment of that here in the House in time to come. I will be gratified by that. I am not about playing politics with these things; I am genuinely concerned to get an outcome that will produce the end result that I think we all want. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082093"></A>
The other issue that I would revisit, that the minister may not have fully appreciated given that he was consulting, is the issue of the chief executive refusing to approve the report. As I indicated, the provisions of the clause have two parts. They anticipate the situation where the chief executive would either approve the report or send the report back and require additional conditions to be met. It strikes me that there should be a specific section that makes it clear that the chief executive can refuse to approve the report in particular circumstances. The wording I have used in my amendment is put forward as a suggestion. That is the sort of thing that I think should be clearly stated, to make it very clear that the chief executive can refuse to approve a report if it does cause excessive hardship to the owner of the land or if the activities that are anticipated in the report do cause impaired capacity for existing water bores that cannot reasonably be made good. Otherwise, I think there is an inherent impression--if you like an assumption--in the wording of the legislation that the report has to be approved by the chief executive. I do not think that is the reality, I might add. From the way the legislation has been drafted I do not think that is the reality; however, I think that is the impression that is given by the way it is worded and by the lack of a third alternative in that particular section. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082094"></A>
I would suggest to the minister that, once again, we are dealing with a situation where people who are concerned about this legislation do have a tendency to be distrustful--understandably so given the situation that they have ended up in or given the point that this whole situation has arrived at. I suggest to the House that there is a requirement for a new section 1A to be added at page 148 after line 5 to ensure it is made very clear that the chief executive not only has the right to not approve a report but also must not approve a report if it does cause excessive hardship to the owner of the land and if the impaired capacity that is identified, or the potential impaired capacity that is identified, in that report cannot reasonably be made good. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082095"></A>
There is a lot of doubt about the make-good provision, as I indicated in my second reading contribution. It is a new concept in the laws that govern the management of land and water. It is a concept that, as some members on this side of the House have said--not me--sounds good but will be very difficult to apply in practice and could become very complicated. I do not disagree with that. I think we have to ensure that any make-good provisions that are accepted in this approvals process have a reasonable chance of being fulfilled, that they have a reasonable chance of making good the impairment that is their very purpose. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082096"></A>
I think the way to address that is to have a very clear statement that the chief executive does have the responsibility, the power and a clearly defined option in the legislation to refuse to approve the underground water impact plan if that impaired capacity cannot be reasonably made good. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082097"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The advice that I have been provided with is that this is not a matter for the underground water impact report. The underground water impact report is about identifying risks arising from the extraction of groundwater. This report does not specifically deal with the make-good provisions. That is a matter dealt with separately through the make-good process by requiring the controlling tenure holder to undertake baseline bore assessments followed by bore assessments on a case-by-case basis with landholders. That is the advice provided by my officers. Again, because I genuinely believe that we do have a shared commitment to get this right, I will nevertheless, as part of the development of WOLA 2011, review your suggestion and that will either confirm that advice or deal with it appropriately through that process. </Hansard-Body>

(ii)	the sustainable yield of the bores.’.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent4>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082127"></A>
I will not labour the point here, because the essential concept is the one that we spoke about at the beginning. The essential concept is the requirement to establish some sort of sustainable yield from the bores. That concept is being applied here in a different situation, which is the requirement for baseline assessments rather than the definition of the termination of impaired capacity, which is in another part of the bill. As I said in my earlier contribution, the concept of a sustainable yield should be included. The minister has indicated that he will investigate that and I appreciate that. I believe he is genuine in that. I will be interested to see what the response from the department is. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082128"></A>
I move these two amendments because they seek to change the requirements that are part of the baseline assessment process that is set down in the bill. They seek to increase the information that is required and, in my view, improve the information that is required to be compiled as part of that baseline assessment. While I will not labour the point, and I probably will not contest the point, I think it is a worthwhile exercise to put the amendments on the record and to indicate that the concepts involved are in relation to that sustainable yield question and the recognition of that as a requirement in this process as in the earlier one. </Hansard-Body>

These amendments deal with part 4 and part 5 of clause 195. It is somewhat complex. Part 4 and part 5 deal with the section of the clause that relates to, firstly, the general agreements about water bores--the obligation to negotiate a general agreement--and, secondly, in part 5, the make-good obligations for water bores and the obligation that the bill imposes in requiring people to enter into those make-good obligations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082134"></A>
One particular concept has been brought to my attention. From listening to some of the contributions in the second reading debate of this bill, it is obvious that this has been brought to the attention of some other members in this House as well. It is that the rights and remedies under other legal instruments may or may not be affected by this bill and, more particularly, by the make-good provisions. The concern that has been expressed to me is that a particular person’s access to civil action or to common law rights may well be called into question because of the make-good obligations in this bill. It is a fair point, knowing the complexity of some of the arguments that lawyers get into. Without wanting to cast any ill will on any of the lawyers in the House, from a layman’s point of view lawyers can argue about pedantic nonsense. Therefore, it is worthwhile to raise this issue and to seek to have it rectified. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082135"></A>
Again, it is in a very similar vein to the views I expressed before. We have to always remember the situation in which we are operating. We have to be very aware of the background against which this bill is being considered. It is a background of distrust and it is a background of a high degree of community concern. I understand perfectly that people are going to ask these questions and are going to require these reassurances. I believe the best way to provide that reassurance is to make a very definitive statement, such as the one that I have included in amendment No. 8, which requires the insertion of a new subsection 405A dealing with other rights or remedies not affected. The amendment states very clearly--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1082138"></A>
This part does not affect or limit a civil right or remedy existing at common law or otherwise.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1082139"></A>
That statement is taken from the Mineral Resources Act. It is clearly stated in the Mineral Resources Act that the particular section of that act does not limit or affect a civil right or remedy existing at common law or otherwise. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086393"></A>
The real question, I suspect, exercising the minds of people who are concerned about this is: why is that definitive statement made in the Mineral Resources Act but not made in this particular bill, which seeks to insert this new concept into the Water Act. As I said before, we are dealing here with some new legal concepts. They are certainly new in relation to the legal framework that surrounds the administration of land and water. Without having an encyclopedic knowledge of the subject, I suspect that they are new concepts in law. They are certainly new concepts to landholders. They are new concepts to the legal practitioners who advise landholders. This make-good obligation is certainly a new concept in relation to water, as I explained in quite some detail earlier in this debate. It is a new concept and how it is going to be interpreted, how it is going to be enacted and what consequential effects the make-good obligation may have are all genuine questions. They are all genuine concerns that we need to turn our mind to. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086401"></A>
In posing these questions, I think it is worthwhile reinforcing the point that I also made in my speech in the second reading debate that these pieces of legislation can be amended. We have a sufficient degree of common purpose in this parliament to give the assurance that they will be amended if they need to be amended to achieve the intent that I think is clear. I seek to move this amendment in relation to inserting a new section 405A to endeavour to give comfort, if you like, or give assurance to people who are concerned about it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086402"></A>
I also seek to move amendment No. 9. It deals with a different concept and is a different change but to the same part of the bill. The part of the bill that it deals with generates the obligation to negotiate a general agreement. The general agreement is a requirement in a situation where the planning instrument that we were talking about before--the underground water impact plan--has not been put in place. Section 406 creates that obligation to negotiate the general agreement and the obligation applies to each petroleum tenure holder. Subsection (1)(b) states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086403"></A>
Until an underground water impact report applies to the holder’s petroleum tenure.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1086404"></A>
Subsection (2) states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086405"></A>
For each water bore the holder reasonably believes has an impaired capacity, the holder must use the holder’s best endeavours to negotiate and enter into an agreement with the bore owner--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1086406"></A>
And that is with regard to the impaired capacity and the make-good obligations that I have spoken about and that I would hope by now that members would be familiar with. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086407"></A>
The difficulty that I have with that particular part of the clause is that the requirement to have a reasonable belief about the bore’s impaired capacity rests with the tenure holder. I do not think that is the way it should be. This particular part of the clause provides for the tenure holder to reach a reasonable belief that the bore has an impaired capacity. That clearly in my mind should be the province of the bore owner. In this situation where the major planning instrument that this legislation puts in place has not yet been prepared--and there are a range of situations where that is the case--the bill provides a time period of 14 months to conduct that planning exercise and that is fair enough. Even once this legislation is fully implemented, there may be other situations where there is a bore in an area where there is no underground water impact plan. It is puzzling to me why that particular part of the clause provides that it is the tenure holder who has to arrive at a reasonable belief that there is an impaired capacity before the problem which obviously belongs to the bore owner is addressed. The amendment that I seek to move shifts that requirement to reach a reasonable belief from the tenure holder to the bore owner. It should be the landowner obviously. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086408"></A>
If the landowner has a reasonable belief that his bore has an impaired capacity--if the landowner has a reasonable belief that his bore has been affected by the operations of the tenure holder--then that obligation to make an agreement should apply. There should not be any argument about it. In this situation the tenure holder should just reach the agreement until such time as all of that analysis that I was talking about before, which is part and parcel of the underground water management plan, is able to be conducted and the true picture of the situation arrived at. I do not believe that we need a situation where the landowners, the bore owners, are at the mercy or the behest of the tenure holders arriving at that reasonable belief. The onus should be on the tenure holder to address the problem. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will deal with that matter first. You mentioned that your argument is based on legal advice or views from a lawyer that have been brought to your attention. I understand that that lawyer may be a Mr Peter Shannon from Shannon Donaldson Province Lawyers. I recall reading an article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Country Life</Hansard-Italic>
 that was authored by Mr Shannon where he put forward those points. I asked my department to contact Mr Shannon and work through those issues, because I thought some of the arguments were certainly interesting and needed to be followed through. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086416"></A>
The director-general, I think, has spoken to Mr Shannon but at the very least has written to him. I will table that letter. As I said, the director-general has written to Shannon solicitors re their concerns that amendments to the Water Act will replace requirements in the Environmental Protection Act. We sought our own legal advice and Crown Law advice has indicated that the make-good provisions will not displace the water quality provisions of the Environmental Protection Act. The letter that Mr Shannon has been sent from the director-general states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086420"></A>
There will be a clear delineation between the subject matter of the <Hansard-Italic>
Water Act 2000</Hansard-Italic>
 as amended by the WOLA Bill and the provisions of the <Hansard-Italic>
Environmental Protection Act 1994</Hansard-Italic>
. The specific regulatory framework under the <Hansard-Italic>
Water Act 2000</Hansard-Italic>
 dealing with underground water extraction impacts on water supply bores is in addition to the broader environmental regulatory framework for petroleum activities under the <Hansard-Italic>
Environmental Protection Act 1994</Hansard-Italic>
. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086452"></A>
Therefore the WOLA Bill provisions will not displace or override the regulatory provisions of the <Hansard-Italic>

 in relation to impacts of petroleum activities, including coal seam gas activities, on underground water. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

To ensure that the above intention is clear, I understand the Minister will specifically address the issue in the Parliamentary debate on the WOLA Bill in the Legislative Assembly. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

In relation to amendment No. 9, from my reading of that amendment and from listening to the member for Callide, I think the principle that has been espoused is correct so I do not have any issue with that. To be consistent with what I said before, I offer the member my commitment that that principle--whether it is espoused in the words that he articulated in this amendment or a variation thereof--will receive very serious consideration in the next iteration of WOLA. As the member for Callide said, it makes sense that a bore owner should be able to lodge a complaint or a concern about the possible impact on his or her bore by a holder of a tenement and make those concerns known to that holder. As I said, I support the principle and we will look at that very seriously. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the minister for that. On the basis of the assurances the minister has given us with regard to the effect or otherwise on civil rights or common law rights and the assurance he has given on the other amendment with regard to the requirement to reach a reasonable belief, I will not divide on my amendments. In relation to amendment No. 9, the concept behind that amendment needs to be held off until such time as the minister considers that in the department. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086460"></A>
As the minister indicated, the fair way to exercise that particular clause, to me at least, is to give the owner of the bore the requirement to achieve a reasonable belief before that obligation is triggered. I will not pursue the issue further. I anticipate a response to that particular issue, as with the other issues, early next year.</Hansard-Body>

Anyone who has listened to this debate over the last couple of days--indeed, anyone who has engaged with the stakeholders over the last month or so--will know that these amendments, especially amendments Nos 11 and 12, deal with a somewhat contentious issue. This issue has been mentioned a number of times during the second reading debate by people who obviously have engaged with the stakeholders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086466"></A>
The amendments seek to address this issue of the definition of an impaired capacity and the characteristics of the bore that trigger that definition. In the bill as it stands, there is a necessary requirement for there to be a decline in the water level of the bore before the definition of an impaired capacity can be invoked. So, in practical terms, a bore cannot be considered to have an impaired capacity and therefore trigger the requirement for a make-good obligation unless there is a fall in the water level. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086468"></A>
The argument that has been very passionately put with quite a degree of complexity by a number of people is that we should anticipate a situation whereby a bore may well have an impaired capacity because of a water quality issue without there being a decline in the water level. That is the crux of the concern that has been generated by this particular part of clause 195. This is an essential concept and it is an important part of the definition because the process of getting a declaration of an impaired capacity is critical to instigating the obligation to begin negotiations about a make-good agreement. Unless that definition is right and unless landholders can be confident that the definition will cover all of the eventualities they see, then very understandably a degree of doubt will be created in the minds of the landholders about how effective the whole framework will be in practice.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086473"></A>
I do not believe there is any downside to changing this definition. A body of opinion and views have been expressed to me that it is not possible for effects of coal seam gas extraction to be made apparent on a bore without there being a fall in the water level. To clarify what I mean, nobody has ever suggested to me that it is not possible for coal seam gas extraction to have an impact on a bore--I think that is anticipated to some extent, and that is certainly the reason for this legislation--but it has been put to me by technical people with a professional understanding of the whole process that any impact that coal seam gas extraction may have would certainly involve a fall in water level. They make a convincing argument when they go through the technical details of how gas wells work and how they will affect water bores if they do affect them. However, once again, that is only half of the issue. It is not really the essential point. The essential point of this legislation, as I have indicated when discussing a number of amendments, is ensuring that the stakeholders who will be affected by this legislation have a degree of confidence in it and will be able to trust the provisions of the legislation to address the issues they foresee.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086476"></A>
An atmosphere of heightened anxiety exists and an atmosphere of distrust obviously exists for the reasons we have discussed in this parliament. Because of the government’s slowness to react, because of the fact that there has been this vacuum as this industry has developed, because the development on the ground has outpaced the government’s ability to introduce regulation and administrative controls--because of all of those things--we have a heightened degree of anxiety and an unquestionable atmosphere of distrust. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086477"></A>
I understand completely that in that sort of atmosphere people want to make sure that every eventuality is catered for. Therefore, I think it is reasonable that this definition be amended in the way I have suggested in both of these amendments. The reason there are two amendments is that the definition applies in two different parts of the legislation. Because of the way the bill is written, it applies to existing bores and it applies again to new bores. Even though there are two amendments, they essentially do the same thing to different parts of the legislation. They amend that definition to ensure that there is no prerequisite for a fall in water level for a bore to meet the requirement to be seen as having an impaired capacity.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090992"></A>
I think that is reasonable. There is no down side. There is nothing that I can see that would mitigate against including that in the definition. If somehow a bore suffers reduced water quality through some mechanism that is completely unanticipated then that bore is seen to have an impaired capacity and therefore comes within the provisions of the rest of the bill and a make-good arrangement can be negotiated and the compensation provisions that we have spoken about at some length all come into play. If that first definition is called into question then it is understandable that stakeholders and landholders come to doubt the rest of the process that depends upon it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090994"></A>
That is simply all those amendments do. They ensure that a drop in quality on its own is enough to ensure that a bore is able to be seen as having an impaired capacity, as it obviously would in real terms. If there was a drop in water quality it would have an impaired capacity, every bit as much as if there was a drop in the total supply caused by a fall in the water level in the aquifer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090995"></A>
I commend the amendments to the minister. I think it is a genuine concern that is genuinely held by a number of people. I think it can be very easily fixed without any down side. It can be fixed by amending that definition in the way that I seek to do with these amendments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Again, I shall commit myself to giving further consideration to this. In the advice that I have just been provided with by my officials they make an important point. Water quality issues are already comprehensively covered by the Environmental Protection Act. This is where, as the member knows, it gets a bit technical in the drafting of clauses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090998"></A>
If we were to go down this path we would have to find a way to reference the existing provisions of the Environmental Protection Act in relation to water quality so that we do not duplicate or set up some new regime for assessing water quality. It would be purely a drafting issue. That is why I would need to take this away and have a bit of a think about it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090999"></A>
Again, I commit to giving these amendments consideration over the coming months. They are just some preliminary things that we would need to work through. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091000"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 While I appreciate the minister’s willingness to take these concepts away and consider them, I think this one is sufficiently important that it should have been considered before now. I do not believe that the degree of community concern that has been expressed to me about this particular concept has not been expressed to departmental officers. I just do not believe that that is possible. This has been a very significant issue for a very significant group of people. It really should have been dealt with by now. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091001"></A>
As I said, there is no down side that I can see. I do not accept the suggestion that somehow or other it duplicates what is in an environmental authority. I would suggest that there are a lot of responsibilities in the exercise of an environmental authority that is granted under the EPA that, if not duplicated, are held as well within the body of the legislation that authorises the application of that environmental authority in the first place.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091002"></A>
There are a number of overarching responsibilities in legislation that negate the argument that we should not accept these amendments because there may be some duplication with the environmental authority. If there is, that is not a particularly bad thing. If there is a duplication of a recognition that water quality is an important trigger for the definition of impaired capacity, that is not a particularly bad thing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091003"></A>
I am going to persist with these amendments. I think they should be accepted. I do not see that there is a down side. I think it will address an issue that has undoubtedly been brought to the attention of the department. It has been brought to the attention of a number of members in this House. It has certainly been brought to the attention of me and my office. It is not a very difficult concept to either understand or address. Therefore, I think these amendments should be accepted by the House and we should fix this problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091004"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HORAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would like to support our shadow minister in moving these amendments. In this part of the legislation it is all about the quantity of water and the levels of bores as the trigger for a test for a drop in water quality. I think the two figures were three metres for the Condamine alluvium and five metres for other alluvium. The bores have to drop that much. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091005"></A>
Normally the water being taken for stock and domestic purposes is above the level of the coal seam and below the coal seam is the artesian basin, if it is over the artesian basin. There are areas in the gas fields where the strata are different. I think I am correct in saying that in some areas but not many the water that people are bringing up is actually below the coal seam. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091006"></A>
This is unknown and new and people are concerned about not only the quantity of water they are getting up as measured by the level of the bore if it drops but also the quality of it. The salinity of the water might change and that might make it not palatable for stock. If there ever were to be any contamination from the coal seam--and I am not exactly sure of the technology--very often that water would be too saline for stock. That means it would be over 3,600 parts per million. The salts in it would be the fluorides and bromides, not so much sodium and chloride. That is of concern. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091007"></A>
There are concerns about other chemicals. There is always the possibility of animals getting sick from drinking that water if it were contaminated. What our shadow minister is getting at is that there needs to be a way, other than simply a drop in bore levels, for people to take action if their bore loses quality in terms deliverable amounts of water or the chemical content of that water. There should not just be the one issue of the drop in volume. It might be that cattle shed hair or get scald on their coats because there is something in the water. There needs to be a more comprehensive test, which this amendment seeks to bring forward, so that everything is covered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091008"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will not labour the point. It is apparent that the minister is not going to accept the amendment. I think that is regrettable. I will ask for support from the House in that circumstance. I think the logic of the argument that I have put is undeniable. This is a relatively easy issue to fix and it will address a lot of concern in the community. This parliament should fix it tonight.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1095864"></A>
This final amendment that I want to move is a continuation of a theme that has been consistent throughout the consideration of these amendments and it has actually been consistent throughout the consideration of the entire part of this bill. The actual mechanics of this amendment seek to change subclause 445(2) by deleting (a) and (b). That particular part of the clause deals with the public access to the database that the commission is required to keep and make available to the public. Subclause (2) states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1095865"></A>
However, the publicly available part of the database must not include information obtained as a result of undertaking--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

(c) 	any other information the commission reasonably believes is commercially sensitive.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095869"></A>
The intent of my amendment is to remove (a) and (b) and let (c) remain. The logic behind this amendment is to make the maximum amount of information available from that public database. Once again, I think that is a necessary move to ensure that the public can have confidence in the process and, as I said, it is a continuation of the theme that has been consistent throughout all of the amendments that I have sought to move tonight. I will not repeat the argument in full, but it is important that, if the public is going to have confidence in this process, if the public is going to have confidence in the administrative framework that this legislation puts in place, there is a maximum amount of information available to them. People should be able to see the situation with regard to water levels and water quality across the whole district so that they are able to regain some confidence in the system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095871"></A>
I understand the concept of commercial sensitivity. I know that there will be arguments about the degree of commercial sensitivity of some of the information that is gathered in those baseline assessments and bore assessments, and I understand that in any other circumstance some of that information may be considered to be commercially sensitive. But I think there is a justification here for a trade-off. I think there is a justification to trade off what would normally be considered an acceptable degree of commercial sensitivity with regard to that information with the need for the community at large or a wider group of people in a district to be able to understand what is happening with regard to underground water and aquifers and what impacts are being experienced as a result of the extraction of the coal seam gas.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095874"></A>
So I understand that what I am suggesting is a departure from what probably would be considered normal practice with regard to the commercial sensitivity of some of that information, but I would contend that it is an acceptable trade-off to trade that off to achieve a degree of public confidence in the monitoring system and in the framework that this clause puts into place. Therefore, I have moved that amendment. By way of explanation, the reference to commercial sensitivity would still be there. The clause would then read--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1095877"></A>
However, the publicly available part of the database must not include any information the commission reasonably believes is commercially sensitive.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095878"></A>
That leaves the decision to the commission. It leaves the decision to the commission as to whether any of the information that is gathered in that process is justifiably considered to be so commercially sensitive that it should not be released given that a baseline assessment as mentioned in (a) and a bore assessment as mentioned in (b) will gather a whole range of information. There will be a whole range of information that those two processes that I have explained and that we have gone through as part of this consideration will gather and will bring together on that database. It will not all be commercially sensitive. Nobody would contend that. I do not think anybody would suggest that, but there may well be some things that are commercially sensitive and that, I expect, is why the drafters of this legislation have included (a) and (b) in this particular subclause. My suggestion is to recognise the need for a trade-off and to provide the commission with the authority to make those judgements and to make a judgement about when a trade-off is necessary and to make that judgement in light of the benefits of providing that information widely to the public in an attempt to restore public confidence in the framework system that this legislation puts in place.</Hansard-Body>

Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I think it is fair to say that in the time that I have been a minister--now over 10 years--I have always been sympathetic to the principle of transparency, so I naturally come to such debates with a view that says that more information is better than less. I would suggest that under such circumstances I would normally be attracted to the argument pursued by the member for Callide. But it would seem to me that what is being put forward by the honourable member is that the details or information about individual boreholes, including those of individual irrigators or licence holders, would then become publicly available. That may offend the privacy principles contained in the privacy act.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095884"></A>
Whilst I understand the argument that is put forward by the member, because what we are dealing with here is the need for transparency and appropriate data collection to assess real or anticipated impacts, I think we need to be careful about individual rights here. I am not going to suggest that the member has not thought about that, but we do need to take care. The information provided to me that this may not accord with provisions in the privacy act is something that needs to be considered and it is always about trying to get the balance right. If you like, I am again happy to take this issue on notice. I think it is an important consideration as to whether we are getting into levels of information that becomes publicly available that may get us into an area that neither of us wants to get into. But the point the member makes is nonetheless a valid one. Again, as I have done with previous amendments moved by the member, I am happy to, if you like, take it on notice and consider it through the process of developing the next WOLA amendment act.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095887"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the minister for that. I would say in response that, as the clause would read if it were amended as I suggest, surely the commission would have the ability to make that decision about whether or not the release of the particular information offended the provisions of the privacy act and it could make that decision.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100550"></A>
I remind the minister again that there is a whole range of information that is collected in these two processes. I agree with the point the minister is making in that there may well be some of that information that offends commercial sensitivity and it may well offend the provisions of the privacy act. But in moving the amendment I wanted to, firstly, reinforce the point that the more information that is available to the community the better--and the minister obviously agrees with that and I acknowledge that--and, secondly, ensure that the decision rests with the commission to reinforce the role and the stance that the commission has in the whole process. But I am happy with the minister’s response. I will not put the question to the House and I anticipate a resolution of the issue at some time in the future.</Hansard-Body>

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (Mr Kilburn): Order! Member for Burnett, we are on an amendment to the clause at the moment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100554"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 And I rise to speak to the amendment to clause 195--the insertion of a new clause, the amendments circulated in this parliament.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This is the member for Callide’s amendment No. 14, which we are about to vote on, and then the minister’s amendments will come after that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100556"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I was given the information from the Clerk that this is an amendment to clause 195, which contains a total of 15 clauses; is that correct? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100557"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This is clause 195. This is the amendment moved by the member for Callide. After we vote on this one, we will then move to the amendments that will be moved by the minister. Do you want to speak to the member for Callide’s amendment?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I have been listening to the debate tonight between the member for Callide and the water minister. I understand that the principal purpose of this amendment is to increase the amount of information through to the public--to those farmers on that prime agricultural land. I simply make the point that it is too little and a little bit too late. The LNP had the ability to vote with the Independents when we moved for the moratorium and that would have made this amendment superfluous. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100561"></A>
The LNP failed to stick up for its constituents--the farmers, the farming families--and this amendment is for political show. It is a dog whistle to the farming communities who are manning the barricades and trying to prevent the underground coal gasification, and it should be seen as such.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100562"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Can I just respond to the member for Callide. It occurs to me that this issue about appropriate levels of transparency, the privacy act and personal information could quite usefully be put to the stakeholder committee that we referred to earlier. It seems to me that we would both benefit from that question being posed to it to get its feedback about where landholders may find a level of comfort. I just thought I would mention that, and I undertake to do that. </Hansard-Body>

Mr STEVENS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mermaid Beach--LNP) (7.46 pm): I rise to speak to the Fair Trading (Australian Consumer Law) Amendment Bill 2010, which seeks to implement Australian Consumer Law, ACL, in Queensland. This will be set out in schedule 2 of federal legislation called the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. This is further legislative harmonisation as a result of the COAG reforms to save communities across Australia hundreds of millions of dollars. We are sure that this legislation will be passed by the parliament. Obviously the Labor government has the numbers. We are supportive of the legislation; however, there are issues that I will refer to later that the opposition believes should be incorporated into the legislation through amendments in the interests of Queensland maintaining its power to protect itself in future consumer matters that may affect Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100595"></A>
The Australian Consumer Law, as set out in schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, will be the new name for the former Trade Practices Act 1974. There are two Commonwealth pieces of legislation that will help facilitate the transition by their collective effects, and they are the Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Act (No. 1) and the Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Act (No. 2) 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100599"></A>
The Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Act (No. 1) addressed the following areas: the introduction of the Australian Consumer Law, the unfair contract terms provision of the Australian Consumer Law and improved enforcement and redress provisions for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. This legislation received royal assent and came into force as of 14 April 2010 federally. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105698"></A>
The Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Act (No. 2) 2010 addressed related and supporting reforms to the first act and received royal assent and became law on 13 July 2010. As a result of this Commonwealth legislation, each state and territory government is required to introduce application legislation to apply the entire ACL in its jurisdiction. This is one of the greatest changes to consumer law in Australia in our history and will allow for uniform consistency across all the states and territories of Australia. The new Australian Consumer Law will provide a national product safety system consistent for all Australians. I would like to note here that, as shadow minister for fair trading, along with my opposition colleagues, I have great concerns about the complete takeover by the Commonwealth in relation to this new consumer law, having in mind that what is good today may in the future present problems for Queensland. As a state parliament we have to at all times protect the interests of Queenslanders which may not be the interests of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia or Western Australia. So although we are in favour of this national consumer law, we do not believe that all power should be handed to the Commonwealth unrestricted. I will elaborate on our concerns and issues later in the speech. We all know what happens when people have absolute power: absolute power corrupts absolutely. I will not go into other matters of corruption. Consumer law in Australia has had significant reforms over the last few years. </Hansard-Body>

Mr Watt:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Tell us about it, Ray. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will. The member for Everton should pay attention. I thank him for that, and I have just added on another 10 minutes. As a result of states and territories together having 17 different pieces of legislation to administer in relation to consumer law across these jurisdictions, there is a need to consolidate and to prevent overlapping and unnecessary doubling up of legislation in this important area. These majors reforms have come out of the review of Australia’s consumer policy framework by the Productivity Commission which was released in April 2008. In July 2008 the Council of Australian Governments agreed to a new national consumer protection product safety system in Australia. In August 2008 the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs recommended an overview framework for the development of the Australian Consumer Law to COAG.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105703"></A>
On 2 July 2009 an Intergovernmental Agreement for the Australian Consumer Law was signed by all leaders of the states and territories of the Commonwealth of Australia. As stated in the agreement, the objective of the new national consumer policy framework is to improve consumer wellbeing through consumer empowerment and protection, to foster effective competition and to enable the confident participation of consumers in markets in which both consumers and suppliers trade fairly. This is a very concise explanation of the objectives in the agreement and is supported by six operational objectives: to ensure that consumers are sufficiently well informed to benefit from and stimulate effective competition; to ensure goods and services are safe and fit for the purposes for which they were sold; to prevent practices that are unfair; to meet the needs of those consumers who are most vulnerable or are at the greatest disadvantage; and to promote proportionate, risk based enforcement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105704"></A>
There are two issues that I would like to raise with reference to this Intergovernmental Agreement for the Australian Consumer Law. Firstly, in clause 8 on page 6 of the agreement it says that any party may submit to the Commonwealth a proposal to amend the Australian Consumer Law, but then at 19.2 there has to be an agreement to the amendments by four other parties, including three states--three states plus a territory maybe. We have concerns with this as there may be specific amendments relating to Queensland that may need to be included but these arrangements make Queensland totally reliant on four other parties to support any change. It really is a shift to centralism, the Commonwealth basically having charge without agreement by four other parties to this agreement. That would be very, very difficult to achieve, even if Queensland had an amendment in relation to a particular issue for Queenslanders that it felt was important to make a change in the legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105705"></A>
We are not passing the responsibility across to the Commonwealth as we have done in other areas of change. Through the Personal Property Securities (Ancillary Provisions) Act, those sorts of issues were passed across to the Commonwealth completely. What we are adopting is this Australian Consumer Law model in Queensland for enforcement and operation by Queensland. That is the clear difference with some of the other COAG recommendations that have come through this parliament and will give a better and hopefully stronger, cost-saving system of consumer protection throughout Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105707"></A>
Clause 5 on page 6 states that, except as agreed by the parties, a party will not submit a bill to its legislature which would be inconsistent with or alter the effect of the Australian Consumer Law. The opposition’s amendment will help Queensland retain the power to make amendments. I look forward to the government benches supporting the opposition’s amendment to retain Queensland’s power as the pre-eminent aim and intention of the legislation even though we will be adopting the Australian Consumer Law for consistency. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105708"></A>
The third issue addresses withdrawing from the intergovernmental agreement. Clause 49 on page 10 of the agreement says that a party may withdraw from the agreement by sending written notice to all other parties. The withdrawal will become effective six months after the notice was sent. This in effect means that a state or territory has an opt-out provision in the Intergovernmental Agreement for the Australian Consumer Law and can then repeal the Australian Consumer Law and bring in their own which would be to the detriment of the law being passed here tonight in the first place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105709"></A>
The newly proposed Australian Consumer Law will be a national scheme that will provide a single law on consumer protection and ethical business practices to ensure fair trading for all Australians. This will ensure consistency in the reform of consumer law in Australia. It will also make it easier to do business across states and territories with the knowledge that no practice or procedures will be different across jurisdictions which has been a problem in the past and has caused issues with regard to consumer law requirements of each state and territory. This consistency will mean that consumers will have the same protection anywhere in Australia and that businesses will have the same responsibility and sense of duty to uphold certain business standards throughout the country. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105710"></A>
I would like to highlight that Australia has one of the highest standards for consumer protection, fair trading and products and service standards in the world. Adoption of this Australian Consumer Law will add significantly to our standard of living in our great country. Where in the world would you rather live? According to the Productivity Commission, it is believed that the reform process of the new Australian Consumer Law could provide benefits to the Australian community of between $1.5 billion and $4.5 billion a year. I am not sure how the Productivity Commission came up with the figures, but maybe the minister could elaborate more fully on the savings to Queensland with these new reforms and particularly what Queensland’s share of those savings, the $1.5 billion to $4.5 billion, may be. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105711"></A>
I note that the explanatory notes state that for the full raft of reforms covered by the national partnership agreement to deliver a seamless national economy, including the reforms to the Australian consumer laws, Queensland received $20.1 million in facilitation payments for 2008-09 and is eligible for payments of $92.6 million as a reward over five years up to 2013 if it achieves key milestones in legislation. I take it that would be legislation right across-the-board and we have adopted quite a few of those rafts of legislation already. How are those milestones going to be measured? If the government does not reach those milestones how is the government going to compensate for the loss of that promised $92.6 million from the Commonwealth? This will mean it will be expensive for the taxpayers of Queensland instead of being cost neutral, as reported in the national partnership agreement, to deliver a seamless national economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110751"></A>
The United Nations guidelines and general principles for consumer rights are quite specific and focus on protecting consumer rights. They include the protection of consumers from hazards to their health and safety--and by this it means that the government should adopt or encourage the adoption of appropriate measures, including legal systems, safety regulations, national and international standards, voluntary standards and the maintenance of safety records, to ensure that products are safe for either intended or normally foreseeable use.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110754"></A>
They also include the promotion and protection of the economic interests of consumers, by which they mean that governments should seek to achieve the goals of satisfactory production and performance standards, adequate distribution methods, fair business practices, informative marketing and effective protection against practices that could adversely affect the economic interests of consumers and the exercise of choice in the marketplace. This is an important area that I have concerns with, in relation to imported goods in particular. We need to maintain Australian standards whilst importing goods from overseas. On many occasions--and the minister has brought several cases to our attention--goods have been allowed into the country and distributed to businesses, but then have had to be recalled at great expense to both the company and the people of our nation. That process works okay, but I am concerned about how many fall through the gaps and are not picked up by the regulatory authorities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110755"></A>
Across the globe, due to the pressure to increase productivity, more and more businesses are constantly in search of cheap labour. This means many companies are utilising the cheap labour offered in developing countries such as China, Taiwan and Indonesia, and we feel that there is a great responsibility on those international, national and local companies to ensure certain standards are met in those countries where the goods are made. The concentration should not be totally on the cost and the cost of labour in getting to the end product. Maybe the payroll program purchased for Queensland Health did not work out very well, but we are looking to the government to make sure that other goods that are purchased overseas are in accord with the Australian standards expected throughout our community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110757"></A>
The United Nations guidelines set standards for the safety and quality of consumer goods and services. Governments should formulate or promote the elaboration and implementation of standards at the national and international levels for the safety and quality of goods and services, and give them appropriate publicity. National standards and regulations for product safety and quality should be reviewed from time to time to ensure that they conform to accepted international standards. In Australia, our laws must be strong enough with regards to standards for the safety and quality of products and services to ensure we have limited recalls on products, because recalling a product is like trying to prevent a disease after it has started to spread. Sometimes information might not get out to the consumers who have purchased the faulty product and are unaware of recalls advertised by the ACCC. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110758"></A>
The UN guidelines state that governments should adopt or maintain policies to ensure the efficient distribution of goods and services to consumers, in particular, where that distribution is endangered, as could be the case for rural areas in particular. Such policies could include assistance for the creation of adequate storage and retail facilities in rural centres, incentives for consumer self-help and better control of the conditions under which essential goods and services are provided in rural areas. That is very important in Queensland, and across Australia, because of the vastness of our outback and the remoteness of rural communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110759"></A>
The guidelines refer to measures enabling consumers to obtain redress. Governments should establish or maintain legal and/or administrative measures to enable consumers or appropriate relevant organisations to obtain redress through formal and informal procedures that are expeditious, fair, inexpensive and accessible. Such procedures should take particular account of the needs of low-income consumers. After these new laws are implemented in Queensland, I presume consumer redress will be obtained directly through the ACCC, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. I note in the legislation that we are debating in the House tonight that the new Australian Consumer Law enables the ACCC to seek redress orders from the court for the benefit of consumers who are not included as a party to legal action but who have suffered loss or damage arising from the contraventions of various consumer protection provisions in the act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110760"></A>
The United Nations guidelines encourage governments to develop general consumer education information programs, including information on the environmental impacts of consumer choices and behaviour, and their possible implications. That includes the promotion of sustainable consumption patterns. The guidelines encourage sustainable consumption patterns, which includes meeting the needs of present and future generations for goods and services in ways that are economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110761"></A>
The guidelines contain measures relating to specific areas. In advancing consumer interests, particularly in developing countries, where appropriate governments should give priority to areas of essential concern for the health of the consumer, such as food, water and pharmaceuticals. Policies should be adopted and maintained for product quality control. Those are the United Nations guidelines for consumer protection. </Hansard-Body>

The Fair Trading (Australian Consumer Law) Amendment Bill 2010 seeks to amend the Security Providers Act 1993 by inserting provisions into the act whereby there will be a requirement by law for the mandatory fingerprinting of security providers. This is not intended to impinge on people’s privacy rights, but to be an identification mechanism to ensure the security industry is not infiltrated by criminal elements. The Liberal National Party has no concerns about the extra requirement for the fingerprinting of security providers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110763"></A>
The other amendment to the Security Providers Act adds terrorism related offences to criminal checks. Of course, my opposition colleagues and I have no problems with this amendment. We believe it to be a very important part of our security checking systems. We should never underestimate the potential threat that terrorism could have on our way of life. We should also be vigilant in helping authorities prevent those abhorrent acts in Australia. Our she’ll-be-right-mate ideology should not move us into a false sense of complacency on such an important issue. </Hansard-Body>

Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (Ms Farmer): Order! There is too much audible conversation in the chamber. Could members please keep their conversations to a minimum.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110765"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I will try to make it a little more interesting to reduce the conversation over there. In his summation of the bill, could the minister advise me in relation to a problem that I have been made aware of. This will save a bit of time later on. It relates to the security industry. The National Security Association of Australia advised me of this concern. I have not been able to ask about this, despite the briefing by the excellent staff members. There is an issue in relation to audits that have to be done in compliance with this legislation. It is a user-pays system on audits. That is a major cost, particularly for small security companies in very remote areas. Could the minister explain this or, through his staff, give me a heads up on it, because I am unaware how it will be picked up in this legislation. The National Security Association of Australia (Queensland) Inc. assures me that it is a problem with our legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110767"></A>
I bring the House’s attention to the issue of security licences in Queensland. The minister must be aware that the honourable Martin Moynihan AO QC has indicated that bikie gangs have infiltrated the nightclub scene on the Gold Coast and are working as security personnel in venues. I ask the minister how many have infiltrated the nightclub industry on the Gold Coast and across the state? Will they be picked up through the new security provision in this bill? It is very concerning for people of the Gold Coast that security licences may be provided to people who are affiliated and associated with bikie gangs that may engage in criminal activity. That is extremely worrying to the Gold Coast community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115938"></A>
So you can be a member of a bikie gang and may potentially engage in a criminal activity but have no criminal record--and I am sure there are some in bikie gangs who have no criminal record--and still be able to have a security providers licence approved. Is that the case? Has the security provision not gone far enough to ensure integrity in that security industry? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115941"></A>
In relation to the terrorism checks, I presume that this is an international check but, as we know, different countries have different laws and is it not true that a potential threat could slip through these checks with a false name or information on their application? This area of security is critical for the protection of the community in various industries--for example, nightclubs, the protection of government and non-government buildings, major events including festivals and sporting events. I would also like to ask the minister how tight are the laws to ensure maximum protection without violating individual rights? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115944"></A>
I will now move to the concerns of the Western Australian Minister for Commerce, the Hon. William Marmion, who has introduced a bill called the Fair Trading Bill 2010 into their parliament. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115953"></A>
The Barnett government has concerns about applying laws of other jurisdictions in this state in such a way that future amendments to those laws will take effect automatically, without consideration by the Western Australian Parliament. As a matter of principle, we do not believe this is in the best interests of parliamentary democracy ... that the Western Australian Parliament should always have the final say on what laws are introduced as laws of Western Australia. As a result, this bill--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1115954"></A>
the Fair Trading Bill--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115955"></A>
proposes to introduce the Australian Consumer Law ... in a modified way ... future amendments to the Commonwealth version of the Australian Consumer Law will not automatically apply in Western Australia. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115956"></A>
Ditto in Queensland. We concur with Minister Marmion’s remarks. That is why I propose an amendment today in the House that will bring the same effect to the Queensland legislation, and should be supported by the House, in terms of protecting the interests of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115957"></A>
The federal shadow minister at the time of the introduction of the Australian Consumer Law had some concerns which I will highlight to the House. The shadow minister for consumer affairs, financial services, superannuation and corporate law, Mr Luke Hartsuyker, expressed concerns in his speech on 19 October 2009. He highlighted the following issue: the removal of the unfair contract term in relation to business-to-business contracts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115959"></A>
In November 2009 Senator Nick Xenophon proposed amendments to allow for business-to-business contracts involving transactions of $2 million or less. This, I believe, would be a good change to protect the backbone of our business community which we all know to be small business. As the minister in the House would be aware, the matter of contracts is now coming into the realm of the Australian Consumer Law where it was previously excluded from Queensland’s Fair Trading Act. Under this new law--and I have already had experience of this--a lot of businesses who sign contracts with other businesses will now become part of the unconscionable contract and will become part of an already heavily taxed judicial system to resolve the matter. I understand--and the minister will advise--that these matters are not Queensland’s problems anymore; they are the ACCC’s through this legislation. But it will clog up the work of the legal people and it will clog up businesses by having a government body, if you like, now looking after the interests of business contracts. This is quite a new phenomenon for Queensland. Will matters be dealt with through QCAT on some of these issues? Will it be a further strain on getting a QCAT resolution or a date at QCAT to resolve the contract issues? Perhaps the minister could advise me in his summing-up of these matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115960"></A>
There were concerns raised by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. They focused on individual rights and liberties. In section 52 of clause 18 the committee believed that it would impose an unfair burden on executive officers to provide evidence of why they should not be prosecuted for actions against the company as a whole. The other issue that the committee was concerned with was the invasion of privacy with regard to the fingerprinting amendment to the Security Providers Act. On the whole, industry is in favour of greater uniformity of consumer laws that make business practices more streamlined to protect both consumers and industry itself. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115962"></A>
Significant responses were received with regard to the Australian Consumer Law in relation to consultation and they were in the form of submissions to the federal Senate Standing Committee on Economics inquiry and analysis of the Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Bill (No. 2) 2010. The Queensland Consumers Association wants the Australian Consumer Law amended to include authority to punish retailers in breach of the Unit Pricing Code. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115965"></A>
Legal Aid Queensland is concerned about consumer protection with regard to door-to-door salesmen and telemarketers. As we know--and the minister may well have been in the parliament at this particular time--on the Gold Coast the telemarketers were quite a major problem for legislators and fair trading officers to deal with. Through the change in the markets, particularly the real estate market, that has occurred in recent times, we have seen a falling away of the telemarketing business. But I do understand that they are back in business again in other areas. So we will be seeing more of telemarketers becoming a problem that this legislation will have to deal with. Legal Aid Queensland strongly supports the increase in consumer protections for telemarketing sales. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115968"></A>
The Spier Consulting Regulatory Strategies and Solutions submissions on behalf of the Queensland Newsagents Federation and the New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory Newsagents Association agreed with the bill in principle but have serious issues on the impact of small business. They are concerned about the protection of newsagent owners and operators in relation to the following: guarantees--definition of ‘consumer’; guarantees--exclusion of retail; guarantees--indemnification by suppliers; and unfair contracts--exclusion of business-to-business dealings, which is what I raised earlier. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115969"></A>
The Australian National Retailers Association is concerned about the uncertainty created for retailers by the reporting requirement contained in sections 131 and 132 of the bill which relate to goods associated with death, serious injury or illness; the potential liability for retailers under sections 106 and 118 when they are in control of, or possess, non-compliant products, even when a retailer has no intention to sell those non-compliant products to the public in that state; and the provision and acceptance of a credit card or debit card statement by retailer as proof of transaction set out in section 100 of the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115970"></A>
Coles, our major retailer in Australia, is concerned with section 29--false and misleading representations about goods and services. According to its submission, Coles supports the new provisions to the extent that this is the aim. However, Coles is concerned with the use of the words ‘by any person’ in the section and considers that the use of actors that play a character shown to enjoy, use or endorse a product in advertising material risks contravening these new provisions to the extent that the actor does not enjoy, use or endorse the product in their personal life. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115971"></A>
The ACL actually increases consumer protection for Queenslanders, with unfair contract terms provisions, as I mentioned, increased conditions and warranty provisions. The only downside to this is that the workload for Queensland courts and QCAT may increase due to the increased number of complaints under the more stringent legislation. This, I believe, would be a small price to pay for the increase in consumer protection for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115973"></A>
There are several areas of the bill that raise concern about consistency with fundamental legislative principles which the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee has raised. For example, there is an increase in restriction on individual’s rights and liberties. However, this relates to the service/product providers and therefore increases consumer protection. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115974"></A>
The LNP will be supporting this bill. We support this as a major step forward for the harmonisation of consumer protection across Australia. However, we do have the reservations that I outlined in relation to protecting Queensland’s interests in the future, and we also do have reservations in believing that Queenslanders want to adopt everything that the Commonwealth of Australia wants to adopt. That is why we actually have a state and federal system. Some states believe in differentiating on certain matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115975"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Lawlor:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 How do you get harmonisation then? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the minister’s interjection. We are getting harmonisation laws now by adopting all the recommendations of this legislation. We agree with those matters. What we are doing--and it is exactly the same as Western Australia--is putting in provisions for the future for consumer protection matters arising in Queensland. If they are in the interests of Queenslanders we will have the capacity, through this amendment that the minister should be agreeing to, to move a matter in this law in this House through legislation in Queensland that protects Queenslanders. Under the minister’s proposal, even if it is good for Queenslanders--and some issues may be good for Queenslanders in their own right--we have to go and ask New South Wales, Victoria and two other states to get permission to do something in Queensland, even if no--</Hansard-Body>

 Under this law we do.

It is a good move for the Australian Consumer Law harmonisation, and the LNP opposition is supporting it. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr GIBSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gympie--LNP) (8.22 pm): The Fair Trading (Australian Consumer Law) Amendment Bill comes at a time when the states and the federal government are working together for consumer policy reforms--reforms which have their genesis as far back as 2003, when the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs first commenced consideration on product safety provisions. With this bill now before the House, it is recognised that the Australian Consumer Law bill represents a significant overhaul of Australia’s consumer laws. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121298"></A>
I would like to restrict my remarks tonight to those elements of the Australian Consumer Law that deal with unconscionable conduct and unfair practices, especially as they relate to franchising and its impact upon the Australian economy and consumers. Just recently, we had the release of the PWC Franchise Sector Indicator, <Hansard-Italic>
How can we grow the franchises of tomorrow?</Hansard-Italic>
 This report highlights the value to our economy and the strength of franchising as a business model in Australia, particularly when placed in context of the growth experienced despite the economic downturn and the hangover our economy has experienced from the global financial crisis. As the report elegantly states, ‘The sector hit the ambitious targets it set for itself and outperformed the rest of the Australian economy.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121299"></A>
It is estimated that, within Australia, the franchising industry’s annual turnover is $130 billion, there are approximately 71,000 franchise agreements in place, and franchising employs more than 690,000 people. According to the report, in the past year franchisor revenue grew by 12 per cent with profits growing by 19 per cent, and for the franchisee the profit and revenue growth was around six to seven per cent, almost twice the rate of CPI. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121300"></A>
In Australia, franchising has been governed by the Franchising Code of Conduct which was established in 1998 when it was introduced in the Commonwealth Trade Practices Act. Each year, many Queenslanders aspire to self-employment and, as new business owners, they have been able to realise this goal by leveraging off the resources, knowledge and reputation of established commercial franchise operations. However, during recent years, community concerns about fairness in franchising resulted in a number of state based reviews of the franchising code and broadly across the franchising sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121301"></A>
This was also followed with a Senate inquiry into unconscionable conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act and an Australian parliament joint committee inquiry into the franchising code and related matters. It became clear that, despite franchising being an important business model for the Australian economy, more needed to be done to ensure it operated effectively, more needed to be done to protect all parties in the agreement, more needed to be done to ensure an even playing field for small businesses. Therefore, I am disappointed that an opportunity was lost from the draft of the federal legislation, which included business-to-business contracts being subject to the unfair contract term provisions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121302"></A>
In the absence of a willingness by the federal government to address concerns raised by the various inquiries and the clear public concerns about cowboy operators in the franchising industry, we have recently seen the South Australian and Western Australian governments take action with the introduction of state based franchising laws. Interestingly, a Labor government in South Australia and a Liberal-National government in Western Australia have both felt the need to act, and in Western Australia just recently the Labor opposition took the opportunity to declare bipartisan support for the bill at its first reading. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121303"></A>
Queensland needs to also act in this important sector of our economy but perhaps not to the extent contemplated by other states. A more moderate approach is appropriate for such an important part of the Queensland economy. It is my intention to do exactly that in 2011 and to consult with major stakeholders in the industry with a view to drafting Queensland’s own private member’s bill that addresses the concerns in the franchising industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121304"></A>
In June 2009 in this House, during the debate on the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Bill, I called for franchising reform, with the identification that the tribunal would be ideally suited to be utilised as a state based tribunal for dispute resolution within franchising. This is because tribunals can avoid the annihilation of adversarial litigation and make orders of a practical nature sufficient to deal with low-level or relational disputes. As well as being a low-cost and timely dispute forum, the tribunals are already established. A franchising tribunal would address the current failings of mediation as a one-size-fits-all solution to dispute resolution. At the time, the Attorney-General said in his summing up of the debate--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1121306"></A>
Due to the current Commonwealth activity in the area of national consumer laws, it is not possible to say at this stage whether franchisee matters will be included in QCAT’s jurisdiction. I note the member’s interest in the issue and I undertake to consider what steps may be taken in the future to address these concerns.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121307"></A>
Just last month, the federal small business minister, Nick Sherry, again showed an unwillingness to deal with the problems in the franchising sector by the federal government, so it is very clear that the states need to act. This bill before the House now falls short in its failure to address business-to-business contracts subject to unfair contract conditions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121308"></A>
In making the necessary reforms, however, there is no need to throw the baby out with the bathwater. The Queensland Law Society has raised some very valid concerns with regard to the Western Australian legislation which we should heed in the drafting of any private member’s bill for Queensland. These concerns appear to be how the Western Australian approach will impact upon Queensland franchisors and legal practitioners. This is why we must consult with all stakeholders to determine the way to achieve improvement in the industry. We have an opportunity to make Queensland the place to do business with franchising, an opportunity for best practice by engaging with our own Griffith University centre for excellence, which has done such fantastic work with regard to franchising.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121309"></A>
This bill, as with most bills, presents an opportunity for improvement. We have an obligation to find ways to enhance protection for consumers and small business operators. The Australian Consumer Law bill is part of an ongoing reform process that is delivering enhanced consumer protection. It is important to have ongoing improvement in regulation and legislation, particularly in economic and financial areas. Therefore, the need for ongoing improvement in franchise reform is also an important area that this parliament must address in 2011. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Glass House--LNP) (8.29 pm): I too rise this evening to address the Fair Trading (Australian Consumer Law) Amendment Bill. Given the attention span of those opposite that we have seen evidenced during the last couple of speeches, I will keep my comments brief. I focus my comments on a particular concern raised by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. Before I do so, I want to acknowledge the time and effort of Helen McKenzie who has been working for the committee over the last couple of months. She will be missed. </Hansard-Body>

In <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert No. 11,</Hansard-Italic>
 which deals with the fair trading amendment bill, the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee raises concerns around the institution of parliament. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1126561"></A>
Where the Queensland Legislative Assembly is considering the enactment of legislation which is to be uniform with the legislation of one or more other Australian Parliaments, the committee’s report on its examination of the legislation aims to assist the Legislative Assembly in the ‘enhanced and investigative role’ necessary in relation to such legislation. This role is required because the legislatures participating in uniform or complementary legislation: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1126563"></A>
•	provide a forum for discussion of intergovernmental matters and for asking questions about them from the major executive participants; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1126564"></A>
•	have an investigative role which may be used to study the need for, and the goals of, intergovernmental cooperation, as well as the performance of the relevant agencies, and the appropriateness of existing intergovernmental agreements. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126565"></A>
The committee goes on to identify a range of paragraphs from the explanatory notes. I will focus on the concluding paragraph which reads--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1126567"></A>
It is possible that the Commonwealth will be able to make amendments to the ACL without the support of Queensland which will be applied as a law of Queensland through the application law. Should these circumstances arise, the Queensland Parliament is able to vary the application of the ACL to prevent amendments to the ACL taking effect in Queensland. There are, however, potential time or process constraints preventing amendments to the ACL taking effect in Queensland in a timely manner. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1148587"></A>
The committee states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1126568"></A>
In relation to the matters addressed in the final paragraph above, the committee notes with concern the apparent absence from the legislation of a requirement that amendments to the Australian Consumer Law be tabled in the Queensland Legislative Assembly. The committee invites the minister to provide information about the practical ability of the Legislative Assembly to subject such amendments to its scrutiny. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126569"></A>
This is a continuing and concerning pattern that we are seeing in these national laws. It is interesting to note that the committee’s concerns have been addressed with regard to other laws that have come before the House, but clearly not with this one. It is worth noting, however, that the amendment proposed by the shadow minister will go some way to addressing this concern. Therefore, I too support it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126570"></A>
I will not speak any further on that. I would ask the minister to possibly address that in his summing-up. It is a concern. We have had it addressed in health legislation and some of the other pieces of legislation we have seen before the parliament. It would be good to see it addressed in this one too. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms GRACE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Brisbane Central--ALP) (8.32 pm): I rise to support the Fair Trading (Australian Consumer Law) Amendment Bill 2010. It is good to see national laws that cover both business and consumers. Obviously, I believe that consumers and businesses are fundamentally the same not only throughout Queensland but throughout Australia. I believe that an efficient, up-to-date law that guarantees uniformity is a step in the right direction and represents best practice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126573"></A>
The implementation of the Australian Consumer Law will provide for an increased range of enforcement options to the Queensland regulator. These provisions will be a benefit to Queensland consumers as the regulator will now have sufficient enforcement powers to provide a proportionate response to a range of breaches and contraventions of the Australian Consumer Law. This principle will apply equally across the broad spectrum of business behaviours ranging from large corporations to small businesses.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126574"></A>
The introduction of the Australian Consumer Law will provide increased penalties of up to $1.1 million for a body corporate and $220,000 for other persons. These penalties were introduced into the Australian Consumer Law based on the Australian Law Reform Commission recommendation that penalties be increased from $40,000 in the case of persons and $200,000 in the case of a corporation. This is essentially a result of the Trade Practices Act 1974 forming the basis for the Australian Consumer Law.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126575"></A>
Although there is a notable increase in penalty amounts, the Australian Consumer Law does not contain penalties which provide for imprisonment. Accordingly, penalties are higher to provide a deterrent effect through the regulator using disciplinary powers, such as seeking civil pecuniary penalties or adverse publicity orders. I think that is a step in the right direction. It should be noted that these amounts will be treated as a maximum penalty and will only be sought in those instances involving a serious contravention of the law.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126576"></A>
The courts will also be in a position to impose an appropriate penalty that takes into account the size of the contravening business, the amount of loss or damage caused and the extent to which the business cooperated with any investigation. It is important that courts are provided the flexibility to impose penalties that deal with the most serious of breaches of the Australian Consumer Law, as well as minor technical breaches across all Australian jurisdictions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126577"></A>
In implementing the Australian Consumer Law, the Queensland Fair Trading Act will also be updated to reflect changes to the status of the Office of Fair Trading. The Fair Trading Act currently provides the statutory basis for the Office of Fair Trading and the Commissioner for Fair Trading and specifies their major functions and investigative powers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126578"></A>
Amongst other things, the Service Delivery and Performance Commission review of the Department of Tourism, Fair Trading and Wine Industry Development recommended the removal of the statutory role of the Office of Fair Trading. The Service Delivery and Performance Commission concluded that the legislative creation of the Office of Fair Trading limited government’s flexibility to deliver consumer protection and promotion services in the most appropriate way. The commission also indicated that there was no requirement that consumer protection services be provided independently from mainstream government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126579"></A>
As part of the implementation of the Australian Consumer Law, the statutory role of the Office of Fair Trading is removed, but the statutory role of the Commissioner for Fair Trading will continue to provide a focal point for consumer protection, education and training in Queensland. It should be noted that the Office of Fair Trading ceased to be a distinct operational unit in mid-2007 due to machinery of government changes and organisational restructures. This has not impacted on fair trading services. These amendments to be included as part of the implementation of the Australian Consumer Law will merely formalise this process. </Hansard-Body>

I join Mr Deputy Speaker Powell in referring to some of the comments by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. I believe that those issues raised have merit to be raised but equally I also believe that the law and the minister will be able to provide ample information to justify the reasons the bill has been formulated in the manner in which it has been done. With those few comments, I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (8.37 pm): The Fair Trading (Australian Consumer Law) Amendment Bill is introduced as the Queensland leg of the legislation resulting from the consumer policy reforms agreed by COAG in October 2008. This followed the Productivity Commission review--a two journal publication--of the Australian consumer policy framework. In short, it will deliver a new Australian Consumer Law and improved safety regime for consumers, a broader definition of consumers, a national private security industry regulatory structure and an identity checking system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126583"></A>
As I have said, this is as a result of the report from the Productive Commission. Consumers in Australia might be seen today as a mixture of all things to all men but not all positive when seen through each of many eyes--that is, the consumer, as has been reported correctly. The Productivity Commission report states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1126584"></A>
Many consumers are now more confident as a result of better education and the internet. But greater complexity and demographic change such as population and ageing have simultaneously increased the pool of vulnerable consumers. Young people are now higher consumers. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126585"></A>
They are saying that they are often being treated like mushrooms and there are too many of them saying the same things. There are higher community expectations and demands for less risky products. What has followed is greater guarantees and warrantees.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126586"></A>
Industry which increasingly has massively reduced onshore manufacturing feels that consumer laws are unfairly weighted against them. Government has increasingly taken the approach that if mass restructuring legislation will not work then open access to court mediated mechanisms have spawned the massive growth of publicly listed firms such as Slater &amp; Gordon. They have grown on the stock exchange. This is a new extension of ambulance chasing--no win, no fee. A new zone of broad based case actions have grown against all sorts of manufacturers and suppliers. It is a disturbing trend. Qantas is experiencing this currently when the engine failed on the new A380. Unfortunately, what it has done is proactively taken to compensating consumers. I wonder whether that is going to lead to further changes in the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131933"></A>
It is concerning that today the government is introducing a new Australian Consumer Law legislative step that is a fairly significant step forward. The concern is that Labor governments across Australia have continuously been giving Australian consumers some false hope and a consumer regulatory framework that is hopelessly entrenching red tape mired in ideology as opposed to practicality. It seems a great idea to have a seamless national Australian consumer legal framework where a state’s border means nothing, but if all that is changed is compounding the worst of problems then not only has little been delivered but a whole new bottleneck has been created. An example of this can be seen in my own electorate where people of all ages have to rely on motor vehicles for transport to get to work. The reasons are well known in this parliament and I have repeatedly stated that the bus timetabling system on the Gold Coast is circa 1995 and does not even synchronise with the railway.</Hansard-Body>

 I will get to it; it is a Fair Trading matter. This is a Fair Trading matter. This era of implementing a cash for clunkers program has increased the value of the oldest cars in the country. It gets worse: our consumer affairs laws are so restrictive and difficult that many people cannot obtain finance that is realistic to buy the vehicles. The demands placed upon motor dealers are so awful that it would seem that the current objective is to prevent them from entering the profession and making their lives impossible. For those who may not realise, motor dealers go in and out of their jobs. Too many have been stigmatised, parodied and officially derided, mainly by governments and politicians. On the latest list of those most trusted, car dealers actually rated above politicians. In order to provide finance and enter into valid contracts, motor dealers have to jump through hoops that are unfair, overly expensive and restrictive. If they come from New South Wales to Queensland--and we are encouraging many to come--they have to do a bridging course that is identical to the one they have already done in New South Wales. They of course have to undergo all of the probity checks, and that is totally valid and fair.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131942"></A>
What follows is that we have created a problem for consumers that should not be occurring. It is an 11-module step. They have to pay $3,800 and two of the contents are basically how you buy cars. We are ending up with unlicensed operators and amateur car sales agents who sell the odd few cars parked on our streets, rogue operators who share their licences, higher costs to consumers, consumers who are forced to borrow from credit cards and payday lenders and bad cars on our roads. The problem is not a small one. In my own electorate it is a very big one and it is growing. I would not be surprised if it is throughout the state. Its growth has been driven by severe cost-of-living pressures and rising interest rates. Labor governments consistently deliver these outcomes by policies that promote government debt, deficit and higher tax approaches. The impact is that the public is finding it harder to get to work that they can access. This new problem of difficulty of access is a significant component of the underemployment problem in Queensland. Across Australia 900,000 Australians do not have enough work. This is made worse on the Gold Coast by a massive casualisation of the workforce. Many people are relying on three different jobs to provide both themselves and their families with a sustainable living.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131947"></A>
What is most distressing is that of new full-time jobs in Australia last year 300,000 of them were in government and in Queensland 46,000 of those full-time jobs were in government. Beyond health professionals, teachers and emergency services, which represent 25 per cent of the 46,000, we have a serious increase in bureaucracy and red tape at the expense of greater business efficiency and a generation of people who are short of cash. All the consumer law in the world will not save a system that is stuck in the socialist ideal of government at the centre of the economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1255971"></A>
What global socialist experiments demonstrate is that it is consumers who bear the brunt of socialist ideology. They have less choice, higher prices, poorer quality and no real ability to have their complaints addressed. That is why this change today really needs greater scrutiny. It is overly idealistic when the real economic worries of our states are being completely ignored. Dwelling approvals in Queensland are 7.6 per cent down. That is twice the national average. Housing finance approvals are down one per cent and Premier Bligh is still 81,700 jobs off her 100,000 jobs target. I am not saying that we do not need consumer protection, but what we need here is a reality check. Our state is stalling economically in spite of record CSG exploration and coal shipments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131951"></A>
In difficult times such as these, our governments must make it easier for small business owners and their staff. Is this bill a defiant statement stating to anyone who would bother to listen Canute-like that Queensland is dabbling in national consumer law change when consumers’ own lives and their homes are under threat? We have record home repossessions in Queensland. There were 1,638 in Queensland last year--that is, 2009--and there were only 1,361 in 2008. We have record personal bankruptcies--1,800 in the October 2009 quarter and 1,440 in the September 2008 quarter. That is an increase of 23.29 per cent, and Queensland was much higher than the national average.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131952"></A>
Is this bill the message consumers want to hear from a government before Christmas? I do not think it is. In practical terms, the changes in the bill are all of those changes that aspirational devotees might wish for. It is heavy in red tape and referenced back to bureaucracy. This is the tragedy of these changes. The ACL is founded on the Trade Practices Act 1974. It provides for a national product safety system for all Australian consumers and business. It ends with adopting a consumer guarantee system. The old Commonwealth Trade Practices Act, to be renamed the Competition and Consumer Act, will be in place by 1 January 2011 with a single national law. It is not necessarily simpler, but it is national and broader in coverage. In his second reading speech the minister stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131958"></A>
... new unfair contract terms provisions, which will allow consumers to challenge potentially unfair terms in contracts and allow the courts to declare unfair terms of contracts to be void.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131959"></A>
The minister has stated that it makes business obligations clearer. One hopes the balance of obligations is indeed fair and the use of plain English and consumer guarantees will be more effective and better. What has led to this bill? I quote from the COAG process, and it is quoted in all of the papers--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131961"></A>
There were a number of key recommendations in the Productivity Commission’s report of April 2008 critically that stated Australia’s consumer policy framework has some important strengths but some ineffectual and inefficient institutional arrangements and excessive reliance on an industry specific regulation and deficiencies in particular policy approaches, and they detract significantly from the outcomes that deliver to consumers, businesses and the community. Hence, there is scope to do much better.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131962"></A>
This bill is part of the national so-called reform agenda for consumer protection. COAG and the Productivity Commission have had critical input into the initiation phase. The deep concern is that it is typically overly bureaucratic and burdened with red tape. These are dreadful patterns of Labor governments. Consumers invariably suffer the consequences of these hierarchical approaches. I have stated that they end up with less choice, poorer quality, higher prices and irrelevant complaint mechanisms. Smaller innovative businesses just leave the market because it is not cost-effective to be either a reliable supplier or a supplier at all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1255972"></A>
For the nation the worst consequences are that these new types of laws inevitably lead to the death of the local manufacturing industry and greater imports with diminishing exports. Consumers with less choice but better consumer guarantees tend to end up with having to make do with what the market is prepared to offer them. With a population of 24 million, Australia is a manufacturing irrelevance in a world of six billion souls. I am not sure what the best consumer law would be, but any time it leads to a reduction in all of those things that make life worthwhile means that they may not be worth implementing. Remember, Russia ended up with the polluting Moscovitch’s and West Germany produced everything from Porsches to Mercedes for its taxi fleets. Consumerism must be balanced against access to excellence of products.<Hansard-Speech-End>

This legislation will come as welcome relief to the consumers of Burnett. I would like to address a number of issues briefly. First of all, I would like to congratulate the minister on some of his personnel who operate in Fair Trading. Peter Nell from Maryborough is a fine fellow and he has been very diligent and very busy. I understand that he operates out of the Maryborough office. I would like to put in a bid to the minister for an Office of Fair Trading in the Burnett-Bundaberg region. I think we need it. There are a number of dodgy operators and rogue traders in the area. I think if we had more personnel from Fair Trading in the Bundaberg-Burnett region then we would be able to keep on top of all the scams and dodgy behaviours.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137454"></A>
I would like to alert the House to a scam in the building industry. I am sure the minister is well aware of this, but I am not sure that most other members would be aware of it. Kit homes are not covered by BSA insurance. That lack of coverage has led to many bad decisions. It has also led to a lot of poor outcomes for many consumers in the Burnett-Bundaberg region. They have gone ahead and bought a kit home, particularly from an unscrupulous man called John Biles, thinking they would be covered under BSA insurance. And when they paid the full amount or considerable sums for the delivery of those kit homes and either did not get the kit home or received only a little bit of the kit home, they then thought they could go and apply to the BSA and recover their moneys. They then found out that they were covered under the department’s Fair Trading Act. It is a huge loophole that I hope this government is going to fix--I hope possibly by ensuring that, when the Australian Consumer Law takes over the act, that loophole is covered, because it has caused so much unnecessary heartache. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137458"></A>
There are literally hundreds of people affected by that particular loophole in the legislation. One particular couple comes to mind. At the moment they are living in a shed in the middle of a paddock and making loan repayments for a kit home that they will never have. Their life is an absolute misery. When speaking to this legislation we must keep our minds and thoughts on those victims who have been ripped off and those hundreds of people who were ripped off by that unscrupulous person. It seems that you can have the book thrown at you and incur more penalties if you go down to the corner shop and get caught shoplifting a chocolate bar than you would if you undertook these scams. You fall into the gap between the Office of Fair Trading and the BSA. I notice that the shadow minister is paying keen attention. I hope that he is aware of that scam and that fault and incorporates a solution to it into his policy. </Hansard-Body>

Retirement village residents are also consumers who I believe are covered under this bill. I draw members’ attention to page 97, under the heading ‘Retirement Villages Act 1999’. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137465"></A>
So I assume that all residents in Queensland who are living in retirement villages and other similar facilities are covered under this legislation. I would like the minister to address that particular issue in his reply. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137466"></A>
There are a number of problems with retirement villages. It appears that those problems have arisen ever since big business has become involved in the retirement village industry. When it was a not-for-profit industry the imperative to take care of the bottom line rather than take care of our retirees was less. Now, big business seems to focus on the bottom line more than the welfare of and the fair dealing with our retirement village residents and consumers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137467"></A>
I have lodged a question on notice with the minister and I will repeat it in this place tonight: what security is there for the exit entitlements for retirement village residents when the village goes into receivership? That is one issue that is being discussed hotly in the Carlyle Gardens Retirement Village. Dylon, Jim, Philma and Barry Stick are very concerned about that. They are a great bunch of people who are good advocates for the consumers in the retirement village industry. Who is entitled to payments before the exiting residents when the retirement village goes into receivership? A number of retirement villages have gone into receivership around the state. It would be good if the minister took this opportunity to clarify those issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137473"></A>
There is also a strong suggestion from Carlyle Gardens Retirement Village that we have an independent ombudsman to oversee retirement villages and have somewhere for residents to make their complaints. The current dispute resolution process is very complex. It is intimidating, protracted and demands that aged residents confront face to face, and frequently alone, the very perpetrators of the matter in dispute. There is a massive inequality in the resources available to the two sides in that dispute. That almost certainly guarantees that chequebook justice will prevail and that justice is often on the side of the retirement village operator, who has massive resources. The dispute process is simply too complex or threatening for many retirement village residents to consider instigating. It is common that residents either have no idea how to or lack the capacity to access that dispute resolution process. </Hansard-Body>

Currently, the volunteers of the Association of Residents of Queensland Retirement Villages, the ARQRV--and I have to pass on my compliments to Les Armstrong; as a former RAAF apprentice he is doing a fine job--are the only advocates for residents, and they frequently deal with hundreds of new requests for assistance every month. There was a suggestion that we move the administration of the Retirement Villages Act from its present jurisdiction to one more appropriate to the people centred nature of the industry. There is no listing for a minister for seniors or the aged on the parliamentary website. The association is very concerned about that. It is objectionable that seniors and issues relating to their secure housing and healthcare needs for the remainder of their lives are debated by lawyers quoting as precedents disputes about granite benchtops and vinyl pool liners. ‘We are people, not objects’ is the message that the residents of the retirement village send to the minister, and they ask him to listen to them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137479"></A>
The Commercial and Consumer Tribunal--the CCT--adjudicates disputes under 16 different acts, and the residents of the retirement villages in my electorate believe that the Retirement Villages Act should not be one of them. There should be no CCT adjudication. Should the Retirement Villages Act remain within the jurisdiction of the Commercial and Consumer Tribunal, the limit of jurisdiction for the CCT should be increased to a more realistic amount. The current amount of $250,000 provides little protection to retirement village residents. It certainly makes disputes initiated by a group of residents, as allowed for by the Retirement Villages Act, likely to be beyond the jurisdiction of the CCT. </Hansard-Body>

Just as an example of why I think it is so important to look after our retirees, I have recently had cause to advocate for residents there. Because of cost-cutting measures, at a certain retirement village--I will not mention it; it is not in the Burnett electorate but it is very close to the Burnett electorate and there were people being serviced by that retirement village--incontinence pads were being rationed to residents and put under lock and key. Instead of having three incontinence pads per day, the residents were allowed to have only two incontinence pads per day and one of a night. It was absolutely diabolical the behaviour that was being visited on these residents. Eventually we did achieve justice. </Hansard-Body>

 There are ignorant members opposite saying, ‘Come back to the bill.’ We are talking about consumer rights here.

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137485"></A>
I will give another example. Unqualified medical staff were urged to dispense medication. A fish tank was removed from a retirement village as part of a cost-cutting measure. People were being denied pieces of bread so they could feed the birds. Residents wanted to go to an Anzac Day ceremony and the manager of that facility denied a bus service. We as members of this place have to be aware to fight injustice wherever it may occur and always listen to our constituents, who of course are consumers as well. I commend the bill.<Hansard-Speech-End>

(9.00 pm): I rise to make a short contribution in support of the Fair Trading (Australian Consumer Law) Amendment Bill. In researching this bill and in placing consumer policy in its historical context I discovered one particular reference from the code of the Babylon ruler Hammurabi. I am surprised that the member for Gaven did not actually find this reference. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr RYAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No, I have put a little bit more thought in. Hammurabi’s code was written almost 4,000 years ago and sets out a series of laws which regulates consumer transactions. For example, and importantly for some members of this House, the 108th law in Hammurabi’s code protects tavern goers from paying too much for their drinks. The code said that if the mistress of a beer shop has not received corn as the price of beer or has demanded silver on an excessive scale and has made the measure of beer less than the measure of corn, that beer seller shall be prosecuted and drowned. I know some people would still say in such circumstances that we should continue to let the punishment fit the crime, but of course we have moved on since Hammurabi’s days. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137529"></A>
Today the Australian Consumer Law is about protecting consumer rights when buying goods and services. Members of this House would have heard me talk about my passion and commitment to the concept of the safety net, that wonderful principle of governments providing support and protection for vulnerable people in our community. Consumer protection law is one way that governments can protect vulnerable people from unfair and harsh consumer transactions. This bill further enhances consumer protection for Queensland consumers by enhancing consistency and certainty and by extending other important protections. I commend the minister, his staff and the department on their hard work in respect of this bill. I commend the bill to the House and I ask all members to support it.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PJ LAWLOR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southport--ALP) (Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.02 pm), in reply: I thank all members for their contributions and support for this bill. I will address the bill in two parts. Firstly, I will discuss the Australian Consumer Law and, secondly, I will discuss the security provider amendments. This is a bill that adopts the Australian Consumer Law as a law of Queensland. It delivers on the Queensland government’s commitment to reform Australia’s consumer policy framework in cooperation with the Commonwealth and the states and territories of Australia. It also delivers on the Queensland government’s commitment to the broader business regulation and national economy reforms established by the Council of Australian Governments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137532"></A>
The Australian Consumer Law includes some fundamental changes to consumer protection in Queensland, including the introduction of unfair contract terms, provisions and statutory consumer guarantees. The Australian Consumer Law also reinforces the importance of long-established protections such as protections against misleading or deceptive conduct and false or misleading representations. There are also improvements to the uniformity of consumer protections across Australia with the introduction of unsolicited consumer agreement provisions which deal with door-to-door trading and telemarketing.The differences in penalty amounts and enforcement options that existed between the Commonwealth’s Trade Practices Act and Queensland’s Fair Trading Act are also removed by this bill. This will mean more uniform outcomes and scope for increased cooperation among jurisdictions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137533"></A>
A number of members had questions about the bill. I thank the member for Mermaid Beach for his words in general support of the ACL bill. I am pleased that he recognises and acknowledges the broadening of consumer protections in Queensland. However, I note that the member has concerns that the manner in which the ACL is being applied impacts on the role of the Queensland parliament in administering the law as a law of Queensland. Due to the application law model used to adopt the Australian Consumer Law as a law of Queensland, any change to the text of the law will be enacted in all participating jurisdictions without the need for any legislative amendment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1256082"></A>
The underlying policy of the Intergovernmental Agreement for the Australian Consumer Law, the IGA, is that the Commonwealth, states and territories will use their best endeavours to maintain a consistent national generic law. Pursuant to this ideal, the IGA provides for a process for amendment of the Australian Consumer Law. The IGA for the Australian Consumer Law provides that the Commonwealth will not introduce a bill into the Commonwealth parliament to amend the Australian Consumer Law unless the proposed amendment is supported by at least four other parties, including three other states. In the event that Queensland seeks to change the law to address state concerns, Queensland will have the initial option of proceeding to obtain agreement from parties to the Intergovernmental Agreement for the Australian Consumer Law to amend the Australian Consumer Law. So if Queensland is unable to progress an amendment through the process agreed in the IGA, Queensland will still be able to take legislative action but consideration should be given to the extent that the amendment to Queensland legislation is not directly or indirectly inconsistent with Commonwealth Law. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1137535"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No, we can introduce laws ourselves so long as it is not inconsistent with the Commonwealth law which obviously prevails.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137536"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Stevens:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Yes, correct. If we want a law that is different it is different. We have to get agreement.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137537"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Of course it is different. There is no impediment to Queensland enacting legislation itself. If the amendment is considered to be inconsistent with the intention of the Australian Consumer Law, the amendment may be seen by the Commonwealth or other parties as being counter to the agreement to have a uniform national consumer law and the development of a seamless national economy. Queensland also has the option of discounting any new law via regulation. There are checks and balances through both the IGA and the provisions of the bill. The member for Mermaid Waters also referred to the Productivity Commission’s estimate of savings of $1.5 billion to $4.5 billion. This was a broad estimate applying to savings right across the reforms to the consumer policy framework which remains a work in progress. With regard to facilitation payments, Queensland has agreed to forego some revenue streams in the national interest and in the interest of the indirect benefits accruing to Queensland business.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137538"></A>
The member also seems to be concerned that all power is being handed to the Commonwealth under the ACL application model. In doing so he is failing to recognise the nature of federalism in Australia, neglecting the fact that jurisdictions already cooperate in the area of consumer protection to a high degree and neglecting to consider the nature of the multiple regulator model being adopted as part of this reform which will not see Queensland’s regulatory role diminished. The ACL is not a shift to centralism; it is a shift to partnership.The member also suggests all redress under the ACL will be sought and provided through the ACCC. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Mr Stevens:</Hansard-Member-Down>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137540"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 With respect to the member, in this he is wrong. The reform adopts a multiple regulator model, with more effective coordination of actions by regulators, but those regulators still enforce the law in their jurisdictions. The Office of Fair Trading will have access to all the powers and enforcement tools available to the ACCC. Queensland’s application law allows access to the Queensland courts just as was the case with the Fair Trading Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137541"></A>
With regard to business contracts, clearly this is a complex question and there are powerful arguments in favour of certainty of contracts at the business-to-business level.

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148597"></A>
I thank the member for Brisbane Central for her comments on the bill. The member rightly discussed the proportionality the courts will bring to penalties to be applied. Importantly, she noted that the important role of the Commissioner for Fair Trading will continue in the context of the reforms recommended by the Service Delivery and Performance Commission. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148601"></A>
I can tell the member for Mermaid Beach that there are no audit requirements. There is a mandatory membership requirement, but there are no audit requirements with the security registers. The bill implements the remaining elements of stage 1 of the 2008 agreement about the security industry. Specifically, the bill introduces the mandatory fingerprinting of all security providers to improve identification of licensees and more comprehensive ongoing probity. The bill also adds terrorism offences to the list of disqualifying offences for holding a security provider’s licence. Members opposite raised concerns from the National Security Association of Australia, which I have addressed. There is no requirement for an audit. Rural and remote security provider licensees and licence applicants will be permitted to have traditional wet prints taken or the mobile LiveScan unit will be made use of. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148604"></A>
The member for Mermaid Beach asked whether the legislation would solve the problem of outlaw motorcycle or bikie gangs that have infiltrated the security industry. To a great extent the answer is yes. An applicant’s fingerprints will be checked against latent prints left at unsolved crime scenes. If there is a match, the Queensland Police Service will investigate it further and, if it is found that the person has committed a crime, obviously they will be charged. I note that the infiltration of outlaw motorcycle gangs is a matter for the Queensland Police Service. The Security Providers Act allows the Commissioner of Police to provide criminal intelligence to the chief executive of the department when the commissioner is of the opinion that the suitability of the applicant is in question. This allows for policing regarding outlaw motorcycle gangs to reach into the licensing regime under the Security Providers Act. </Hansard-Body>

I thank all the hardworking government officers from around Australia who have worked diligently on developing the Australian Consumer Law.

 Fair Trading (Australian Consumer Law) Amendment Bill, explanatory notes to Mr Stevens’s amendments [<HypertextLink>

<A ID="pgfId-1148618"></A>
The objective of the amendments is to legislatively ensure sovereignty for Queensland. Any future amendments to the Australian Consumer Law, which is being adopted from schedule 2 of the Commonwealth’s Competition and Consumer Act 2010, might arise and affect Queensland. The proposed amendments to the Fair Trading (Australian Consumer Law) Amendment Bill 2010 will make certain Queensland’s legislative power is preserved in relation to consumer law into the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148620"></A>
These amendments have either been introduced by the Western Australian government or are about to be introduced by the Western Australian government. Therefore, the minister’s argument about harmonisation across Australia would be better served if the two most important states that are effectively dealing with consumer protection, that is, Western Australia and Queensland, harmonised their legislation rather than taking on board everything that Canberra says and not thinking of the future interests of Queensland consumers. Any power to amend the Australian Consumer Law in the future, which would take effect immediately, needs to be changed so that the parliament of Queensland can also consider those amendments. In that way we retain state control over amendments to consumer issues that may arise in the future. I bring to the minister’s attention the fact that what we have today in consumer law protection may well not be what is required in the years to come. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148621"></A>
Again I allude to the period where it almost started. If there is a scheme around that of dubious intent, most likely its birthplace will be the Gold Coast. The minister would be well aware of the rise and rise of telemarketers in Queensland and then nationally in the 1990s through to the 2000s. That created many problems when Merri Rose was the minister, a long time ago. Clearly those matters had to be addressed in Queensland’s interests. Currently, there is a downturn in the telemarketing industry. However, we may well see that practice come back to Queensland in the future. If that were to happen, we would not be able to, as the minister said, change the Australian Consumer Law to suit Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148622"></A>
As the minister would be aware, and the advice would be given, if we wanted to do something that the other states did not agree with because it disharmonised the Australian Consumer Law and they did not want to attack the interests of Queenslanders dealing with telemarketers, we would have to disengage ourselves, which we could do as I understand it by giving notice. However, then we would be completely out of step with the Australian Consumer Law. Then, if the Commonwealth--</Hansard-Body>

Mr Lawlor:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 You can’t have it both ways. You want harmonisation yet you want the ability to opt out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148624"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 We have harmonisation. The minister is not listening. We have harmonisation with the law. We have agreed to adopt the law, but we want Queenslanders to have the right to protect their future. Clearly, the minister is saying, ‘Trust me, you have that.’ However, we do not have that because we have to go through the Australian Commonwealth law. The minister would know that the interests of Victoria, New South Wales and, in particular, Tasmania are different to those of Queensland. To say that we have that coverage is not correct. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148625"></A>
I support some matters that are raising their heads in our community right now. They should be looked at from a consumer point of view. Should we be the government, we would certainly look at ways that we could possibly assist. We are seeing a rising trend in people supplying a product on what we call plastic cards or credit cards so that they can pass the credit charges on to the consumer. In the future that may well be something that Queenslanders will wish to address and I feel that they should.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148626"></A>
I remember clearly when the credit card was introduced to consumers on the basis that it was secure--the payment was guaranteed, unlike with cheques--and it was easy for shoppers to use it if they did not have cash and the retailer did not want to take a cheque. That is how it started. In other words, the retailer or the seller of goods was prepared to wear that small cost to ensure that they were paid and there was a capacity to generate more sales because of the convenience of the plastic card. That has changed, as the minister would be aware. Even when paying your Telstra bill, they say, ‘We are going to charge you if you pay by credit card.’ Now they have gone the other way and are charging for credit card payments. The consumer is again footing the bill when it was never intended for the consumer to foot the bill with the introduction of the plastic credit card. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1154499"></A>
Future consumer protections for Queenslanders are an important matter. In relation to the advertising of three-year-free deals, which is a very common practice, we all know that there is no such thing as a free deal. The charges for that deal are incorporated into the price of the product. A lot of the retailers around the place are now selling finance, inducing people to take the product without any charges for two or three years when the costs of finance on those goods over three years are incorporated into the prices charged. That may well be an issue that Queenslanders would like to see in their consumer law. But have we got that capacity? No. We have to go along with the Australian Consumer Law. If the Australian Consumer Law does not agree then we would have to go and get the support of three states plus a territory to introduce laws to protect Queenslanders. I feel that that lets us down in the future. Western Australia has adopted this model that I am presenting to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1154503"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Correct. They are looking after the Western Australian residents and consumers. The Western Australian government are looking after the Western Australian consumers. They have harmonised. They have adopted the Australian Consumer Law. They cannot be faulted in what they are doing. They are passing on the savings and all of those things that are consistent with the COAG agreement. But are they protecting Western Australia’s consumers? Yes. Is Queensland going to protect our consumers for the future by agreeing to let it go across to Commonwealth legislation? No. That is why this amendment is one that should be supported by this House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1154504"></A>
It does not change the Australian Consumer Law. It does not break the harmonisation. Quite clearly, it adopts the Australian Consumer Law model in its entirety. But if in the future we have a matter--and I have just identified a couple that may or may not come to fruition--that is in Queensland’s interests to go it alone, then we will have the capacity to put through amendments to the Australian Consumer Law that suit Queensland. So we would have the Australian Consumer Law plus Queensland law, if it were that important to us. We would understand in that scenario that we would be out of step with the Australian Consumer Law in the future, but we would still have that capacity without having to change or drop the Australian Consumer Law harmonisation across Australia. We have to give six months notice to drop out of the current system of Australian Consumer Law. We certainly would not have to ask New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, the Northern Territory or the ACT for their permission to change Queensland’s laws. I strongly commend this amendment to the House. I do hope for support from the government on this matter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1154505"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I hate to disappoint the member for Mermaid Beach, but we will be opposing this amendment which has been lifted straight from the WA legislation. As the bill stands, due to the application law model used to adopt the Australian Consumer Law as a law of Queensland, any change to the text of the law will be enacted in every jurisdiction, except WA, without the need for any legislative amendment. Also, as the bill stands, the sovereignty of Queensland is protected, as any modification made by the Commonwealth to the Australian Consumer Law text can be declared through a regulation-making power to be excluded from operation in Queensland. Queensland has a period of two months during which the regulation must be enacted for the exclusion to be valid. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1154506"></A>
The member for Mermaid Beach wants to involve the Legislative Assembly of Queensland and burden it with dealing with every single amendment made to the Australian Consumer Law no matter how minor it is. The proposal is the equivalent of wasting the government’s time by reading out every act that references the Personal Property Securities Act, which also seems to be high on the list of the member’s concerns. The government has taken a sensible approach to allow amendments by exception. Let me restate that, under the bill, any modification made by the Commonwealth to the Australian Consumer Law text can be declared through a regulation-making power to be excluded from operation in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1154508"></A>
The amendments proposed by the member for Mermaid Beach would require specific parliamentary attention to each and every change to the Australian Consumer Law whether inconsequential or major and whether agreeable to Queensland or not. In contrast, the bill as it stands allows Queensland to retain control over the content of the Australian Consumer Law and its regulations whilst allowing changes agreed under the process provided by the IGA or changes to the nature of legislative housekeeping to have automatic effect. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1154509"></A>
The current provisions allow for the sovereignty of the state to be respected but in an efficient and effective way, without placing an undue and unnecessary burden on the government. It is worth making the point that Queensland is not ceding powers irrevocably. This is a scheme that adopts the Australian Consumer Law text as a law of Queensland. Ultimately, if it were the case that the matter was such that it was felt by this parliament, or indeed the next one or the one after that, that part of the Australian Consumer Law or the scheme in general was so inappropriate and unable to be endured in Queensland, then ultimately we would have the ability to withdraw in a legislative sense. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1154510"></A>
The second change the member for Mermaid Beach is seeking is to require Queensland to gazette the notifications made by the Commonwealth minister under the Australian Consumer Law. The amendment also provides that if Queensland does not gazette the notification within 28 days of the notification being made then the notification ceases to have effect in Queensland. What we have here is a proposal that attempts to confuse business--it will anyway; I do not know whether that is the intent. It probably is not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1154511"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Stevens:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 How will it confuse? It will not confuse them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1154512"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Okay. The proposal attempts to undermine the agreed national approach and adds unnecessary activities required by the government. I reiterate that the proposed amendment deals with notifications that only a Commonwealth minister can make. These are not notifications made by the Queensland minister. The bill correctly provides that notifications made by the Queensland minister must publish a gazette notice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1154513"></A>
If the Commonwealth minister makes a notification--for example, that is for a permanent ban order on a particular consumer good--the notification will have effect for corporations whether or not Queensland gazettes the notifications. So, instead of looking in one place to see if there is a permanent ban on a particular consumer good, business and consumers will need to look to see if Queensland did not gazette the notification which would mean that the ban would not be in place in Queensland. They would have to see if it was not in the <Hansard-Italic>
Government Gazette</Hansard-Italic>
. They would also have to understand that, even if the notification is not in the <Hansard-Italic>
Government Gazette</Hansard-Italic>
, the permanent ban still applies to corporations through the Constitution. This is a ridiculous suggestion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1154514"></A>

Mr Stevens:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 It is not. Western Australia enjoys it. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Well, how can I explain the mentality of Western Australians? Just because Western Australia does it, I do not see that as a reason we should have it. The government is opposing the amendments. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms JONES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will start my speech on the proposed revocation of part of Mungkan Kandju National Park. As members of parliament will recall, the Premier and I spoke about the sorry history of the Archer Bend section of this park when the motion was tabled on 6 October this year. The former Bjelke-Petersen government declared this area as a national park in 1977, thus preventing the acquisition of the Archer Bend pastoral holdings by Aboriginal interests, including the late John Koowarta and others. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160393"></A>
The proposed revocation will address this historic injustice by providing for the return of a significant area to Aboriginal traditional owners as Aboriginal freehold land. The area to be revoked is the north-western corner of the park north of Archer River. It covers about 75,850 hectares, which is 44 per cent of the Archer Bend section and 17 per cent of the whole park. The key conservation values in the area will be protected through a nature refuge which will cover 43 per cent of the area revoked from the park. The government will provide financial and practical assistance to traditional owners for conservation management of this nature refuge.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1166552"></A>
This will also support training opportunities for local Indigenous people to develop the skills needed for ongoing management of their land and could potentially provide a career path to jobs in natural resource management and with the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service. For example, one of the Lama Lama traditional owners has assumed a significant management role, effectively as ranger in charge in the Coen district. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1166554"></A>
The return of this area as Aboriginal freehold will provide opportunities for the Wik Mungkan people to manage the cultural and natural values of the land. It will allow them to establish living places and business enterprises on their traditional lands. Traditional owners and the government have negotiated that 83 per cent or about 380,000 hectares of Mungkan Kandju National Park will remain a national park due to its high conservation values and many popular sites for visitors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1166556"></A>
That means the park will continue to protect the Archer and Coen rivers corridor and associated wetlands and wildlife. The park will in future be jointly managed by the state and the traditional owners. This will provide for continuing conservation of the natural and cultural values of the area and for visitor access to the many camp sites in the park. The conversion of most of the Mungkan Kandju National Park to a jointly managed national park and the revocation of a return of part of that land to traditional owners is a significant outcome of the government’s Cape York Peninsula Tenure Resolution Program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1166558"></A>
I take this opportunity to thank the staff of the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, including Buzz Symonds who is here tonight, for the great work that they have done in working with the traditional owners to make this an historic outcome. I also thank a number of other key players who have made this possible--of course the Wik Mungkan people, the Balkanu Cape York Development Corporation, the Cape York Land Council, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Wilderness Society. I thank them for their constructive negotiations during this time. Through this tenure resolution program the government has transferred more than 600,000 hectares of Aboriginal and freehold land and declared more than 570,000 hectares as national parks managed jointly and cooperatively with Aboriginal traditional owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1166560"></A>
I must also point out that what is being put forward before the House tonight would never have been possible under a conservative government. It was conservative politics that was responsible for this shameful chapter in Queensland’s Indigenous history. It was a travesty of justice and a corrupt use of government power motivated solely by a spiteful determination to deny the rights of the Wik Mungkan people. </Hansard-Body>

I take the interjection that this is what Queensland was like before I was born. I am very pleased to say that that is not the Queensland that I live in today and it is not the Queensland that my child was born into. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1166563"></A>
I hope the measures we are taking today go some way to easing the genuine hurt that many Indigenous people felt in 1977 and help repair the years of sour relationships that followed due to the attitudes of the conservatives towards Indigenous land rights. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1166564"></A>
I will now address the proposed revocation of the Munburra Resources Reserve--another outcome of the Cape York Tenure Resolution Program. This reserve covers 6,730 hectares and lies about 60 kilometres northwest of Cooktown. It was previously part of the Starcke Pastoral Holdings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1166567"></A>
The Queensland government bought the Starcke Pastoral Holdings in 1994 for conservation of natural and cultural resources and the return of homelands to traditional owners. About two-thirds of the property was then included in national parks and about one-third was granted as Aboriginal freehold land. A small section was dedicated as the Munburra Resources Reserve in 1995 to allow mining exploration to take place. The government intended that after 15 years the resource reserve would be revoked, except for any granted mining leases, and the revoked area would be granted as Aboriginal land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1166569"></A>
As 15 years have elapsed it is now proposed that the whole resource reserve be revoked. The revocation of the resource reserve and the grant of the area as Aboriginal freehold land will finalise the tenure resolution of this area as agreed in 1994. I commend the motion to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr WETTENHALL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Barron River--ALP) (9.47 pm): I rise to second the motion to revoke the dedication of certain protected areas under section 32 of the Nature Conservation Act 1992. In doing so, the member for Cook, who cannot be with us tonight but in whose electorate the subject lands are located, has asked to be associated with my remarks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1166573"></A>
The first part of this proposal involves revoking part of Mungkan Kandju National Park so that it can be returned to traditional owners as Aboriginal freehold land. As the Premier emphasised when this proposal was tabled in October, the revocation of any national park should never be taken lightly and should only be contemplated in exceptional circumstances. These are the most exceptional circumstances. The Archer Bend section of this park has an exceptional history. Over 30 years ago the Wik Mungkan people were endeavouring to regain their traditional lands by purchasing the Archer Bend pastoral holding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172677"></A>
Following High Court proceedings that declared the Queensland government’s blocking of that transaction unlawful under the Racial Discrimination Act, they were then thwarted by the former Bjelke-Petersen government in December 1977 when, to thwart their aspirations and to thwart the decisions of the highest court in the land, the areas were declared as a national park in one of the most shameful episodes in Queensland’s history. Without any doubt, the Bjelke-Petersen government deliberately set out to prevent the traditional owners from acquiring their lands and without doubt that was, in addition to being a travesty of justice, an abuse of the national park process. Instead of protecting the area for its conservation values, which are significant, the primary purpose of that action was to deny justice to the late John Koowarta and his people. An unintended consequence of the action was the confirmation of the validity of the federal Racial Discrimination Act under the Australian Constitution.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172685"></A>
This proposed revocation will set right a grave historical injustice. The Archer River is a major waterway that has sustained the Wik Mungkan people and their country for countless generations. The area includes many story sites of great importance to the traditional owners. It is important to note that the conservation sector, although conscious of the importance of maintaining and increasing the size of the protected areas estate throughout Queensland, has acknowledged the special circumstances of the Archer Bend area and has strongly supported the rightful return of these lands to the traditional owners.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172689"></A>
It is also important to note that a large proportion of the park will remain as national park, and this will include all of the existing camp sites for visitors. Members of the public will still be able to enjoy all of the quiet and shady camp sites along the Archer and Coen rivers. The proposed revocation and grant of freehold land will enable the Wik Mungkan people to realise at long last their aspirations to own this part of their traditional lands where they can establish homes and economic enterprises. The significant conservation values of the area will still be protected in the park and the proposed nature refuge, and the park will continue to provide nature based recreational opportunities to the public. I commend the motion to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr ELMES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Noosa--LNP) (9.52 pm): Tonight is one of those rare opportunities when a member of parliament is able to set the tone for a fundamentally important debate, and I welcome the opportunity. If the House is not careful and mindful of the true significance of this debate, it could degenerate into an unedifying slanging match. The effort to which the government has gone to live in the past clearly indicates that that is how it wishes to approach it. That need not--indeed it should not--be the case. The Liberal National Party is in its infancy as a political party. It is little more than two years old. The merging of the Liberal Party, the Country Party and its namesake more recently, the National Party, only happened, as I said, a couple of years ago.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172696"></A>
What we do know is that time and tide wait for no man. Neither does time wait for a political party. As the community evolves and as circumstances change and the needs for the constituency shift, so must political parties merge, morph, adapt and change if they are to remain contemporary and if they are to remain relevant. While the LNP is immensely proud of its roots and immensely proud of its achievements and celebrates its record, we do not dwell on the past or stand on our record or necessarily the heritage from which we came. We have our sights firmly focused on the future, and we are setting about to write a proud new contemporary history for conservative politics in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172697"></A>
We are determined to protect the environment and our national park estate, and it is increasingly important in the era of climate change that the parks estate is grown, managed and preserved. It is increasingly important that our biodiversity is managed and preserved not only for its heritage value but also because of our interdependency, our future and the future for generations to come. Ours is a critical responsibility, for it comes at a watershed time in the life of this planet. Some at least--and arguably many--of the decisions which we take as the present caretakers of this planet will be irreversible.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172699"></A>
The LNP is also a party which stands for the land rights of our Indigenous communities, and we are able to stand clearly by that statement here tonight in the House by supporting this motion. There can be no clearer statement of the fact of our position and of our commitment to our Indigenous brothers and sisters of the Wik Mungkan people, and let each and every one of them be in no doubt that the LNP is a party committed in partnership to their future. The opportunities are enormous, as is the commitment the Wik Mungkan people must make. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172704"></A>
Above all things, the Liberal National Party is a party which stands for the individual. The LNP is a party which encourages aspiration by the individual, provides for the equality of opportunity, facilitates the way forward by which the individual may achieve and by which the individual may succeed to the advantage of us all--to provide a hand up delivering independence rather than the handout which ensures dependency.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172707"></A>
So while we support the revocation which returns the land to the Wik Mungkan people, it is incumbent on me to articulate the vast differences in approach which we on this side of the House have from those opposite. We support native title, but the present native title arrangements to me are un-Australian. The present native title arrangements mitigate the aspirations of Indigenous Australians to own their own land, to own their own home, to have a job in meaningful employment by which to provide with pride for their own family and their community. The present native title arrangements hold land in community trusts with little practical advantage for the Indigenous community. Native title was a great step forward for Indigenous Australians, but the time since Mabo has shown us the practical flaws. We need this native title concept to advance, to become contemporary so as to meet the emerging needs of Indigenous Australians now in 2010 and in the years ahead and for generations to come.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172714"></A>
We see Indigenous Australians integrated into mainstream Australian society if that is to be their choice. We cannot in conscience support the ongoing maintenance of Aboriginal society as a curiosity of ancient times, as a relic of the past, as a political trophy to be retained in abject neglect so that their so-called natural champion can continually bestow hollow promises to do more on their behalf. Because of the hollowness of those promises, the health, the lifestyle, the aspirations and the hope do not improve one iota while their culture, values and heritage relentlessly shrink and disappear. That self-fulfilling disadvantage is compounded by the contrary wild rivers legislation inhibiting the fulfilment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander aspiration for self-sustainability on the land with which they are intimately connected.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172719"></A>
So this revocation decision, while welcomed, could also be seen as freeholding that which we have not assessed and therefore do not fully understand and therefore could be a disaster from a conservation management standpoint. I am left to wonder why section 18 of the Nature Conservation Act 1992 within part 4 relating to protected areas under division 1 relating to basic concepts could not have been used as a simpler alternative. Section 18 reads--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>

Perhaps the Bligh Labor government does want to see Indigenous people use their land in such a way as to develop economically and sustainably and beyond traditional uses only, in which case I look forward to the repeal of the wild rivers legislation as it affects this parcel to continue the logic of granting freehold over this parcel.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172729"></A>
Earlier in the debate I urged the Wik Mungkan people to rejoice. Why? When we read the fine print in the commitment of what the Bligh Labor government has planned for these lands, three aspects stand out. First is the money. I have said it before and, at the risk of repetition, I will say it here again tonight: the Bligh Labor government is a government that has the rare distinction of going bust in a boom. It is a government addicted to spending and taxing. With the return of this land a dowry of up to $79,800 from DERM over three years--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ELMES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 With the return of this land goes a dowry of up to $79,500 from DERM over three years. The Wik Mungkan people need to grab the joy tonight in armfuls, because here is a commitment that is full of escape clauses and wriggle room. If all of the ifs and buts and hurdles and objects are negotiated successfully, then that may be provided as $50,000 over three years if the land becomes a nature reserve through a land management agreement with DERM. Much of the commitment is for a planning study, partially funded by the Commonwealth, which no doubt will include full cost recovery of the DERM contribution and which will involve minimum funds to support the self-determination for these lands by traditional owners. It looks a bit like a Clayton’s commitment to me. Of course, given the political capital that the Bligh Labor government has burned in this term alone, I am deeply suspicious of any pronouncement or announcement that it makes. So I naturally look for the flaws and in this instance I have not had to look too far. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1178969"></A>
The second aspect is that only 17 per cent of the Mungkan Kandju National Park appears to be being handed back to the traditional owners. The Premier, in speaking to this motion on 6 October 2010, expressed great pleasure that--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1178971"></A>
... thousands of hectares of land taken from Indigenous people on Cape York more than 30 years ago will be returned to its rightful owners. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1178972"></A>
She went on to say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1178974"></A>
This decision puts an end to a shameful chapter in Queensland’s Indigenous history. It changes the outcome of a long legal battle which saw the legitimate legal rights of the Indigenous people of Cape York circumvented by what can only be described as a shocking abuse of power. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>

Of course, the reality is that if the decision was as shameful as the Premier is on the public record as saying it is, then she has redressed only 17 per cent of the shame. When I first heard the Premier speak, I assumed that all 457,000 hectares of the lands were to be returned. Of course, that is the impression that the Premier was trying to create. But she is quite happy for 83 per cent of the national park to be retained by the state. Is she, in fact, saying that the 1977 decision was 83 per cent correct and only 17 per cent wrong? In fact, the 83 per cent of the land being retained as national park is due to its high conservation values. Could it be that the 1977 decision was correct in conservation terms? </Hansard-Body>

The national park at Archer Bend was created in 1977 under a recommendation from a senior ecologist from the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service as a result of a systematic and scientifically based assessment of Queensland’s natural ecosystems using RAKES--the rapid assessment of key and endangered sites--</Hansard-Body>

 to note that it is the member for Barron River up the back who is carrying on like a pork chop.

<A ID="pgfId-1178981"></A>
There is more. The minister in a press release said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1178983"></A>
Archer Bend is a place of enormous significance to its people--returning the land as Aboriginal freehold is the right thing to do. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1178984"></A>
Yet of the 75,330 hectares of the total area of 457 hectares of the Mungkan Kandju National Park being revoked by this motion, 32,478 hectares--or 43 per cent--will not be returned as freehold as the right thing to do but retained as a nature refuge. The messages being sent here are clearly very mixed. On one hand the impression being created for consumption by the Queensland public is that a decision of the past, in the words of the Premier and the minister, was truly evil and that this wondrous decision by the Bligh Labor government will right that wrong. But in reality it rights only 9.42 per cent of the alleged wrong. The member for Cook, Jason O’Brien, in welcoming the revocation is reported as saying--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1178986"></A>
This is an historical occasion and a healing moment for the local indigenous community ... This is about righting a great injustice in Australian history. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1178987"></A>
Cutting to the chase, at best it rights 9.42 per cent of the perceived wrong--the wrongness of which appears to be arguable, a case supported by the retention of 90.58 per cent of the area as national park because of its high conservation value or as a nature refuge. But there is still more. The package of assistance valued at $79,500 and achievable only if all fine print conditions are met is not to help the Wik Mungkan people look after their freehold land at all but to care for the nature refuge and the possibility of any compensation is specifically excluded. The final nail in the coffin of credibility is that the Bligh Labor government has also excluded the possibility that this great righting of a wrong is unique and is not to be regarded as a precedent. So while the Wik Mungkan people can rejoice in what is a modest outcome, every other Indigenous community in the state should be aware that the Bligh Labor government is not about to do anything to help them and their particular aspirations. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1178988"></A>
The third is a very practical request on behalf of the community of Cape York and elsewhere. I heard in the speech that the member for Barron River gave that other Indigenous people and non-Indigenous people will be allowed access to the land. That is, of course, a welcome thing. </Hansard-Body>

There is another matter included in this revocation, which until tonight had not appeared in any speech by the Premier or the minister. I refer to tabled paper No. 3309, which the minister tabled and formally laid on the table of the House on 6 October 2010. This paper addresses two revocations: the revocation of Archer Bend and the revocation of a small parcel of land--6,730 hectares--some 60 kilometres north-west of Cooktown known as Munburra Resource Reserve. This area experienced some interest from goldminers in the early 1900s--interest that was dormant until the 1980s. According to the tabled paper, the parcel was dedicated in 1995, but no date is given, to allow for mining exploration with the intent that after 15 years it should be revoked and granted as Aboriginal freehold land except for any areas covered by mining interests. The paper does not confirm that 15 years have, in fact, elapsed or whether any of the area is still covered by mining interests, although I suspect not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1178994"></A>
Aside from that, on behalf of the LNP I welcome this action by the Bligh Labor government in revoking this parcel of land to become freehold land for the Wik Mungkan people and I look forward to celebrating their use of that land for their mutual and individual benefit. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The past is a foreign country: They do things differently there.  </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179001"></A>
Tonight we debate the revocation of a 1977 decision to protect 457,000 hectares of land for conservation on Cape York. Hartley is right: the past is a foreign country; they did do things differently there for any number of justifiable reasons that only those contemporary to the times know best--good reasons and bad reasons. I will return to the past shortly, but let me focus initially on the present and on this revocation, specifically the LNP’s position with regard to it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179002"></A>
The LNP, as outlined eruditely by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Noosa, is determined to protect the environment and our national park estate. The LNP stands for Indigenous land rights, the LNP stands for Indigenous advancement, and there is example after example of where we have done so, particularly in the political realm. Having visited the Aboriginal community of Cherbourg numerous times in my former role with Child Safety, I am committed and passionate about Indigenous advancement. I readily acknowledge that I do not have the answers, but I hope that the good people of the electorate of Glass House will give me the time to work with local and Queensland’s Indigenous people to unearth the answers and deliver real outcomes for them and their communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185310"></A>
The LNP also supports native title but a native title that allows Indigenous Australians to own their own home and be employed in their own community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185313"></A>
As I said, before concluding I do want to touch on one part of the past, again raised by the shadow minister. Clearly, the decision made in 1977 had considerable merit. Through advice at the time from a senior ecologist and scientifically based assessment, the government chose to protect 457 hectares through the Nature Conservation Act. The fact that this revocation seeks to revoke the protection of only 75,000 hectares suggests that the original decision, taken because of the high conservation value of the area, was very, very close to the mark. When we consider that 32,000 hectares of this revoked parcel of land will remain a nature refuge, we again must highlight clearly that there was much merit in the original decision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185314"></A>
That said, I do congratulate the Wik Mungkan people. This is their day. This is a great outcome for them. As the shadow minister said, it is a day to rejoice and we share your joy. I, too, wish you all the best in your ongoing negotiations with the government on the use of your land, but be wary and be cautious. There are few Queenslanders left who trust this Bligh Labor government to keep its word. Today, though, is a day for you to celebrate.<Hansard-Speech-End>

(10.10 pm), in reply: I thank everybody for supporting the motion, although I am a little bit confused. The shadow minister said that this was a very mild, modest arrangement that did not really deliver for the Mungkan Kandju people. Then the other member from the LNP speaking here tonight said that it was a great day. Those opposite might not agree exactly on their positions--I know that this is a tough night for the LNP--however I thank them for supporting the motion tonight because it is the right thing to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185317"></A>
Before I conclude--I know that everyone is keen to finish--I want to clarify the situation. I think the shadow minister did not quite grasp what is happening tonight and what this actually means. This means that all of the lands that we are talking about will be owned 100 per cent freehold by the traditional owners, the Mungkan Kandju people. It is only because of the generosity of these people that they are willing to enter into a joint management arrangement of the national park because they, too, recognise the significant conservation values and are allowing 83 per cent of this land to be national park. What is happening tonight is that 100 per cent will be recognised as Aboriginal freehold land by the traditional owners. </Hansard-Body>

I want to put on the record once again my thanks to everybody who has been involved in making sure that this happens in a transparent and fair way.

That the Queensland parliament welcomes the recent release of Aung San Suu Kyi after having spent more than 15 of the last 21 years under house arrest but also notes Amnesty International’s concerns that more than 2,200 political prisoners, many of them prisoners of conscience, continue to languish behind bars in Burma Myanmar, including Mon monk Oakkan Tha, who was sentenced on the third anniversary of the crackdown on the saffron revolution to 15 years in prison for ‘anti-election activities’. The parliament of Queensland calls for protection of human rights in Burma and joins the international community in specifically calling for the three freedoms--of expression, assembly and association--to be protected. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

(10.14 pm): I am very pleased to second the motion moved by the member for Murrumba. In the history of most countries there is usually a hero who has made a great personal sacrifice to build that nation or to free its people. Whether we are looking at Mandela, Gandhi or Lincoln, they have in common great love and compassion for their country and its people and a willingness to sacrifice anything they have for their country and the freedom of its people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185329"></A>
On our doorstep we have one such person, Aung San Suu Kyi. Aung San could not sit by for decades of brutal oppression by one of the world’s most ruthless and closed military dictatorships. I would like to just give a brief outline of Aung San’s life. She was born in 1945 and at the age of two her father was assassinated in Burma. Her mother followed her father to become a prominent public figure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185330"></A>
In 1958 the Independent Union of Burma was established. In 1967, while studying at Oxford, she met Michael Aris, who later became her husband. In 1972 Aung San became a research officer in the Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Bhutan. In 1988 her mother died. That year saw the resignation of General Ne Win, the military dictator of Burma since 1962. Aung San, in her first political action, sent an open letter to the government asking for the formation of an independent consultative committee to prepare multiparty elections. In 1988 she delivered her first political speech calling for democratic government. In September of that year the military established the State Law and Order Restoration Committee banning political gatherings of four people or more, and arrests and sentencing without trial were reaffirmed. In 1989, at her mother’s funeral, Aung San declared that she would serve the people of Burma even unto her death, just like her mother and father before her.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185332"></A>
In February 1989 she was prohibited from standing for election. In July 1989 she was placed under house arrest without charge or trial. She went on a hunger strike, asking to be put in prison to join students who had been arrested at her home. She ended her hunger strike on assurances of good treatment for those imprisoned students. In 1990, despite the detention of Aung San, her party won the election with 82 per cent of the parliamentary seats. The State Law and Order Restoration Committee refused to recognise the election result. In October 1990 Aung San was awarded the Sakharov Human Rights Prize by the European parliament and the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that she was the winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185333"></A>
In 1992 she announced that the $1.3 million in prize money would establish a health and education trust for Burmese people. In 1995 the SLORC released Aung San from house arrest after six years of detention. Even though she was stopped from speaking at large gatherings, her popularity among the Burmese people had not diminished. The SLORC changed its name to the State Peace and Development Council but its repressive policies and violation of human rights continued unabated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1185334"></A>
Suu Kyi discouraged tourism and overseas investment in the country until it was free. In 1999 her husband died in London of prostate cancer. His requests for Aung San to visit him one last time were rejected. They had not seen each other since Christmas 1995. The separation between her and her husband was regarded by Aung San as one of the sacrifices she had to make in order to work for a free Burma. </Hansard-Body>

I have had a personal interest in Burma for a number of years. On 25 October two years ago I held a Burmese human rights seminar in this very parliament. On that occasion I spoke about the terrible abuse of the Karen minority, including forced relocation, destruction of cropping lands, destruction of villages, placing of landmines on their land and the forcing of many people into refugee camps, many across the border into Thailand where they reside to this day.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1191742"></A>
In a country like Australia where basic human rights are often taken for granted, I urge everyone not to forget that basic human rights, such as the right to have enough food and to have shelter, to be assured of personal safety for yourself and your family, to have freedom from fear of being killed or imprisoned, to have freedom of movement and assembly and to have freedom from forced labour and forced relocation are not available to all in our world. </Hansard-Body>

Three days after the devastating cyclone that hit that country, my eldest son landed in Thailand. He went there to do two years of aid work with the Thai wheelchair project, which aims to supply wheelchairs to the 200,000 immobile Thais who are unable to get around because of the absence of a wheelchair. He managed to raise some funds in Brisbane and through the Anglican Church in Sydney. He sourced relief supplies in Chiang Mai in Thailand and arranged some Burmese nationals to take those supplies across the border. As members would be aware, it is estimated that well in excess--and perhaps a long way in excess--of 130,000 people perished, many of them needlessly, because the Burmese government refused to allow either media coverage or aid to reach those people. In a subsequent visit across the Burmese border, my son contracted dengue fever, which would be a problem for many people in that area. He became seriously ill but fortunately survived. </Hansard-Body>

Many people are working to support the Karen refugee community in Brisbane. Mr Rick Plumb, a real estate agent on the north side of Brisbane, and Tamla Paw Dwel, a Karen refugee, spoke in our Burmese human rights seminar. Tamla Paw Dwel spent 10 years under canvas in a refugee camp in Thailand. She was not permitted to obtain work. She was granted a permanent resident visa as a refugee on humanitarian grounds in Australia. She now works as an interpreter for the Karen community. She spoke of her people’s dispossession from their land, of the rape and destruction of their villages, and of the enormous challenge for refugees moving from an agricultural society where they lived in bamboo huts to life in Brisbane where people speak a different language.</Hansard-Body>

Aung San Suu Kyi has described the greatest priority for human rights in her country, Myanmar--or Burma as we know it--to be the release of the country’s estimated 220,00 political prisoners held for no real crime except their political beliefs. We have no way of knowing whether Aung San Suu Kyi will see a modern, free and democratic Burma in her lifetime. She may never know when or whether her country achieves the goal she has sacrificed her entire life to try to bring about. Those of us who live in free countries should not forget those are our brothers and sisters, and they deserve our support. </Hansard-Body>

Finally, I pay tribute to the work of Amnesty International. It is a fact of human nature that most of us are preoccupied with our day-to-day activities and most of us are heavily focused on what happens in the community close around us. It takes special people in organisations such as Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders to bring those human rights abuses to our attention, to ensure that wherever possible there is awareness of and pressure on oppressive regimes, without which there would be no change whatsoever.</Hansard-Body>

On 11 November, all of us here would have stood at some place in our electorates for Armistice Day and on 25 April, we would have done the same for Anzac Day, to remember those who died protecting our freedoms and our way of life. We treat very solemnly--and thankfully it is growing--those two days of remembrance. On each of those days, and in between, we spend time valuing our freedom. We value our freedom of expression, not only in this chamber and this parliament but also in our homes and in our daily lives. We guard greatly that freedom. We also guard the freedom of association, to be able to meet in legal freedom and in normal circumstances, in fellowship with one another. We value the freedom of peaceful assembly. Those are the very things that people in Burma do not have. </Hansard-Body>

Aung San Suu Kyi spent 15 years in prison attempting to bring an awareness of those things to the forefront not only of the Burmese government but also of the governments of the free world. The motion before the House today is intended, through Amnesty, to bring into sharp focus the needs of the people in Burma, the thousands of people who are political prisoners because they hold a point of view that, while valid, is contrary to that of the Burmese government.

Mr MOORHEAD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Waterford--ALP) (10.26 pm): It gives me great pleasure to rise to shine a light on some of the issues facing the people of Burma and on the repression of their human rights. I thank the member for Murrumba and the member for Moggill for the motion before the House tonight and for bringing these matters to the attention of the parliament each year. Recently we have seen elections in Burma, but the lesson that we learnt from those elections was that there is more to democracy than putting a piece of paper into a box. The elections were held against the background of the banning of political parties. They were held against the background of the violence against the Saffron uprising of 2008, which saw people who challenged the government shot, bashed and imprisoned, and the continued house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi who spent 15 of the past 20 years under house arrest despite being the last legitimately elected leader of Burma. </Hansard-Body>

The effect of those human rights abuses has been felt harshly by the people of Burma. Therefore, it is an Australian duty not only to speak about those human rights but also to make practical efforts to protect the victims of those abuses. The member for Logan, the member for Woodridge and I represent communities that are home to many Karen refugees. We are proud to make a home for those people who, in Burma, are an oppressed minority. They have been treated terribly. Many of them spent years in Thai refugee camps, but now they are proud to call Australia, Queensland and Logan their home. On Wednesday night, the member for Gaven, the member for Murrumba and I were attending the Amnesty end-of-year function. We saw a performance by a group of my constituents, the Karen Kangaroos. They are extremely happy to have access to not only the freedom and democratic rights of this country but also the education and employment opportunities that we have provided. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1191768"></A>
However, the oppression in Burma goes beyond democratic oppression. It goes to the oppression of labour standards. Along with the Speaker and the member for Indooroopilly, recently I met with a Bangladeshi group who spoke about the oppression of garment workers in that country. The garment workers in Bangladesh are under pressure to cut their wages, because the Burmese government continues to outlaw collective action in Burma and the protection of labour standards. Burma continues to keep labour standards low, to ensure that garment workers in other countries simply cannot stand up for the wage conditions they deserve. </Hansard-Body>

Amnesty International must be recognised by all of us for its conviction to shine the light on difficult issues and the abuse of human rights. It brings sensible approaches to the respect for international law and support for human rights. Amnesty has taken on some very difficult issues. Amnesty has taken a very strong view on the issue of Israel and Palestine, which is one of the greatest challenges facing the globe at the moment in terms of peace. Amnesty has said, ‘This is an issue from which we need to take away the politics and take away the racial tensions. Let us talk about respect for international law, the 1967 resolutions of the UN and respect for the human rights of all involved’. I commend the motion to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

However, the political circumstances in Burma are still highly problematic. Very often the people of Burma are still being denied the three essential freedoms of peaceful assembly, expression and association. This country is suffering a human rights crisis of a magnitude that we cannot imagine in the Western world. There are, for example, still more than 2,000 political prisoners in Burma today living in inhumane conditions in the prisons, and the only prospect they have is for a flawed, unjust and unfair trial. </Hansard-Body>

Moreover, Amnesty International has reported that the military government oppresses ethnic minorities, who are often expelled from their homes and forced to carry out compulsory, forced labour. Torture is a daily reality and way of life for these people and a common form of instilling terror and getting people to submit and live in some respects a cowardly life. </Hansard-Body>

What I am most shocked about in Burma is the record number of children who are being recruited and press-ganged into fighting as child soldiers. If we do not think that is a bad thing, we only have to look at the murderous regime of Charles Taylor in Africa to see exactly what happens when these young people are recruited as child soldiers. They are utterly scarred and ruined for life. That is one of the greatest travesties that has been visited upon our world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198197"></A>
Amnesty estimates that every fifth soldier of the army of Burma is actually a child soldier. Prisoners are denied sufficient food and basic health care. They are often transferred to remote locations far from their families and support networks. Obviously in that situation where they are so isolated we can only imagine some of the things that must go on. </Hansard-Body>

Aung San Suu Kyi is nothing short of an absolute hero. She was born in Burma and then went to the USA to study and graduated with a BA degree in philosophy, politics and economics. As so often happens, people who are educated, who have a great understanding of what is going on, are often very, very oppressed by ruthless and heartless regimes. She lived in New York City. She worked for the United Nations for three years and then returned to Burma to lead the pro-democracy movement. She founded the National League for Democracy and became its general secretary. In the 1990 general election, Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy won 81 per cent of the seats in parliament. She had, however, already been detained under house arrest before the elections. Each member of this parliament ought to be greatly saddened by the prospect of someone winning 81 per cent of the seats in parliament only to end up being arrested and placed under house detention. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198199"></A>
Aung San Suu Kyi was the daughter of Aung San, considered to be the father of modern-day Burma. He was a founder of the Communist Party of Burma and was instrumental in bringing about Burma’s independence from British colonial rule, but he was assassinated six months before its final achievement. I have also travelled in other regions such as Cambodia, and people who have heard me speak would realise that I am very passionate especially about child sex trafficking in Cambodia. I look at it and think to myself that the utter inhumanity of what goes on in societies that do not value the sanctity of human life is most distressing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198200"></A>
Some of the quotes that I love by Aung San Suu Kyi are: ‘Human beings need freedom and security that they may be able to realise their full potential.’ When I hear that I think of the philosophical or humanitarian mantra of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which states that you cannot move on to the higher things--</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1198202"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FOLEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No. As I said, Maslow’s hierarchy of needs talks about all of those things. The struggle for democracy and human rights in Burma is a struggle for life and dignity. It is a struggle that encompasses our political, social and economic aspirations. Every person deserves the right to live with aspirational values in their life. The quote by Aung San Suu Kyi that I want to finish with is: ‘The only real prison is fear and the only real freedom is freedom from fear.’ I just hope that somehow the freedom that she is experiencing now, reuniting with her husband and with her grandchildren, will in some respects wash away some of the pain and the bitterness that she has experienced in those years of captivity. I commend Amnesty for the work they are doing in this particular area. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (10.37 pm): If 2010 could be placed in a box to be later studied in history, it would be remembered as a year of beginnings and endings--beginnings because it was the year in which we saw the beginning of Queensland’s recovery from the global financial crisis, a year in which we welcomed the end of a devastating crippling drought, and the beginning of a phenomena many children have not witnessed in their lifetime--water supplies at capacity levels. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198213"></A>
It could also be characterised as a year of heartbreak, triumph and closure--heartbreak in the form of a forlorn parade of coffins bringing home the bodies of Queensland and Queensland based boys who gave their lives for their country on the front line in Afghanistan, heartbreak in the form of a one-in-100-year flood which devastated the central west of our state; triumph in the form of our record-breaking Queensland team’s gargantuan effort at the Delhi Olympic Games, the sight of a Queensland teenage girl from the Sunshine Coast bringing her boat through Sydney Heads after her inspiring around-the-world journey and a Gold Coast girl who brought a tear to many a Queensland eye as she reached the French Open tennis final, and the inspirational pictures that we saw from the Vatican as Australia recognised our first saint; and closure because our favourite local sons Powderfinger emotionally called it a day, and closure in the form of an unforgettable haunting image of a lonely slouch hat laying adrift on the sea floor of Queensland alongside of the watery grave of a lost World War II medical ship. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204682"></A>
As we rise for the final time in this place for 2010 and head into the Christmas and new year period, it is important that we reflect on the year that was. It is important that we reflect on what was achieved this year. It is a list of significant and in some cases remarkable achievements of which each and every member of this parliament and each and every Queenslander can be proud. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204684"></A>
It was the year that our government’s $17.1 billion Capital Works Program, supporting 106,000 precious Queensland jobs, saw tangible state-wide results as projects began to rise from the earth; the year that Queensland’s green credentials took even greater shape; the year in which we introduced tough and sweeping reforms across our government, making us the most open, transparent and accountable government in Australia; the year in which we introduced a raft of social reforms to make us a fairer society for every Queenslander; the year in which we continued to plan our Queensland of the future, not just the future decade but the decade after that and the decades after those. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204686"></A>
I am proud to lead a government which is taking Queensland into the future with good planning and strong measures to ensure that our future is bright and prosperous. I am proud to lead a government and a team which is not afraid to take the tough decisions to keep Queensland strong, a government that is determined to keep us strong, smart, green, healthy and fair. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204687"></A>
Our government’s credentials on handling our unprecedented growth speak for themselves, and this year we have built upon them in significant areas. Our Growth Management Summit in March resulted in key measures to help Queensland cope with our more than 100,000 new residents every year, including the announcement of three new South-East Queensland cities--Ripley Valley, Greater Flagstone and Yarrabilba. Along with Caloundra South, these new development areas will help alleviate the pressure being felt across major urban centres in this corner of the state. Central to our growth management strategy is regionalisation, resulting in the introduction of an $11,000 Regional First Home Owner Grant to encourage movement outside of the south-east corner, a boost of $4,000 to the existing First Home Owners Grant for those who choose to build a new home in regional Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204692"></A>
While we have been planning for our growth for the coming decades, we have kept a fixed eye on Queensland’s precious environment. At all costs, our government has determined we will maintain the pristine environment that Queensland is famed for, for our future generations no matter how large our population continues to grow. Our landmark laws to ban broadscale clearing and further protect regrowth vegetation have proven their long-term value and importance, with the latest tree-clearing analysis showing a 48 per cent decrease in tree clearing state-wide in 2010--the lowest annual rate of clearing since 1988.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204695"></A>
We have continued to build upon our strong track record of protecting the state’s natural icons, delivering on our vision for a sustainable North Stradbroke Island and a plan to phase out sandmining after important negotiations with the Quandamooka people. We have also this year announced significant reforms to Queensland’s waste management framework that will see the creation of new green jobs, that will stop Queensland from being Australia’s dumping ground and that will pour unprecedented funding into recycling and the environment through a levy on industrial waste going to landfill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204698"></A>
Queensland’s national park estate expanded with an additional 178,448 hectares in 2009-10, and we saw a commitment of $56 million over the next five years to acquire more land for protection, particularly national parks. This is the most significant injection of funds into new national parks in 20 years. The Wenlock River is one of Australia’s spectacular natural assets, and our government has protected it for current and future generations through our wild rivers legislation, allowing for economic development to occur in harmony with a healthy river environment. This is our 10th wild rivers declaration. This year the Wild River Rangers Program took on a new partner, Australia Zoo, to perform ranger activities on the Steve Irwin Wildlife Reserve in the Wenlock River catchment. By joining forces with Australia Zoo, we give a further guarantee for the environmental future of this beautiful part of our state and the world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204704"></A>
As well as being Australia’s greenest state, we are determined to be the fairest. That is why we have taken great strides this year in social justice by helping out our most vulnerable citizens and looking after our children and our elderly. We have continued to put investment into those families who care for a loved one with a disability, and that will continue to be one of our priorities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204705"></A>
We have introduced a new partial defence to murder for victims of seriously abusive relationships who kill their abusers. We have legislated to ensure convicted paedophiles must serve an actual sentence of imprisonment, unless there are exceptional circumstances. We have created a Sentencing Advisory Council that will ensure balanced public debate about sentencing issues and inject community opinion into the sentencing process. We will introduce standard non-parole periods to ensure jail time fits the crime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204708"></A>
Justice is also about righting the wrongs. I am very proud that 2010 saw our government insert a preamble to the Queensland Constitution, a preamble that gives formal recognition to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of our state. This preamble is not only an important statement for Indigenous Queenslanders but one for all Australians. With it, we take another step forward on the path to reconciliation. It represents both an acknowledgement of where we come from and a vision for the society that Queenslanders strive for, a society founded on the principles of democracy, freedom and peace. Australia is home to the oldest living culture on earth, and in Queensland we are uniquely home to two Indigenous cultures. This is not only something we should recognise, it is something we should celebrate, and the preamble to our Constitution does just that. I am also equally pleased that we have seen justice done this evening with the revocation of land that rightly belongs to the Koowarta family. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204710"></A>
While we continue to maintain the toughest but fairest system of justice and law and order in the country, it is imperative that we also run the most open, accountable and transparent system of government. In 2010, our government completed the most significant program of integrity and accountability reform since the Fitzgerald inquiry. It was based on our response to the Integrity and Accountability in Queensland document released in November 2009 which was developed after an extensive public consultation period. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204712"></A>
The new Ministerial and Other Office Holders Staff Act commenced on 1 November, providing us with, for the first time, a transparent framework for the employment of ministerial and opposition staff separate to the Public Service. Whistleblower protection in Queensland has been overhauled, a single Public Service code of conduct has been adopted, the Public Service Commission’s responsibilities for setting ethical standards in the Public Service have been strengthened, and we have imposed new statutory requirements for members of parliament to declare their personal interests. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204717"></A>
The new Integrity Act established Australia’s first legislative scheme for the regulation of a lobbying industry, and we banned the payment of success fees. In addition to these measures, we have also established the new ethical standards branch within the Public Service Commission. Less than a year after releasing the blueprint for integrity reform, our government has delivered on its commitments. After leading the nation in transparency through new right to information laws, Queensland is once again setting the bar for accountability for the other states of our federation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204718"></A>
We are committed to giving all young Queenslanders the very best start in life. That is why we released the Flying Start green paper, seeking views on reforming Queensland’s education system. It is why we opened six new kindergartens as part of our commitment to universal access to kindy by 2014, with the rollout of 240 kindergarten services. It is why this year we took our campaign against bullying in Queensland schools to a new level, appointing Dr Michael Carr-Gregg as the government’s antibullying expert and signing the historic Queensland schools declaration against bullying and violence by all school sectors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204720"></A>
In 2010, we once again saw the results of maintaining our massive infrastructure and building program, the biggest and most ambitious in Australia. This program was key to us here in Queensland staring down the fallout of the global financial crisis. To abandon it in the face of the GFC was simply not an option for a Labor government. We are committed to the 106,000 jobs that it supports. We are committed to building the Queensland of today for the Queenslanders of tomorrow. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211220"></A>
2010 saw a number of significant achievements. We saw the opening of the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridge, otherwise known as the Gateway duplication. We also saw the opening of the first stage of the Forgan Bridge in Mackay and the Ted Smout Bridge linking Redcliffe. We saw major progress on the Northern Busway and the Airport Link project, including opening of the airport roundabout flyover and the scrapping of the airport roundabout. We saw major progress in the planning of the Cross River Rail project. The first stages of the Gold Coast Rapid Transit network began to take shape. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211226"></A>
We secured a commitment from the federal government to join state and local governments to build the Moreton rail link. We commenced construction on the Queensland Children’s Hospital. We commenced the upgrade of the Goonyella to Abbot Point coal network. We made major progress in the redevelopment of the Lotus Glen Correctional Centre in North Queensland. We bought forward planning and development of the rail link from Darra to Springfield. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211228"></A>
Amid all of this flurry of building activity, of which the projects I have mentioned are just the tip of the iceberg, we made major inroads in what is for Queensland a brand-new industry. The state’s LNG industry offers Queensland a unique opportunity for a generation of employment. A $15 billion investment decision by British Gas in October 2010 is the first commitment from an industry anticipated to create 18,000 direct and indirect jobs in Queensland, with many of those flowing appropriately to regional communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211230"></A>
This new industry is becoming an exciting reality. It is bringing both new challenges and tremendous opportunities for our state. So far three LNG proponents have received high-level state approvals and two of these have Commonwealth approval. This process has taken up to two years of intense examination and assessment and it includes some of the most stringent environmental conditions ever imposed on any industry in Australia. The British Gas project is the subject of 1,300 environmental and social conditions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211231"></A>
This reflects our government’s commitment to strike the right balance between economic development and our precious environment. As LNG enters this next phase of development it is our priority to make sure it meets the highest environmental standards. We have put in place the monitoring and compliance regimes to make sure this happens. Over the past year significant progress has been made but there is much more work to be done in 2011. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211232"></A>
We will continue to work with communities, industry and other governments to transform regional economies and realise jobs and prosperity for a new generation of Queenslanders. In that same vein we are always looking for renewable energy opportunities for Queensland. In September I signed a memorandum of cooperation with the government of Papua New Guinea, Origin Energy and PNG Energy Developments to support a potential hydroelectricity project. Located at Wabo on the Purari River in PNG--one of the highest rainfall regions in PNG--the project plans to generate up to 1,800 megawatts of baseload renewable hydroelectric power. It includes a proposal to transport the bulk of this energy from PNG to north-west Queensland via undersea transmission lines which could then connect to the national electricity grid as early as 2018-19. This project has the potential to transform the electricity market in Queensland and indeed the nation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211236"></A>
In October Queensland’s total solar energy capacity reached 336 megawatts. That is a milestone achievement. It puts us well on track to reach our target to double Queensland’s solar energy capacity within five years. We are looking to create a virtual solar power station by 2015 and Queensland households are helping us reach that target. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211237"></A>
We started this vision with 1,000 households having a solar panel. What have we got today? Some 47,000. It is a remarkable effort in small scale solar installation on the homes of Queenslanders and the commitment of Queensland families to do the bright thing. Another 200,000 Queenslanders have installed solar hot water. We are changing our energy mix and householders want to be part of it. The more solar energy we can produce in our homes, the less we rely on coal-fired electricity. It is good news for our environment and it reduces energy bills for participating householders. We have paid almost 8,000 rebates under the Solar Hot Water Rebate Scheme since 1 July this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211239"></A>
While we foster new industry that will stand Queensland on a firm footing for the future, it is critical that we protect those existing industries that are the lifeblood of our state. It is no secret that it has been a very tough 18 months for tourism in the wake of the combination of the global financial crisis, swine flu and the high Australian dollar. That is why in 2009, as part of our election commitments, we committed an additional $36 million to steer the tourism industry through the tough times and protect tourism jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211240"></A>
That extra money is on top of the highest tourism spends we have seen in 20 years. The total tourism budget this financial year is $63.7 million. Our commitment to the tourism industry is not just about Tourism Queensland, as important as that is. We are also building infrastructure to bring people to Queensland--infrastructure like Carrara Stadium and the Cairns cruise ship terminal, and we are bidding for the 2018 Commonwealth Games for the Gold Coast. Our ecotourism plan is progressing well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211241"></A>
In October we welcomed the first direct China to Brisbane flight in more than a decade, reopening a very important tourism market. Just as our tourism industry begins to show signs of recovery--and of course we still have the opportunity that <Hansard-Italic>

Just as our tourism industry began to show signs of recovery, our science and innovation sector continued to make major inroads over the past year. 2010 saw the completion of the $77 million Australian tropical sciences and innovation precinct at James Cook University in Townsville, jointly funded by the university, CSIRO and the Queensland government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211248"></A>
In a very exciting development, in October I turned the first sod on the $354 million Translational Research Institute, which included a $107 million contribution from the Queensland government. This facility, due to open in 2012, will be the first of its kind in Australia where new biopharmaceuticals can be discovered, clinically tested and manufactured all in one location, ensuring that the rewards of Queensland discoveries can be reaped by the state. August saw the opening of the Health and Food Sciences Precinct at Coopers Plains. These are state-of-the-art facilities for Queensland’s top scientists to advance biosecurity, health care, food and nutrition research. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211250"></A>
It is also very pleasing that both our mining and agricultural industries have continued to thrive in the fallout of the GFC. Agriculture, forestry and fisheries created an additional 9,500 jobs in the 12 months to August this year, equating to more than 35 per cent of the total jobs growth in the Queensland economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1211251"></A>
Our government has maintained our commitment to our primary producers with a $20 million reinvestment package for the Australian Agricultural College Corporation and programs such as our $6.5 million investment to establish the Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation.

As minister responsible for the arts in Queensland, I am very pleased to say that it has been a great and fabulous year for the arts. In fact, Queensland and the south-east in particular have finally and deservedly come of age as the country’s premiere arts capital, and no wonder considering our venues have hosted major international productions and exhibitions. The Valentino Retrospective and the Ron Mueck exhibition have attracted record crowds and our performing arts sector attracted exclusive shows such as the Ballet Nacional de Cuba’s stunning <Hansard-Italic>

I would like to touch on some events--some tragic, some inspirational but all significant--that I touched on at the beginning of this valedictory and which I believe touched Queenslanders across the state. You would have needed a heart of concrete not to have been moved by the images that emerged from thousands of metres beneath the sea off the Queensland coast after the wreck of the AHS<Hansard-Italic>
 Centaur</Hansard-Italic>
 was finally located and photographed earlier this year. The image of a slouch hat lying on the seabed, presumably belonging to a fallen digger, was beamed across the world and it reminded us all of the horror and tragedy of war but it also reminded us of the huge loss when this vessel was sunk by enemy fire 67 years ago. Some 268 lives were lost when this hospital ship was bombed and finally we were able to acknowledge the devastating effect that this event had not only on those who lost their loved ones but on those very few who survived the attack. The discovery, together with the national service of thanksgiving and remembrance held in March and the at-sea service held in September, has hopefully offered some peace and some closure to those affected by this terrible tragedy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1217829"></A>
The passage of time has not altered the dreadful fact that as a nation and as a state we still face the atrociously sad consequences of war in 2010. This year we watched in sadness as the bodies of eight young men, each either born and raised or based in Queensland, arrived home from the nightmare landscape that is the ongoing war in Afghanistan. I pay tribute to each of these young men who sacrificed their lives for their country and for the battle for peace in the Middle East. I take a moment tonight to mention every one of them by name and to acknowledge their courage, their dedication and their sacrifice: Sapper Jacob Moreland, Sapper Darren Smith, Private Timothy Aplin, Private Benjamin Chuck, Private Thomas Dale, Private Nathan Bewes, Private Grant Kirby and Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney. May they rest in peace.</Hansard-Body>

I also give special mention of the hardy and courageous folk of our state’s south-west who this year faced the devastation of flood. They are a very special breed of people who live in towns such as St George, Charleville and Roma, and they faced up to exceptional monsoonal rain events following one of the worst droughts of several generations, and they faced up to it with remarkable resilience. The cost of rebuilding lives and homes and roads and town halls and vital infrastructure is currently estimated to run to $1.6 billion, and I pay tribute to those government agencies, to the local governments, to the non-government agencies and to all of the volunteers who have worked together to provide direct and indirect assistance to those in need as these communities have recovered from these events.</Hansard-Body>

As I mentioned at the outset, 2010 was also a year of triumph and in many cases inspiration.

I was very pleased to officially launch the Gold Coast’s bid for the 2018 Commonwealth Games and I was fortunate enough to be present to present our bid to the Games Federation in New Delhi as the India games got underway. It was terrific to see our athletes. They were all looking forward to their chance to shine in an international competition, and didn’t they do well! It is a very little known fact, but with our Queensland Commonwealth Games team’s medal count of 71 gold, silver and bronze from Australia’s total of 177 we in fact would have placed fourth as an individual team behind Australia, India and England if Queensland had competed as a country in our own right. That is a pretty good opening I think for a Gold Coast bid. It is not only a remarkable achievement from the likes of Sally Pearson, Geoff Huegill, Brenton Rickard, Emily Seebohm and Michael Hepburn, to name just a few; it is truly inspirational for a generation of young Queenslanders who dream of one day themselves standing in an international competition on the winner’s dias, and I hope that many of them will stand on a Gold Coast winner’s dias.</Hansard-Body>

Inspirational does not begin to describe the huge achievement of Jessica Watson, the 17-year-old from the Sunshine Coast who stood up to the critics and the doubters and who sailed solo around the world in her boat <Hansard-Italic>
Ella’s Pink Lady</Hansard-Italic>
. No-one who witnessed her triumphant return via the Sydney Heads is likely to forget the spine-tingling welcome home for this extraordinary young Queenslander. I was very pleased to acknowledge her as Queensland’s nominee for Young Australian of the Year, and I am sure every member of this House is very much in support and hopes that she does stand proudly next year as the Young Australian of the Year.</Hansard-Body>

Nor will any of us forget the remarkable achievement of the Gold Coast’s Sam Stosur, who made the French Open final and in doing so helped put Queensland back on the international tennis map. Equally, Stephanie Gilmore’s continued dominance of the surfing world with her fourth consecutive world title win puts her in the league of surfing legend.</Hansard-Body>

 There are a lot of women doing great things in sport. I am happy to take the interjection, Minister for Sport. But when it comes to a truly inspirational triumph of light over darkness, it is very hard I think to beat the sight of Aung San Suu Kyi being released after spending 15 of the last 21 years under house arrest. On all sides of this House we have stood united in support of democracy in Burma, and I think every one of us felt a particular special moment when Aung San Suu Kyi was able to be liberated. But of course, as was acknowledged in tonight’s Amnesty debate, there is still much work to be done in Burma and many other people who are not only under house arrest but under much more punitive punishments for their political views. I join with those speakers in the Amnesty debate tonight in saying that Aung San Suu Kyi has stood for 15 years as a bright beacon of hope for the people of Burma. I hope that her release is the beginning of many and that she will in fact begin a fall of the dominoes.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1217869"></A>
As the people of Burma fight for democracy, we here in Queensland can celebrate the fact that in 2010 we recognised the 150th anniversary of the first sittings of the Queensland parliament. This was an historic anniversary of continuous electoral representation and democracy in our great state. This year the parliament has met on 43 days for more than 513 hours--maybe a few more have been added tonight. We have considered 66 bills--58 of which have been government bills and eight private members’ bills have been introduced--and 54 government bills have been passed. During the year 738 questions have been asked during question time and almost 2,400 questions have been placed on notice. A total of 238 petitions from 283,527 petitioners have been tabled. That includes 86 e-petitions and a further 16 e-petitions remain open at this stage.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1217873"></A>
The fact that a workload of that magnitude is able to be carried out of course is made possible by many people, and I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the ongoing hard work and dedication of the Parliamentary Service which is studiously led by the Clerk of the Parliament, Neil Laurie. Neil Laurie continues to do a sterling job as Clerk and his advice on parliamentary matters is always considered and rigorous. I would also like to acknowledge the ongoing hard work of the Deputy Clerk, Michael Ries, and the Director of Corporate and House Services, Michael Hickey. I also thank all of the officers from the committee office managed by Stephen Finnimore. There is of course an important review of the parliamentary committee system currently being undertaken by a select committee of this House, and we will all be interested to see the committee’s report when it is tabled later this year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1224609"></A>
I also acknowledge and thank the Manager of Community Engagement, Glenda Emmerson, and her team and the Chief Hansard Reporter, Lucinda Osmond, and all of her staff who once again this year have done a marvellous job of recording the debates of this place. It is never an easy job and every year we recognise the difficulties that they face and thank them sincerely. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1224611"></A>
I also acknowledge the work of our Librarian, Mary Seefried, and all of her library staff. I think the Parliamentary Library of Queensland is one of the best libraries in the country. We are lucky to have it and we are lucky to have the quality of staff who we have there. I also want to acknowledge the work of the officers of the Table Office, managed by First Clerk Assistant, Leanne Clare, who does a terrific job, and the Manager of Property Services, Jason Gardiner--who regularly emails us about evacuation possibilities--and all of his team, including the gardeners, the cleaning and the maintenance staff who continue to do a great job of keeping the parliamentary precinct in good order. This building is our workplace but it is also one of the most remarkable heritage buildings in our state. Jason and his team keep it looking sensational on a regular basis. I thank the Catering Services team, led by Jaakko Ponsi, for feeding us all and trying to do that as healthily as possible despite some of the choices we might sometimes make. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1224618"></A>
I also thank the Manager of Human Resource Management, Peter Morris; the Manager of Financial Services, Craig Atkinson; the Manager of Information Technology Services, Mike Coburn; the Manager of Security and Attendant Services and Sergeant-at-Arms, Kevin Jones; and all of their respective officers, including the parliamentary attendants, the executive service and the switchboard staff and all of our security officers. I know that this is not an exhaustive list of names, but I think it provides a snapshot of what a very large operation our parliament is and how many and varied and dedicated the officers are who we have working for us to ensure that the parliament runs smoothly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1224622"></A>
Getting out and about and staying in touch with Queenslanders is a pivotal and critical part of government. This year, in addition to our government’s program of community cabinet, we introduced the new concept of people’s question time. This allows us through technology to ensure that, no matter where people live, they can access their government directly. Five people’s question times were held in 2010, allowing Queenslanders to pose their questions on any issue. Across the five sessions we saw more than 1,000 questions and thousands of Queenslanders tuning in. The sessions have proved to be a successful initiative and we will continue them in 2011. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1224623"></A>
We have staged nine community cabinet meetings during 2010 and our 10th will be held at Everton and Pine Rivers on 5 December and 6 December, and I am looking forward to being there. During the year we have met with communities in almost every corner of the state--from the Gold Coast in the south-east, to Roma and Mitchell in the south-west, to Innisfail and Mareeba in the north and to Mount Isa and Cloncurry in the north-west. Of particular note, when the community cabinet was held in Innisfail and Mareeba in February and March this year it turned out to be the busiest community cabinet to date, with over 600 people attending the open forum and 300 formal and informal deputations held.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1224624"></A>
In keeping with our commitment to community engagement, the government has also announced that in 2011 we will host a regional sitting of the parliament in Mackay. This will be the fourth time that the parliament would have been staged outside of Brisbane and I, like all members, look forward to meeting with the people of Mackay next year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1224625"></A>
None of these things would be possible without a team to make it happen. It takes hard work, it takes dedication, it takes commitment and I am surrounded by a team of talented and dedicated people who make it happen. I want to thank my team of government members. I want to thank them for their hard work during 2010 and I want to thank them for fronting up when they needed to. I want to thank all members of my cabinet. I want to make particular mention of my deputy, Paul Lucas, whose support is absolutely vital to the role that I play on behalf of the people of Queensland. I want to acknowledge the work of the Treasurer of Queensland, Andrew Fraser. I have been here for some time and I cannot think of a tougher year to be the Treasurer of Queensland. Andrew Fraser has lived up to every expectation and I thank him for all of his hard work.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1224626"></A>
I also thank all non-government members for their contribution to a very robust parliament and for playing their part in this important institution of our democracy. I want to thank the Leader of the House, Judy Spence, for her efforts this year, particularly for her leadership in the review of our parliamentary committees, which looks set to result in some major changes to the way things are done in this place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1224627"></A>
Mr Speaker, I take the opportunity to thank you for keeping all of us in check this year. I do not think we are an easy mob to rule and I thank you for your efforts. In that regard I also thank the whips of the parliament. Thank you for keeping us in line and for keeping us on time this year. I thank the government whips, Margaret Keech, Curtis Pitt and Betty Kiernan; I thank the non-government whips, Ted Sorensen and Mike Horan; and I thank the Independent whip, Liz Cunningham.</Hansard-Body>

 And Vicky Darling. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1224629"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 And Vicky Darling, who took over from Betty. I knew that. All of these people have played a really important role this year and I thank them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1224630"></A>
 I also take this opportunity to thank my staff. I thank both the staff in my ministerial office and in my electorate office. I thank the people who work on my media team and also the policy team and the administrative team and the staff of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet for their consistency and their dedication over the past year. Work in ministerial offices is an extremely demanding job. It means long hours and it often means very thankless tasks. I consider myself lucky to walk in their company and tonight I salute them one and all. I thank my long-time electorate officer, Tina Langford, for continuing once again in 2010 to keep the wheels turning in the office of the member for South Brisbane and I welcome on board a new electorate officer, Anna West. Two Annas is going to be a little confusing, but I think we can work with it. She is going to answer the phone saying, ‘Anna from South Brisbane’, and that is going to work for me. I thank my team. I also take a moment to recognise and pay tribute to the electorate staff of every single electorate office of every one of the 89 members here. Each and every one of our electorate staff serves our constituents in ways that I think we would all agree are too many to measure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1224633"></A>
I know that I speak for every member when I acknowledge the vital role that our families play in our ability to meet the responsibilities of our role as parliamentarians. Tonight, I take the opportunity to thank my husband, Greg, and my children, Joe and Oliver, for going on this journey with me over the past year and for their unconditional love, particularly in the face of some of the more difficult times. I also acknowledge that this week I think it is fair to say that the Leader of the Opposition and I have not shared very much but the one thing that we have shared is the anxiety of parents who are watching with a great deal of concern their children enjoy their time at schoolies. I am pleased to say that my son is enjoying his time there safely--so far--and I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition and I share a sense of relief that there are only two days to go. I genuinely say that I hope that the Leader of the Opposition and his family will have the same experience with their daughter as I have with my son and that when they come back they will be perhaps slightly more worldly wise but they will still know that they have a lot in front of them. I take this opportunity to recognise all of those volunteers who are down there keeping people like my son and John-Paul Langbroek’s daughter safe and taking the care to be there 24 hours a day. It is a big event, it is not easy to manage; they do a terrific job, and I am very grateful to them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1224637"></A>
There is no doubt that you need a very thick hide to be married or related to a politician and those of us who are lucky enough to be married or be in a long-term relationship or be in an important relationship with someone I think will look back over the year that was and thank each and every one of those people for standing beside them in the good times and in the tough times. We can look forward over the next couple of weeks to a very rare opportunity to spend some time with them and I know that every one of us will not miss that opportunity. I also pay a very special tribute to my mum, Fran Tancred, for her undying support, her love, her generosity of spirit, her warmth of heart and her incredible support of me for yet another year in this job. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1224639"></A>
I wish each and every member here, I wish their families and I wish their staff members and all Queenslanders a happy, healthy and relaxed Christmas and a safe new year, and can I say with absolute honesty that I do actually look forward to seeing all of you in 2011. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(11.23 pm): The 150th year of the Queensland parliament has been a good year. I note the comments of the Speaker in the annual report that the highlight was the parliament reaching its 150-year milestone. As he has said, many countries around the world would dearly like to point to a similar record of democracy. I have heard him say it at citizenship ceremonies, I have heard him say it at book launches, I have heard him say it to school groups, and it is a very good point. In light of the Amnesty motion that we have heard debated tonight, many other countries would like to be able to point to something similar. I cannot stress enough the importance of parliament in maintaining democracy separate from the executive government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1231333"></A>
The LNP team and I approach the new year with an enormous sense of optimism and a firm belief that the people of Queensland will approve the many and innovative policies to be announced up until election day. There are brighter days ahead for Queensland--fresh ideas, fresh goals, fresh standards and a fresh start for Queensland. I do not want to point out the failings of the government in chapter and verse. We have been doing that for 18 months and we will be doing it all next year as well. I want to thank everyone for the year that we have had. I want to thank all members of the parliament, including the Premier and her government. Even though there are fundamental issues that divide us, there is still much more that unites us in support of our parliamentary democracy and our fundamental rights and freedoms as Queenslanders and Australians. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1231334"></A>
Mr Speaker, you have displayed great fairness in running parliament and seemingly boundless patience that I know we have tested many times. I want to thank you for many of the innovations that you have brought in in terms of involving the opposition. I want to thank your staff, Joe and Mary-Anne, as well. I want to thank the Clerk of the Parliament, Neil Laurie, for provision of impartial advice as to the opportunities to use the forum of parliament for the public good; the Deputy Clerk, Michael Ries; and the First Clerk Assistant, Leanne Clare. Leanne Clare’s leaving of the Public Accounts Committee led to Deborah Jeffrey becoming the head of that Public Accounts Committee and then the Public Accounts and Public Works Committee and then subsequently being named the Clerk’s choice for Parliamentary Staffer of the Year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1231335"></A>
I note and appreciate the independence and integrity of the parliamentary staff and their commitment to improvement through innovation and diversity and their commitment to respect for clients and fellow workers. I want to thank the staff of the Table Office: Meg Hoban, Annette Henery and Bob Bradbury. They are always cheerful and of assistance. I thank the security staff led by the Sergeant-at-Arms, Kevin Jones. We saw this morning in the parliament that in this age of global terror there are always incidents that are likely to happen. The poor member for Burleigh thought that she was experiencing a moment of global terror this morning when someone threw something from the balcony. She thought she had been bombed. Didn’t you, Christine? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1231336"></A>
I want to thank the parliamentary attendants led by happy John Polistena. They help whenever needed, especially the ones who are here in the chamber: Ron, Judy, Jim, Margaret, Angie, Rona and, of course, Dennis and Lyn who are over at the Annexe. Can I also say that--for all that I am naming staff, I know there is always a danger you may leave people out--there are many staff who work behind the scenes that we as parliamentarians do not necessarily see. The Speaker acknowledged that at the parliamentary awards ceremony. They do not interact with the MPs as much, but we certainly thank them as well. There are about 190 staff altogether and I want to thank all of them. I want to thank the committee staff: Stephen Finnimore, Renee Easten, Deborah Jeffrey--who, as I mentioned, was the Clerk’s choice for Parliamentary Employee of the Year--Rob McBride, Rob Hansen and Julie Copley, for providing substantial professional assistance to all the committees to enable them to carry out the tasks given by the parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1231337"></A>
I thank all of the Hansard reporters, led by Chief Reporter Lucinda Osmond, for recording for posterity the contributions, both good and bad, of members who all take it so seriously and who are so concerned about how they sound and who go up there and say, ‘I want to hear the tape. I want to hear whether it was right.’ Lucinda says, ‘Yep, that’s the ruling. No more correspondence will be entered into’, and we all have to cop it. Thanks to all of the Hansard reporters, especially when the microphones go off and they are leaning over trying to hear what it is that is said. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1231338"></A>
I want to thank the Parliamentary Library staff led by Chief Parliamentary Librarian Mary Seefried. The staff there answer the many and varied queries of members with confidence, professionalism and quick dispatch. I thank them, as I always have, for the great research briefs they provide on various topics for the parliament. I thank the staff of Corporate Services, who I know the Premier has acknowledged, who look after the many and varied needs of members and their electorate staff: Michael Hickey, Peter Morris, Mike Coburn, Jason Gardiner--and too many others to name. I thank the catering team, led by Jaakko Ponsi and the executive chef Sucil de Silva--your choice, Mr Speaker, for Parliamentary Employee of the Year. They keep us and all of our guests amply and satisfactorily fed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1231339"></A>
I want to also put on record our appreciation for the fact that many of these staff are now more semi permanent or permanent staff and we can rely on their service. I thank Mary, who has been in Stranger’s for a long time, and Mario, Cliff, Margaret, Ellen, Colleen, Barb, Gabbie and John. I thank the cleaning staff, the gardeners and the maintenance staff who keep both the House and in particular our offices and our bedrooms clean and a substitute for the home that many of us miss. I also want to thank the switch staff where my mother-in-law worked for many years. Pauline, who was on the switch for a long time, was given a very nice ceremony when she left. I thank the people who are still there: Pat, Evelyn, Joanne, Coralee and Margaret. Even though their role has changed over the years they are not forgotten. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1231340"></A>
In this 150th year of the Queensland parliament we know how much it has changed from 1860 when 26 members of parliament were elected by fewer than 2,000 voters--if only it were so easy nowadays. The Community Engagement section of the parliament has done so much, particularly to explain to our younger generation the vital importance of parliament in maintaining our democracy. I want to mention in particular Glenda Emmerson and also our Indigenous liaison officer, Brett Nutley, and senior education officer, Graeme Kinnear. I hope we do not forget to have a photographic record of our parliament that we have had every term since I have been here. We have, of course, next year to do that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1231341"></A>
In P150 we had book launches, the launch of Speakers’ Corner, open days, more online information and citizenship ceremonies--all of those being part of your efforts, Mr Speaker, carried on from previous Speakers as well--to make sure that the people of Queensland should feel that this is their House and that they should feel a part of it. I commend you, Mr Speaker, and all of the staff on the books that were released about the first parliamentary librarian and, of course, the very good book that details the history of the parliament from 1957 to 1989. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1231342"></A>
I want to thank our electorate staff. I know the Premier has done it, but often they are to the ordinary citizen the real face of the parliament. I want to thank in my own electorate office Josie Stinson and Cathy Ermer in Surfers Paradise. I thank my parliamentary colleagues and my deputy Lawrence Springborg, my whip Mike Horan, leader of opposition business Jeff Seeney, members of my shadow cabinet, all parliamentary members of the LNP and, of course, members of the government who serve in those roles as well. I want to thank my opposition office staff, in my case my PA especially, Kim McInnes, Ross Musgrove, Jake Smith and Scott Whitby, and I also want to thank Kevin Martin. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1231343"></A>
Opposition staff work, as do ministerial staff, extremely long hours with few resources. I want to thank them. I want to thank the LNP organisation led by president Bruce McIver and state director Michael O’Dwyer. I thank in particular the thousands of members and volunteers for whom we as parliamentary members are proud to be the parliamentary LNP representatives. I want to thank the media, specifically the parliamentary press gallery with whom we interact on an almost daily basis and who take great delight in trying to get us to answer what they regard as the tough questions and also those media practitioners both in the electronic and print areas who practise their craft in towns and regions large and small throughout Queensland. It is through the media that we expend much effort in communicating with the people of Queensland and learning their concerns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1231344"></A>
In relation to community groups and individuals, my role involves articulating an alternative vision to restore Queensland to the lifestyle it has enjoyed before and which it can again and in formulating this vision I am assisted by an increasing input from community groups and individuals across the whole of Queensland who constantly provide me with advice on how Queensland can be improved. I look forward to even further input in 2011.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1231345"></A>
I want to thank my wife and children. They sacrifice much to enable me to do my job. I know that other members also receive the same level of support from their loved ones. I acknowledge that to people of different or no religious faith Christmas still provides a basis for considering how we as human beings interact. I want to say that may the principles of goodwill to all men and peace and love for one another continue to underpin the actions of each of us as we approach the challenges of the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1231346"></A>
The demands of working in politics often means that we do not spend much time with our families. Our families are the unsung heroes, of course, and Christmas is a time when we can see a bit more of them. I sincerely hope that all members and staff get to relax with their loved ones, just as I will with my wife, Stacey, and my children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1231347"></A>
Premier, thank you for your comments about schoolies. I have not heard too much from my daughter. I have heard her on the radio being very careful about the things she had to say. I do not know that she and Oliver have met. I do not know how much she is venturing outside the premises she is staying in. She has her scholars day at her school on Saturday. It is a bit tough having to front up to your own school on the day after schoolies. I wish everyone who is at schoolies a safe time. I want to thank the various departments who are helping there, as well as the council and the volunteers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1231348"></A>
Finally, I hope all members travel safely, enjoy good health and cheer, relax and put their feet up, and I look forward to seeing everyone back here for a great 2011.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Gladstone--Ind) (11.30 pm): Being the third speaker, most of it has been said so I will be brief. The Premier and the Leader of the Opposition have already acknowledged the staff in this parliamentary precinct, both seen and unseen. We pass on our thanks to you and our appreciation for the fact that you make our time away from home more tolerable and more enjoyable so that we can achieve more. I apologise for the lateness of the hour, but we do value everything that you do for us. </Hansard-Body>

This is the Christmas period and for many families it is a time of great difficulty. On behalf of all in this chamber, I place on record our thoughts and prayers for the families of the miners in New Zealand whose Christmas will be marred in the most tragic of ways. No matter whether their loved ones are recovered before Christmas or after, it will be a time of great sorrow for each and every one of them. Our thoughts are certainly with them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1238047"></A>
I take this opportunity, indulgently perhaps, to put on the record the thoughts I hope of everyone in this chamber for George and Leonie Creed and their family. They were called to George’s bedside on the weekend. It certainly appears that it will be a very sad Christmas for them. George is a man of great integrity and value. He has been involved in the Calliope shire and, subsequently, the Gladstone Regional Council for many years. Our thoughts are certainly with him. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1238049"></A>
As other speakers have, I put on the record my thanks to our electorate staff, that is the staff who give us support in our electorates and in the parliament if we bring them with us. My thanks go to our families. They are the ones who love us and put up with us when we come home after working long hours and are perhaps a little jaded. However, Christmas is a time for faith, family, friendship and fellowship. On behalf of the Independents and the one Queensland Party member, I wish each member here, your families, your extended families and your friends a safe, happy and holy Christmas. We wish you every joy for 2011 and we trust that we can come back here and represent our communities with honesty, with integrity and with care. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would like to thank all members--the government members, the non-government members and particularly the Independents whose ranks have swelled this year--for their commitment and contribution to the ongoing functioning of this House. As both the Premier and the Leader of the Opposition have said, it has been a momentous year for us. One hundred and fifty years of continual parliamentary democracy is worth trumpeting and it was worth celebrating. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1238052"></A>
As I have said in the past, it was not perfect in the beginning and it is probably not perfect now, but it is better than all the other alternatives. Some things we might like to reflect on include the fact that in the beginning women did not have the right to vote. They were not even eligible to stand for parliament. Those initiatives were rectified in 1905 and 1915, respectively. However, even worse, in the beginning--and it lasted for more than a century--Indigenous Australians and Indigenous Queenslanders did not have the right to vote or stand for parliament until the mid-1960s. </Hansard-Body>

Parliament has come a long way over the past 150 years and to this day it continues to evolve. That evolution is a process we need to foster and nurture. As well as establishing and celebrating the 150 years, this year was one in which significant steps were taken in evaluating, in physical terms, the parliament we have, and planning and positioning for the direction in which we want to head into the future. That is the bricks and mortar side of things. In terms of the institution, the review of the parliament’s committees, with its report soon to be delivered, is also evidence of steps being taken in that evolutionary process. As a parliament, we need to be vigilant about a number of things and identify and distinguish between them: to protect and preserve what is worthwhile; to throw out what has had its day and is no longer working or is no longer relevant; and to realise what improvements need to be made and to make them. </Hansard-Body>

I make this point: the one change that is approaching us all in the medium term will be the need to increase the size of our parliament, both in the number of members and the buildings we have in this precinct. If I may at this late hour, I will give you some figures. When this parliament began 150 years ago, there were 26 members and the state’s population was a little over 28,000. The population per member figure was a little over 1,000. One hundred and fifty years later, the population has grown to more than 4.5 million. With 89 members, that works out to be a population per member figure of more than 50,000, which is approximately 50 times as many. In 1986, when the number of members was increased from 82 to 89, the population per member was just 30,000. Today, with the same number of members, it has grown by more than 20,000 people per member. Fifty years ago, in 1960, the total population per member was just under 20,000. </Hansard-Body>

I thank both the Leader of the Opposition and the Premier for highlighting the great events that have occurred this year, both in the parliamentary precinct and also in the tremendous work that has been done by the Community Engagement people. That has included citizenship ceremonies, continuing the tradition of schools visiting the parliament, the celebration of religious occasions, hosting overseas delegations both for business and parliamentary occasions, the parliament’s participation in the Brisbane open house event and the educative role of Community Engagement through such events as youth parliaments. Those are events that we want to foster and encourage in the year ahead. </Hansard-Body>

I am conscious that my job is not one that I can do alone, but is one that I can do only with the support and the cooperation of all members. On behalf of all members, I acknowledge the efforts and contribution of all the parliamentary staff. I thank the speakers tonight for acknowledging the tremendous work being done by those who work here in the parliamentary precinct and also those people who work in the electorate offices across our state. This parliament is able to discharge its role and we as members are able to perform our roles because of the collective contribution of the management and staff of the various business areas of the Parliamentary Service. </Hansard-Body>

I thank you for acknowledging the Clerk for his impartiality and for his assistance, support and advice. I thank the Deputy Clerk and the Director of Corporate and House Services who, together with the Clerk, comprise the Executive Management Group of the Parliamentary Service. To the staff of my office at Parliament House, I thank both of you for your generosity and acknowledge the work that you do. Of course, I thank my electorate staff. </Hansard-Body>

The Deputy Speaker has done a tremendous job on the occasions that I have not been here and a fabulous job in his own right. To the panel of temporary speakers I say this: I have been so impressed with the work that they have done that I have decided that next year I will double their pay. I make specific mention of a change--perhaps it is not a change, but a reversion--to what this parliament used to have, which is the addition of an opposition member to the panel of temporary speakers. If we can add another one or two opposition members, and even include an Independent member, then I think the parliament will be the better for it. I say that for this reason: order in this House is the responsibility of all sides and all members. </Hansard-Body>

I thank and acknowledge the Leader of the House and the Leader of Opposition Business, the government and opposition whips, the honourable Premier, the ministers and the government backbenchers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, the members of the shadow cabinet and the opposition backbenchers, the member for Gladstone and the other Independents. I thank the people who help me in making sure that this parliament is presided over in an impartial way, that is, the Speaker’s Advisory Committee. Those members give of their valuable time to help me with those decisions. I thank members of the media gallery, who are present in their hundreds tonight, for the role that they play and whose donation of a quantity of drinks for tonight’s function is much appreciated. </Hansard-Body>

 I thank the Treasurer. I am also conscious not just of the role that my family plays but also of the role that each and every one of your families and partners play. I know that at a time like this we should acknowledge tremendously the sacrifices that they make not just on your behalf but also on behalf of your electorate and fundamentally on behalf of the people of this state. With those few short words, I do extend my best wishes to all of you for the coming Christmas and for 2011. </Hansard-Body>
