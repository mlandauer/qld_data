Speaker’s Ruling, Alleged Deliberate Misleading of the House by the Premier</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998334"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, on 7 October 2010 the Leader of the Opposition rose on a matter of privilege alleging that words spoken by the honourable the Premier in a ministerial statement after question time had been removed. It was suggested that the Premier had caused these words to be removed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998347"></A>
Later that day I made a statement in this House clarifying that words that had been spoken by the Premier in the House were not included in the record as they were considered to be a false start to the sentence which was subsequently restated by the Premier. As such, they were a redundancy and, therefore, under the parliament’s editing policy were not included in the record. No correction to the proof was sought or made by the Premier. The decision with respect to the matter was made by Hansard staff.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998356"></A>
The Leader of the Opposition has subsequently written to me twice in respect of the matter. Firstly, the Leader of the Opposition has formally requested that the Premier’s omitted words be included in the <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
. The Leader of the Opposition has pointed to the Premier’s confirmation that she also used these words in a subsequent press conference as evidence that the Premier intended to say them in the House and that the words were not in error and were not a false start. Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition is claiming that the Premier deliberately misled the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998367"></A>
In accordance with standing orders, I wrote to the Premier on both matters seeking her response. For the information of the House, I table all correspondence in relation to this matter.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<A ID="pgfId-1001801"></A>
<Hansard-Italic>
Tabled paper:</Hansard-Italic>
 Bundle of correspondence relating to matter of privilege raised by Leader of the Opposition.</Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998385"></A>
I will deal with the request to include the omitted words in the record first. As my statement of 7 October 2010 makes clear, the principles upon which corrections to the record are accepted are expressly contained in the Members’ Information Manual. These are long-standing principles within Westminster parliaments and are based on the overarching principle that the <Hansard-Italic>
Record of Proceedings</Hansard-Italic>
 is a report of the proceedings of parliament, not a verbatim record. I have viewed the audiovisual of the Premier’s statement. I am of the strong opinion that the words removed were a false start or a correction and, therefore, a redundancy and were removed correctly in accordance with well-established editorial principles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998407"></A>
I appreciate that given in 2010 we have both audiovisual and edited printed reports of proceedings of the House inconsistencies will occasionally occur. This in turn may lead to a legitimate re-evaluation of editorial policies. However, I am not inclined to retrospectively overturn almost 150 years of policy that affects the official records of the House without the detailed and careful consideration and consent of the House itself. Therefore, I am not going to accede to the Leader of the Opposition’s request.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998418"></A>
I will now turn to the Leader of the Opposition’s claim that the Premier deliberately misled the House. I must admit to some doubt as to whether the Leader of the Opposition was claiming that the Premier deliberately misled the House in her words that were removed by Hansard or in her later statement in the House that the words were said in a press conference and not in the House.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998427"></A>
In either case, I believe I can easily deal with the allegation. Having viewed the audiovisual of the Premier’s original statement, I am of the opinion that the alleged offending words were a false start or a self-correction. I cannot see how, in these circumstances, the elements required to be proved in terms of deliberately misleading the House could be established. A genuine false start or self-correction of a statement cannot be used as the basis for a claim of deliberately misleading the House.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998440"></A>
Furthermore, it has been established that the Premier did not know about or ask for the <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
 record to be edited prior to the green being issued to her for correction. Therefore, it is a reasonable conclusion that the Premier did not believe she had made the statement in the House, but believed the words may have come from the press conference. Therefore, I am not intending to refer the matter to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, I have ordered that a ruling regarding a complaint by the Minister for Natural Resources, Mines, Energy and Minister for Trade against the members for Moggill and Coomera and their cross-complaints against the minister, the member for Capalaba and others be circulated. I table documents relevant to the matter. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-998500"></A>
I have decided not to refer any matter raised to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee. I seek leave to have the statement incorporated in the parliamentary record.</Hansard-Body>

Honourable Members, the reputation of all members and the dignity and reputation of this House can be adversely affected when members make unfounded or mischievous allegations of unethical behaviour against other members. It does not assist when members retaliate against such charges by making their own counter-charges.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000024"></A>
On 16 September 2010, in debate on the Land Valuation Bill, a long saga of claim and counter-claim began. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000025"></A>
During debate on that Bill the Minister for Natural Resources, Mines, Energy and Minister for Trade alleged that the Member for Moggill and the Member for Coomera had breached Standing Order 260 by not declaring in the debate their interest in the Bill. The Minister followed this allegation in writing as required by Standing Orders.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000026"></A>
Both the Member for Moggill and the Member for Coomera when provided an opportunity to do so denied emphatically the charges by the Minister, rightly pointing out both previous rulings on the narrow scope of Standing Order 260 and an information paper produced by the former Members’ Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000027"></A>
Both members also made counter-charges, alleging that other members of the House, including the Minister, owned interests that should be declared if they were required to declare the matters.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000028"></A>
The Member for Moggill also alleged that the Minister had misled the House by declaring himself a man of modest means. The Member for Coomera also added an additional allegation as regards the Member for Capalaba for an alleged breach of Standing Order 262.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000029"></A>
I shall try to not waste the House’s time by going into too much detail of the claims and counter claims and will table, for the benefit of the House, all correspondence received in respect of these matters. I note that I did not in all cases write to members mentioned adversely seeking their responses to complaints made, as I was satisfied on the face that no credible matter arose.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000030"></A>
In short, I find that the debate on the Bill on 16 September descended into an acrimonious, undignified and unparliamentary exercise. There was no substance to the Minister’s original allegations of unethical conduct and there was no substance in the members’ counter claims against the Minister’s conduct or the conduct of other members, including the Member for Capalaba.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000031"></A>
To assist members I have again ordered to be circulated in the House an information note by the Members’ Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee published in 2005 on standing orders 259 and 260.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000032"></A>
I consider the Minister’s statement about his ‘modest means’ not to be something that can be objectively determined, but simply what is known as ‘puffery’.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000033"></A>
I am not intending to refer any of these matters to the Integrity Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000073"></A>
On 7 October 2010 the Member for Mudgeeraba wrote to me alleging that the Attorney-General had deliberately misled the House on two occasions in debate on 6 October 2010 deliberately misled the House.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000074"></A>
The member’s essential complaint was that the Attorney-General in his summing up of the Justice and Other Legislation Amendment Bill misrepresented the contribution of the Member on the Bill. Indeed, the member alleges that the Attorney-General attributed statements to the Member that were not the member’s statements.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000075"></A>
In accordance with Standing Order 269(5), on 13 October 2010 I wrote to the Attorney-General, enclosing a copy of the member’s allegations and requested a response.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000076"></A>
On 21 October 2010 the Attorney-General provided a very detailed letter of response. For the benefit of the House, I table a copy of all the correspondence in this matter.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000077"></A>
It is well established that there are three elements to be established when it is alleged that a member has committed the contempt of deliberately misleading the House:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1000078"></A>
•	first, the statement must, in fact, have been misleading;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1000079"></A>
•	secondly, it must be established that the member making the statement knew at the time the statement was made that it was incorrect; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1000080"></A>
•	thirdly, in making it, the member must have intended to mislead the House.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000081"></A>
There is always a danger that a member, in referring to an earlier speech by another member, will misrepresent that member’s comments.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000082"></A>
Various parliamentary procedures and rules were developed around this problem. In past times it was well accepted that proof copies of Hansard could not be quoted, because members who had made the speech had not yet had the opportunity to correct those proofs (See rulings by Speaker Nicholson 9 September 1971 at 457 and Acting Speaker Lickiss 28 March 1973 at 3362). </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000083"></A>
Similarly, there was also a rule, then enshrined in standing orders (former Standing Order 120), that speeches from the same session could not be referred to in debate (See Deputy Speaker Row 6 March 1984 at 1806), although it was held to apply to concluded debates, and that Hansard or speeches in the same debate could be referred to or quoted (Chairman Mann, 21 October 1948 at 864).</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000084"></A>
In both New Zealand and the Commonwealth House of Representatives, standing orders allow corrections of misrepresentations. Standing Order 69 of the House of Representatives provides a member can speak again in a question to explain some material part of his or her speech which has been misquoted or misunderstood. In making this explanation the Member may not interrupt another Member addressing the House, debate the matter, or introduce any new matter.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000085"></A>
I see some merit in this type of procedure, but it currently forms no part of Queensland procedure.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000086"></A>
It is clear that a deliberate misrepresentation can constitute a deliberate misleading of the House and a contempt only if all the elements described above can be established.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000087"></A>
However, I do not believe that any of the elements have been sufficiently been made out. The Attorney-General’s letter has persuaded me that he was only attempting to paraphrase the member’s comments. The inverted commas in the Hansard of the Attorney-General’s speech were a punctuation device used by Hansard, not inserted by the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General maintains that he was not directly quoting the member, and he could not have been given her speech was less than two hours before his summing up and there was no time to obtain and check the Hansard of the member’s speech.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1000070"></A>
I have, therefore, decided not to refer the matter to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As is my practice, following last sitting week I reviewed the <Hansard-Italic>
Record of Proceedings</Hansard-Italic>
. This review highlighted an issue that I did not address adequately when the Acting Leader of House raised the matter. Standing order 115 provides for the rules for questions. One of the rules is that questions should not contain imputations. In at least three questions on the last sitting day, 7 October, members in their questions made imputations by use of the word ‘rorts’. I advise all honourable members to consider the rules relating to questions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998673"></A>
This leads me to the rules relating to answers. On 1 October 2010 the member for Maroochydore wrote to me regarding an answer to a question on notice from the honourable Attorney-General. I table the member’s correspondence. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998693"></A>
The member complains that the Attorney in his response attacked the member on a false premise, that the answer was unparliamentary and if the answer had been made in the House the member would have had a remedy. I have reviewed the answer to the question. The member may well feel aggrieved by the tone and content of the answer, but I am not convinced that if it had been an answer made in the House the member would have had an immediate remedy as there was no personal reflection. Therefore, I intend to take no further action. However, I do warn all honourable ministers that answers to questions, either on notice or without notice, are required to adhere to the normal rules of this House as regards personal reflections and parliamentary language. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.42 am): Queensland is on the precipice of a brand-new industry--an industry that means thousands of jobs for a generation of Queenslanders, an industry that means millions of dollars for our state, and an industry that will forever alter the character of some of our key regional areas. On Friday the federal government gave its conditional environmental approval for two multibillion-dollar liquid natural gas projects--the $7.7 billion Santos-Petronas Gladstone LNG project and QGC Pty Ltd’s $8 billion Curtis LNG project. Five years ago these industries were just a pipedream. Today they are a reality. Our government promised to invest in jobs and in new industries for Queensland, and we have done exactly that. There is an army of workers ready to put their shovels in the ground and get to work building these projects.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001948"></A>
Importantly, these projects strike a balance between developing a key industry and protecting our precious environment. We said that we wanted this industry to go ahead, but not at any cost. Through the state approvals process we have already imposed more than 1,200 environmental and social conditions which cover everything from community support through to environment protection. Additionally, the federal government approval imposes a further 300 conditions, making these projects the most environmentally stringent in the history of Australia. Queenslanders can be assured that we will be working with both companies throughout the life of the project to ensure that these tough conditions are adhered to. These projects combined potentially mean 10,000 jobs for Queenslanders in what is a world-first industry. Queensland will be the first place in the world where coal seam gas will be converted to liquid natural gas. This will excite international interest in what is happening here. Pending final government approvals and investment decisions by the companies, work could possibly start on these two projects later this year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001950"></A>
This has been some time coming. This is the end result of a process that has taken approximately two years and involved around 27,000 pages of material being assessed by the Queensland Coordinator-General. But with a brand-new industry now within our grasp, it has been well and truly worth the effort. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.45 am): I am very pleased to advise the House that I spent a week recently governing Queensland from Townsville. My week in Townsville--</Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 If you listen, you will hear. My week in Townsville has reinforced to me that this great city has an extraordinary number of opportunities that are about to come together. These projects could turbocharge Townsville’s economy in a way never before seen in the city’s history. There is the relocation of Defence Battalion 3RAR to Townsville, which will bring about 750 soldiers and their families; the NBN rollout; the expansion of the Townsville port; a possible expansion of Sun Metals; the expansion of Abbot Point; Townsville’s potential as a centre for tropical health excellence; connection of the north-west minerals province to the national electricity grid; and the potential of baseload renewable energy into Townsville from green hydroenergy from PNG.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001962"></A>
Our government has a big vision for Townsville, and I want the city to make the most of its opportunities. That is part of the reason why I went to Townsville to run the state for a week. As a result of my stay, we are now working to fast-track the state development area in Townsville to provide industrial land to market quickly. I can also advise that we are now working on the feasibility of building more government office space in the CBD to help revitalise the city centre. In addition, I am following up on a number of very good ideas that were raised with me by many businesses, community groups, sporting organisations and arts agencies that took the time to visit me in Townsville and bring their ideas forward.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001964"></A>
Running the state from outside of Brisbane for a week was a new approach for a Premier. As a test run, I have to say it was a big success. The technology enables me in this position to liberate myself from Brisbane geographically. I was able to use videoconferencing to chair meetings in Brisbane and keep the decisions flowing. That included a virtual cabinet meeting--a first for Queensland. Staying put there in Townsville for a week also gave me more time to sit down with people, and I relished the opportunity to immerse myself in all things Townsville. I had 15 separate face-to-face meetings that involved more than 70 people covering everything from business, education, community, sport and the arts. I also spoke at some eight functions attended by hundreds of people and had an opportunity at them to chat informally afterwards with many of the guests about their ambitions for this great city. I intend to be back in Townsville on a regular basis, but I also intend to take this idea to other regional cities of Queensland to use technology that in the 21st century allows a Premier of Queensland to effectively run the state from any part of the state.</Hansard-Body>

Breast Cancer Awareness Month; Creed, Mrs P</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<A ID="pgfId-1001968"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.48 am): October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month and, because I am a firm supporter of this important initiative, I was heartened to see so many men and women yesterday wearing pink as part of Pink Ribbon Day. Yesterday I also joined thousands of other Australian women who signed up to the National Breast Cancer Foundation’s national online research register called Register 4. Participants in the register are required to provide basic information about themselves and their lifestyle and are then emailed about each new research project that they may be eligible to participate in. The National Breast Cancer Foundation is calling for one million women to join the register, and I urge all women to heed that call and sign up. I make the point that the register is also open to men and that you do not have to have had any personal experience of breast cancer to be very helpful in breast cancer research in that as much as anything you can be part of a control group. So I do encourage every member to consider it and to talk about this register in their own electorates.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003504"></A>
We have got some great researchers in Australia doing terrific work but they need people to be part of those research efforts. Breast cancer affects one in 11 Queensland women every year and it claims almost 500 Queensland lives each year. While there is currently no cure, early detection is playing an increasingly important role. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003506"></A>
The Chief Health Officer in Queensland estimates that the incidence of breast cancer could be reduced by 25 per cent to 30 per cent if 70 per cent of women aged 50 to 69 years were screened regularly. Currently, only 58 per cent of this target group are getting their free screenings through BreastScreen Queensland. I also know that the rate at which women in city and urban centres get screened is lower than those in rural, remote and regional areas. I encourage all Queensland women, wherever they live and whatever their age, to talk to their GP about prevention strategies and to take advantage of the free, world-class professional and modern services offered by BreastScreen Queensland. Our investment in this service means that fast and efficient screen services are saving time for busy women, and digital mammography technology allows breast images to be checked immediately for quality. These advances mean that a one-on-one appointment with a female health professional takes only about 15 to 20 minutes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003508"></A>
This week is not just about recognising the bravery of the many Queensland women and their families who have experienced, who are enduring or who are fighting breast cancer; it is also an opportunity for us to recognise the tireless work of the many people who are supporting women across Queensland in their difficult and individual journeys. One such person to whom I rise to pay tribute today is nurse Patsy Creed. Next month Nurse Creed will retire from the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital after 34 years of service. Since the early 1990s, Mrs Creed has been a pioneer and driving force in achieving the introduction of breast care nurses to Queensland’s public healthcare services. In fact, Nurse Creed is one of the first dedicated breast care nurses here in Queensland. They are now a feature of caring for women with breast cancer around Australia. Members would be aware of the work that the McGrath Foundation does in this area. I think it is important that we recognise one of those people who was a pioneer of this initiative, because it is making a real difference to these women who are experiencing breast cancer. So on behalf of the House and on behalf of all of those who have fought, who are currently fighting or who will fight breast cancer, I give our thanks for the unflagging support and energy that Mrs Creed and her fellow breast care nurses have devoted to this cause. Thirty-four years of service is a great achievement. It is a great contribution in a very important area. I also ask honourable members to join with me in congratulating not only Nurse Creed but also the many unsung heroes who play a role in the fight against breast cancer and all other forms of cancer. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.52 am): Last night, I was pleased to host an official reception to celebrate the centenary of the University of Queensland. In attendance were Chancellor Mr John Story, Vice-Chancellor Professor Paul Greenfield as well as many stakeholders, members of staff and members of the alumni, including a number of members from all sides of this House. This was an opportunity to honour the important contribution of the University of Queensland to our state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003517"></A>
The university began with an initial intake of 83 students, 23 of whom were women. It now has more than 40,000 students enrolled from more than 120 countries. At the official inauguration of the university in 1909, the then Premier William Kidston famously said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1003520"></A>
There is a difference between the youngest University in the Empire and the oldest: Oxford was established by a King; the university of Queensland is established by the people. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003521"></A>
This university has continued to give throughout its 100 years opportunities to young people regardless of where they live in Queensland and the financial circumstances of their families. This university has set the bar for higher education in Queensland and is a world leader in many fields, including medical research, hypersonic flight, the world of whales and Australian anthropology. As some members may be aware--it is a somewhat quirky fact--it is home to the world’s longest continuously running laboratory experiment, known as the pitch drop experiment. This experiment was started in 1927 by Professor Thomas Parnell to demonstrate to students that some substances that appear to be solid are, in fact, very high-viscosity fluids. Parnell poured a heated sample of pitch into a sealed funnel and allowed it to settle for three years. In 1930, the seal at the neck of the funnel was cut, allowing the pitch to start flowing. Since 1930 there have been eight drops of pitch. Spectacularly, nobody has actually seen it happen. It is now the subject of an entry into the <Hansard-Italic>
Guinness Book of Records</Hansard-Italic>
 and is another reason for UQ to be on the international stage.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003523"></A>
All Queenslanders can be proud of this great centre of learning, and not just because of its world-famous pitch drop experiment. It has been a place where our best minds have been trained and given direction in life. It has been a centre of ideas and science, of words, art, history and all of those wonderful things that make up the sum of our knowledge as humans. As a former graduate--an honour I share with other members of this House--I congratulate the university on reaching this milestone anniversary. I have every confidence that its next 100 years will be just as remarkable as its first century of achievement. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.55 am): I think just about every one of us in this House can remember a bully from our schooldays. Whether we were the victims of a bully or we witnessed the bullying, we know that the actions of a bully can scar a young mind for life. That is why our government is determined to stand up to bullies. We are determined that our schools will be places where our children can reach their full potential in a safe environment and where our teachers and other staff can enjoy a workplace free of this sort of activity.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003527"></A>
I am pleased to announce today the appointment of high-profile psychologist Dr Michael Carr-Gregg as the state government’s official antibullying expert. Dr Carr-Gregg has been engaged to provide ongoing practical, effective advice on tackling this challenging social issue. The appointment is the next step in the fight against bullying and demonstrates that we are serious about making our schools safer, more tolerant places for students. Dr Carr-Gregg is a well-respected expert who will provide the government with advice on future policy directions and procedures relating to bullying. He will also be involved in projects such as conducting workshops with principals and other staff and creating resources for schools. Dr Carr-Gregg has recently carried out presentations at 30 Action Against Bullying seminars across Queensland. He will ensure that the government has within easy reach a qualified expert that parents respect and trust. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003531"></A>
This appointment is made on the back of recommendations from the Queensland Schools Alliance Against Violence report, which I table today.</Hansard-Body>

 Report, dated October 2010, titled ‘Working Together: Queensland Schools Alliance Against Violence Report’. </Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005013"></A>
We established this task force in February this year to bring together the Catholic, independent and state schooling sectors to find new ways to stop bullying and violence in our schools, particularly in the context of the growth in the use of technology in cyperspace by young people. I would like to thank Professor Ian O’Connor, the Vice-Chancellor of Griffith University, for his leadership of this alliance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003533"></A>
With the release of the report and recommendations, we have a clear blueprint for how we move can forward and continue to make progress on this issue. The recommendations were developed through careful consideration and each of the school sectors will now look at the best ways to implement them. Our schools will be encouraged to develop and implement a cybersafety strategy. Cyberbullying is a particularly challenging issue, because this form of harassment can take place at any time away from the schoolyard, usually online and on mobile phones. Simply banning mobile phones or Facebook for students is not realistic. The world has moved on and our children, and indeed many of their parents, regard these things as essential. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003535"></A>
We are considering a raft of measures such as online programs designed to help schools develop cultures of respect as well as to increase cybersafety skills. Schools could also be urged to establish cybersafety teams, which would work within the school to develop cybersafety security systems, policies and acceptable use agreements. Dr Carr-Gregg has indicated that he intends to provide constructive criticism when there is the need for more action. He has also said that Queensland is leading Australia in attempting to address these issues in our schools. Unfortunately, no society has ever succeeded in completely stamping out bullying. However, our government is absolutely determined to make sure that everything that can be done is being done and that is the least that our children and our schools deserve. </Hansard-Body>

(9.59 am): The safety and wellbeing of all Queensland students is a top priority for the Bligh government. Over the past 12 months we have taken strong action to make Queensland schools even safer. Last year all state schools reviewed their responsible behaviour plans for students to make sure they set high standards of behaviour and contained appropriate responses to bullying and cyberbullying. In December we announced our commitment to grant state school principals the authority to suspend and exclude students. We also engaged Dr Ken Rigby whose report and professional development vodcasts provided a sound foundation for further work to tackle bullying head on. Education ministers across the country accepted Queensland’s push for a national ‘Say no to bullying day’ to be held in March next year. In February we established the Schools Alliance Against Violence, implementing one of Dr Rigby’s recommendations. Under the chairmanship of the highly respected Professor Ian O’Connor, Vice-Chancellor of Griffith University, the alliance brought together the state, Catholic and independent school sectors to tackle the complex issue of bullying on a united front. Professor O’Connor’s leadership has been instrumental in shaping the valuable work and recommendations of this alliance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005394"></A>
I welcome the school’s alliance report released today, and its recommendations, along with the announcement of well-respected psychologist Dr Michael Carr-Gregg being appointed as the government’s anti-bullying expert. The three school sectors will now work together in implementing the recommendations. Having seen Dr Carr-Gregg’s work at the alliance’s recent Action Against Bullying seminars across Queensland, I am thrilled he has agreed to come on board to offer his expertise. The response to Dr Carr-Gregg’s presentations was overwhelmingly positive from principals, school staff and parents. He engaged with the audience with real life case studies, video resources, and offered useful advice. It is clear that his practical and personal approach was highly valued with participants using such words as ‘invaluable’, ‘thought provoking’, ‘informative’ and ‘entertaining’ to describe the program. I am pleased all members of the alliance, including representatives from parents and citizens associations, principals associations, the Queensland Teachers Union, Independent Schools Queensland, the Catholic Education Commission, the Queensland Independent Education Union and Education Queensland, have endorsed the report. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005395"></A>
Bullying and violence is a whole-of-community issue and is not to be tolerated anywhere at any time. The three school sectors in Queensland are leading the way in the fight against this totally unacceptable behaviour when it occurs in schools. No-one has all the answers, yet by working together we are proving we are serious about stamping out antisocial behaviour and making our schools even safer and more tolerant places for Queensland students. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (10.02 am): Earlier this year an historic agreement was reached on health reform between the Commonwealth and the states. This agreement means a better deal for Queenslanders. It will deliver better hospitals and better health services. It comes after years of inaction and underfunding by the former Howard government. As part of this agreement the Bligh government secured an additional $755 million for delivering improvements in three priority areas: better emergency departments with $150 million to reduce waiting times for more than 150,000 Queenslanders over the next four years; faster elective surgery with $160 million to ensure more Queenslanders get surgery sooner; and more hospital beds with $325 million for 270 new sub-acute care hospital beds over the next four years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005399"></A>
But this agreement is not just about more funding; it will also change the way we deliver health services in the future. We are committed to more localised hospital management with more involvement from clinicians and the community. That is why we will work with the Commonwealth in establishing local hospital networks. These networks will be responsible for the day-to-day operation of public hospitals. It is our aim to establish these networks by 1 July 2011. This is an ambitious time frame and that is why we are getting on with the job of delivering this important reform. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005400"></A>
Right now we want to hear Queenslanders’ views on the number, location and boundaries for these new networks. The networks will need to be large enough to operate efficiently and provide a reasonable range of hospital services, yet still be small enough to be effectively managed. Of course, there will still be some services that will continue to be centrally operated. Those services that deliver a real benefit, professionally or clinically to staff, or a better service for patients state-wide, will continue to be operated in this manner. No-one could suggest that instead of Education Queensland or the Queensland Police Service we should have the Longreach school system or the Cloncurry Police Service. A health service is arguably far more complex and deserves to be delivered as such.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005401"></A>
Who could forget the federal coalition government’s contribution to health reform, the Tasmanian Mersey Hospital takeover, an isolated and poorly thought-out policy announced in a desperate attempt to win a marginal seat? The Queensland government will not rush reform in this manner. We are committed to getting this right. That is why my department has conducted face-to-face and videoconference consultations with almost 1,000 people in 10 health service districts during 36 sessions across 12 different sites. Over the next month sessions are also planned for Cairns, Mount Isa, the Gold Coast, Nambour and Mackay.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005402"></A>
We have heard from staff across every category, as well as GPs, community organisations, health community councils, patient advocates, university clinical schools and peak bodies. Consultations have been scheduled in another seven districts as well as with major health stakeholders. Any Queenslander who wants their view heard can also visit www.health.qld.gov.au/health-reform. All of this feedback will inform the state government’s response to the Commonwealth due later this year. The new networks will have a local CEO and a local governing council and will deliver a real say to Queenslanders on how their local health service is run. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.05 am): Around the world right now the debate is sharpening on the correct path for governments to tread as the global economy navigates its way out of the longer tail effects of the global financial crisis. Our government introduced a comprehensive fiscal and economic reform strategy, one that we have had the courage to stand by and one that is delivering. The recovery in Queensland is building and reports this week from commentators have supported the case.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005406"></A>
Yesterday, CommSec said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1005407"></A>
... the main positive is in the measure of economic growth--Queensland is second strongest of the states with activity just over 18 per cent higher than the decade average.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005408"></A>
The report yesterday did not say our economic growth was behind other states. The fact is it said we were second strongest. It did not create a league table or rank economies, despite some yesterday suggesting that our economy was ranked last. The fact is it is not. Those who suggest it is on the basis of this report are either intent on deliberately talking down the economy or uninterested in the facts getting in the way of a campaign, or perhaps just innumerate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005409"></A>
There are challenges--many challenges--and the recovery is not yet full blown. I have said this consistently and yesterday the CommSec report backed it up. I note also for the record of the House that CommSec has, in fact, changed its methodology after serious concerns were raised by me and other Treasurers. This morning Access Economics has released its business outlook for the September quarter. Access Economics has again improved the growth estimates for Queensland for 2010-11, increasing by half a percent through to 3.8 per cent--ahead of its national forecast of 3.7 per cent. Its forecast improves further in 2011-12, out to 4.4 per cent. Access says in its report--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1005410"></A>
Queensland is expected to once again carve out a growing share of Australia’s economy and population over the longer term. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005411"></A>
We are on the right side of a global industrial revolution. Challenges around property in particular and those related to access to credit are also identified in the report. The report makes note of the potential for Queensland’s LNG industry to provide another layer of strength to our economy. Shepherding this industry to a reality was a key commitment of this government and one that we are delivering on. The fact is the policies we have put in place to create jobs and to expand the economy are working. The evidence is there for all to see, except for those blinded by their campaign of negativity. One can trawl through any report to cherry pick quotes, but the numbers, as ever, tell the real and indisputable story. Jobs have been created in Queensland each month for the last 14 months. The outlook for the state’s economy is a positive one. By maintaining our commitment to invest in the $17 billion building program, the Bligh government’s economic policies are about securing long-term prosperity for the Queensland economy. We are delivering jobs, not cuts; an economy recovery, not a body blow to growth--jobs, not cuts, just like we said we would. </Hansard-Body>

QBuild, Asbestos Removal</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.08 am): Our government takes the issue of protecting people against exposure to asbestos very seriously. QBuild has, for many years, led by example when it comes to increasing awareness of asbestos issues and providing specialist training for its staff to keep them safe. In May last year QBuild began a practical asbestos training program which complies with two national codes of practice.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007047"></A>
In April this year, QBuild conducted a PAT refresher program for all trade based and relevant office staff, irrespective of their occupation. The program was conducted in conjunction with Biga Ltd, a Queensland based registered training program. The refresher program allowed staff to sit the asbestos removal certification exam developed by Workplace Health and Safety Queensland to obtain a B-class asbestos removal certificate. As a result of this training, more than 1,150 QBuild staff now hold a B-class licence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007052"></A>
I am very pleased to inform the House that QBuild’s PAT Program has also been formally accredited as a competency by the Training and Employment Regional Council until 2015. This means that the program, accredited as ‘course in fixed asbestos handling and maintenance’, can be used across Australia by the industry to enhance safety when working with asbestos. Biga lodged the program on behalf of QBuild with the Department of Education and Training for accreditation and formal recognition of the training. Although formal agreements have yet to be made, QBuild will work with Biga on how the course can be promoted to registered training providers and the private sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007054"></A>
This national recognition just goes to show the quality of the training developed by QBuild and the practical commitment of this government to minimising the risk of asbestos. QBuild has also developed a contractors asbestos pack featuring a DVD, safe working procedures and a booklet for correctly and safely managing asbestos. The pack will help ensure contractors doing work for the government know as much about working safely with asbestos as possible and the high standard we expect from them. There are no excuses for them not to follow it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007055"></A>
QBuild staff receive the most comprehensive asbestos training in Australia, and I am pleased that the industry around the country now has the opportunity to benefit from its training and resources. </Hansard-Body>

 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (10.11 am): Queenslanders are well versed in preparing for--and recovering from--natural disasters like storms and floods. So far this year, for example, four tropical cyclones have impacted the Queensland coastline and as much as 90 per cent of local government areas across the state have been flood declared. The impact of natural disasters can be heartbreaking for those whose homes are inundated with floodwaters or, worse still, destroyed by cyclones.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007061"></A>
The Bligh government recognises that the changing climate patterns will have an impact on the frequency and severity of natural disasters in the future. That is why in 2009 we joined forces with the federal Labor government to develop the Natural Disaster Resilience Program. This four-year, $44 million funding program aims to assist local councils and other disaster response organisations to better prepare for--and mitigate the effects of--natural disasters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007063"></A>
With 124 applications for funding received in the program’s second round, it is obvious that organisations such as local councils are more than willing to partner with the state and federal governments on this important work. In fact, on a visit to Cunnamulla last week, Paroo Shire Council Mayor Jo Sheppard expressed to me her support for the program and her hope that her council’s application for funding would be successful. Murweh Shire Council Mayor Mark O’Brien has also initiated applications through the program to enhance Charleville’s resilience to flooding. I am pleased to advise both Councillor Sheppard and Councillor O’Brien that projects in their areas have been approved. In the Paroo local government area the Wyandra community resource and local emergency coordination centre project has attracted $65,000 in funding. Murweh Shire Council will receive close to $1.4 million in funding for a diversion channel for Bradley’s Gully, a Charleville floodgate strategy and the purchase of the Guardian disaster management software. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007071"></A>
These are just four of the 68 projects with a total value of $26 million to receive funding in the Natural Disaster Resilience Program’s second funding round. Other successful projects include flood mapping of the Hughenden urban area, a flood levy improvement project in Balonne Shire, a feasibility and pilot study of flood surveillance cameras in the Ipswich City Council area, and a tropical cyclone storm surge and wave impact study for the Mackay regional coastline. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007072"></A>
By acting now to enhance community resilience we can reduce the effects of future natural disasters and the impact they have on our communities. I seek leave to table a list of successful applications.</Hansard-Body>

Safe Work Australia Week</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (10.14 am): Every person in Queensland deserves to go home safely to their loved ones every day after work. Sadly, this does not occur for about 100 workers in Queensland each year. Furthermore, tens of thousands more workers are injured in the workplace each year, exacting a massive human toll for workers, their families and the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007078"></A>
The Queensland government has made worker safety one of its highest priorities, and part of this means raising awareness among workers and the community about the need to address safety concerns at work. An important part of this approach is our involvement in Safe Work Australia Week, which started on Sunday and continues until Saturday, 30 October 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007079"></A>
Safe Work Week was launched on my behalf in Brisbane yesterday by the Parliamentary Secretary for Industrial Relations, the member for Yeerongpilly. He joined the government’s Safety Ambassador, Rugby League legend Mal Meninga, at the launch, where employers and workers heard about the latest efforts and initiatives to cut death and injury in the workplace. Mal is a keen supporter of Safe Work Week and has added his voice to those of experts letting us know how we can work safer. Mal will be talking about his own family tragedy brought on by a workplace incident. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007082"></A>
Yesterday’s launch was just the start of a week of activities throughout the state where worker safety will be the focus. Here in Brisbane, I will be joining workers and Mal Meninga in King George Square on Thursday for a free breakfast that will highlight workplace health and safety. Tonight, I will attend the annual Queensland Work Safe Awards, which celebrate innovation in workplace health and safety. Other events are being held throughout the state this week, including regional seminars on how to avoid common workplace injuries, an Indigenous business leaders meeting and a major conference on Zero Harm at Work in Rockhampton.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007084"></A>
Workplace safety is not just about employers and workers; it is an issue that impacts everyone. Going to work should mean coming home safe and sound to our loved ones, but the fact is that people die or are seriously injured while doing their jobs and it can happen to anyone at any time. Safety needs to become an integral part of the everyday culture of all workplaces and we must realise that safety is everyone’s responsibility. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. A PALASZCZUK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Inala--ALP) (Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs) (10.16 am): The Bligh government is delivering more for older Queenslanders and those with a disability. We are committed to supporting people who want to remain living in their own homes. We understand that most older people and younger people with a disability wish to remain living in the community but some need support to maintain their independence and social participation. That is why today I am pleased to announce, in conjunction with federal Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mark Butler, that almost $51 million in funding for Home and Community Care services will be allocated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007091"></A>
The centrepiece of this announcement is the allocation of almost $7 million for minor and major home modifications for people right across this state. Minor modifications include installing a hand-held shower, modifying steps or installing handrails. These may seem like small changes to many of us, but to those set to benefit these can be huge improvements to their quality of life. It also enables people to remain living in their own homes for longer. The funding for major modifications includes the installation of stair lifts, ramps or bathroom modifications. Almost 5,000 extra Queenslanders are now set to benefit from these modifications, many of whom are pensioners. This funding will assist residents right across Queensland, from Cairns to Caloundra, from Mount Isa to Mackay and from Logan to Longreach. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007093"></A>
Along with the almost $7 million for home modifications, key components of the new funding allocation also include $10.9 million to increase support for people in their own homes in areas such as cleaning and bathing as well as support to access their community for respite; $5.7 million in major capital to expand or modify buildings and facilities for centre based day care; $2.1 million to provide domestic assistance, personal care, nursing and allied health; $5.5 million for nursing and allied health care, including administering medication, wound dressings, occupational therapy and podiatry; and $3.3 million for transport to assist people to do things like visit their local doctor, to do their shopping and to do their local banking. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007094"></A>
This funding is part of the joint Commonwealth-state Home and Community Care Program. Almost 170,000 Queenslanders benefited from this funding last year. We are committed to ensuring that all Queenslanders remain independent, in their own homes and in their own communities for as long as possible. This significant allocation of funding today is evidence of that commitment. I urge all members to share this good news with members of their local community. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PG REEVES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mansfield--ALP) (Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport) (10.19 am): As members know, over the weekend the Gold Coast 600 took place and it has been hailed a roaring success. ‘A Great Show’ roared the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
. And why are they so pleased? Because 170,073 tickets were sold for the three-day event. They are also pleased about the 551,000 viewers nationwide and the fact that the coverage topped its timeslot on Sunday. Early estimates are that the ratings are well up on last year, with an increase of close to 10 per cent on 2008 figures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007142"></A>
The V8 Supercars event was broadcast to over 110 countries around the world, promoting on an international stage what the Gold Coast and Queensland have to offer. Queensland is where Australia shines. Those numbers mean jobs and a boost to tourism, and that is very important for the Gold Coast, which is famous for fun. This government is about jobs and not cuts. That is the difference between the Bligh government and the LNP.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007143"></A>
I know that the local members are big supporters of the event, particularly the members for Southport, Albert, Burleigh and Broadwater as well as those opposite. The member for Broadwater was very proud of the performance of the Labrador State School choir, which sang the national anthem prior to the first race on Saturday. It was a stirring rendition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007145"></A>
V8 Supercars Australia, the promoters, need to be congratulated. The Gold Coast 600 is an important part of Queensland’s events calendar. Over the past 19 years it has generated an estimated $700 million for the Gold Coast and Queensland economies. This is just one of many events the Bligh government brings to the people of Queensland, and in particular the Gold Coast region. Next month 10,000 athletes will descend on the Gold Coast for the Pan Pacific Masters Games. Later in November, again the eyes of the nation will turn to the Gold Coast as the AFL takes its national draft on the road for the first time in 25 years. We are about attracting the big events because it means jobs, and we are about jobs and not cuts. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. KJ JONES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ashgrove--ALP) (Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability) (10.21 am): The Bligh government is serious about protecting our environment. That is why we have tough penalties in place for companies that breach their environmental authorities. For their operations all mining companies require environmental authorities that set strict standards to protect the environment. Most companies do the right thing and have processes in place to manage any risks from their operations. However, the penalties are severe for those who fail to meet their obligations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007152"></A>
Last week the owner of a Cloncurry copper mine was fined $135,000 for causing serious environmental harm when contaminated stormwater was released into the local creek. The company, Great Australian Operations, has also been forced to remove the contaminated material and provide ongoing monitoring of the creek to ensure it is recovering. This case was the latest in a number of prosecutions that we have pursued against mining companies that have caused environmental harm. Last month Ernest Henry Mining was fined $100,000 for illegal discharges from its copper/gold mine near Cloncurry. Earlier this year MMG Century was also fined $130,000 for discharges from its zinc and lead mine into Page Creek north-west of Mount Isa. Those sentences send a clear message to industry that our government takes our environmental legislation very seriously and if companies cause environmental harm we will not hesitate to act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007157"></A>
In addition to this strong deterrence, our government is also working closely with mining companies to ensure they are prepared for the coming wet season and have systems in place to significantly reduce the potential for illegal discharges to occur. Officers have undertaken an inspection program that includes assessing mining companies’ compliance with the water conditions of their environmental authorities. This is to ensure mines have done the preparation needed ahead of the wet season.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007159"></A>
I would also like to update the House on the matter regarding Australia Pacific LNG’s operations in the Surat Basin. Last week the company briefed the state government on the detection of traces of hydrocarbon chemicals during routine testing on eight exploration wells. The company advised there is no evidence of environmental harm or risk to landholder bores as the water is isolated from watercourses and livestock. The company has suspended its hydraulic fracturing operation as a precaution. While it is investigating the source of the chemicals, and at government’s request, independent testing has been done on relevant landholder bores to confirm that no environmental harm has occurred. The results of those samples are currently being processed by an independent laboratory as a matter of priority. Whenever there is an unexplained detection on a mine site, we expect companies to act. I look forward to updating the House when final results are received. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. TS MULHERIN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland) (10.24 am): I am pleased to announce that applications are now open for $2 million in funding for rural community building programs. One-off grants of up to $10,000 for projects that improve the economic, social, cultural and environmental capacity of communities in rural Queensland are now open until 7 December. The types of projects we are looking for include programs that attract investment and skilled workers, environmental management activities, plans for the development of local sporting facilities or to engage volunteers and events that celebrate a cultural or community milestone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007166"></A>
I encourage eligible organisations in Blueprint for the Bush communities to apply. Eligible organisations must be an incorporated not-for-profit organisation, a sponsored unincorporated not-for-profit organisation, a local government entity or a regional and remote area development organisation. This $2 million in funding is part of the Bligh government’s commitment to helping rural and regional communities become places where people want to live, work and raise families. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007167"></A>
This is just one initiative aimed at regional economic development and rural job growth. Other regional development programs include the Queensland Regional Development Initiative, delivering $7.52 million in funding over four years for key projects and creating job opportunities; the Surat Basin future directions strategy, which is part of a $27.9 million initiative; the $100 million associated with the Sustainable Resource Communities Policy to fund social and economic infrastructure in key mining communities over a three-year period; and the establishment of 12 Regional Development Australia committees across Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007168"></A>
We are firmly focused on delivering for the future economic growth of all of regional and rural Queensland. That is why I am minister for all of rural and regional Queensland and not just specific areas of Queensland. This is part of our plan to protect and create rural jobs and growth, and we are delivering. I encourage organisations to apply and become a part of this rural economic growth by going online to regions.qld.gov.au. Applications are open now. </Hansard-Body>

 I thank the honourable member for the question. As I have stated in this House previously on a number of occasions, and I have had representations from a range of MPs, I have had the pleasure of visiting every single child safety office in Queensland--every single one of them. I have met with the majority of staff both individually and as a group at every one of those offices. </Hansard-Body>

These child safety officers have some of the most difficult jobs imaginable in the Public Service. These child safety officers have to deal with some of the most complex and difficult people that anyone could imagine. These child safety officers have to knock on a door not knowing what to expect on the other side of the door. These child safety officers have to deal with children and young people who have been abused and neglected. These child safety officers are some of the most professional people that I have ever come across in my life. </Hansard-Body>

I want to thank the member for Cook for choosing to walk a day in the shoes of a child safety officer. The member for Cook spoke to me during that experience and he has spoken to me since to inform me of what he learnt from walking a day in their shoes. That is the whole intention of the ‘Walk a day in my shoes’ program. It is so that we can get that firsthand experience. I myself walked a day in the shoes of a teacher aide. I learnt heaps from that experience. </Hansard-Body>

 My second question without notice is to the Premier. When the Labor government announced that it would privatise Queensland Rail, the state’s debt was estimated at $44 billion. Can the Premier confirm that the state’s debt under the long-term Labor government will be more--more--at the end of the privatisation process than it was when Labor first announced the sales? </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am very happy to take this question from the Leader of the Opposition because what it demonstrates, as I said, is that he has a minuscule understanding of the state budget and the state economy. Will we have debt associated with the borrowing to build infrastructure that we had in place at the beginning of the 2009-10? Of course we will. We outlined a borrowing program. We committed to the infrastructure. We signed the contract. We got the cranes on site. We employed thousands of people, and we are building the infrastructure. That means--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007292"></A>

 And more assets. What is the plan of those opposite to reduce debt? They do not have one. They do not have a debt reduction strategy. What we know is that on this side of the House we are determined to build Queensland. We have signed the contracts. We are building the infrastructure. Economists around Australia and around the world have endorsed our strategy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007293"></A>
We will use the assets sales revenue not only to pay down debt now; it will also avoid future debt because those borrowings will be through the private sector. You could not find someone more bereft of economic policy than the member for Surfers Paradise--not a schmick of an idea about how to build a $3 billion or $4 billion project. Under his proposal, he would stop it after he won. He would turn the cranes off. He would send everybody home. We will build Queensland. We will invest in jobs because we stand for jobs, not cuts. We know what those on the other side are up to. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for her question. I thank the member for Albert and the other local members on the Gold Coast for their terrific support of the Armor All Gold Coast 600. It was held last weekend. It is rightly being hailed as a massive success and has provided a much-needed boost to the local economy of the Gold Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009950"></A>
We know that tourism is doing it tough and it is doing it toughest in our biggest and best tourist markets like the Gold Coast. I want to congratulate a great Gold Coast based company, the V8 Supercars, for the work that they have done to make this a success. They have done a terrific job this weekend in their first outing. I think they deserve credit for that. I also want to congratulate and thank the Minister for Sport, Phil Reeves, for the work that he has done to make sure that this was a great event. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009953"></A>
The event has this year injected tens of millions of dollars into the Queensland economy. Some 170,000 tickets were sold. The TV ratings are in. There were 551,000 viewers Australia-wide. The coverage topped its timeslot on Sunday. It beat the Four Nations Rugby League test match. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009955"></A>
This is an example of the massive benefits that can accrue to a local regional economy when a government is prepared to invest in it--invest in the infrastructure needed for it; invest in the incentives to make it happen. We could not get a more stark contrast between what our government is doing for regional centres like the Gold Coast with our infrastructure program and our investments than what would happen if those opposite were in charge. We know they went to the last election with a proposal to cut the budget by three per cent every single year and to cut 12,000 jobs out of the economy every single year. We do not have to think about it any more as just an imagining because we only have to look across the ocean and see it in practice. </Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Treasurer.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question about the importance of this government’s economic plan and the strength of this government’s economic plan that we have put in place. Yes, it is no secret to the Queensland people that we have decided to divest the Abbot Point coal terminal because we have decided not to continue to put public funds into a coal terminal that will require hundreds of millions of dollars in order to expand into the future to meet the needs of the growing resources sector in Queensland. We have decided not to do that. We have decided, as we said, to put it to the market by the end of this year. We have decided to say that we would have that transaction completed in the first half of next year. That we will. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009972"></A>
None of this is a revelation. All of that is in the public arena. What this government will do is continue to pursue the plan that we said we would. Why? Because that plan is delivering. It stands in stark contrast to the plan that is being put forward by the shadow Treasurer and his tory mates on the other side. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009973"></A>
Take a look on the other side of the world right now and we see what the tory plan would be. If those opposite want to continue to fund coal ports then they are going to take a hat to what the UK tories are doing. What does that mean? Billions of dollars of cuts to child benefits. Billions of dollars of cuts to working families. Billions of dollars of cuts to rate subsidies for people who need to pay for it. Billions of dollars of cuts out of education. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009974"></A>
If we look across the water, what are they doing in the UK? Some $53 billion has been cut out of education. There is 21 per cent being taken out of transport, 27 per cent out of local government and 51 per cent out of housing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009975"></A>
What is the evidence in support of the plan that we have taken, the choice that we have made to invest in social services--to invest in the things that Queenslanders need? Do not take my word for it. How about we take what Professor Joseph Stiglitz, who, after all, has only won the Nobel Peace Prize for economics, said. What has he said about the tory plan in the UK? He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1009978"></A>
Cutbacks in investment, in education, technology and infrastructure will be even more costly in the future for they will spell lower growth, lower revenues, indeed higher unemployment itself, especially if persistent will result in the deterioration of skills, in effect in the destruction of human capital. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009979"></A>
That is the miserable prescriptions that the tories in Queensland have for the Queensland government. This is a government that stands for investing, for jobs, not cuts; for not the cruelty of the austerity measures that those opposite advocate. While they stand here and continue to promote their antiprivatisation agenda, all they consign Queensland to is a great big debt snort of another $15 billion in support of resource companies instead of support for families and working people and putting people in jobs just like this government said it would. </Hansard-Body>

Ms JARRATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Premier. Can the Premier outline how our world-class exporters contribute to the Queensland economy and how the government supports their innovation? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009989"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for her question. Our government is very clear about the importance of exporting to the Queensland economy. We are a small domestic market. We will only continue to see growth, prosperity and wellbeing if we keep our eyes firmly focused on the rest of the world. We need to see our market as the global market. Increasingly, we are seeing more and more Queensland companies do just that--turn their eyes to the global market. When they do, the Queensland government is right there to back them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009990"></A>
We believe simply that export equals innovation, equals jobs. Our export agenda is critical to our jobs agenda. Trade and Investment Queensland in its assisted businesses this year secured nearly $614 million in export contracts. That was up 17 per cent on the previous year. So in 2009-10--one of the toughest years economically that the globe has experienced for some time--it was up 17 per cent. Trade and Investment Queensland helped $923 million worth of foreign investment into Queensland in addition to the export. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009992"></A>
Last week was Export Week. Mr Speaker, I was pleased to join with many of our exporters for both our regional export awards in Townsville and Cairns and then here with you and many others for the Premier’s export awards and to recognise those great exporters of Queensland--the new and emerging companies as well as those that have had great achievements over a period of time. It was great to see Queensland’s new export award going to Becker Helicopters on the Sunshine Coast. It won the Dermot McManus Award for their export of pilot training DVDs and manuals around the world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009996"></A>
Of course we know that under Labor we will get investment in business, in innovation, in skills and in programs to grow business. Last year we saw the LNP go to the election promising to cut the Queensland Investment Incentive Scheme--the scheme that brings businesses to Queensland. It had an awfully familiar ring about it.

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It has got an awfully familiar ring about it, because what are the British tories doing? Cutting business, innovation and skills programs by a whopping 28.5 per cent. So it is not just the public sector jobs that will go but it will be all of those companies that rely on those sorts of programs to get going. The slash and burn that is happening in the UK prompted that well-known economist Joseph Stiglitz to make the point that this sort of austerity in hard times turns downturns into recessions and recessions into depressions. Under Labor you will get investment in jobs and investment in infrastructure. The LNP equals cuts!</Hansard-Body>

You actually do not borrow the money to build the hospitals and sit it in the bank until such time as you build them. You draw it down, and of course that debt will go on until that point in time, but an asset is being added to it as part of that. The Sunshine Coast University Hospital will secure 2,500 construction jobs and 3,500 health jobs when it opens and thousands more when nearby commercial facilities open. We of course know that those opposite will not commit to building it. We took the tough decisions because we believe in jobs, not cuts. Indeed, what did CommSec say yesterday through Craig James on ABC Radio? He said--</Hansard-Body>

In the state budget after just 15 months we are already three-quarters of the way towards meeting a commitment of 3,500 extra clinical staff. Since 2005 we have employed more than 14,000 extra doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. This year we will have 556 interns and next year 644. In 2005 it was 250. What are they doing on the other side of the House? They are endorsing regimes throughout the world that actually result in fewer health workers being employed. California in September alone cut 37,300 workers, including 13,600 in health and education alone. In this year’s budget Governor Schwarzenegger cut $1.3 billion in funding for Medi-Cal, California’s free health program for the poor, and the California Medical Association labelled that move ill advised and fiscally reckless, saying that life without access to health care can be terrifying.</Hansard-Body>

In Ireland there have been Public Service pay cuts of between five per cent and 15 per cent in one year. In the UK, $20 billion will be cut from the NHS budget by 2014--double the entire Queensland Health budget this year. There will be a 19 per cent cut to front-line services and it will cut 140 doctor training positions. We have 556 in Queensland alone. It is going to cut 140 out of the UK. Of course, we saw Abbott and Howard cut $1 billion from the Health budget. It is a very clear prescription: you can be committed to an infrastructure building program that will stand Queensland in good stead for the future that is acknowledged by others to do that, or you can take the short-term view. I would rather build hospitals than have coal trains that other people are going to use and build anyway. That is the secret. </Hansard-Body>

What I pointed out to Mr Simpson--and I am happy to point it out in here--is that he is doing nothing to help those members. He sold them out on the job in Queensland. At every single job that I have been on I have had ETU members, BLF members and CFMEU members there and I have repeated the message that we are borrowing money to keep them in jobs. There is no three-year guarantee for them like there is for railway workers. I am not surprised to hear the member defend the rort that is Queensland Rail. The reality is this--</Hansard-Body>

 The Nicklin government enticed the coal industry here with three public subsidies. First of all--the greatest of them all, the greatest rort and the greatest thing done to working people in this state--was to use public housing funds to subsidise houses for wealthy coalminers. That was the first one. I privatised that and I am delighted I did. I privatised every one of those houses in coal communities in Queensland, because it was not good enough--</Hansard-Body>

 I want to get this messages across. That is No. 1. That is what Joh did. He took money off the poor and put it into the coal companies by way of housing. The second point is the low royalties that everybody in the Labor Party complained about for years--everybody before Simpson was even born. Without their saying that the coal companies were rorting the royalties in this state--and that is what Nicklin did and that is what Bjelke-Petersen did; they continued to subsidise those companies by not giving Queenslanders their fair share--</Hansard-Body>

 I know they do not want to hear how for generations the people of Queensland have been robbed because of their government and its decisions to underfund the basic services in this state. It has taken us 20 years in government to try to turn that around, because they did everything they could to kowtow to multinational companies in this state at the expense of the poor in this state. All the teachers in Queensland, the lowest paid in Australia; police officers, the lowest paid in Australia; nurses, doctors, the public health system--run through the floor, all because they would rather subsidise the multinational coal companies in this state. </Hansard-Body>

We privatised the forestry, which they opposed--$603 million that was returning three million bucks. What was the announcement in Rockhampton last week? It was that the new firm was investing in that business, planting thousands more trees. Guess what? They are going to build a new sawmill. Are they putting it on the public account? No, they are not. But there will be more workers there who will be working under award conditions as members of the Australian Workers Union who will have all of their conditions that you people want to take away.

Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 He was not around in 1980, either, in the street-marching stuff. In 1985 he was nowhere to be seen in the SEQEB dispute. I was down here in a number of these rallies and I saw what happened as the police were put on the backs of workers at the instruction of Bjelke-Petersen. I stood in this parliament and voted to restore the conditions of the employees who had been robbed by your side of parliament. In 1975 my father worked for the works department when overnight it was privatised. All of the new school buildings were privatised. They were given out to private enterprise. Guess what happened? He left that job with eight hours pay in his pocket--no relocation expenses, no superannuation. What have the railway workers got? A 14 per cent wage increase that 92 per cent of them supported. The people I know in the railways have got that in their pockets. They have a 14 per cent wage increase, guaranteed superannuation, a guaranteed job and are going into an industry that pays well beyond what every other industry in Rockhampton pays. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012558"></A>
I go on to building sites and I talk to families. I see blokes who do not know where their next job is coming from. They are members of the ETU, and Peter Simpson has never been near them. You have never once heard him say anything about the plight of ETU workers who are struggling to know where their next job is going to come from. He is too busy worrying about 300 or so workers who are guaranteed a job in Queensland Rail. That is what I object to. That is why I wrote the letter to the editor, because there is nothing Labor whatsoever about sponging on the taxpayers’ account by multinationals. I do not support that. No decent person would. And if anybody on that side had any conscience whatsoever, they would reveal to Queenslanders what exactly they intend to do. Are they going to go down the path of what the other economies are doing and slash jobs? Are they going to do that? Are they going to cut the capital works, like the tories did in 1929? Is that what they are going to do, and have 23 and 24 per cent unemployment in this state? </Hansard-Body>

Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Everton for his question and for his commitment, along with the other 50 members of this government, to the government’s economic plan which stands for delivering jobs and not the cuts that the other side stands for. Over the last couple of days we have seen a lot of commentary about the state of the Queensland economy and I want to put it on the record for the benefit of the House. We saw that Craig James from CommSec said yesterday that Queensland is saying that we want infrastructure first and anything else second. He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1015173"></A>
... and I think that longer-term perspective by the Queensland Government is going to hold the Queensland economy in very good stead. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015174"></A>
I could not agree more with Mr James. Even the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 yesterday reported that Mr James from CommSec said that Queensland had been a victim of circumstance, not mismanagement. I look forward to the LNP continuing trying to misquote Mr James and his comments on the Queensland economy. Last week the shadow Treasurer admitted he had a little problem with numeracy, but after his comments trying to put words in the mouth of Mr James yesterday it is clear that he is also illiterate because that same report said that our economic growth was the second strongest in the nation--up 18 per cent on the decade average. While ever the shadow Treasurer and those around him continue to advance the fraud that they do not support privatisation, we know that they do support something else. In the absence of them coming clean and finally admitting--as they have so many times before on the record--that they support privatisation, we know what the alternative is because it is being played out around the world at the moment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015175"></A>
What is the alternative? Well, in the UK right now the shadow Chancellor, the shadow Treasurer, just put in place a plan for cutting 500,000 jobs out of the British public sector. That is what those opposite will be aspiring to at the next election. They went to the last election with a plan to cut 12,000 jobs. They will be looking across the ocean with stars in their eyes. Because we know right around the world that a tory is a tory. A tory here is a Tory in the UK. What do they stand for here? Like they stand for in the UK, they stand for cuts. What do we stand for? We stand for jobs. One hundred thousand jobs are being supported in the Queensland economy because of the courage of this government to take the high road and to put in place the program. How many people have lost a job because of privatisation? Zero. How many people have got a job in Queensland because of the courage of all 51 members of this government? One hundred thousand people because of the building program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015176"></A>
I am proud to stand with 50 other people who have the courage of their convictions, unlike those vacuous and callous people opposite who would condemn this state and the working people in it to the austerity measures that the UK tories are putting in place. I encourage all Queenslanders to look across the shore to see the horror of what these tories really stand for. </Hansard-Body>

 There has been quite a bit of speculation recently about the future of Queensland racing. Let me assure the House that racing in Queensland is in safe hands. The government, as those opposite well know, has committed $80 million to Racing Queensland to develop infrastructure. Racing Queensland has gone through the various pieces of infrastructure around the state and put a submission to the government which is being considered. The first thing you have to remember is that Albion Park is owned by Racing Queensland, as are other places such as the Gold Coast Turf Club.</Hansard-Body>

last week I was overseas in London and China promoting tourism. When I came back the various comments made by the opposition and the Mayor of Brisbane about the future of Albion Park were brought to my attention. So I had a little look at what the town plan provides for Albion Park. Let me read a bit from the Brisbane City Council Albion Neighbourhood Plan--</Hansard-Body>

The intent is to encourage redevelopment of the Albion Park raceway facility. The preferred option is for the relocation of the facility to allow redevelopment more appropriate to an inner city location. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

 The interesting thing, of course, is that if one looks at the UK, they are going to cut sport and culture by 24 per cent. I suppose that is part of the platform of those opposite, too, now. We have committed to in excess of $80 million over the next four years. We are assessing the most recent submission put by Racing Queensland to the government. </Hansard-Body>

Mr KILBURN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Attorney-General. Could the Attorney-General provide the House with details of any significant milestones in relation to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017700"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for his question and for his unwavering support for an independent Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Queensland, which he has spoken at length about in this House. Last week was a significant milestone for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions as we celebrated its 25th anniversary. I was very pleased to attend the function that was held to commemorate that event with not only the Director of Public Prosecutions, Tony Moynihan SC, but also all three former directors: Des Sturgess QC, Royce Miller QC and Judge Leanne Clare SC. It allowed me to celebrate the work of 384 staff members in that office who work throughout Queensland. Fifty per cent work out in regional Queensland and more than half of the staff are women. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017702"></A>
We need courageous, fearless and, most importantly, independent prosecutors in this state. It is only Labor that stands up for an independent Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Last year, in 2009-10, that office conducted 950 committals, 850 trials, more than 4,300 sentences, 250 bail hearings and 466 appeals. In the past five years this Labor government has increased funding to that office by a third. We will continue to support an independent office, and it is only Labor that supports the independence of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017703"></A>
The number 25 is an important number. It is an important number for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and an important number for conservatives because that is the size of the cut that is being delivered to the justice system in the United Kingdom--a 25 per cent cut to the UK Home Office. What does that mean? Up to 18,000 police officers will be cut, up to 3,000 prison places will be cut and, most damnably of all, £350 million will be cut from legal aid. It is not a cut; it is a massacre to public finances never seen before in living memory. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017704"></A>
No wonder the Leader of the Opposition will not talk about his economic plan. If members opposite do not support assets sales, if they do not support increasing revenue by raising taxes, there is only one way to get the budget into surplus, which is what the Leader of the Opposition said he wants to do, and that is to cut, to cut and to cut again. You cannot keep the community safe if you cut public defenders, public prosecutors, police and prison services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017705"></A>
I challenge the Leader of the Opposition today to go out of this House and to speak to the media and say that he will not cut. I challenge him to do that today. These cuts in the UK have been described as ‘brutal, ideological and cripplingly unfair austerity’. That is the only option they have. That is their dirty little plan. That is the secret plan of the opposition. I call on the Leader of the Opposition today to rule it out once and for all. </Hansard-Body>

Mr EMERSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I refer the Premier to the weekend by-election in the Walter Taylor ward where Labor came a distant third, with just 16 per cent. Will the Premier now give a guarantee that she will not, in any way, try to rig or cheat Labor’s way to the next state election by changing the electoral laws for voting? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. I am pleased to have an opportunity to talk about the weekend by-election result in the Brisbane City Council ward of Walter Taylor because I think it has some very interesting outcomes for all political parties. It was an interesting outcome for Labor, although I do note that the Walter Taylor ward is what would be known on any measure as an absolutely blue ribbon Liberal Party seat; it has never been held by the Labor Party. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017717"></A>
I was a bit concerned that there was such a low voter turnout at just over 60 per cent. That is probably partly because it was a by-election, but that is something that we should all be a bit worried about. We do want to see a high voter turnout at any election at any level of government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017720"></A>
The much more interesting outcome of the Brisbane City Council by-election on Saturday was the swing against the Liberal National Party in that ward. The preliminary results show a primary swing against the LNP of over six per cent and a likely two party preferred swing against the LNP of close to nine per cent. It was a pretty interesting outcome in a ward that has never been held by Labor. If I was the member for Indooroopilly, I would be having a long, hard look at a number of the booths and I would not have Campbell Newman out campaigning for me on polling day. </Hansard-Body>

Ms MALE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Education and Training. Could the minister please outline what support the Bligh government is providing for teacher aides in Queensland? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017730"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. Teacher aides are a vital part of the total complement of teaching staff in our state schools. They make such an enormous difference to the opportunities of kids in state schools; they give them a flying start into learning and life. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017732"></A>
Only last weekend I had the pleasure of opening the Lighting the Way conference of teacher aides from across Queensland. About 350 teacher aides attended, undergoing professional development, networking and talking about how they can help kids in school. They, too, want to give kids a flying start in our schools. They are really the quiet achievers, as I discovered when I experienced my ‘Walk a day in my shoes’ day last Tuesday at Samford State School. What these teacher aides do is just beyond the imagination. They support in such a range of ways. I commend them and congratulate them all the way through. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017733"></A>
There are 14,000 teacher aides in Queensland. We stand behind the important work that they do. Their work flies beneath the radar in some ways and is not recognised like it ought to be. We need to keep recognising it and raising their profile. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017734"></A>
We support teacher aides and teaching staff. The Liberals and the National Party do not. They stand for cuts. If there is one thing that is in the DNA of the Liberals and Nationals and the tories, complicated as it might be, it is cuts. Whatever it is, cut it. Cut jobs, cut whatever. In England, 490,000 public servants will have their jobs cut and £7 billion will be cut from the welfare budget. What did the Liberal National Party say at the last state election--our home grown version of tories? It said that 36,000 public servants would be cut from the Queensland Public Service over three years. That translates to 420 teacher aides every year over three years or 990 teachers every year over three years. However, we support increasing those teacher and teacher aide numbers and we have dramatically done so in the past. But wait, there is a policy change. A press conference was held by the Leader of the Opposition in which he said only last weekend that he wants smaller class sizes. How can he have smaller class sizes by cutting teacher aides and cutting teachers? The two do not add up, but I have an answer as to why he may have said that. He consulted his Treasury spokesman, whom we know really understands mathematics, and he has given the advice that it does add up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017737"></A>
We stand for strong education and the retention of teacher aides. The opposition stands for cuts, cuts and cuts. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Premier. With the announcement of federal government approval of two LNG projects for Gladstone, will the Premier give an undertaking to residents in my electorate that this government will fund necessary infrastructure including expanded hospital and health services, affordable housing, roads, social services and education and not abrogate its responsibility for funding this growth? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017743"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. As she well knows, these two projects offer an extraordinary opportunity, not only in the south-west of our state but, importantly, in Gladstone and I believe to the entire Central Queensland area. Along with that growth will come demand for increased infrastructure. I am very pleased that the Coordinator-General’s conditions on these companies include for the first time in many years a requirement on the companies themselves to invest and construct a number of houses in both Gladstone and in the south-west. I think that is important because it will go quite a long way to relieving housing cost pressures. I do not want to see ordinary families who have lived in Gladstone for a long time finding it hard to buy or to rent because of that pressure. That is a very important step by the Coordinator-General. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017748"></A>
The member is right; it will also lead to demand with increased population for increased services in areas like education, health and police. I am very happy to put on record an assurance that this government will continue to fund, firstly, schools along the formula that applies everywhere else in Queensland. When we have new enrolments, new classrooms and the teachers and other staff needed will follow. I understand from the Deputy Premier that Queensland Health is currently doing a services plan for the Gladstone Hospital and health service area and that he has met personally with the member for Gladstone. The purpose of that plan is to make sure that we are one step ahead of the growth and demand that we expect to come out of these projects. Similarly, in areas such as policing and roads, ministers are working on the implications for not only Gladstone and Central Queensland, but also for the south-west of the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017751"></A>
As I have said in a number of forums, particularly in South-West Queensland there are communities that, literally for decades, have been experiencing population decline. Whenever I have visited those communities I have talked to local residents, mayors and others about the problems of decline, such as how to keep teachers at the schools and how to keep hospital services going. There is some spare capacity in those towns to absorb some of this, but there will need to be growth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017752"></A>
However, over the last few decades Gladstone has been a growing community and we will have to continue to make sure that we match that growth. I look forward to working with the council in Gladstone, the local member and other relevant stakeholders to make sure that we are a step ahead of that growth. It will be a challenge, but it is a great challenge to have. This is prosperity the likes of which has not been seen in Queensland for a long time in terms of a brand-new industry and we welcome it. </Hansard-Body>

 I know you are crooked on apprentices and QBuild, but other people might be interested in listening to this. This is the time of year when we release annually 100 apprenticeships through QBuild, the same QBuild that those opposite would privatise. Since we have been in government, 1,339 people have gained trades. That has happened because this government has been in power and QBuild has not been privatised, which is what the previous government intended to do. I want to know whether it will be reassessed. I have here a document. I found out that the honourable member who sits opposite cannot even be original. He has borrowed a phrase from Chancellor George Osborne, who said there would be ‘fundamental reassessment’. It sounds like he would have said it. That is the way they are: there is not an original thought in their minds; they borrow terminology from the Brits and the tories. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition) (11.30 am): Today it has emerged that this long-term Labor government is good at only one thing: creating debt. The astonishing thing is that Labor is creating debt faster than it can sell assets. It does not matter how fast the ‘for sale’ signs go up, Labor’s debt total goes up faster. Labor is no longer running a government; it is running a great big debt generator. On 22 November QR National will be listed on the Stock Exchange, delivering a maximum of $5 billion to this desperate Labor government that is drowning in debt. The LNP has opposed that sale from day one. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020358"></A>
On 2 June 2009 the budget that contemplated the sale of QR National was brought into this House. From the day the legislation was brought into this House and rushed through by a Labor government that deceived the people of Queensland by saying that it had no plans to sell assets but as soon as it got re-elected started planning a fire sale, the fire sale of Queensland assets has been consistently opposed by the LNP. The LNP continues to oppose the rushed sale of assets, including the sale of QR National, which has been imposed on Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020359"></A>
Let us not forget why Labor has mistakenly gone down the path of privatising assets such as QR National. Let us not forget that Labor sent Queensland bust in a boom. Queensland was the only state to have its credit rating downgraded during the global financial crisis. Queensland did not lose its AAA credit rating because of a downturn in the resources sector. If it did, Western Australia would have lost its as well. Queensland lost its AAA credit rating simply because of the economic irresponsibility of this toxic, long-term Labor government. Now every man, woman and child in Queensland will be carrying government debt of almost $20,000 each, and this Labor government is trying to tell them that it has no choice but to sell an asset that Queenslanders already own. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020360"></A>
Asset sales are not the solution to the debt crisis of Labor’s making. For years the Queensland budget has been in structural deficit. The solution to a structural deficit is not a fire sale of assets but involves living within your means by controlling the growth in government expenditure. The waste and unsustainable spending by this state Labor government would make Gough Whitlam blush. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020361"></A>
Today, there are two very disturbing facts that I want to remind the House of. The first is that in the 18 months between when Labor first announced the sale of QR National and the date it gets its hot, wasteful little hands on the proceeds more debt has been accumulated than the government expects to receive from the sale. Labor members should listen carefully to this: there will be more debt after the sale of QR National than there was when it was first announced. More than $10 billion of additional debt has been accumulated since the announcement of the privatisation of QR National. That is twice the current anticipated proceeds of the sale of QR National. The second disturbing fact is that in the time between when Labor first announced the sale of assets and when it completes its entire privatisation agenda, including the sales of the Port of Brisbane, Abbot Point and Queensland Motorways, more debt will have been accumulated than the expected sale proceeds of the entire privatisation agenda of around $15 billion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020362"></A>
I will repeat those disturbing facts for the benefit of the House, because they are indeed startling. There will be more debt after the sale of QR National than there was when it was first announced and, worse, there will be more debt after the sale of all the assets than there was when they were first announced. Even when we compare the sale proceeds of QR National to the interest on Labor’s debt, it is but a drop in the ocean. The expected sale proceeds of $4 billion to $5 billion from QR National would not even pay the interest bill for the next 18 months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020363"></A>
The LNP believes that growing our economy and stopping the waste are the best ways to start paying off the generational debt that Labor has left all Queenslanders and future Queenslanders. This state has had nearly two decades of Labor’s irresponsible spending. My government will balance the books, my government will repay the debt and my government will get the AAA credit rating back, because that is the economically responsible thing to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020364"></A>
A stagnant or declining population will undoubtedly lead to higher unemployment. Recently the Bureau of Statistics revealed that last year Queensland had the lowest interstate migration level since 1984. That is incredibly bad news. It is incredibly bad news for Queensland business. Ever-rising state charges for water, electricity and rego are making it increasingly difficult for businesses and ordinary families. No longer do southerners flock to Queensland as a state of opportunity. Instead, they see a poorly managed state burdened by debt, a state burdened by deficit and a state burdened by a toxic, long-term Labor government. We will ensure that we get our state from the bottom of the ladder in terms of economic performance, service delivery, education standards and cultural facilities back to where we should be: right at the top. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020365"></A>
This toxic, long-term Labor government is out of puff and is limping its way to the next election. The comparison between Western Australia and Queensland could not be more clear. Both are resource-rich states. WA is absolutely booming under a conservative probusiness government while Queensland is struggling under a tired, old Labor government that impedes business at every turn. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020366"></A>
If we are elected, we will re-energise Queensland. We will do what good governments do best: facilitate and encourage business. Our No. 1 task will be to let business get on with business, to grow and create jobs and to create the wealth that generates the taxes to provide the services Queenslanders need. An LNP government will rebuild Queensland’s economy through a partnership with business. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020367"></A>
There will be a lot to fix after such a long-term Labor government. However, that has happened elsewhere in the country, with Jeff Kennett in Victoria and Premier Colin Barnett in WA. I am confident that an LNP government will turn around this state’s fortunes and create an environment in which we can all prosper and, importantly, once again we can be proud that Queensland regains its rightful place as the best place to work, live and do business. Under an LNP government, Queensland has a much brighter future. </Hansard-Body>

Safe Work Australia Week</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020399"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms GRACE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Brisbane Central--ALP) (11.39 am): The Bligh government is urging employees, employers and the community to work together to cut the incidence of death and injury in the workplace. The plea has been made as part of Safe Work Australia Week, which runs this week from 24 to 30 October. Safe Work Australia Week is of vital importance in spreading the message throughout the entire community that workplace safety is for everyone. We all have a role to play in cutting injury and death from the workplace. Ensuring that Queensland workers come home safe and healthy is a goal worth striving for. It does not matter what industry we work in. As Queenslanders, we want to return home safe each day to our families and loved ones. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020404"></A>
Promoting workplace health and safety has been a lifelong mission for me and it is vital to cutting the Queensland workplace injury and fatality toll. There was a slogan in the union movement, and we have lived by it for many years, in relation to occupational health and safety--that is, that workers sell their labour, not their health. The human dimension is that each year in Queensland there are about 100 work related fatalities and nearly 30,000 cases where workers are either permanently impaired or seriously injured. On the economic side, the cost of these workplace incidents to the Queensland economy has been estimated at more than $5.2 billion each year. The Queensland government wants to turn these shocking statistics around to ensure that people make it home safe and sound to their loved ones at the end of each working day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020407"></A>
The government is working with employers and workers to build a positive zero harm safety culture in all Queensland workplaces to reduce the number and severity of workplace incidents. Ensuring our businesses are as safe and productive as possible will also secure Queensland jobs and keep the economy strong. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020410"></A>
Safe Work Australia Week is for all Queenslanders--whether you are a small, medium or large business; an office worker or labourer; an apprentice or manager; from the country or the city; or work in an office or outdoors. This is the perfect opportunity for employers and workers to look carefully at their workplace health and safety practices and systems and how they can be improved. Workplace Health and Safety Queensland has many events planned during Safe Work Australia Week to raise awareness of the importance of a safe and healthy workplace, as I said, for all Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020415"></A>
It was great to have Simon Finn, parliamentary secretary to the Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations, launch the Safe Work Australia Week at a forum held at the Victoria Park Golf Complex in my electorate of Brisbane Central. The forum keynote address was delivered by rugby league legend and Queensland State of Origin coach, Mr Mal Meninga. Mal has taken on the role as a safety ambassador for Safe Work Australia Week this month and will be helping to spread the safety message during the week. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020419"></A>
The forum provided a comprehensive look at the new harmonised occupational health and safety laws to be introduced from 1 January 2010. Speakers from Safe Work Australia and Workplace Health and Safety were there to outline details of key aspects of the new legislation. John Crittall from Master Builders Queensland and Amanda Richards from the Queensland Council of Unions were also there to discuss the impact of the new laws from an employers’ and workers’ perspective. Also in attendance was the Workplace Health and Safety Board chair, Vince O’Rourke, and other board members. The new laws will mean that occupational health and safety rules will be applied consistently across Australia, making it easier for workplaces to understand and comply with requirements and this will improve both safety and productivity in industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020424"></A>
On Thursday the 28th this week Mal Meninga, along with the Hon. Cameron Dick, the minister, will be at the King George Square Zero Harm at Work breakfast, which kicks off at 7 am, and I plan to be there. Celebrating this year’s theme ‘Zero Harm at Work, the event will include Nova 106.9 providing entertainment, games and giveaways. Safety ambassador Mal Meninga will address the crowd and discuss the importance of workplace health and safety and his personal perspectives as a coach, team player, business owner and family man. Industry groups supporting the Zero Harm at Work theme have agreed to be involved in the event providing giveaways or support with promotional materials, banners and a variety of interesting stands. Come along everyone and have the chance to win an autographed football from Mal. </Hansard-Body>

Helping businesses to set up health and wellbeing programs is a priority for the Queensland government. There are a host of activities happening in hundreds of workplaces across the state from Toowoomba to Townsville to Rockhampton. In Rockhampton, we have the second annual Central Queensland Zero Harm Seminar. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SHINE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (11.44 am): On 4 September this year I was very grateful that the Premier travelled to Toowoomba to open the $8 million National Carriage Factory at the Cobb and Co Museum in Toowoomba. This project received an investment of $4 million from the Queensland government. I was very keen to see this project come to fruition, as were notables in Toowoomba like Mary Wagner and the Premier’s former media adviser Steve Keating. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020436"></A>
Why is this a very significant project? The Cobb and Co Museum will serve as Queensland’s first nationally accredited training facility for trades that are in danger of being lost--trades like blacksmithing, leadlighting and leather work. The Cobb and Co expansion is a key infrastructure development for the region, creating jobs. The Cobb and Co expansion created around 280 jobs in the first year of operation. It has also stimulated the local economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020438"></A>
The development was also supported by the Board of the Queensland Museum, the Department of Education and Training, Q150 community legacy infrastructure and the local community. With respect to the local community, it contributed $2 million, which was a fantastic amount to be raised in a city like Toowoomba. The campaign to launch it was set up about four years ago under the leadership of Mary Wagner, and some really outstanding donations were from Mr and Mrs Clive Armitage and Mr Clive Berghofer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020444"></A>
The museum features a purpose-built, open plan factory for workshops with accredited heritage training programs in specialities such as heritage building, blacksmithing, silversmithing and equine trades catering for secondary school traineeships through to adult learners. This project builds on the great work carried out by Cobb and Co over many years, led very efficiently by its CEO, Deborah Tranter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020447"></A>
I also mention an event that occurred on 8 October this year when the Minister for Sport, Mr Reeves, attended Toowoomba. He announced a government grant of $2.24 million towards a total of $3.6 million for the construction of a tennis centre and clubhouse at the University of Queensland. The minister launched the project at the USQ amongst officials from the USQ, the city council, the Toowoomba Tennis Association and indeed Tennis Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020453"></A>
The project will create nine International Tennis Federation standard courts and will construct a clubhouse. The three existing courts on site will be upgraded. So in total there will be 12 ITF standard courts. The project will be completed in early 2011. The facility will provide more opportunities for everyone to play tennis and for tennis events to be held. Other funding came from USQ, $600,000; the Toowoomba Regional Council, $300,000; Tennis Queensland, $362,582; Tennis Australia, $80,000; and the Toowoomba Tennis Association, $20,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020455"></A>
The program creates much needed jobs and supports local suppliers of products and services. The Queensland government recognises the important role sport, such as tennis, plays and how it contributes to the local community. We are committed to providing sport and recreation facilities that help Queenslanders to get active and work with industry leaders to build capacity within the sport and recreation industry. This project contributes to the Toward Q2: Tomorrow’s Queensland initiative of helping Queenslanders become Australia’s healthiest people by reducing obesity levels by one-third by 2020. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020457"></A>
The minister, whilst in Toowoomba, also announced a rescue package for the Toowoomba Sports Ground Trust. The trust has been conducting a review of its operations in light of its financial difficulties. The state government has delivered a $150,000 rescue package to ensure that the Toowoomba Sports Ground survives into the future. It is an iconic sporting facility for the Toowoomba community, and we certainly do not want to see it fail. I met with the minister on a number of occasions, and I was very pleased that he acceded to our request. The trust chairman, John McDonald, said, ‘The Queensland government has stepped in to save the sportsground at a time when we needed it most.’  </Hansard-Body>

Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Callide--LNP) (11.49 am): I today join with the Premier in welcoming the approval by the federal minister for environment, Tony Burke, of the two coal seam gas projects which will produce LNG for export from Gladstone. I reaffirm the support of the LNP for the proposals that are being pursued by the BG Group, Santos, Petronas and Total joint venture. The conditions applied by the federal minister together with the conditions already applied by the Queensland Coordinator-General will make this the most heavily regulated and closely monitored industry in Queensland’s history. That should ensure that the land and water assets of the area are appropriately protected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023311"></A>
The current state Labor government in Queensland has not dealt well with the development of the industry up until now. It has constantly lagged behind and has had to be pushed by the LNP opposition and a range of stakeholder groups. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023312"></A>
There is no doubt that the state will benefit hugely from this new industry. It is up to the state government to ensure that all the resources are in place to properly cope with the development and protect the environment in the region. Some of the regional communities that have been declining for decades can anticipate an explosion of growth and economic development the likes of which they could only have dreamed about in the past. Already small businesses of all types from Gladstone to Toowoomba have been gearing up to be in a position to benefit from the development of the gas industry. Likewise, the state government needs to be gathering up its service delivery to ensure that people in south-west Queensland and Gladstone can cope with the coming development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023314"></A>
When I made my first speech in this parliament 12 years ago I said that the biggest export from regional Queensland was our kids. At that time there was only one choice for young people in the communities that I represented. That was to leave to get a job somewhere else. Over those years the coalmining industry has developed markedly. Now it will be joined by a whole new coal seam gas industry that will provide high-value jobs and career paths in central and south-western Queensland communities for generations of such young people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023315"></A>
The gas industry will bring new skills and a new work culture to an area of our state where the choices have been very limited. As a local member I welcome that. I will be focusing on ensuring that my constituents can access the opportunities that will come with the export gas industry. I will also be maintaining my strong focus on the issues that have already affected landholders throughout the region who are dealing with such things as exploration activities, gas production infrastructure or pipeline construction on their land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023317"></A>
The government has been slow to act on many of the regulatory issues involved. The CSG industry is different from traditional mining activities in that it involves a long-term co-existence between landholders and gas companies. My aim as a local member and shadow minister, and hopefully as a minister, is to achieve a situation where that long-term co-existence produces an outcome where every landholder who is involved in the CSG industry ends up better off than they would have otherwise been. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023320"></A>
The land access laws and the compensation provisions currently require that landholders be made no worse off. But the future aim of all industry participants should be to ensure that landholders are better off. Likewise with the environmental issues, especially the water issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023323"></A>
There has been a lot of concern expressed about the water issue, and understandably so. But I believe that the CSG developments, with proper management, can improve the water situation in the area by using the produced water to supplement existing irrigation schemes and to recharge aquifers that have been declining under current extraction levels for many years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023324"></A>
The state and federal conditions will set up the most extensive and rigorous water-monitoring system in Queensland’s history, and rightly so. But that water-monitoring system should ensure that any unplanned-for impacts are detected very quickly, and both sets of conditions deal extensively with the remediation requirements in any such situation. They should also deal with remediation and re-establishment of vegetation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023326"></A>
This development will overlay a whole new energy province on a closely settled existing agricultural area, some of which is unquestionably high-quality land. It will be a huge challenge to successfully achieve that in a way that ensures that the economic benefits of the export gas industry flow to the state and to the local communities and, at the same time, that the long-term sustainability of the land and water assets are protected and that individual property owners’ rights are not trampled. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023327"></A>
The LNP as a whole and the local members who represent the area will continue to ensure that the complexities of that challenge are recognised and met in a proper way. We will continue to push the government on a whole range of issues on which the government has been slow to act. We will continue to ensure that the land and water assets are protected. We will continue to support the industry to produce the economic outcomes for the whole of Queensland that it has the potential to do. </Hansard-Body>

Building the Education Revolution</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023330"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms CROFT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Broadwater--ALP) (11.54 am): Young Queenslanders all over the state are enjoying learning in world-class facilities because of the Bligh government’s delivery of the federal government’s Building the Education Revolution program. The BER program is delivering 21st century facilities such as school halls and libraries that make parents and students happy to go to school. In my electorate more than $9.8 million is being spent on 12 projects across four schools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023332"></A>
Two independent reports by PricewaterhouseCoopers, in 2009 and 2010, have already found that Queensland projects achieved value for money. As well as value for money, Queensland’s BER rollout also achieved best practice design standards which were coordinated by the Department of Education and Training in a way that allowed schools to focus on their core business of teaching and learning. Most recently, a third report from the federal government’s BER task force confirmed that BER delivery in Queensland is a success. The federal government task force met with senior department officers, had access to all the files and documents regarding our BER program and at no stage raised any criticism. Further, all of the applicable recommendations in all three reports have been implemented or are in the process of being adopted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023338"></A>
A fourth report into the rollout of BER will be released tomorrow by the Queensland Auditor-General. I am confident that this report will confirm what the previous three already have. The Bligh government is committed to transparency and we look forward to the release of this latest report. I am confident that it will yet again show that Queensland got value for money and built facilities that students and teachers from the Gold Coast to the Far North enjoy using every day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023340"></A>
Queensland has had a different approach to Building the Education Revolution from the very beginning. It was our objective from the very start of this process to stretch every dollar as far as we could for every school. We recognised that we could not take a cookie-cutter approach with BER as every school was different and had individual needs. That is why we consulted widely with school communities and the P&amp;Cs--to ensure we got the most bang for our buck. Their views have been carefully considered in each project and, combined with a flexible approach while still complying with BER program guidelines, schools have secured better quality outcomes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023341"></A>
Queensland state schools handled more than four times the number of projects as the Catholic sector, many of them in rural and remote areas. Considering the high number of state school projects, it is pleasing to note that there have been only 21 complaints out of the more than 4,500 infrastructure projects--that is less than half of one per cent--and the federal task force singled out the Queensland state school sector for praise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023343"></A>
As well as building better schools for our children to learn in, the Queensland construction industry has also benefited from Building the Education Revolution. As this House would well know, our construction industry is still trying to recover from the severe effects of the global financial crisis. The BER program is delivering real work for Queensland businesses, real jobs for locals and new facilities for our schools. I know that the Gold Coast construction industry has been particularly hard hit. It is our BER projects and others funded through the Bligh government’s $17.1 billion infrastructure program that is keeping them going. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023345"></A>
The two PricewaterhouseCoopers reports and the federal task force report all tell us that BER in Queensland has been going well, has been managed and is a success. Even the opposition via the member for Moggill has acknowledged how important this BER program is. In fact, the member recently wrote to our education minister to inform him of how delighted he was by the BER program in his own electorate and even asked for more funding. Despite his private delight at the program, he is still publicly condemning it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023346"></A>
Three reports and a fourth on the way all tell us the same thing: BER in Queensland is a success and it is building first-class facilities to enhance and develop the young minds of our future generations. I know that our Minister for Education is anticipating another positive report when it is released tomorrow. I look forward to hearing more success stories from teachers, parents and students who, like me, are delighted with the results and the long-term outcomes of their Building the Education Revolution projects. </Hansard-Body>

Murray-Darling Basin</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023385"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr HOBBS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Warrego--LNP) (11.59 am): For the last 16 years Queenslanders who live in Murray-Darling Basin catchments have negotiated, researched and argued on the value of every drop of water in that system. This protracted debate has taken a severe toll on many landholders and irrigators in terms of their private lives and in terms of their businesses. Due to the fact that Queensland was one of the last states in this system to develop its irrigation industry and southern states had already overallocated theirs, there was consistent pressure on Queensland to underdevelop and allow more water to flow into southern states. Queensland irrigators in the Lower Balonne even offered and gave up a 10 per cent reduction in allocations. Yes, there was a voluntary reduction of 10 per cent by Queensland irrigators to try to help the river system. The state Queensland Labor government deliberately manipulated the science and was discredited in a Land Court case. Landholders funded their own scientific studies. They had to because they could not trust what the government was saying. During this time, as members can imagine, debate was very heated.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023390"></A>
As a circuit breaker the landholders’ science was peer reviewed by an independent group of scientists headed by the late Professor Peter Cullen from the Wentworth Group. That peer review found that the landholders’ science and understanding of the river was correct--that is, that the Lower Balonne was in fact in good shape and not dissimilar to the Warrego and the Paroo, where there was little or no irrigation. Finally after 16 years the resource operation plan was signed off on by the state government and peace finally came to the Murray-Darling Basin catchments in this state. Other river resource operation plans were also signed off on. The river system of the Murray-Darling Basin and in particular the Condamine-Balonne has had intensive scrutiny and has had detailed science, but we have a sustainable extraction rate for long-term sustainability.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023398"></A>
The Commonwealth government has now instructed the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to redo all of the work that has already been done in Queensland in the Murray-Darling Basin catchment and to develop sustainable diversion limits. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority has determined a 3,000 to 4,000 gigalitre a year reduction in the current diversion limits which represents a reduction of between 22 per cent and 29 per cent on average across the whole basin. In Queensland our sustainable peer review, which is 15 years of scrutiny, shows that the river system is higher than the average. With regard to the Condamine-Balonne, they want to claw back 29 per cent. In terms of the Warrego, which has roughly 80 per cent end-of-valley flow, they want a 40 per cent cut. In terms of the Moonee, which has 70 per cent end-of-valley flow, they want a 34 per cent cut. In terms of the Nebine, which has in the vicinity of 90 per cent end-of-valley flow, they want a 40 per cent cut.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023404"></A>
The Warrego runs into swamps and hardly gets to the Darling anyway. Therefore, this cutback will close down the existing small irrigating industry and will not put any more water into the Darling. This is a devastating plan for Queenslanders all the way down each river system--from the piggeries on the Downs and the hatcheries on the Downs to the feedlots, the farms and the towns from the Darling Downs right through to the border. This is only causing uncertainty once again for our industries, our towns and our jobs. The reason they have not had water down the Murray-Darling Basin is that it has not rained. There has been a drought. Everybody has been suffering, and even rivers not in the Murray-Darling Basin have also suffered the same fate. It has not damned well rained!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023410"></A>
If the federal government is serious about finding some water, it should look at carrying out good environmental work on Menindee Lakes and save the 250 to 300 gigalitres from the evaporation that occurs each year. The Menindee Lakes has been changed from its natural state and man-made banks have been built to hold water back. A sustainable off-stream storage should be built to supply Broken Hill and the banks removed, with some careful planning and further works to be done to enhance the environmental qualities of the lakes and allow more water to flow down that system. A tax has also been put on the people of the Lower Balonne, which is worth $2.5 million a year. They are the only irrigators in the whole of Australia who have that special tax. That has been imposed on them and it should be removed. If the tax is to remain, at least put it into a fighting fund to fight this dreadful takeover by the Commonwealth government because it is only going to destroy our irrigators, our towns and our jobs in this state. </Hansard-Body>

Let’s Stay Put Program</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023418"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms NELSON-CARR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mundingburra--ALP) (12.04 pm): I rise today to speak about a project which is little known in general but extremely well known as a positive achievement in some Townsville schools because of the collaboration between James Cook University and Education Queensland. It is a project which targets mobile students, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, in high areas of disadvantage, and that means in many slabs of my electorate. At the end of 2010 funding for the Let’s Stay Put project at Heatley, Vincent and Currajong state schools will come to an end. These schools receive funding from Community Renewal money which was allocated based on the results from the Commonwealth project in 11 other Townsville schools. This funding has made a difference, and I thank the Minister for Communities for her foresight and commitment. The funding under the Smarter Schools National Partnership program for literacy and numeracy is the Closing the Gap commitment which I believe must be continued.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023429"></A>
Let me talk about the Let’s Stay Put program. In 2006 Let’s Stay Put commenced in the Upper Ross in Townsville. The project aims to address the needs of students who are highly mobile--moving between multiple schools--like Simone, not her real name. Simone, a year 3 student, arrives at a local school to enrol. Simone is accompanied by her mother and brother. This will be the third school in the last three months. She attended her last school for three days and Simone’s mother explains that housing is difficult to find and she hopes her new rental home will last for a while. The Let’s Stay Put project is a great collaboration between Education Queensland and James Cook University’s School of Education in Townsville.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023434"></A>
The project has two objectives. Firstly, it helps students and their families make a positive adjustment when they have to change schools through the deployment of a resource, a mobility support teacher, an MST. The MST is a fully qualified teacher who completes the enrolment process for every student who arrives at the school, ensuring a smooth transition through accurate assessment of learning and support needs, particularly in numeracy and literacy. The MST also plays a critical role linking families to support services, particularly housing and family services. The second aim is to promote the importance of stable schooling, especially in the early years of schooling. MSTs work to support mobile students and their families in their transition in the new school; support the principals and deputy principals in the enrolment process; work collaboratively with classroom teachers to ensure a successful transition; work with external agencies to ensure enrolling students and their families are supported; and collect and collate relevant data.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023436"></A>
As I have said, these projects will cease operation at the end of this year. The funding has run out and those responsible for the program have been very creative in looking at ways to keep it going but so far to no avail. I do ask the Minister for Education to please give this some serious consideration and lobby the federal government at the ministerial council meetings for a continuation of what has turned out to be a collection of real data which should have serious implications for national data analysis. NAPLAN of course has its place, but with this significant cohort of mobile students it addresses the symptoms only and not the cause. The data is also skewed towards the census data collection--that is, like the day 8 numbers and so on. The real figures for this group are very different. The Let’s Stay Put project is evidence based action. Researchers from JCU have systematically collected data about every student who is enrolled or has left schools. This evidence shows the incredible extent of movement--movement that is not captured by the department’s current census collection methods. In these schools serving low socioeconomic communities, students can move back and forth between schools several times a year depending on family and housing circumstances. Sometimes they might stay a month at one school and other times a few days.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023441"></A>
Benchmarked against movement in schools in Britain and the US, the schools in Townsville have exceptional levels of mobility. The index used by JCU researchers, the Joiners Plus Leavers Index, shows that while internationally mobility of school students of over 35 per cent is considered exceptionally high, in Townsville for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students mobility can be as high as 95 per cent. This is an extraordinary level of movement that obviously has huge impacts on schools and classrooms. Half of the Queensland Indigenous population actually lives in north and Far North Queensland and schools like Heatley, Vincent and Currajong are now focus schools for improving Indigenous education outcomes. Innovative programs like Let’s Stay Put, which provides just 0.5 of an additional teacher at each school, are able to be catalysts for improvements in learning and closing the gap.</Hansard-Body>

Office for Women, Women’s Infolink</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs MENKENS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burdekin--LNP) (12.09 pm): A number of times I have raised in this House concerns about the minister’s administration of the department and the specific example of her Office for Women. Instead of being used as an effective advocate and a tool for change, the Office for Women is bogged down in bureaucracy literally. Ninety per cent of its budget is spent on staff and supplies. The minister can say anything she likes to try to defend this method of self-generating and self-supporting the administration. In fact, before the Estimates Committee F hearing this year she did make a number of statements that have little resemblance to reality.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023491"></A>
The Women’s Infolink service is part of the information strategy of the Office for Women--part of the 10 per cent of expenditure that is not devoted to running itself. The Mason report into the office said that the Women’s Infolink line was ‘probably the best known component of this strategy’. In fact, the Mason report described the information function of the Office for Women as being a core function. It also listed a number of calls in the month preceding the report on issues such as couples and family counselling, domestic violence services, emergency housing issues and health and general counselling. Between 2005 and 2010, 23 per cent of calls have related to family law, 22 per cent to women’s health and 20 per cent to violence, primarily domestic violence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023494"></A>
On 1 July this year the Office for Women’s freecall 1800 infolink service was deleted from the <Hansard-Italic>
White Pages</Hansard-Italic>
 online. It will be left out of the next <Hansard-Italic>
White Pages</Hansard-Italic>
 directory as well. There is no longer a direct freecall number. The 13QGOV number--the local-call-cost general government number--is the only available contact. The call is answered by a consultant, male or female, who transfers calls through to the appropriate offices or provides referrals of government services. This is a result of a conscious decision to close the Women’s Infolink line, saving the department about $30,000 a year through the discontinuation of the Smart Service Queensland contract for the Women’s Infolink service. The use of the Women’s Infolink line has dropped dramatically in recent years. There were 5,000 calls to the line last year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023497"></A>
Now for the disparity. In the estimates hearing, held on 21 July, I asked the minister a simple question: could she guarantee that the Women’s Infolink line was going to remain open as a separate entity? The minister gave a response of about 150 words, in which she stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1023499"></A>
We have Smart Service Queensland as the agency that delivers services on behalf of other agencies. So we all contribute funding to that. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1023500"></A>
In fact, the contract between the Office for Women and Smart Service Queensland was discontinued three weeks before this answer. The minister said--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1023502"></A>
Seventy-seven thousand requests for information referral or advice were responded to by the Women’s Infolink telephone service. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1023503"></A>
The actual number is just seven per cent of that number--just 5,000 calls. The minister said--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1023505"></A>
... people will access a number. It will say ‘Women’s Infolink’. In they go. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1023506"></A>
The <Hansard-Italic>
White Pages</Hansard-Italic>
 number was discontinued three weeks earlier, with all calls going through the general Queensland government service. The minister said--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1023508"></A>
Essentially, it is remaining open. It is open for business and it does a lot of business. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The main reason we are looking at closing the Women’s Infolink helpline is due to calls dropping by 75% since the service was transferred to SSQ--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

that is, Smart Service Queensland. It continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1023514"></A>
From the discussion I had with Mark earlier in the week I’m advised that from July all calls will go through the 13QGOV number and that we won’t be able to retain the Infolink 1800 177 577 number. If this is the case then we don’t have any option but to advertise with the 13QGOV number while we go through the process to seek approval to close Infolink. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

This email is dated seven weeks before the estimates committee hearing. After the estimates committee hearing the following briefing note was sent to the minister with the comment--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1023517"></A>
There are no issues in the Service Level Agreement with SSQ impeding the termination of the OFW--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

service delivery contract. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023521"></A>
That briefing note outlined the 75 per cent decrease in the number of calls to the Women’s Infolink line and described the ‘low public profile of the service with stakeholders and the general community’. It stated further that the Office for Women was advised of the decommissioning of the number and detailed the omission from the <Hansard-Italic>
White Pages</Hansard-Italic>
. It even stated that it was not known where I obtained my information for the estimates hearing. It was a thorough briefing note. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023523"></A>
So if the minister’s original answer was based on ignorance of the fact, there has been ample opportunity for her to correct the record. To date she has failed to do so. As a result, I will be writing to the Speaker to refer this matter to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023525"></A>
On a practical note, it is also of concern that the Smart Service Queensland service charter restricts the provision of referrals to government agencies only. When the subject matter of the calls to the Women’s Infolink are considered--domestic violence, family law and women’s health--the direction of these inquiries through the general government number has repercussions both for users of the service, who are seeking support and assistance, and for the non-government organisations that provide that support and assistance. </Hansard-Body>

Wild Rivers Legislation</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023529"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr O’BRIEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cook--ALP) (12.14 pm): How pathetic is Tony Abbott? After coming out after the election and saying that his first order of business would be to introduce legislation to stop Queensland’s Wild Rivers Act, he has subsequently stalled, backflipped and oozed away. But perhaps I am being disingenuous. Perhaps he is starting to listen not just to the broad range of people who live on Cape York Peninsula, many of whom support the legislation--people like Gina Castelain, David Claudie, Eddie Holroyd and Donnie De Busch--who are all traditional owners on Cape York and who all own businesses on Cape York Peninsula. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023535"></A>
Perhaps Tony Abbott has listened to his Liberal National colleagues who have on several occasions supported the passage of the wild rivers legislation through this House. I remember well when we first introduced this legislation to the House. It was debated and, whilst some National Party members, as they were in those days, mumbled some concerns, they did not take the opportunity to oppose the legislation. The Liberals were more supportive. In fact, the member for Moggill commented during the second reading debate of the original bill--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1023537"></A>
... let me say that the Liberal Party understands that in a state with rapid development and a great deal of environmental impact from development the goal of preserving our relatively untouched river systems is a worthy goal, and we support the intent of a bill to that effect. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023538"></A>
The legislation was amended and improved following its enactment as the government continued to consult with stakeholders. This process culminated in the introduction of the Cape York Peninsula Heritage Bill in 2007. This legislation amended the Wild Rivers Act and received the virtual unanimous support of this parliament, including the member for Callide, who said at the time--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1023541"></A>
But this legislation goes some way towards finding a balance through agreements reached by the government with representatives of the Cape York Land Council, Balkanu, the Wilderness Society, the Australian Conservation Foundation and AgForce. All of the parties to whom I have spoken are cautiously optimistic, saying that the agreement strikes the right balance. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1023542"></A>
The member for Callide went on to say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1023544"></A>
This bill makes a lot of concessions to the Indigenous people of the area. We welcome those changes. I acknowledge that the government has been able to come in here and acknowledge the fact that it got it wrong and that it is prepared to change it. That in itself should be acknowledged. The wild rivers legislation is being improved. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023545"></A>
Those are the words of the member for Callide. The member for Hinchinbrook said that the act ‘protects native title rights ... and asserts mandatory water allocations in each of the catchments once endangered by the wild rivers declaration. I support this act.’ The member for Burdekin said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1023548"></A>
More and more people are interested in visiting all of these unspoilt areas of the world where development has been kept to a minimum and of course the unique natural features have been preserved. The tourism industry could be said to be sustainable and it can also help enrich the economy without adversely affecting the land if it is correctly managed. Tourism would provide an opportunity for members of the local Indigenous communities because they have a wonderful natural affinity with the land and also have vast knowledge of the land. Tourism is a way that they can showcase their culture to visitors to the cape. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023549"></A>
Given the support that those opposite have given to this legislation, I am at a loss to understand the statement of the Queensland Leader of the Opposition calling for wild rivers laws to be scrapped. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023550"></A>
I am also confused about Noel Pearson’s approach to this issue. Noel has been an important partner with the state government in reforming a number of longstanding issues on Cape York, such as tenure resolution, alcohol management plans and now welfare reform. It is a huge agenda and I have backed him, even though those issues such as alcohol reforms have cost me large numbers of votes in Indigenous communities. The difficulty I have is that I was standing just near him on 7 June 2007 when we introduced the Cape York Heritage Bill into this parliament. That law reformed the original wild rivers legislation, including ensuring that native title rights remained unaffected and improving the process for development to be assessed in those areas. On that day Noel said that the legislation meant that land rights are going to be put behind us and that we can get on with the social agenda of development and welfare reform and social recovery. Soon after in the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 Noel wrote that the law represents the best opportunity to strike a balance between conservation and development for the future of this region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023552"></A>
I do not want to fight with Noel or the Cape York Land Council. The issues in Indigenous communities are too large and have been going on for too long for any of us to afford that luxury. Dying in a ditch over wild rivers diverts the government’s focus from welfare reform, alcohol reform and business opportunities opening up on Cape York as infrastructure improves and awareness of its uniqueness grows. We on this side of the House understand that environmental protection is synonymous with economic growth. We understand that things like World Heritage listing in places like Cairns and Port Douglas and the Douglas region in general have brought an enormous number of jobs and an enormous amount of wealth to that region. That is why we will continue to support the wild rivers legislation. </Hansard-Body>

Gladstone Region Social Infrastructure Strategic Plan; LNG Industry</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(12.19 pm): I rise to speak on the announcement of the LNG industry in my electorate. I welcome the Premier’s response to my question without notice this morning. I also acknowledge the positive meetings I have had so far with the health minister in relation to health services. Whilst several of his staff members have come up to the Gladstone area, I look forward to the report that should be out in the next week or so in relation to future planning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023592"></A>
On 16 September, in question on notice No. 1886 in relation to the draft summary of preliminary findings for the Gladstone Region Social Infrastructure Strategic Plan, I asked the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning about the finalisation of the plan, why the delay had occurred and whether the minister had made any changes to the findings. The minister answered that question. He talked about the cooperation between the Queensland government and the Gladstone Regional Council to carry out the study, that the social infrastructure strategic plan will be used to guide the direction of future industry investment in social facilities and went on to answer a number of questions. However, the minister did not respond in relation to changes to the document from its forwarding from the region down to his office. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023593"></A>
I would like to acknowledge, however, that at the bottom of that answer the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning commented on Mayor George Creed’s resignation and the fact that George had made a superb contribution to the region. I echo that. George is not enjoying good health at all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023594"></A>
The social infrastructure strategic plan has been touted as the blueprint for infrastructure for the region. I particularly valued the Premier’s comments this morning where she acknowledged that investment in infrastructure is not just the responsibility of the gas companies, it is the responsibility of government as well. The project overview of the SISP is to inform and guide future planning activities and investment decisions for strategic social infrastructure in the region. In the document that was forwarded to the minister titled, ‘The opportunities framework: Gladstone Region Social Infrastructure Strategic Plan’, if I go to the first item under the recommended opportunities framework it talks about health. It includes statements like ‘address the lack of public transport to access medical services in Rockhampton’, ‘consider a hospital shuttle bus’, ‘liaise with Queensland Rail’, ‘consider the potential for short-term provision of a small number of emergency acute inpatient mental health beds’ and ‘incorporation of an inpatient mental health unit in long-term strategic planning for Gladstone’--that is required immediately and long term--‘consider the level of emergency care available to meet the future needs of industry and potentially the availability of intensive care at Gladstone Hospital’. It goes on with approximately 15 or 16 recommendations on health and wellbeing, community health precincts, community health centres, general practitioners and allied health services. When we read through the document that was released, we find that it contains phrases such as ‘health and wellbeing’, ‘address the lack of public transport’, ‘provide support for staff development and funding of a children’s and families centre’, ‘fund innovative models’ and ‘consider the holistic health and wellbeing of the community’. It is significantly sanitised. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023595"></A>
I table a copy of the two documents that were forwarded to the minister’s office from the group who did the study--that is, the Gladstone Region Social Infrastructure Strategic Plan, the Social Infrastructure Strategic Plan for the Gladstone Region, Summary Report, and then the Social Infrastructure Strategic Plan that was released by the minister to the community. There are significant differences. There is a huge reduction in the identified infrastructure needs from the document that was forwarded to the minister’s office after the study and the document that came out of the minister’s office. It could be said that the reduction is identifying those things that can be contributed to by the Gladstone Foundation. If that is the case, I believe the report released by the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning does a disservice to all those who contributed to the original plan. There can be indicators in a report to show those items suitable to the Gladstone Foundation and those that government should fund. We need that infrastructure desperately. </Hansard-Body>

Ms DARLING</Hansard-Member-Electorate>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(12.24 pm): The Urban Land Development Authority was established as part of the Bligh Labor government’s commitment to affordable housing. But the authority has also been charged with developing liveable and environmentally sustainable neighbourhoods and I am pleased to report that it is excelling. On 18 September, Minister for Infrastructure and Planning Stirling Hinchliffe and I officially opened the Fitzgibbon Chase display village. We enjoyed a tour of the houses on display by Aushomes, AV Jennings and Ausbuild, all of which have a six-star energy rating. We also had a sneak peak at the new ‘Fonzie’ flats which have sold for under $200,000 and some of which should be occupied by the end of the year. The open day that was held on the same day was also a great opportunity for local residents to check out what has been happening on the site next door.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023599"></A>
Fitzgibbon Chase has parks and barbecues which are now operational for the use of all local residents. I took the opportunity to play the musical handrails on the bridge above one of the new parks. I would like to thank the artists, Barbara Penrose and Nameer Davis, for making the most of an Arts Queensland grant to bring music to the residents of Fitzgibbon Chase. This is a truly unique and delightful addition.The minister and I crossed two new footbridges to walk from the display village and information centre to the existing streets and houses of Fitzgibbon. Again, these new footbridges, provided with state funding, mean that Fitzgibbon residents in the older part of the suburb now have a direct walking or cycling path to Carseldine station. I would like to acknowledge and thank the many people who raised this issue with me and I am please that we have delivered. I am determined to ensure that this development provides lifestyle improvements for the entire neighbourhood, like connecting pathways, green space and recreational areas, not just for the new residents moving into the development. Many Fitzgibbon houses have been subject to flooding in the past, but flood mitigation works on the new site will benefit both new and existing homes while providing sustainable water use. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023600"></A>
It was very exciting last month to welcome the first new residents into their homes. I noticed many young people choosing to set up share houses, as well as families and singles. The mix of dwelling types at Fitzgibbon will encourage a mix of people to the area and I know that the development will provide opportunities and services, such as commercial and community spaces, for both employment and relaxation. Premier Anna Bligh has also made a decision that will bring further opportunities to the area and consolidate its future as an important northside hub.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023601"></A>
I welcome the announcement that the former QUT Carseldine campus will become a government office precinct. It is anticipated that around 1,000 Public Service workers will be based at Carseldine by the end of 2012 with the decentralisation initiative being a catalyst for the new Carseldine Urban Village. I am keen to see open spaces on the Carseldine side of the development, with sport and recreation areas for northside residents. I am also thrilled that this decision brings certainty to the child-care centre that was originally established to provide care to children of staff and students at the campus but is being used by many local families in my electorate as it is a beautiful centre with top-class staff. I am pleased that my lobbying to save the centre has paid off and I thank the parents in my electorate who raised this with me.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023602"></A>
The C&amp;K Carseldine Community Childcare Centre, as it is now known, has been through some uncertain times since QUT ceased using the campus and subsequently the student guild moved away from providing child-care services. I thank C&amp;K for coming to the rescue, but I know it has been a very unsettling time for staff and families. I know that workers in the government office precinct will appreciate the services at their doorstep such as child care, shops, trains and buses. The precinct, which is within the Fitzgibbon UDA, will also provide an opportunity for the many public servants living in my electorate to seek work closer to home.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023603"></A>
I look forward to discussing the practicalities of decentralising many Public Service offices with the unions and my local workers. I thank those constituents who have already started the conversation with me about sensible decentralisation that supports worker lifestyle and reduces the cost and environmental impact of commuting. The entire Fitzgibbon development is expected to inject $500 million into the Queensland economy with the delivery of 1,400 jobs over the life of the project, plus provide ongoing government, commercial and retail opportunities for thousands of workers once the development is complete. I congratulate Paul Eagles, Minister Stirling Hinchliffe and ULDA staff for their professional approach to planning such a liveable community on the north side of Brisbane. </Hansard-Body>

The Water and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 amends the South-East Queensland Water (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) Act 2009 and the Energy Ombudsman Act 2006 to further implement the second stage of the South-East Queensland water reform program and provide key additional customer protection provisions for residential and small business water customers. Following the commencement of the council owned distributor-retailers on 1 July 2010, the government is now implementing a strengthened package of transparency and regulatory protections for customers. Under these amendments customers will</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1027568"></A>
be informed about their distributor-retailer’s governance and accountability arrangements in respect of its participant councils; be notified of proposed and final water and wastewater prices and charges; be better informed about the contents of their water and wastewater bill, including identifying when it has been based upon an estimated meter read; and have access to an independent dispute resolution process provided by the Energy and Water Ombudsman Queensland in accordance with a Customer Water and Wastewater Code.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027570"></A>
A regulation-making power will also be introduced to allow the contents of a water and wastewater bill to be further defined. This is necessary in light of the somewhat dishonest and tricky campaigns that have been launched by some councils in South-East Queensland over the last number of months. Through confusing water bills, some councils have deliberately set out to blame the state for water charges levied by council owned water and sewerage businesses. Some councils have been deliberately hiding the simple facts that, on average, three-quarters of the average South-East Queensland water and sewerage bill is levied by council owned water businesses. Only a quarter of the average bill is a result of state government bulk water charges. This regulation- making power is designed to enable the development of a clear template to ensure residents receive straightforward and honest information. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027573"></A>
The Energy and Water Ombudsman is an expanded role for the current Energy Ombudsman. It will be industry funded and supported by an advisory council comprising industry and customer representatives. The introduction of the ombudsman is necessary in light of confusing messages from some councils and the current high number of complaints about service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027575"></A>
The Customer Water and Wastewater Code will be released for public consultation shortly. Public feedback will be incorporated into the final code, which will commence on 1 January 2011 in line with the Energy and Water Ombudsman. While the Energy and Water Ombudsman will have jurisdiction in South-East Queensland only at this stage, its powers could be expanded later across the state. This expansion might be necessary to protect consumers should some local governments continue to engage in misleading and confusing campaigns about water and sewerage services and prices.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027578"></A>
The bill also includes amendments to the Queensland Competition Authority Act 1997. These amendments will enable the Queensland Competition Authority to make binding and enforceable price determinations for the water and wastewater services provided by South-East Queensland’s three distributor-retailers water authorities: Allconnex Water, Queensland Urban Utilities and Unitywater. Based on a transparent and independent scrutiny of the costs of providing water and wastewater services, enforceable price determinations will allow the Queensland Competition Authority to regulate the prices these water authorities may charge consumers. This will provide increased consumer protection and will ensure that the prices consumers are charged are fair and efficient. Price determinations for these water authorities will be in place from 1 July 2013. </Hansard-Body>

Today I introduce into parliament an important bill to further deliver on the government’s blueprint for Queensland’s liquefied natural gas industry. The emergence of this new industry is significant for all Queenslanders. The government is committed to achieving a balance between the development of the coal seam gas industry for the benefit of all Queenslanders and the rights of landholders and environmental sustainability.</Hansard-Body>

Under the Water Act 2000 this bill puts in place a strong groundwater management regime to manage impacts on bore water supply and natural springs while the petroleum companies exercise their water rights under their tenure. This new regulatory regime replaces the current framework under the petroleum legislation. This bill provides that all petroleum companies, including CSG companies, have an obligation to make good impacts on bore water supplies and mitigate impacts on natural springs caused by their extraction of groundwater. Consistent with the government’s earlier announcement, trigger thresholds are specifically set in the bill to ensure impacts on water supplies linked to groundwater extraction are investigated and made good. The triggers are two metres in alluvial aquifers, such as the Condamine Alluvium, and five metres in consolidated aquifers, such as the Great Artesian Basin. Impacts or likely impacts on water supply bores caused by the extraction of underground water by petroleum tenure holders, resulting in reduced water quantity and any consequential impact on water quality, will be made good by the petroleum tenure holders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027588"></A>
A key first step for petroleum tenure holders will be the undertaking of assessments to collect baseline information on water supply bores and then, following bore assessments being conducted, make good agreements will be entered into with bore owners. An adaptive management regime underpins this new regulatory framework to allow progressive improvement in the understanding of impacts and also to support timely implementation of the make good arrangements for water supply bores. Petroleum companies will, every three years or earlier if required, produce underground water impact reports subject to public consultation. These reports will include a comprehensive water monitoring program, a projection of future likely water level impacts using progressively updated groundwater flow models and a spring impact management strategy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027624"></A>
Importantly, this groundwater management regime will manage the cumulative impacts of groundwater extraction. A cumulative management area will be established where impacts of tenure holders overlap. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027629"></A>
The bill expands the functions of the Queensland Water Commission to have responsibility for regional groundwater monitoring and flow modelling and the production of the underground water impact report for the cumulative management area. Through its underground water impact report, the QWC will also assign areas of responsibility to individual petroleum companies in relation to make-good obligations and monitoring activity. These expanded functions of the QWC will be funded by a levy on the petroleum industry. The bill provides for a dispute resolution process about make-good arrangements requiring mandatory mediation, which can be facilitated by the Department of Environment and Resource Management assisting with technical information, before bringing the matter before the Land Court.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027630"></A>
A key issue raised by landholders and conservation groups during consultation was the issue of impacts on the groundwater resource as a whole. Of particular concern was the need for the groundwater resource to be assessed and managed within the proposed Water Act framework. While it is recognised that impacts on the groundwater resource as a whole are currently managed under the Environmental Protection Act framework, the government will give further consideration to expanding the Water Act framework in the future to include an aquifer impact management strategy within the underground water impact reporting requirements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027631"></A>
Landholders have also raised the issue about what happens to make-good commitments if a gas company is insolvent. The Queensland government takes this issue seriously and has formed a project team that draws on key personnel across a number of government departments to work through these potential issues. The project will check to ensure that our current regulatory framework, with financial assurance under the Environmental Protection Act 1994, combined with the new provisions to the Water Act introduced in this bill, adequately addresses those concerns. Depending on the outcome of the project, the government will ensure any outstanding issues are addressed.</Hansard-Body>

This bill amends the Water Supply (Safety and Reliability) Act 2008 to provide purpose-built rigorous requirements for the supply of CSG water if it has a material impact on town drinking water supply sources. In such cases, CSG water will be regulated as recycled water. This is necessary to ensure the protection of public health and provide public assurance that public health is being protected. This may be by supply of CSG water into a watercourse or aquifer, or by directly supplying to a town as a source for drinking water supply. A recycled water management plan will be required, except where it can be demonstrated there is no material impact on the town’s drinking water supply or where certain requirements are met specific to aquifers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027634"></A>
CSG recycled water providers will be required to prove treatment process, and supporting management arrangements will consistently deliver water of the quality required. They will also be required to review their recycled water management plans, conduct internal audits, engage third-party auditors to audit compliance with their plan, make water quality information publicly available and provide annual reports.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027636"></A>
This bill also amends the Wild Rivers Act 2005 to extend the purpose of the act to preserve the existing natural values of the Lake Eyre Basin rivers. Those rivers have been subject to reasonable levels of development. However, they retain unique geographical and environmental values that are worth preserving. This amendment delivers on an election commitment to extend wild rivers protection to the Lake Eyre Basin. The bill amends the Vegetation Management Act 1999 to ensure category X and category C property maps of assessable vegetation or an area mapped as non-remnant on the regional ecosystem map or remnant map, in place prior to the area being included in a wild river declaration, will continue as an existing lawful right. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027638"></A>
This bill demonstrates that the government has again undertaken extensive consultation on wild rivers. We have made changes to reflect feedback from the communities of Lake Eyre Basin and Cape York, for example allowing for changes to property maps of assessable vegetation in high preservation areas and managing impacts of development on the channel country of the Lake Eyre Basin.</Hansard-Body>

In September the government introduced important amendments to the valuation system in Queensland. The Land Valuation Act 2010 introduced a range of reforms to the valuation system to bring Queensland into line with other jurisdictions and introduce a more simplified and easily understood statutory valuation process. An amendment to the act is now required to ensure the government policy intent in introducing valuation reform is met. When the act received assent, the ability to undertake a statutory value of the surface area of mining, geothermal, greenhouse gas and petroleum leases was removed and this has caused the unintended consequence of increasing the value of these leases. This was not the government intent, so we are amending the act to ensure the status quo remains for the valuation of these leases.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1027642"></A>
The bill also amends the Queensland Institute of Medical Research Act 1945 to make important changes to the governance arrangements for the Queensland Institute of Medical Research to help it operate more effectively and efficiently. The amendments are being progressed in this bill rather than in a Health portfolio bill to ensure that the new governance arrangements can be implemented as close as possible to when the recently appointed director of the QIMR takes office early next year. The amendments abolish the QIMR trust, which has fundraising and investment functions, and confers those functions on the QIMR Council, the QIMR’s governing body. Having a single statutory body under the act will enhance the strategic management of the QIMR and provide for greater administrative and resourcing efficiencies. In addition, changes are made to the council’s membership structure which provide for greater flexibility in its appointment to enhance the council’s ability to effectively perform its extended functions. The QIMR strongly supports these amendments. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

The Department of Environment and Resource Management, through the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, manages 417 state forests and 638 protected areas, covering nearly 12 million hectares across Queensland. With such a large and dispersed estate, there is the occasional need to revoke small areas from the state forest estate for legitimate purposes, for example to allow the upgrade or expansion of essential public infrastructure, including roads and railways. I will only support the revocation of land from our state forest estate for an alternative use if it can be clearly demonstrated that the proposed usage is in the broader public interest and there is no other practical alternative. The Department of Environment and Resource Management has given careful consideration to this proposal and appropriate consultation has occurred with affected stakeholders. Native title issues have also been considered in relation to this proposal and it has been determined that this action may proceed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027656"></A>
I will now outline the background of this proposal and the offsetting arrangements that have been agreed to compensate for the loss of estate. This proposal will revoke approximately 7.5 hectares of land from Sonoma State Forest, which is located about 12 kilometres north of Collinsville, and will allow for the construction of an additional rail line. This is a component of Queensland Rail’s northern missing link project, which will provide up to 50 million tonnes of additional capacity for coal transportation per annum. This will be achieved by connecting the existing rail network serving the Bowen Basin coalfields in Central Queensland to the rail line from Newlands and the Port of Abbot Point. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027661"></A>
The area known as Briaba Bank, within Sonoma State Forest, has been identified as one of the sites where rail infrastructure improvements are necessary. Several alternative routes were considered. However, with this proposal most of the additional track may be constructed within the existing rail and road corridors, with only a small area of state forest required to supplement the proposed rail corridor. Corridors for the existing rail and the Bowen Developmental Road pass through the north-west corner of the state forest and also along its western boundary. By realigning part of the rail infrastructure on the existing road reserve, the total area of land required to be revoked from the state forest has been kept to a minimum. It is anticipated that construction of the northern missing link and the stage 3 expansion of the Abbot Point Coal Terminal will significantly increase the capacity and flexibility of Central Queensland’s coal export infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027663"></A>
In keeping with successive governments’ policy that there be a net gain for conservation from revocations, compensation on a two-hectares-for-one basis for the proposed loss from the state forest estate has been negotiated with the Department of Transport and Main Roads. While the Department of Transport and Main Roads does not have any land available to be added to the Sonoma State Forest, in 2009 agreement was reached that a sizeable area of land with good conservation values adjoining Mount Stowe State Forest, near Gladstone, would be made available as a land bank for compensation for a related revocation and any future revocations, including this proposal. The loss of conservation values from the area proposed for revocation is not considered to be significant, as it is comprised of sparsely wooded forest, classified as ‘not of concern under the Vegetation Management Regulation. I commend the motion to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Callide--LNP) (12.49 pm): The opposition will be supporting the revocation involved in the motion moved by the minister. It is a sensible move to allow the progression of a vital piece of rail infrastructure. The northern missing link rail infrastructure has been overdue for some time. The motion before the House today will facilitate its long-awaited construction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027711"></A>
The minister has outlined the details of the revocation at some length, and I will not repeat those. However, I think the process that the minister went through could be seen as unnecessarily long and convoluted, especially in regard to the government’s offsets policy. Queensland has a large area of state forest and not all of that area has high conservation values. I note the minister’s comments about this particular area not having high conservation values being open woodland, and that is characteristic of a significant percentage of the area that was set aside as state forest land many, many years ago. I do not believe that it is necessary to consider every last piece of that state forest estate as being something that is inviolate and requires the types of offset that the government obviously adopts as a policy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027713"></A>
I believe it is appropriate for state land to be used for this sort of infrastructure when and if it is available and appropriate. The use of state land for building essentially state infrastructure should be seen as a right and proper purpose for that state land. While I take a view that those offset provisions to the extent to which the minister has outlined them may well be over the top, I have no problems at all with supporting the motion before the House to implement the revocation of this relatively small area of state land to allow what is a piece of infrastructure that the state badly needs to proceed. We will therefore support the motion before the House. </Hansard-Body>

 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (12.52 pm), in reply: I commence my summation by thanking the shadow minister for his support and therefore the support of the opposition. Without wanting to provoke a longer debate, I do note his reservations that he has just enunciated. That is an issue that clearly delineates this side of the House from the other. The fact that we do believe, no matter how small, that offsets are appropriate to add to a net increase in conservation in this state is something that we are proud of. It may be convoluted in some cases, but it is scientifically robust and does add to a net increase in the conservation estate of this state of Queensland. The fact that the member has, as is his right, outlined his concerns should be noted as a matter that does delineate, as I said, the views and beliefs of this Labor government against those enunciated by the LNP. Having noted that, and not wanting to be overly provocative at this stage, I once again do thank the member and the opposition for their support for this motion. </Hansard-Body>

 (Gregory--LNP) (12.53 pm): The Police Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 is a very important piece of legislation. This bill amends the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 to support the state-wide rollout of ticketing for public nuisance, public urination and associated offences, as the minister points out in the explanatory notes. The Police Legislation Amendment Bill was introduced into the parliament recently on 5 October. The bill has three main objectives, as I just said, to amend the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 to enable the state-wide rollout of ticketing for public nuisance and associated offences. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027728"></A>
As I was putting my tie on this morning, I was thinking about the police commemorative service that I went to recently. There was this little card in the order of service about a Constable Gregory Olive, who lost his life on 19 February 1962. He was fatally shot when he went to make inquiries regarding a neighbourhood dispute at a house in Kelvin Grove. When we think about this young officer, we think about the work that the police do in this state on a daily basis. That work is unprecedented. They put their lives on the line every day trying to create a safe environment for the likes of us, our families, our friends and the wider community of Queensland who want a safer and better state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027730"></A>
It is a sad situation when we need to bring this type of legislation into parliament. I think it is good legislation. The police will now be able to give these louts in public places--who want to be public nuisances, who want to deface and violate the objectives of what good common sense in society is all about--a ticket on the spot. This will keep them out of the courts, where the system is already overtaxed. Possibly we will see a turnaround in the behaviour of some of this loutish behaviour. Maybe we will see in time a situation where police are not subjected to violence, where they are respected in the community by the one per cent or thereabouts who do not have the same respect and regard as the other 99 per cent have. </Hansard-Body>

Public places cover a pretty big area. I think the general public of Queensland are sick and tired of this behaviour as a common occurrence right throughout Queensland. We do not just see it here in Brisbane. We do not just see it on the Gold Coast. We see it right across the state, unfortunately. I even see it from time to time in my own electorate, which most of the time is a pretty peaceful area. But it is marvellous what alcohol will do to some people. It changes their character. On top of that, some of these people are on drugs, and drugs and alcohol is a very volatile mix. Again, as I say, our police are the ones who have to be the analysts of the situation, the evaluators of the situation and, ultimately, the people who have to make that decision sometimes on the spur of the moment to protect the wider community and also to protect themselves in the execution of their duty. The CMC report states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027741"></A>
Section 6 states that offensive behaviour will include the use of offensive, obscene, indecent or abusive language and threatening behaviour includes the use of threatening language ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

A ‘public place’ is broadly defined to mean a place that is open to or used by the public, whether or not on payment of a fee. It clearly includes places such as shopping centres (see Schedule 2 of the Summary Offences Act). </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

In examining the issues surrounding public order and disorderly type offences, the CMC noted previous research when it wrote--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027746"></A>
Australian empirical research clearly indicates that public order incidents contribute to fear of crime. Peter Grabosky’s (1995, p. 3) review of Australian research shows that ‘incivilities’, including ‘the frequent presence of drunks, vagrants, or unruly gatherings of young males’, induce a fear of crime in some people as these seem to suggest that the location in question is ‘out of control’. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I were young blokes in communities once. I think we had a better respect and a better understanding of what our civil responsibilities were. It is unfortunate that this does not seem to be the case today. I think it has been fuelled by more young people out there. We have some fantastic young people in this state. One of my schools from Blackwater came through this morning. The kids were absolutely fantastic--their manners, their behaviour, the whole bit. This reflects that the good kids, the good young people of society, are being branded by the minority out there who want to be idiots, who want to cause concern, who want to violate what the good community wants and, ultimately, we now have this legislation before us. But I think the legislation is going to be an important factor in making certain that we do bring some credibility, some decency and some respect back into the public places that we all want to enjoy on a daily basis. </Hansard-Body>

Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As I mentioned before the lunch break, the introduction of a ticketing system for these types of offences was recommended in a CMC report on Queensland public nuisance offences which was released in May 2008. The CMC found that 60 per cent of summary offences dealt with in the Magistrates Court were offences of public nuisance and that 97 per cent of defendants either pleaded guilty or were found guilty after they failed to appear in court. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031519"></A>
There was a 12-month trail of on-the-spot ticketing for public nuisance offences in addition to existing powers to arrest or issue an offender with a notice to appear in court. Griffith University has been engaged to undertake an evaluation of the trial. The Griffith University report concludes that tickets are a cost-effective means of dealing with public nuisance offences. I urge the minister in his summing-up to make reference to the types of offences and the relevant fines and penalties. If it is going to act as a deterrent, I think the penalties have to be pretty stiff, especially when it comes to the abuse of police in the execution of their duties. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031521"></A>
Time and time again the opposition has been vocal in trying to put into this House a private member’s bill, as the Western Australian government has successfully done, relating to violence against police in the execution of their duties. I do not believe this is about playing politics. It is not about playing politics; it is about making our communities safer and better. When people go out--whether it be in the mall in Brisbane in the middle of the night or Toowoomba in the late evening or Cairns or any other regional centre--they want to be able to enjoy themselves and not be victimised by louts who want to make idiots of themselves and denigrate the values of these venues that we are talking about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031522"></A>
During the trial, 46 per cent of all persons ticketed had no previous criminal history and only one per cent of people who received tickets contested them before the courts. The report also found that the trial led to improved workload efficiencies for both the courts and the Police Service. </Hansard-Body>

Previous research, as noted by Dr Tamara Walsh of the University of Queensland, has found that laws aimed at regulating public spaces have a disproportionate impact on the lives of those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, as many social security recipients are. Homeless people by definition lack secure housing and thus they tend to occupy public spaces more frequently than the remainder of the population. Homeless people, particularly those who lack shelter altogether, are forced to live out their lives in public. They necessarily conduct certain behaviour, such as urinating, defecating, drinking alcohol and socialising, in public which the majority of the population prefer to conduct in the privacy of their homes or in the public amenities available. As a result, these people who are homeless are more visible to police, more likely to attract attention and more likely to behave offensively and, in turn, are more vulnerable to being considered a public nuisance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031525"></A>
It is this disproportionate focus which was a concern raised by civil liberties groups. Dr Walsh wrote that many vulnerable people are overrepresented amongst those prosecuted for acting offensively, even though their offensive behave may be reflective of their disadvantaged status. Instead of a law and order response, a therapeutic approach that addresses the underlying causes of defendants’ offending behaviour must be implemented. This very point has been clear and present in the Townsville area for some time and despite calls for mandatory rehabilitation for those homeless in the area suffering chronic drunkenness. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031526"></A>
Research out of New South Wales found that 74 per cent of public order incidents--that is, assaults, offensive behaviour and offensive language incidents--were alcohol related in that the perpetrators had consumed alcohol within a few hours before the offence. In addition, 60 per cent of all alcohol related street offences in this study occurred on or in the vicinity of licensed premises and 91 per cent occurred around the closing times of bars, from 10 pm to 2 am. </Hansard-Body>

I think it important that whilst we move to take many public nuisance offences out of the courts we need to ensure that those most at risk of committing such offences can be diverted where possible through proper rehabilitation and support programs. This is important when it comes to making certain that our streets are safe, that our communities are safe and that people can go about their business safely. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031528"></A>
We cannot tolerate and must not tolerate this behaviour. At the same time, our police must be given every opportunity and every support in making certain that these young people or older people or anybody who wants to thumb their nose at the law become the subject of the police executing their right to make our streets safe and a community that people can be proud to be a part of. </Hansard-Body>

Another provision of this legislation is to amend the Prostitution Act 1999 and the Prostitution Regulation 2000 to allow for automatic suspension and cancellation of a brothel licence or an approved managers certificate for nonpayment of annual fees. A licensee who has not paid that fee can have their licence suspended for 28 days. If the fee is still not paid their licence will be cancelled. This surprises me somewhat. I would like the minister to answer in his summing-up how many licensees fall into this category currently. This is an industry that certainly needs close scrutiny--not only scrutiny from police but also scrutiny from health authorities--to make certain that the women who work within this industry are given every opportunity to have the best health checks and the best protection available to them. As we know, there are many diseases out there. People who violate these licence regulations are certainly going to draw attention to themselves. This industry does attract many undesirable elements, especially that male element that want to visit these institutions to take advantage of what I believe are unfortunate women. </Hansard-Body>

At the end of the day, it is most important that people within the Prostitution Licensing Authority area feel secure and that those people who breach those rules are brought to justice, and I believe that the book has to be thrown at them. There are always many issues confronting any licensed premises, and there are similarities between the licensing of brothels and the Liquor Act in terms of the suspension of licences. The explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>

I ask the minister to elaborate on that. Does that mean that they are going to get time to pay outstanding fees?

The explanatory notes go on to state--</Hansard-Body-Continued>

Over many years--since time immemorial--prostitution has drawn the attention of the police to that element of society who want to break the law, and those same people are found to be culprits in many other areas of criminal activity. This is not an easy issue. It is all very well to stand in here and criticise, but the police are the people who do the surveillance. They are constantly out there monitoring this aspect of society, and I do not envy their job at all. The fact is that people who are licensed to operate these venues and the people who work within these venues certainly must be working within the confines of the law set down within this parliament.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031576"></A>
Clause 6 of this legislation enables the electronic evaluation of offenders’ records of criminal offences for police surveillance and screening reasons. Currently, section 10.2A allows the commissioner to disclose criminal records within the CrimTrac and other police systems. This will allow a more specialised observation of offenders on a national basis under this sophisticated technology. Whether these people are breaching the law in the street or whether they are breaching the law under the prostitution licensing act or whatever, the powers that we give our police to surveil these situations are absolutely paramount in making our state’s streets safer. However, at the same time we have to give our police every resource we can to ensure that we are observing this criminal element that violates the law and snubs their nose at authorities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031580"></A>
In recent days we have heard about the unfortunate situation of police activity on the Gold Coast and the attention that some police have drawn to themselves at Airlie Beach, but I will say this in defence of Queensland police: the greater majority of them--99.9 per cent of our police--are out there doing an exemplary job. They are people who are committed to the cause and dedicated to their professional duties, and we must respect the work that they do.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034830"></A>
Today I put it on the record that some of my constituents have made reference to me about some of our one-man stations around the state that have been the focus of closure. Regardless of where police are operating or what their responsibilities are, it is very important that we give the police the resources they need, whether they live in remote areas or coastal areas. Police presence is a deterrent in its own way without the police having to do anything. The public being able to observe the police is a deterrent to that element of society who wants to breach the law. This legislation will give police the power to execute their authority to ensure that those people are penalised or are subjected to a fine on the spot, and that is certainly going to make our community a safer place and keep these people out of the courts. That is going to enhance the opportunity of a better community for all and sundry. With that, I support this legislation. </Hansard-Body>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (2.45 pm): The Police Service has a long history of the successful transition of crime prevention to crime resolution that reflects the times. Our Queensland Police Service, QPS, has more than its daily work cut out for it managing an increasing deluge of paperwork and process when the community is calling on it to be far more visible. This bill is a sensible attempt to reduce the increasing paper chase for our police officers for offences that should not impede their ability to do that for which they are properly trained. Additionally, this bill enables the CrimTrac system to function as per its design and the PLA, the Prostitution Licensing Authority, to be able to proceed with its activities in the event of no shows by industry offenders.</Hansard-Body>

The critical piece of this legislation deals with public nuisance offences, which include being a public nuisance, urination in public and associated offences. These associated offences still seem to remain unclear on reading both the bill and the explanatory notes. This issue is a significant one. Public disorder has become a hallmark of Labor in government for nearly all of the 20 years of its governance. It is so because Labor underestimates offenders and overestimates its own ability to manage those offenders and the reasons that are associated with the offending behaviour. The evidence for this statement is merely to be found in the report card--that is, the number of offences of a nuisance nature annually responded to, the growth of those offences and the relative cost of those offences, inclusive of reception costs. There are 1,000 plus offences annually of this type, the growth is at least three per cent to four per cent and the cost is one to two hours of police down time. For each new offence that hourly cost is $200 directly and roughly $340 if one allows for having to replace that officer in the community when the other officer is doing the critical clerical work.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031592"></A>
The QPS ran a trial in 2009 using infringement notices for public nuisance, urination and other minimal offences. It followed a CMC report recommending this step. Griffith University has been engaged to undertake the evaluation of the trial and has done so with a result determining that the issuing of these tickets is a cost-effective means of dealing with public nuisance offences. The minister has stated that 46 per cent of those issued with tickets have no prior criminal history. For those living on the Gold Coast this law particularly has focused on ‘managing party people’--I quote the minister from his second reading speech--‘with a potential to prevent them from entering the criminal justice system’. I want to discuss everything from the offences, the definitions, tickets and what really is best to manage party people. But I am going to start with the last first because one needs to state the blindingly obvious. To manage party people one needs to remove the party people from the environment where their behaviour is so unacceptable, because, often under the influence of alcohol and drugs, those offenders will often continue to offend until they are removed. On the Gold Coast there are too many examples where offenders are not removed and they continue to cause havoc until they are removed. Issuing this group with tickets is naive. The police need to remove the offender, whether or not they issue them with tickets, and that will actually stop the offending behaviour. Certainly, this is the Gold Coast environment and I do not want to speak for all of the other parts of the state, but it is very similar across Australia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034979"></A>
It may be even that zero tolerance is not enough and the government, by refusing to use its powers under the Liquor Act, is compounding everything from public nuisance offences to more serious offences. Yesterday, the fair trading minister refused to accept interstate and overseas evidence that demonstrates that restricting the number of licensing outlets in a particular area reduces offending behaviour. His statements fly in the face of powerful evidence. Yet we have a flawed strategy of issuing tickets as a general response where far more specific action is called for. The minister jumped on the bandwagon and said that caps on the number of outlets that sell alcohol would be against national competition rules. In view of the serious nature of the offences, the difficulty in managing these types of behaviours, and evidence from Sydney and London that restricting the numbers of licences in designated areas does reduce crime and offending behaviours, has the minister ever considered the submission to the federal government and also to the Attorney-General with regard to reviewing that component of competition law that may well save lives? Ideology should not blind one to what is needed in the community. We have a problem with the issue of zero tolerance, because some people falsely equate it with a police state mentality. The issue of zero tolerance in certain situations will prevent serious injury and maybe even save lives. We need to change our attitudes to what will work in certain situations and appropriately deliver laws that suit those environments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034983"></A>
The issue of tickets is really very interesting. If one is to use traffic offences as any guide, many of these tickets--possibly nearly 80 per cent--are lost, destroyed or ignored. SPER, that Leviathan-like monster that lurks in the background, will have a major role in the consequences of issuing tickets. No doubt SPER will go on to cancel further licences and we will have the issue of further unlicensed drivers who committed offences, and others, driving around our streets. Presumably, these tickets will largely be for amounts of between $100 and $300, which is strangely about what some seem capable of spending on a very big night or a weekend. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034984"></A>
I am concerned that the implementation of the tickets has not included a consideration of including what is known as a positive ticketing program. That program, which was introduced originally in Vancouver in 2001, has since spread to more than 50 countries. I am greatly concerned that the program is being politely ignored by this state Labor government and that the QPS has, in fact, denigrated it. That disappoints me and many other people, particularly on the Gold Coast, where the CEO of the Gold Coast City Council, Dale Dickson, after a study tour has elegantly described the philosophy behind the program, how it operates and what are the outcomes. I put it to members that there are many ways to skin a cat--and for cat lovers I do apologise for that turn of phrase; it is rhetorical. By using tickets we can cover both ends of the behavioural equation--that is both good and bad--to obtain a positive result. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034986"></A>
I will get to the bad, but I cannot understand why a party that believes that its government is a committed reformist government would not merely suggest these positive ticketing programs when evidence from 53 countries that have used this approach shows that 93 per cent of offenders do not reoffend within the scheme. For those who are curious, I point out that the positive ticketing program initially targets disconnected and at-risk youth in the community. Its intention is to ensure that positive tickets would legitimately reinforce positive behaviour exhibited by youths by offering them something of value. Community partners in Vancouver are McDonald’s, which issues food coupons; the 7-Eleven group, which issues slurpee coupons, movie and entertainment passes; local councils, which give pool and ice rink passes; and theme parks. Local businesses donate. These tickets have on them the vital phone numbers for the Kids Help Line, drug information and health services. At the opposite end of the ticket equation, which is the punishment aspect, the issue of this punishment ticket can be seen in the same terms as tickets being issued when caught speeding by speed cameras. It raises concerns about easy revenue raising when members of the public have effectively very limited capacity to defend any claim that the police have made against them in these circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034989"></A>
The bill provides for the capacity of the members of the public to have their right to be heard in a Magistrates Court. With 60 per cent of people appearing in the Magistrates Court on the summary offence of being a public nuisance and 97 per cent of those people either pleading guilty or being found guilty, in sporting terms their chances are dismal at best and hopeless at worst. On most occasions the alleged offender’s word against that of the law is not upheld. It is a no contest. No doubt there are too many of these offences being dealt with in the Magistrates Court and even the swearing-in of judicial registrars and the delivering of no new money--read we need to have these offences removed from the courts. Is that the correct legal process? I say that it is not and that these actions appear to be reinforcing negative steps in that direction. </Hansard-Body>

Before government members start telling me that people who commit these offences of public nuisance and public urination should be fined and not dealt with by courts, let us look at some real examples. In my electorate of Gaven, we have bus drivers being given bus timetables by TransLink that date back to 1995 and earlier. Because of the tightness of the schedule, these poor drivers--male and female--have no time in the schedule in which to get to the toilet. A month ago, just outside my electorate boundary on the east-west bus route, which starts in my electorate, a bus driver had to go to the toilet. The council had locked the public toilet near one stop. It locks the toilets after seven o’clock at night because of vandalism. She was behind the bushes and was unfortunately interrupted by a group of people who did not realise the nature of the situation. They were offended by the public urination by this woman and the exposing of herself in public. After some considerable discussion by a variety of people involved, the police were not called.

 Unions have been involved. We have had extensive meetings over this. The situation is appalling. The lady involved is obviously blameless but, under this law, she is going to be guilty of public urination and should be fined and issued with a ticket. This is the issue that is raised by the Law Society and other members of the bar. When is public urination an offence? When is it inappropriate? I accept minors are exempt, but what of incontinent older men and women--in some cases not very old at all? I am sure most do not support a lot of those people urinating in all manner of places where it should not occur, but sometimes it is not their fault. There is nowhere else to go.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034994"></A>
This bill is somewhat glib in its politics in that it is just knee-jerk and sounds like a good idea, where, in practical terms, it may be just a bit ridiculous. For those who then go on to say, ‘If the person is aggrieved, they can just refuse to pay the fine and go to court to explain their circumstances,’ I ask: who says that a magistrate will believe, in an environment light years away from a very small bush in the backblocks of Surfers Paradise--where my unfortunate lady bus driver had to go--that they are telling the truth? Do members really think that these honest, hardworking individuals should have to be inconvenienced both in time and financially and be subjected to the humiliation of stating their case in court? I strongly disagree that they should have to do so, and so will most members of the public. Clearly, to any sensible person, one would have to embrace the sensible change to the Summary Offences Act 2005--</Hansard-Body>

Dr DOUGLAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The member should just listen to this. Alastair MacAdam suggests that the Summary Offences Act 2005 be redrafted to provide that the offence of urinating in a public place is not committed unless the urination occurs in an indiscreet and offensive manner or, in other words, the introduction of a ‘without reasonable excuse’ element to the offence. He then states that, as the provision is currently worded, a person who urinates in the following circumstances would commit an offence for which there would be no defence. He goes on to give the example of a man with a prostate problem and someone who was denied entry to licensed premises to access the toilets because of a lockout, the public toilets being locked, and lists all the circumstances in between. Alastair MacAdam remains very concerned about the offence of wilful exposure. So do I and so do Surfside bus drivers, because they cannot use the toilets easily on the Gold Coast, especially at night. Honourable members, for too many to be fined $200 for urination in a public place is grossly unfair and takes no account of the difficulties that many have in both accessing toilets and controlling their own physiology. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038269"></A>
I strongly believe it is discriminatory and I intend to write to both the minister and the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner on the issue of the discriminatory values of this offence. To then allow ‘SPER monster’ to try to take these people’s drivers licences if they refuse to pay the fine and then try to defend the fine in court after debating what is going on I think manifestly compounds the discrimination. I believe it renders the amendment unjust and impractical. We must never condone the passage of legislation that is unfairly weighted against those who are least able to defend themselves, that being everyone from the elderly to the poor, the homeless and, in some cases, pregnant women. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038276"></A>
By initially ignoring the balance of the use of tickets, a lopsided result eventuates. It is therefore inconsistent law. You might ask what happened here. I can only guess someone thought, ‘Gee, this is really a good idea. It is all just so simple.’ But life is somewhat different. Critically, there was no key stakeholder consultation beyond government agencies. The broader stakeholders the Police Union, which the government seems routinely to want to vilify, and the Law Society were excluded. It is no wonder they have a dismissive view of this bill. I think the comments of Michael Cope from the Queensland Council of Civil Liberties really say it all. He said--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038280"></A>
He referred to the powers being a concern when it comes to offensive language and that it would see public nuisance offence rates soar. I have to say that it increasingly looks like a cash grab under the pretence of a management step for public order. Since the government agencies are not an independent umpire on the fairness of these new changes if the key stakeholders were excluded, and they subsequently commented negatively on the legislation anyway, I suspect it is dead legislation and deservedly is headed for the scrap heap. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1038281"></A>
The two other key aspects of this bill relate to changes enabling the electronic assessment of criminal history records for employment screening purposes. This completes the link to CrimTrac’s National Police Checking Service support system. Sensibly, it protects the confidentiality of the information of an individual by restricting access by third parties. It may be that this is too restrictive and one might not have considered that a valid third party should be considered for access on the basis of security clearance in the national interest. </Hansard-Body>

The change to the Prostitution Act 1999, and by default the Prostitution Licensing Authority, will primarily enable the PLA to deal with non-compliant operators who choose to not pay annual fees--there has been a variety of reasons raised; some seemed to have misunderstood that they were up annually rather than for three years--not turn up for hearings and refuse to comply. These changes have been dealt with today by the shadow minister. I do not intend to go much further than this. The compulsory powers regarding the behaviour of witnesses are interesting. The minister concludes with the statement--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038283"></A>
No offence is committed where the answering of the question or production of the documents or information would self-incriminate. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038284"></A>
In the twilight world of prostitution nearly everything that operators do might be deemed to be incriminating, so one might conclude from this that all witnesses might well claim the Australian equivalent of the US fifth amendment--that is, section 10 of the Queensland Evidence Act 1977. So could the changes be nearly as effective as the public urination offence? If this bill might be considered as a whole, I believe the answer is yes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038285"></A>
In conclusion, this is a relatively simple piece of legislation that has been drafted in such a manner that a critical part of it is both unjust and impractical. I have referred to it as a potential piece of dead legislation even before it begins. Parts 2 and 3 of the legislation are probably going to survive for reasons of practicality. Certainly parts of step 3 might not. This seems to juxtapose two opposing views of a being, presented here as a bill. Interestingly, the Shakespearean play <Hansard-Italic>
Hamlet </Hansard-Italic>
is often seen as the true father of existentialism that is the forerunner of humanist theory that forms a core philosophical basis of Labor policy. In <Hansard-Italic>
Hamlet, </Hansard-Italic>
the Prince of Denmark is very similar to the Premier--not one to broker disagreement when challenged and pining for love from anyone who would listen in a one-sided statement of position. The immortal line ‘To be, or not to be: that is the question’ could easily have been replaced here by the same base motives that Hamlet wanted to understand--that is, ‘To pee, or not to pee: that is the question’. Well, honourable members, unless we change the Summary Offences Act 2005 as well, all the advice to the punters must be, ‘Hang on, even if you are busting.’ </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.03 pm): I rise today to contribute to the Police Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. As outlined in the explanatory notes, the objectives of the bill are to amend the current legislation of the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000, the Police Service Administration Act 1990 and the Prostitution Act 1999 and Prostitution Regulation 2000. The changes to the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 are designed to support the state-wide rollout of ticketing for public nuisance, public urination and associated offences brought about by recommendations of a report by the Crime and Misconduct Commission released in May 2008 titled <Hansard-Italic>
Queensland’s public nuisance offences</Hansard-Italic>
. The CMC found that 60 per cent of summary offences dealt with in the Magistrates Court were offences of public nuisance and that, of these, 97 per cent of defendants either pleaded guilty or were found guilty after they failed to appear in court. Following the recommendations from the CMC report, cabinet approved a 12-month trial of on-the-spot ticketing for public nuisance offences in addition to the existing powers to arrest or issue an offender with a notice to appear in court.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038288"></A>
Evaluation of this trial has been undertaken by Griffith University, and their report concluded that tickets are a cost-effective means of dealing with public nuisance. During the trial period Griffith University also established that, of all the persons given tickets for nuisance offences, 46 per cent had no previous criminal history and that only one per cent actually contested their tickets before the courts. Public nuisance offences are quite common on the Gold Coast, particularly when there is an influx of visitors from outside the area. Schoolies and the V8 Supercars are two events where this issue appears to be more prevalent. However, the nightclub strip in Surfers Paradise is also a common location where police are forced to deal with public nuisance offences.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038289"></A>
In fact, one does not have to go very far on any given night to see unruly behaviour in some of our local shopping and entertainment areas. That is why we have police beats at places like Robina Town Centre in my electorate. Whilst these reforms are welcomed and will potentially free up our hardworking police officers from dealing with these offences in a summarily efficacious manner, our police still need more resources to deal with this and other types of crimes on the Gold Coast. Public disorder has become a hallmark of Labor governments over the past 10 years and the Queensland courts previously have been overloaded with public nuisance type offences. Police have to contend with almost 1,000 of these offences every day of the year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038290"></A>
Residents of the Mudgeeraba electorate are well used to not having enough police resources to deal with these offences, and more often than not they do not even bother to report crimes as the so-called 24-hour police stations that we have in Mudgeeraba, Robina and Nerang close up shop from 4.30 pm to 8.30 am daily. Whilst we do have cars deployed in this area, residents hang up when they are patched through to Broadbeach and fail to record complaints, which in turn is used by the government often to hide behind the crime statistics for particular areas such as Mudgeeraba. As the government and the minister know full well, for every crime reported there are probably four hang-ups in frustration that are not recorded. It is these figures that the government uses to determine resourcing of our local areas with police and it is this government that has stretched the thin blue line increasingly more thin.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042034"></A>
Our residents have been demanding an increase in local police and a 24-hour police station that is counter-manned. Last year in this House a petition with over 2,500 signatures for more police and increased counter services in Mudgeeraba and Nerang was tabled in parliament by the shadow minister for police, Vaughan Johnson MP, on behalf of me as the principal petitioner. That petition was not about taking another uniformed officer off the beat so that they can actually issue tickets such as these; it is more about more police for our area and about the public perception that no-one is home at these stations after 4 pm because no-one answers the phone. Residents would be far more likely to report criminal activity if they knew they were contacting their own station. Law and order is a huge issue in the Mudgeeraba electorate, which is evidenced by the number of signatures that were collected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042042"></A>
On the eve of the 2006 state election, this Labor government also promised us a new police station in Reedy Creek, which was quickly claimed by the former member in the dying days of the election campaign. Not only is this police station not in the electorate of Mudgeeraba, but this station will be policing half of he Gold Coast including Burleigh Heads, Varsity Lakes, Robina and Reedy Creek on the eastern and western sides of the M1. The state ratio of police per resident is 1 to 434 and on the Gold Coast it is about 1 per 628. In the electorate of Mudgeeraba, with 28,000 residents and currently 24 police shared between Nerang and Mudgeeraba station, the ratio is more like 1 per 1,166. The minister did confirm our suspicions in the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Sun</Hansard-Italic>
 back in May 2009 that the 24-officer station will be staffed by 14 officers, who will be relocated from Palm Beach, Broadbeach and Mudgeeraba stations of which one will come from Mudgeeraba. </Hansard-Body>

Unlike the Labor Party, the LNP has a ‘tough on crime attitude’. Labor is soft on crime. It has been soft on hooning and soft on graffiti. It has failed to stand up for the residents and police in providing a safer community for Mudgeeraba. Whilst the Liberal National Party will not be opposing this legislation, at least our overworked police officers will be able to issue on-the-spot fines instead of spending hours back at the station doing paperwork and preparing for court appearances when they, like the public, would prefer to be out on the beat protecting citizens and property as they were trained to do. </Hansard-Body>

Mr KILBURN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Chatsworth--ALP) (3.10 pm): On 23 May 2008 a report by the Crime and Misconduct Commission titled <Hansard-Italic>
Policing public order: A review of the public nuisance offence </Hansard-Italic>
was tabled in parliament. The CMC report identified ticketing as a viable option for dealing with public nuisance behaviour. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038345"></A>
In a direct response to the recommendations contained in the CMC report, the Bligh government initiated a 12-month trial, undertaken by the Queensland Police Service during 2009. The trial enabled the issuing of infringement notices for public nuisance, public urination and associated offences where persons obstructed or disobeyed a direction of a police officer in relation to the public nuisance or public urination offence. The trial was conducted in the Townsville and the South Brisbane police districts. This year the Griffith University evaluated the trial and its report concluded that infringement notices are, in fact, a cost effective means of dealing with public nuisance offences. It enables police to spend more time attending to operational duties and responding to the needs of the community rather than attending to paperwork and the preparation of court documents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038348"></A>
I was fortunate to see this firsthand when, as a member of the Law, Justice and Safety Committee, I travelled to a number of places around Queensland and observed the work of police during the night. Townsville was one of the places we went and we spoke to the local police about the difference in being able to issue an on-the-spot infringement notice compared to the lengthy time that would be taken away from operational duties if they had to return to the police station to deal with minor infringements. We saw this in action firsthand. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038349"></A>
The evaluation found that 46 per cent of all persons ticketed during the trial had no previous criminal history. Public nuisance ticketing has the potential to divert persons away from entering the criminal justice system unnecessarily and reduces the necessity for those persons to be arrested and taken into police custody for relatively minor offences. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038350"></A>
On 15 June 2010 the Premier announced that police statewide would be given the power to issue on-the-spot fines for public nuisance, public urination and associated offences. The ability for police statewide to issue these notices is in addition to the current actions available to police. It is important to note that this measure will not replace current practices; this is just giving police another option. I think the police are quite capable of working out which is the most useful or appropriate action. Other actions they have available to them include cautions, diversions, move-on directions, the issue of notices to appear and arrest. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038351"></A>
The member for Gaven suggested that people need to be removed from an area to ensure safety. I am sure that in certain circumstances that is true. In fact, I witnessed that myself. However, after travelling around the state with the committee, I have quite a bit of faith that members of the QPS are well able to identify what is the most appropriate action to take. If QPS members feel that the most appropriate action is for the person to be removed, I am sure that is what they will do and they will not use the ticketing option. It is simply an option that they have. They will make the decision as to which option to use. It is always best that operational people make those operational decisions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038352"></A>
Currently, section 394 of the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 restricts the issuing of a ticket and the subsequent release of a person by a police officer receiving custody of a person arrested for public nuisance or associated offences to the prescribed areas of Townsville and South Brisbane. In support of the state-wide rollout of ticketing for public nuisance offences, this bill will amend section 394 of the PPRA to remove the provision which limits the issuing of tickets by watch-house police officers on behalf of the arresting officers to the prescribed area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1184725"></A>
I also note the speech made by the member for Gaven about the bus driver who was forced to go behind a bush. I also have faith that the QPS is well able to identify the difference between a bus driver who happens to be caught out and who is hiding behind a bush and someone trying to write their name on a shopfront at 2 o’clock in the morning in the main street of Townsville. I am confident that they will use their discretion in that circumstance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1184726"></A>
I will now talk about the prostitution amendments and the non-payment of annual fees. Prior to August 2007, brothel licences and approved manager certificates were valid for only one year. Following legislative amendments, licences and certificates are now valid for a period of three years. Although a licence or certificate is valid for three years, the annual licence fee and the annual licence return fee or an annual certificate fee and annual return fee are payable. Some licensees and approved managers have taken the position that, because they have a three-year licence or certificate, they should not be required to pay their annual fee. In the absence of disciplinary action by the Prostitution Licensing Authority to suspend the licence or certificate, a person may hold a valid licence or certificate without the payment of the relevant annual fees. In 2009-10 the PLA took disciplinary action in respect to three licensees and six approved managers for failing to lodge their annual returns and their associated annual fees. The taking of disciplinary action by the PLA is ill suited to the non-payment of annual fees by licensees. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038362"></A>
This bill amends the Prostitution Act and the Prostitution Regulation to provide for the automatic suspension and cancellation of a licensee’s licence or approved manager’s certificate following the non-payment of annual fees. Where the annual fees are not paid by the anniversary date and the licensee or approved manager has not entered into a payment plan with the PLA, the amendments will enable an automatic 28-day suspension of brothel licence or approved manager’s certificate, the lifting of a suspension where all outstanding annual fees are paid during the suspension period, the lifting of a suspension where in exceptional circumstances a licensee or manager enters into a payment plan for the payment of the annual fee, and automatic cancellation of the licensee’s licence or the approved manager’s certificate if the annual fees are not paid within the suspension period or in accordance with the payment plan. This model is similar to that found in section 36L of the Liquor Regulation 2002 where non-payment of the licence fee results in the licensee having the licence suspended for 28 days and cancelled if the licence fee is not paid within the suspension period. In providing the PLA with a discretionary power to allow a licensee or manager to enter into a payment plan with the PLA in exceptional circumstances such as a natural disaster or where the brothel is damaged by fire, the bill provides the PLA with sufficient flexibility to address situations where it could be considered unjust to suspend the licence or certificate in the circumstances. The entering into a payment plan by the licensee or manager will be at the sole discretion of the PLA. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038365"></A>
These amendments are considered effective, appropriate and the most efficient way to deal with the non-payment of annual fees. I commend the minister for the bill. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr DICKSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Buderim--LNP) (3.18 pm): I rise to the speak to the Police Legislation Amendment Bill. I rise to speak in respect of these proposed amendments in the hope that they will go some way in assisting the poor, beleaguered police officers of Queensland to do their job with greater ease and efficiency. I also want to speak briefly regarding the prostitution industry in Queensland. There is a clear message here for the current state Labor government. During the last decade or so public disorder across Queensland on Labor’s watch has reached epidemic proportions. Police have to contend with almost 1,000 public nuisance offences every day of the year and Queensland courts are overloaded with public nuisance offences. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038405"></A>
The Crime and Misconduct Commission has found that 60 per cent of summary offences dealt with in the Queensland Magistrates Court are offences of public nuisance. Of those, 97 per cent of defendants either pleaded guilty or were found guilty after they had failed to appear in court. Surely there has to be a better alternative than having all these non-felonious matters clog up the Magistrates Court. Following the 12-month trial on the issuing of on-the-spot fine infringement notices for public nuisance offences, the Griffith University evaluation trial concluded that on-the-spot fine infringement notices are a cost-effective means of dealing with public nuisance offences. Forty-six per cent of all persons who received an on-the-spot infringement notice had no previous criminal history and only one per cent of the fines contested before the court. The Griffith University evaluation has also found that the trial led to improved workload efficiencies for both the courts and the Police Service. On the face of it, the introduction of on-the-spot infringement notices for public nuisance offences seems a logical solution to having Queensland police tied up and our courts overflowing with the prosecution of those types of matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038410"></A>
The bill also proposes to amend the Prostitution Act 1999 and the Prostitution Regulation 2000. The explanatory notes state that the amendments--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1038412"></A>
• 	allow for the automatic suspension and cancellation of a brothel licence or an approved manager’s certificate for non payment of annual fees; </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1038413"></A>
• 	provide the Prostitution Licensing Authority (PLA) with a prescribed scheme for undertaking disciplinary inquiries; and </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1038414"></A>
• 	provide for probity checking of persons seeking to be or who are appointed as a member or executive director of the PLA, or employment as a staff member of the PLA. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038415"></A>
While I know that this Labor government is broke, I believe there are more important things to be concerned about regarding the prostitution industry in Queensland than the non-payment of fees to the government, fee payment plans and associated punitive measures for punishing those who are late in paying those fees. In regard to probity checking for Prostitution Licensing Authority appointments and employment, the bill’s explanatory notes states, ‘These amendments will support the safety and security of clients and sex workers...’. The bill acknowledges the need to ensure the safety and security of sex workers and their clients. With that in mind, recently I was advised by people within the Queensland prostitution industry of some disturbing information regarding potential health risks to sex workers and their clients.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038417"></A>
Last year, the Department of Health and Ageing within the federal government undertook to provide the funding to reprint a guide, in the form of a handbook, as a reference for sex workers across Australia. The handbook discusses the spectre of and gives advice about the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases within the prostitution industry. The book has been printed in four different languages. It is the sort of thing that we, as a proactive government, should be promoting. I am advised that the handbook is available to sex workers right across Australia, but not in Queensland. My advice to the minister is to seriously take this on board, because it gives us an opportunity to do a bit of good. I ask that the state government, through the Prostitution Licensing Authority, conduct an urgent review of this situation with a view to ensuring that the handbook is made available to all sex workers within Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038418"></A>
Again I refer to the assertion in the explanatory notes to the bill in relation to the safety and security of sex workers and their clients in Queensland. I have been advised that there is a degree of uncertainty within the industry as to where workers should report criminal activities and potential risks. They are apprehensive as to whether to contact police or the PLA on the basis that they may want to divulge confidential information to an appropriate officer. That information could involve criminal activity, illegal prostitution operations, organised crime, immigration, health matters and instances of potential corruption. In this regard, I ask for the establishment of a number of dedicated liaison officers who can work as a first point of contact for sex workers. Those officers could come from within the PLA or the intelligence area of the Queensland Police Service. Initially, the officers could liaise with the industry across the Gold Coast, the north and south metropolitan areas of Brisbane and also the Sunshine Coast as a trial. It is said that prostitution is the oldest profession and, like it or not, it is here to stay. Real people work in the industry and real people are industry clients. They need appropriate support from this government. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr BLEIJIE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kawana--LNP) (3.24 pm): This afternoon I rise to contribute to the Police Legislation Amendment Bill currently before the House. The bill amends the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000, the Police Service Administration Act 1990 and the Prostitution Act 1999. I concur with the sentiments and statements expressed by the shadow minister, the member for Gregory, in his speech this afternoon. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038423"></A>
One element of the legislative amendment before the House relates to the policy of dealing with nuisance offences. Under Labor--and everyone in the House would agree with me--Queensland police have become bogged down having to deal with public nuisance offences, which takes valuable time away from more prominent cases and, effectively, clogs up our court systems. Between 2005 and 2008, public nuisance offences increased by almost 40 per cent. As the former minister for police, in 2008 the member for Sunnybank stated that police data shows that alcohol is the single highest causal factor for public nuisance offences and is involved in three-quarters of all cases. As I have stated in this place on many occasions, clearly the state Labor government of the past 12 years has totally lost control of our streets, particularly at night when alcohol is reported as the main cause of public nuisance. The rapid increase in the rate of public nuisance offences since the offence was created in 2003 is an indictment on Labor’s softly-softly approach to the general justice system of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038424"></A>
For every crime there needs to be a penalty that is an adequate deterrent for one not to commit the crime in the first instance. I believe that an on-the-spot fine for someone who is causing a public nuisance sends a stronger message than simply issuing a ticket with a court date some weeks down the track. If someone is being a public nuisance, the police will have the discretion of issuing on-the-spot fines, which should put a dampener on a big night out on the town. Every resident in Queensland should able to go out in the evening, or at any time of the day, and enjoy our great lifestyle with moderation, respect for others and respect for property. The trial that the government initiated last year in South Brisbane and Townsville provided for on-the-spot fines between $100 and $150 to be allocated to those committing acts of public nuisance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038425"></A>
A Crime and Misconduct Commission report, released in May 2008, recommended a major overhaul of public nuisance policing. The CMC report noted that the average fine that was issued by a Magistrates Court for a public nuisance offence was $100. The issuing of on-the-spot tickets should significantly decrease the caseload in our court system. However, we are yet to see what the impact will be of this new system on the problem of nonpayers. The CMC report also indicated that 60 per cent of the summary offences dealt with by the Magistrates Court were public nuisance offenders and that 97 per cent of those defendants pleaded guilty or were found guilty after they had to appear in court. The Griffith University was commissioned to provide a report on the 12-month trial period for on-the-spot fines for public nuisances. The Griffith report indicated that such tickets were a cost-effective means of dealing with public nuisance offences and led to improved workload efficiencies for the current court system and the Police Service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038426"></A>
Interestingly, consultation for this amendment was limited only to government agencies and it appears that no consultation was undertaken with broader stakeholder organisations such as the Law Society. However, I note that this morning in parliament a letter from a barrister from the Queensland University of Technology was tabled with one of the reports. I have great respect for the work that is undertaken by the men and women who serve as Queensland police officers and I dispute the claims made by the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties President, Michael Cope, who said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038430"></A>
This will become the thing police just slap on someone whenever they aren’t happy. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1038431"></A>
He further stated--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038433"></A>
No one will fight them and ultimately people who are homeless or young will bear the brunt of this. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1038434"></A>
On many occasions in this place in relation to issues of justice in Queensland I have said that I am sick and tired of people, including the civil liberty champions, using youth and other factors as an excuse to get away with certain deplorable acts that, as a society, we should not accept. People do have rights and people do have choices, but with those rights and choices comes responsibility. I say to all these loopy, leftie civil libertarian campaigners--and generally they are mostly those opposite--that you cannot contract out of your responsibilities in society. </Hansard-Body-Continued>

The Law, Justice and Safety Committee toured the state during its alcohol related violence inquiry. We toured the nightclubs at three in the morning. We toured the streets, as those members of the committee have indicated in this place before, and what we saw was appalling. </Hansard-Body>

Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection. I point out to the member for Brisbane Central, as she crossfires walking across the chamber, that it was the Law, Justice and Safety Committee that was charged by this parliament with conducting the alcohol related violence inquiry and, as part of that inquiry, we did tour the state and we did go out at 2 am, 3 am, 4 am and 5 am in places such as Rockhampton, Townsville, Cairns, the Sunshine Coast, the Brisbane CBD and Surfers Paradise. What we saw on the streets, as I said before, was absolutely appalling. Who are the ones who have to put up with all of this? It is the Queensland Police Service predominantly and the volunteers that we have on our streets. As I said, the loopy lefty civil libertarians would not have a clue what happens on our streets at that time of the morning. </Hansard-Body>

Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 They can issue press releases. They can say all they want. They can say that these people have all of these rights. What I would point out is that it comes back to personal responsibility. I do not accept the view taken by many opposite in this House that, because people are young and because of other varying factors, that gives them some form of excuse for getting away with what they are doing at that time of the morning. Ultimately, the amount of alcohol or drugs that one consumes is a choice for that individual. If that individual then goes down a path of what we see as becoming a public nuisance, then they should bear the responsibility. Throughout the last five minutes there have been many interjections from those opposite, particularly the member for Everton. I take those interjections. I note he will probably jump to his feet in a minute. I take the interjections as a sign that he of course does agree that because they are drunk or on drugs they have an excuse to get away with what they are doing. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I withdraw. I say to all of those civil libertarians--and they have certainly come out of the closet in the last 10 minutes--that they should go out at that time of the morning and see what is really happening on the streets because, for once in their life, they might stand up and fight for the rights and liberties of our fine policemen and policewomen who have to put up with this garbage happening that as a society we should be standing against. They put up with it every single day and night. I give more credit to the Queensland Police Service, who will no doubt recognise the appropriate discretionary obligations that they will have under these new arrangements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042321"></A>
The bill before the House also amends the Police Service Administration Act 1999 to enable the electronic assessment of criminal history records for employment screening purposes. The use of the electronic records provided to CrimTrac under the National Police Reference System will create a more efficient system of employment screening when seeking information on criminal history. There are still appropriate mechanisms in place to protect the release of information to a third party which could only be undertaken with the written consent of the person. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042324"></A>
The other objective of the bill before the House deals with the regulatory provisions with respect to brothel licence obligations. The amendment to the Prostitution Act 1999 allows for the automatic 28-day suspension of a licence or an approved manager’s certificate on the nonpayment of their annual fees. Relevant provisions are made with respect to fee payment plans and any outstanding fees between the party or individual involved and the Prostitution Licensing Authority. The bill also includes amendments which provide relevant disciplinary proceedings undertaken by the Prostitution Licensing Authority. These measures are draconian but necessary to maintain a properly regulated industry that is conducted in an appropriate manner. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1042327"></A>
I will conclude by thanking the fine officers of the Caloundra, Kawana Waters and Sippy Downs police stations and the Kawana Waters Police Beat at Kawana Shoppingworld which conduct the majority of police work that is undertaken in the Kawana electorate. The men and women of these stations are a testament to the Queensland Police Service. I wish to place on the public record the outstanding way in which they conduct themselves in the Kawana community. With that, I once again endorse the comments made by the shadow minister in his speech on the second reading. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr DOWLING </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Redlands--LNP) (3.35 pm): Today I rise to speak to the Police Legislation Amendment Bill 2010, which seeks to amend three bills--the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000, the Police Service Administration Act 1990, the Prostitution Act 1990 and Prostitution Regulation 2000. This regulation should provide police with yet another tool in their arsenal when it comes to preserving good order in our community. I think those comments have been echoed on both sides of the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042341"></A>
On-the-spot fines for certain offences--public nuisance, public urination and associated offences--can only be seen as a positive thing. While no-one condones those offences, this new strategy has the ability to save time for our officers, and I think that is vital. That is certainly the overriding reason why I am standing here. The officers will no longer need to leave their active duty or their front-line activities to process relatively minor offences. I can see that there will be significant time savings certainly for two of my communities that have only one police officer--they are the communities of Macleay Island and Russell Island, both of which are due to receive an extra officer for each island. The community has been very vocal. They have raised safety concerns for a long time on those southern Moreton Bay islands. They are greatly relieved that two officers will be posted there--one to each of the islands. </Hansard-Body>

Thousands of people could be slapped with fines for offences that would never have attracted police attention in the past under sweeping reforms to police powers. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042348"></A>
I am pleased to say that the public commentary seems to be coming down on the side that this is a good idea, that this is a positive initiative, not only because of time saving but because police realise that their time is valuable and they cannot be running off arresting people for these relatively minor offences, but they are still important issues to be addressed. </Hansard-Body>

During the trial period, 1,800 people were fined for urinating and being drunk and disorderly in public places in the two trial areas of Townsville and South Brisbane, but 1,200 have ignored the tickets. No doubt they will be caught up in the fullness of time. My concern is with the SPER process. I am on the record many times saying that I have great concerns that people could lose their licences and things of that order and not actually be aware of it happening through the SPER process. I have never been a fan of that process. </Hansard-Body>

The comments in the blogs are quite interesting. I will share with the House some of the blogs that were posted on the article, as recorded by Anna Caldwell. They state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1042352"></A>
Since swearing and verbal abuse are not part of free speech, these powers are appropriate. As long as our right to free speech and orderly dissent is not undermined, this is a good policy. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Then we get the flip side of the argument which is about the nanny state or the nanna state. The blogs include: ‘Why does everyone want to live in the nanna state? I’m leaving here.’ and ‘Every year it is another law against life.’ I am editing these because some of the comments are colourful, to say the least. There was an interesting comment that I read from one submitter. They stated, ‘I hope Kevin’--and by Kevin they are referring to the former Prime Minister--‘does not come home to visit.’ As we know, Kevin has something of a reputation for a colourful turn of phrase. </Hansard-Body>

The community expectation is that we should not have to suffer this obscenity every time we venture out in public--whether we are walking down the street or are in a shop, at the beach, at a concert or at schools et cetera. It is unacceptable. It seems to me that over the last many years we have gradually allowed our standards to be watered down. This is definitely a step in the right direction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049492"></A>
Some of the language used every day by people in public places is offensive. I am thinking now of the obscenities that children hear when walking down the street or when they are at a cinema or in a shopping centre. This type of thing is a step in the right direction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049493"></A>
Family values and a more harmonious community can come out of this if that law is exercised. Some of the comments posted on the blog were along the lines: ‘It’s got to be a step in the right direction.’, ‘Bringing them into line.’, ‘It’s a great thing as long as it is enforced.’ Those kinds of comments are being echoed through the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049495"></A>
It is time efficient and it appears to be a cost-effective use of resources. There are three groups of thinking on this. There is the nanny state group, the revenue raiser group--which was a predictable line of comment--and the ‘at last the government is doing something’ group. </Hansard-Body>

I can only echo the sentiments made by the shadow minister, the member for Gregory, and other members of the House on both sides in commending the police for the great work they do in very difficult circumstances. Over this last weekend a number of officers were working down at the Armor All Gold Coast 600. It was a perfect venue where these strategies could have been utilised. There were a significant number of arrests. There were incidents around the track and around the precinct. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DOWLING:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection. They made up part of the press recording of the Armor All Gold Coast 600. What I was going to say was that the police who were on site were doing a fantastic job. That was the point I was making, Minister. The police were a strong presence and they were enjoying the atmosphere of the crowd. It was a well managed event and a well managed crowd. I certainly enjoyed it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049500"></A>
That is the sort of event where we need to be vigilant. We need to ensure that we do not allow society to degrade any further. I again echo the comments of those members of the House who support the fine work of our police officers. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr SHINE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (3.43 pm): It is my pleasure to say a few words with respect to the Police Legislation Amendment Bill. I will address my remarks to probity checking with respect to the prostitution section of the bill. The current situation with respect to permissible criminal history disclosures does not reflect the integrity benchmarks required for appointment as members of the PLA, the Prostitution Licensing Authority, or to undertake the duties of the executive director or staff members of the PLA. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049507"></A>
The PLA employs seven full-time staff members. Because the office is so small each officer assists in all areas of the PLA’s work from time to time and, therefore, has access to sensitive information including policing information on licensees and approved managers, financial details of brothels and meets with sex workers and members of the licensed sex industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049509"></A>
The bill amends the PA to allow the minister to obtain and take into consideration a person’s full criminal history in determining their suitability and integrity to be appointed as a member of the PLA or to be appointed to the role of executive director. The bill amends the PA to enable the executive director of the PLA to obtain a person’s full criminal history in determining their suitability for employment as a staff member of the PLA. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049513"></A>
The full criminal history information includes spent convictions, juvenile criminal history, pending charges and non-conviction charges, including acquittals and withdrawn charges, and is despite any other act which may restrict the disclosure of the criminal history information. Honourable members would be aware that on a number of occasions I have expressed concerns about some types of criminal history information being disseminated, particularly as it relates to spent convictions and mere charges and where charges have been withdrawn. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049514"></A>
However, in the field of prostitution and areas where we have seen, through the revelations in the Fitzgerald inquiry, that the old vice squads and licensing squads were full up with corruption, I think it is an area where it is very important that people working in a public office in this area are beyond all doubt in terms of their integrity and their backgrounds. I believe that in this area it provides an exception to the general principle that I have subscribed to in any usual event. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049515"></A>
These amendments will support the safety and security of clients and sex workers, ensure confidentiality of sensitive information and maintain public and client confidence in the integrity of the PLA. Importantly, the bill will reflect the principles of natural justice in circumstances where there is an intention to make an adverse decision in relation to the appointment or employment of a person as a result of the consideration of the full criminal history information. In such circumstances, the criminal history information is to be disclosed to the person and the person is to be provided with a reasonable opportunity to be heard and their response to be considered before finalising the decision as to the person’s appointment or employment. Furthermore, the Public Service officer will be able to appeal an adverse decision under chapter 7, part 1, division 1 of the PSA. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049517"></A>
Additionally, the amendments only permit the criminal history checking of a person seeking employment or appointment with the PLA with their written consent. Furthermore, the amendments provide for the destruction of their criminal history records when they are no longer required and ensure confidentiality of criminal history reports by creating offences for the unauthorised disclosure of the information. I believe these provisions protect the rights of people seeking employment in that area, bearing in mind my earlier comments. However, it is always important that we be vigilant against any insidious trend towards the erosion of basic civil rights. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049519"></A>
I place on the record my views with respect to public nuisance ticketing. I support the measures contained in the bill. They are consequential upon the CMC investigation into this matter some time ago. They will lead to efficiency from the police point of view and less embarrassing situations for members of the public who are caught in the types of situations described by previous speakers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049522"></A>
In terms of the amendments with respect to CrimTrac and the National Police Checking Service Support System, again I say that I have historically had reservations about the conveyance of information concerning a person’s criminal history depending on what that information might be. However, I am reassured that the amendments do not expand the nature of criminal history information which is ultimately released to a third party for employment screening purposes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053284"></A>
Finally, I want to place on record my appreciation for the sterling services provided to the state of Queensland by recently retired Assistant Commissioner Col McCallum of Toowoomba. He has provided a lifetime of service to the public of Queensland and the Police Service. He has had an outstanding career and is a highly regarded person now living in retirement in Toowoomba. He and his family will continue to be assets for our city. I also want to mention another Toowoomba resident in Tony Wright, who has just been promoted to the position of assistant commissioner. He again is a most promising police officer and highly respected by those within the force and the community generally. I wish him well in the important duties that he is undertaking for the benefit of the people of Queensland into the future. </Hansard-Body>

Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Caloundra--LNP) (3.50 pm:) I rise to make a short contribution to the Police Legislation Amendment Bill before the House today and in relation to the issue of public order notifications. In particular, I refer to chapter 3 of the CMC publication in 2008 that dealt with the issue of public order issues and why they are important, and I will quote from that document in some detail. I recommend the document and that chapter in particular to members of the House when considering public order issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049568"></A>
It was in 1982 that James Q Wilson and George Kelling published an article titled ‘Broken windows: the police and neighbourhood safety’. The authors claimed that public disorder offences sent a signal that there was a lack of control in an area which then resulted in greater crime. Page 16 of the publication by the CMC then quotes in some detail an article by Katz, Webb and Schaefer in 2001. I will read that into <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
 because it highlights what Wilson and Kelling were trying to put across. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1049575"></A>
Visible disorder, if left uncontrolled, heightens citizens’ fear of crime and leads them to fear that a neighbourhood is unsafe. After citizens begin to feel unsafe, they withdraw from the community, both physically and psychologically, by reducing their public presence and severing social ties with other residents ... After residents withdraw ... informal social control mechanisms break down. Residents are no longer present to supervise youths or others in the community who are prone to mischief and misbehaviour, and no longer feel a mutual responsibility to react to such behaviour ... As a consequence, more serious forms of disorder begin to materialise; eventually these lead to an increase in serious crime ... Intervention, according to the hypothesis, must occur at the first sign of disorder to prevent the neighbourhood from spiralling deeper into decline.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049576"></A>
It is said that that particular theory is what pushed the then mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, and his police chief to campaign on what was called ‘reclaiming the streets’ and it was that that they claimed led to such success. However, whether the success of this approach is real has also been the subject of much debate. Issues such as social, economic and demographic changes and changes in policing may also have an impact and make a contribution. In fact, the report of the CMC quotes a study by Sampson and Raudenbush which found--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1049581"></A>
The relationship between public disorder and crime is spurious except perhaps for robbery.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1049582"></A>
The jury is still out on who is right--the initial authors or the authors who contest to the contrary--but what cannot be denied, and again referring to the document, is this quote--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1049583"></A>
... fear of crime is very much higher in those Australian neighbourhoods where it is common for unruly young people to congregate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049584"></A>
I do not think anybody in this House disputes the correlation between fear of crime and the perception of crime. They go hand in hand. Whether one is right or one is wrong is not for this House to debate today. However, the proposal in the bill is aimed at a quick resolution of a problem that has either perceptively or in actual fact plagued our streets for some considerable period of time and also assists in the reduction of police time in dealing with matters that may be called at the much lower end of the criminal scale. It also would relate to a reduction in court time in that courts would not need to deal with these matters in the numbers they are at this point in time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049585"></A>
As we know, the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court has been enlarging in the recent past. The fact that the court has to deal with these matters places a greater onus on magistrates to act efficiently and equitably, and the issue of notices in these circumstances would provide to the courts a greater capacity to deal with what may be considered much more serious criminal matters. The ultimate test on whether or not this particular bill with regard to notices is successful will be whether or not there is a downward spiral in this type of offence, and I would assume that the minister will also in due course be publishing data which establishes whether or not that success can be gauged upon the number of tickets or notices issued over a period of four to five years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049587"></A>
I also join with the member for Toowoomba North in giving accolades to police in general for the great work that they do and in particular the work they do in the area of Caloundra. The police in Caloundra do a wonderful service. I was in contact with the acting superintendent not long ago, when the local council determined to pool those who are employed by the council to assist on Friday and weekend nights in relation to law and order issues by council officers. The police have now put in train what they call a Caloundra Support Unit, and that support unit is a group of five police officers who will deal on the weekends with issues that have in fact arisen in the past. In fact, I have been told that this unit will deal with issues involving public order. That is a great initiative because, as we know, tourist destinations, particularly in the Christmas period, are prone to face a greater number of public order issues. If police are seen on the beat and are seen taking care of those matters in such numbers, it is a great deterrent. In that regard I certainly give accolades to the police, and I ask the minister to pass on my congratulations to them for the work they do in keeping Caloundra safe. This of course is one initiative--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Mr Reeves:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 We often see the police around at Christmas time in Caloundra.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049592"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection by the minister. He is quite correct: the police do a phenomenal job in Caloundra and indeed right across the state. It is hopeful that the initiative contained within the bill will also alleviate the need for police to undertake onerous tasks in relation to paperwork and also assist the court by giving it time to spend on much more serious matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049594"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (3.56 pm): I rise to contribute to the debate on the Police Legislation Amendment Bill. It appears that the government may be starting to get the picture. Under its watch, public disorder and public nuisance have increasingly consumed the time and efforts of not only our tireless police officers but also our court system. Therefore, a ticketing approach to public nuisance associated offences is a step in the right direction. The rationale underlying the provision of on-the-spot fines as an alternative method of dealing with relatively minor offences committed predominantly in the course of non-criminal behaviour is a sound one.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049596"></A>
This bill will allow police to allocate their resources and, most importantly, their time to more pertinent and onerous matters. Exposing those who commit these offences to the criminal justice system is unnecessary and unjustified both on economic grounds and on the grounds that those who have early exposure to the criminal justice system have a greater propensity to engage in other criminal activity, especially if they are part of a vulnerable demographic. Here the bill seeks to initiate a more proportionate response to this degree of offending. In relation to the amendments to the Police Service Administration Act 1999, the new use of CrimTrac will undoubtedly make the screening process more efficient by doing away with physical handling. I note that the bill also amends the Prostitution Act particularly with respect to the disciplinary processes within the Prostitution Licensing Authority.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049600"></A>
Before I conclude this short contribution I want to reiterate comments made by members on both sides of the House confirming the fantastic work that police officers do throughout our state and certainly echo that for the electorate of Glass House. However, I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister for Police to fast-track the upgrade of the Maleny Police Station. He would be well aware that I have asked a question on notice on this matter and eagerly await his reply to that. As he also would be aware after having recently visited Maleny, the residents of Maleny were very successful in their call to have the number of officers servicing that great community increased. Where once we had two, we now have four. I and the community are extremely grateful for that, but we are concerned about the substandard accommodation. At present it is a couple of modified Queenslanders that barely catered for the two officers that we had there in the past and which are far from suitable for the increased police presence that we now have. I would ask the minister for police to reconsider the priority rating for any upgrade to the Maleny Police Station on these grounds and to bring forward the construction of a new facility within the community as a matter of some urgency.  </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr KNUTH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Dalrymple--LNP) (3.59 pm): The hallmark of 12 years of this Labor government is a court system that is overburdened, police officers who are overworked and a justice system that is overly lenient on criminals who commit serious crime. I welcome any move to free up the courts by introducing ticketing for public nuisance offences. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053506"></A>
A Griffith University trial of the ticketing system found that 46 per cent of public nuisance offenders were first-time offenders and that people who had no criminal history and who happened to have a bad night out were overloading our court system. This legislation will unburden our congested court system from having to process the almost 1,000 public nuisance offences a day that officers across this state have to deal with. However, this legislation does not address the greater need for legislation that will protect those officers who will be responsible for enforcing the ticket system from members of the public who show a complete disrespect for those who enforce the rule of law in this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053507"></A>
Our police officers are already overworked and are now being investigated for minor infractions. Yet this government continues to reject the need for greater protection for our officers through mandatory minimum sentencing to deter serious assaults on our police. The introduction of the ticketing system for public nuisance offences will improve the workload efficiencies of the courts and the Police Service. The deficiency in this legislation is that police officers will now be required to issue on-the-spot fines without the protection of mandatory minimum sentencing, deterring those who may respond in a violent manner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053508"></A>
It is vital that this government starts to acknowledge that it is not only the paperwork and the court time that is putting pressure on police officers but also the unnecessarily high risk of violent assault that they face in the course of their work. These men and women do an incredible job in protecting the public. They work long hours and are often unable to take holidays because of the recruitment crisis that is faced by the profession. That recruitment crisis can be attributed to the witch-hunt that we see daily in our media and the excessive risk of violent assault that this government has decided should be all in a day’s work for our police officers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053509"></A>
The need for more police is vitally important in townships like Moranbah, which is experiencing a massive expansion owing to the growth of the mining industry in that area. I say to the minister for police that Moranbah needs more police and better accommodation to attract police to go there. A lot of crime is not reported in that area because people believe that it is a waste of time reporting it as there are not enough police on the job there. We need to do something about the police numbers in that mining town. I bring this matter to the attention of the minister right now and I will put it in writing as well. I wanted to bring those issues to the attention of the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms STONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Springwood--ALP) (4.02 pm): It is very clear that there is growing frustration and concern in the community about nuisance behaviour in our public places. That nuisance behaviour can be anything from foul language to urinating in public, unruly and rowdy behaviour, or behaviour that can be perceived as aggressive or intimidating. It has been well documented in research from around the world that this type of behaviour in a public place leads to a fear and a belief that a place is not safe. While that perception may be exaggerated in the minds of people, it still sends people a message of fear and of not being safe in their community. In turn, that fear affects people’s lifestyle, their quality of life and, for some, their health. There is no doubt that there is a point at which people expect police officers to step in and control that behaviour in a non-confronting way and to have some form of penalty to use if necessary. There is also a point at which the community believes that the line has been overstepped and that an arrest is the appropriate response. I believe that this bill meets community expectations and will allow police resources to be used more effectively. It gives discretion to police to make sure that an arrest is made if necessary, or, in this case, a ticket can be issued if the police believe that this is also the appropriate response. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053512"></A>
Before the trial in 2009, I was approached by a security provider with concerns about the growing trend of urinating in public. He was also concerned about the use of police resources to respond to this offence. He worked in the Valley and believed that this type of behaviour was becoming notably more prevalent, especially during the late evenings and early mornings in and around nightclubs. One of the most disturbing stories he told me was about the actions of some people who urinated from balconies on people passing by and on security officers standing below. This security provider informed me that many security officers, club managers, staff and other business owners in the area were not calling the police to assist because they realised that it would tie up two police officers, with all the work that was needed to do something about this. They knew the police would need to arrest the offender, take them to the watch-house and complete all the other work that was necessarily in relation to the offence. They were concerned that these officers would be tied up dealing with this type of behaviour when they could be attending to other matters of a more concerning nature. In other words, nothing was being done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053513"></A>
This security provider and his colleagues are certainly in favour of the issuing of infringement notices and believe that those infringement notices will send a clear message to people that no longer will this behaviour be tolerated and that there will be a consequence in the form of a response to their actions. I have to say that I agree with him. When I have been out and about in some of the state’s late-hour closing entertainment precincts, it was very noticeable that no longer were people trying to find the dark laneway or a large tree where they could relieve themselves; they had no shame in urinating in public and just wherever they were would do. To be fair, I would also like to point out that many of the late-night entertainment trading areas did not have public toilets available for people to use. That is certainly a problem and that is why the Law, Justice and Safety Committee recommended that in drawing up management plans for entertainment precincts councils look at providing appropriate public amenities for the area. That is why that discretion is needed when dealing with public nuisance behaviour. I am pleased that the police will have the discretion by which to work out the best form of policing needed in the circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053514"></A>
I know that the trials were held in Townsville and South Brisbane. I have to say that the member for Chatsworth and I witnessed quite a number of public nuisance offences in Townsville and spoke to the police on duty that night about them. They were certainly able to tell us their views about public nuisance ticketing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053515"></A>
One of the issues that has been brought up time and time again by certain people is a concern about vulnerable social groups and the ticketing process. Whilst the Griffith University evaluation of public nuisance ticketing highlighted that Indigenous people were up to 14 times more likely to be dealt with for public nuisance offences, the overrepresentation of Indigenous people did not increase with the issuing of tickets. The Queensland Police Service is engaged in a number of programs that are aimed at addressing the underlying causes of offending behaviour. The potential impact on disadvantaged groups is recognised and significant effort is being undertaken to engage with support agencies. I have to say that that was very noticeable to us in Townsville. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053516"></A>
In implementing the state-wide rollout of public nuisance ticketing, the Queensland Police Service will focus on the use of existing policies to mitigate any unintended negative impacts on vulnerable people, including the referral of people to available support agencies and the de-escalation of police action in appropriate circumstances. When issuing an infringement notice, police officers will be required to provide an information sheet that will include details of relevant support agencies and services. That will provide an opportunity for disadvantaged people to obtain support, including seeking legal advice. Furthermore, the state-wide rollout of public nuisance ticketing will be subject to ongoing evaluation through a themed operational performance review on public order offending. The review will seek involvement by relevant government and community agencies. Additionally, the State Penalties Enforcement Registry has existing policies to mitigate the unintended impacts on vulnerable persons. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053518"></A>
This new system will free up the court system by removing thousands of public nuisance offences each year. It will also mean that police will spend less time on court work and will be able to devote more time to policing work in the community. Inappropriate behaviour in public places is simply not acceptable and the rollout of public nuisance ticketing state-wide will mean that no matter where you are in Queensland, if you are caught doing the wrong thing you can receive an on-the-spot fine. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053519"></A>
I want to thank the officers of the Queensland Police Service for their hard work and commitment to keeping our streets safe. The police in Logan City work very hard, and I particularly thank the officers in Slacks Creek and the Loganholme divisions. Unlike the member for Mudgeeraba, who believes that the officers in her electorate pack up at 4.30 pm, I know that the officers of the Slacks Creek and Loganholme 24-hour police stations in my area do no such thing. In fact, they are out in their cars doing what we ask them to do. They are out patrolling our streets, keeping us safe and responding to call-outs. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind) (4.08 pm): I rise to speak to the Police Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The explanatory notes to this bill state that the bill has three main objectives: to amend the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act to support the state-wide rollout of ticketing for public nuisance, public urination and associated offences; to amend the Police Service Administration Act to enable the Queensland Police Service to use the full criminal information provided to CrimTrac under the National Police Reference System for the assessment of the suitability of records, including the revival of spent convictions for employment screening purposes; and to amend the Prostitution Act 1999 and the Prostitution Regulation 2000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

There is a strong belief in Queensland that the laws relating to public nuisance offences are weak. Offenders end up with being issued with on-the-spot fines that are being ignored. According to a <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 article titled ‘Just a nuisance’ by Daniel Knowles, on-the-spot fines are not worth the paper they are written on, with two-thirds of the people who have been slapped with tickets for public nuisance ignoring them. The article states that a ticketing trial in Townsville and South Brisbane resulted in police issuing fines to approximately 1,800 people for urinating in public or being drunk and disorderly in public, but around 1,200 people ignored the tickets. However, despite that seemingly ineffective trial, the article notes that an internal police report says that police officers are keen to see the rollout of those extra powers just in time for schoolies week next month. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057333"></A>
I support the police officers in this regard and will be voting to pass this legislation. However, I do have a few reservations that I would like to speak about today. One of those reservations relates to the Queensland Council of Civil Liberties. The council is critical of the laws and was adamant that it gives police too much power. It fears that fines of between $100 to $300 for swearing in public will be a major money spinner for the state and could become the weapon of choice for frustrated officers on the beat. In light of recent events, any legislation that sees an increase in public service power makes me reflect and think deeply about giving too much power to public service officers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057336"></A>
Speaking to this legislation has given me the opportunity to reflect on a book written by Geoffrey Robertson, <Hansard-Italic>
The Statute of Liberty, </Hansard-Italic>
in which the author makes a case for establishing an Australia-wide charter of civil rights, which may be a way of ensuring that individuals can better protect their rights from bureaucrats, whether it be police officers or other government officers, who overstep their good bounds and abuse their powers. I am thinking about the statute of Queensland liberties. I think that is a debate that would be welcomed by many members of this chamber--those in government, on the crossbenches and in the opposition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057337"></A>
One of the groups of people that will be affected by this legislation is Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Unfortunately, the Indigenous community is overrepresented in our prisons for many offences. Many Indigenous people have gone and will go to court because of offences under the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act related to public nuisance, public urination and associated offences. The Indigenous community in Bundaberg has raised concerns over their lack of support from local police in Bundaberg and the Burnett. Their principal concern is not so much police officers themselves but the matter of resourcing and the situation that the underresourcing of police officers has brought about in their community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057338"></A>
Currently there is only one police liaison officer in the Bundaberg district. There is one position vacant at the moment. Respected community elder Auntie Lester states that this police liaison officer has in the past committed herself to the Indigenous community and assisted numerous members with issues that require police intervention. She has established a very positive rapport within the community. However, the community is not being able to access her at the times when this is most necessary. The police liaison officer is now forced to work day shifts, between the hours of 8 am and 4 pm or 9 am and 5 pm and only on weekdays. As members can imagine, issues that involve our Indigenous youth in offences that are described in the Police Legislation Amendment Bill occur mostly in the evenings and mostly over the weekend period. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057339"></A>
Auntie Lester makes the point that for the police liaison officer to work weekends she has to justify why she is required to work these weekend shifts. The police liaison officers were often seen walking the streets of an evening and in the past have assisted not only the Indigenous community but also the Police Service with investigations. Auntie Lester goes on to explain the importance of having police liaison officers working late and weekend shifts and notes that police liaison officers throughout the state work late shifts on regular occasions, particularly in volatile areas such as the Brisbane CBD and Fortitude Valley. She also commends the work by police liaison officers in Cairns, Rockhampton and Townsville. As we have heard, there have been a number of trials conducted in both Townsville and South Brisbane in relation to this legislation. She says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1057340"></A>
In order to resolve the many and varied issues currently present in the Bundaberg area, we suggest that an appropriate person be appointed to the Cross Cultural role, someone who is genuine in their endeavours to assist the community. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1057341"></A>
Auntie Lester further notes that Queensland police should undertake further cultural awareness training. She says--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1057342"></A>
Currently in Bundaberg there is no interaction occurring between the PLO and the community. We are constantly informed at our community meetings from the Superintendent/Inspector that the lack of funding which is apparently associated with the reason why PLOs are unable to work during the evening/weekend periods, when most youth who do come to police attention regular, are out and about. If we have been wrongly informed and the funds have been given for PLOs then where has it been utilised?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057343"></A>
The community is beginning to contact the elders requesting them to attend to incidents involving our youth at various times of the evening. This places the elders in a position where they could be assaulted and one that they should not be forced into. This is a sign that the community’s needs are not being met by the police and they are not comfortable to seek police assistance. This is a very serious issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057344"></A>
Auntie Lester and her fellow Indigenous community members are fed up with not receiving the proper support that they require to address youth issues. They make the impassioned plea for an allocation of more police liaison officers for the Bundaberg police district. I have spoken to Auntie Lester on many occasions. She says that they would prefer four police liaison officers because those officers have to deal with not only the Bundaberg CBD but also the Bundaberg police district that goes out to Eidsvold, Monto and the like. We especially need more police liaison officers around the western areas of the Bundaberg-Burnett region. If we had more police liaison officers then I believe there would be fewer offences and less need to implement the powers that the Police Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 gives our officers. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.17 pm): It gives me a great deal of pleasure to rise to participate in the debate on the Police Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. I do not intend to repeat what other members have said to date, but I note that this bill is simply, in my view, about trying to improve the efficiency of police operations in Queensland. I certainly support that 120 per cent. I note in particular that in his second reading speech the minister referred to amendments to section 10.2A of the Police Service Administration Act 1999. He stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1057347"></A>
The bill enables the Queensland Police Service to use the full criminal history information of a person, which is currently electronically provided to CrimTrac under the National Police Reference System, to assess the suitability of records for release, including the revival of spent convictions for criminal history employment screening purposes under CrimTrac’s National Police Checking Service Support System. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057348"></A>
I support that 120 per cent. What that is simply saying is that we can work more efficiently in the provision of this information and, more importantly, that our police minister and the Queensland Police Service are working in partnership with other police services around our great nation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057377"></A>
That leads me to the next issue. I ask the minister when he next meets with his interstate colleagues to try to see how we can also extend this efficiency drive, this more economical method of policing in Queensland. It is my view that if other police services in Australia are able to deliver their service more economically and containing similar checks and balances to those that we require in Queensland, maybe we need to follow their lead. In particular, I draw the minister’s attention to his recent answer to question on notice No. 1888 in which I asked about the issuing of telecommunication interception warrants. Unfortunately, it seems to me that in Queensland a massive bureaucracy is built around our Police Service that has to be paid for by the taxpayer. I understand our interstate colleagues are able to provide the same service without this massive bureaucracy. I ask the minister and the government to perhaps raise this issue at the next ministerial forum. How can we improve the level of policing in Queensland and simplify the process by following the good lead of our interstate colleagues? I refer members to the minister’s detailed answer to my question No. 1888. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs SCOTT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Woodridge--ALP) (4.20 pm): This bill, the Police Legislation Amendment Bill 2010, has what I believe is a very important change to the operation of police when dealing with low-level incidents such as public drunkenness, urination in public, failure to obey a police direction, swearing, offensive behaviour and such. At the moment these offences will sometimes result in offenders spending a night at the watch-house and, ultimately, a court appearance. While a night in the watch-house may be all that is required to ensure a young person makes a firm resolve never to end up there again, nonetheless for others it may initiate them into a level of defying the law and possibly slipping into a higher level of crime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057385"></A>
When we consider the large number of revellers out in our entertainment precincts on any given night, particularly Friday and Saturday nights, these low-level crimes can occupy so much police time and divert them from other more urgent and important issues. It also requires extra paperwork by police and time involved in court action. This legislation will enable our police to write an infringement notice with a fine attached, thus saving a vast amount of court time. Our courts are busy places and taking up valuable time for people to appear before a magistrate to hand down a fine simply is not best practice. With this new regime, the only time our courts will be used is if a person wishes to contest a ticket given for an offence. Police will use their discretion and may revert to existing measures such as move-on powers, diversion, cautions or, if deemed necessary and of sufficient seriousness, arrest and charges. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057386"></A>
In bringing this bill before the House, we are acting on the recommendation of the CMC in its review of public nuisance and its report, <Hansard-Italic>
Policing public order</Hansard-Italic>
. Following this recommendation, a successful 12-month trial was conducted in Townsville and South Brisbane, which was subsequently reviewed by Griffith University and received a positive report. While there may be some misgivings amongst certain people about the ease at which police may be able to write a ticket, I recall similar concerns expressed prior to the introduction of move-on powers which we gave to police. To my knowledge there has not been abuse of those powers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057387"></A>
Police who are at the front line of public law and order in this state do a fantastic job, often in the face of abominable behaviour on the part of drunken and drug affected people. All of our emergency services personnel are at risk when they attend volatile situations and when there are large crowds of people who have been consuming large quantities of alcohol, often with drugs also involved. It can be a very dangerous situation. The initiatives in this bill will give police yet another option and one which will have, as a result, time saving measures, both in policing and court time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057388"></A>
Other measures contained within this bill enable a far greater electronic search of a person’s criminal history when being assessed for employment and also the threat of suspension of a licence under the Prostitution Act for non-payment of annual fees. This bill will result in far greater efficiencies within our police department and court system. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs STUCKEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Currumbin--LNP) (4.24 pm): I rise to contribute to the debate on the Police Legislation Amendment Bill 2010, which was introduced by the Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services, the honourable member for Nudgee, just last sitting on 5 October. This bill will amend the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000, the Police Service Administration Act 1990 and the Prostitution Act 1999 to achieve three specific aims. These are to expand ticketing for public nuisance offences state-wide, to allow for Queensland Police to use CrimTrac for assessments of suitability records to be used for employment screening and to implement changes to disciplinary processes within the Prostitution Licensing Authority. I shall contain my comments to the first two points mentioned. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057399"></A>
Amendments to this bill are the result of a report by the Crime and Misconduct Commission titled <Hansard-Italic>
Policing public order: A review of the public nuisance offence</Hansard-Italic>
, which prompted a 12-month trial of issuing infringement notices for public nuisance offences in 2009. Griffith University was engaged to evaluate the trial, which took place in Townsville and South Brisbane police districts. They found that the issuing of on-the-spot fines was a more cost effective means of dealing with public nuisance and also freed up courts and police. According to the minister’s second reading speech, the rollout of the ticketing system state-wide will reduce the need for offenders to be taken into police custody for minor offences and enable police to spend less time on paperwork for public nuisance offenders and more time performing operational duties. The minister has also indicated that ongoing evaluation will occur through an operational performance review on public offender reporting 12 months after the state-wide implementation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057402"></A>
Unlike many definitions relating to provisions ensconced in legislation, it is surprisingly difficult to find exactly what amounts to ‘public nuisance’ as the offence is deliberately broad in definition, decided by an objective test considering time, place and circumstance of the behaviour. The Queensland Police Service mentioned some actions as examples of possible public nuisance offences in its submission to the CMC review. These include insulting behaviour such as verbal taunts, disorderly behaviour, destruction of property such as smashing beer bottles and general harassment of the public. Further, the CMC’s own review highlighted the following four broad categories: offensive language, offensive/indecent behaviour including public urination, threatening or violent behaviour and disorderly behaviour. In addition, kicking over bins and acting in an obstructive or threatening manner can be interpreted by police as public nuisance activities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057403"></A>
The LNP will not be opposing this bill. However, we do have some reservations, which have been addressed by my colleagues and in particular the shadow minister and honourable member for Gregory. No electorates in Queensland are immune from public nuisance offences and suburbs in Currumbin suffer from time to time with unacceptable behaviours from a small minority. Unfortunately, this is more frequent in licensed areas in entertainment precincts. Operation Cleanout, conducted in Coolangatta over 24 and 25 September this year, saw 27 arrests for charges from urinating in public to possessing a dangerous weapon--none, I might say, for violent crime. Police from Coolangatta, Palm Beach, Robina and the State Crime Command in Brisbane were involved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057405"></A>
Our police generally seem to welcome this legislation as it will give them more time to spend on the beat. However, some concerns have been raised that, while the ticketing system will work towards freeing up our courts, an increase in non-payment of fines could result in an overload of cases being referred to the State Penalty Enforcement Registry--SPER. A history of unpaid liquor SETONS and driving SETONS are an example of fines that tend not to be paid, particularly if they are imposed on young offenders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057409"></A>
Announcing this legislation in June this year, the minister encouraged police to take a zero tolerance approach--and not before time from this government with a soft on crime attitude that has allowed public disorder to become a hallmark of society over the past decade. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061320"></A>
Police resources are stretched thin on the ground, especially when officers from our local stations are taken away for major events such as schoolies in Surfers Paradise. Given those circumstances, police in the Currumbin electorate have learned to be resourceful by working closely with the community, ensuring a strong relationship of cooperation and collaboration. The unique cross-border situation in my electorate also creates a greater and more difficult workload for our police. Special constable status is required to make arrests across the border in New South Wales. Following my call for the fast-tracking of special constable status earlier this year, the situation was greatly improved and now virtually all officers at the Coolangatta station have the necessary training and qualifications to perform their duties unhindered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061323"></A>
The layers of bureaucratic inefficiency forced on to the Queensland Police Service by successive Labor governments have long frustrated serving officers in our great state. That is why our volunteers in policing, VIPs, play such an important role in assisting police in their duties. VIPs work with police to address customer service, community safety and crime prevention needs in the community. In the Gold Coast district we have 44 VIPs. I had the pleasure of talking to the VIPs manning the Crime Stoppers van in Coolangatta during crime prevention month in October. VIPs do a fantastic job offering important information on crime prevention tips to the community and making sure our kids are aware of the need to be sensible and safe. I would like to thank Senior Sergeant Holly James of the Gold Coast district crime prevention office for her efforts in coordinating the VIPs program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061325"></A>
Two years ago I conducted an electorate-wide survey asking residents to list their key issues and things they would like to see improved in our local area. Over 3,000 people responded and the issues that were of greatest concern, by far, were hooning and graffiti. This result prompted me to start the Hoon Watch initiative, which provided residents with a simple form to record details of villains who were disturbing their peace. To date the response has been strong, despite the former minister for police criticising this popular initiative when I launched it. Disturbances in our neighbourhoods should not be tolerated and, whilst there is already legislation to deal with many of the issues, the provision for police to issue tickets will hopefully act as a deterrent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061327"></A>
I could not speak to this bill without taking the opportunity to talk about the great work of individual police in the Currumbin electorate. I was really sorry to learn that Superintendent Jim Keogh and Inspector Des Lacy will be leaving us to take up positions further north. Superintendent Keogh is moving to Wynnum and Inspector Lacy has accepted a new job in Brisbane. Both gentlemen have many years of police experience on the southern Gold Coast and were instrumental in several projects that benefited our community, such as the Southern Alliance, the Palm Beach Community Consultative Committee and several truancy operations. On behalf of the people of Currumbin, I wish them well in their new endeavours. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061333"></A>
I also mention the acting inspector for the southern Gold Coast, Chris Ahearn. It is hoped that Chris will be placed permanently in this position to carry on the solid groundwork that his predecessors, Des Lacy and Jim Keogh, put in place. I acknowledge Constable Emily Tragis who was the winner of the most outstanding female practitioner at the recent Australasian Council of Women and Policing awards. Emily was recognised for her work with our youth and drug, alcohol and other problems in our community. She has done an amazing job in a very short space of time, and it is really great to see someone so worthy acknowledged for that. I welcome to our electorate Katrina Casaclang, who commenced work in Currumbin as our youth engagement officer. I also acknowledge Tony Unicomb and Kurt Foessell from the Elanora police beat. It is the ongoing efforts of all officers that have such a positive influence in our community. I am pleased to see before us today legislation that is designed to improve the working conditions of our police. </Hansard-Body>

Mr RICKUSS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lockyer--LNP) (4.34 pm): I rise to make a brief contribution to the Police Legislation Amendment Bill. I congratulate the police minister for bringing forward this bill. Recently in the Lockyer, a liquor industry action group was set up because, unfortunately, as many other speakers have said, it is around hotels and in the entertainment districts where these issues arise. The hotels have banded together to form a LIAG to assist the police in managing some of those issues. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1061343"></A>
I congratulate Sergeant Tom Messingham, Sergeant Jim McDonald and the team from Gatton. I acknowledge Sergeant Bernie Wilce, a long-serving Gatton police officer, and retired Sergeant Mick Brennan.

This is commonsense legislation, particularly when we remember that some public toilets are locked at midnight to save them from vandalism. Unfortunately, some business doorways suffer the consequences and the police or the business owners have to clean up the mess. Addressing the issue has been a long and onerous task. I have heard of the frustration felt when a judge gives an offender only a $50 fine and a slap on the wrist, yet the shop owner has spent half the morning cleaning up his doorway. They really do find that very frustrating. I have also given a few letters of reference to young fellows who have found themselves in those unfortunate situations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061350"></A>
I believe CrimTrac will improve policing. This is all good common sense. The police need all the assistance they can get.

Unfortunately, some young people think of it as an initiation to see what mischief they can get into in those sorts of events. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MALONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mirani--LNP) (4.36 pm): I rise to support the shadow minister in his enunciation of our support for the bill and to congratulate him. The debate gives me an opportunity to speak about the great work being done by police officers in my community, right throughout the seat of Mirani, and to talk about some of the frustrations that they experience from time to time. I particularly mention Superintendent Rowan Bond of the Mackay police district and Acting Superintendent Graham Coleman from the Rockhampton police district. I acknowledge officers from right across the electorate such as St Lawrence’s Senior Sergeant Mick Hill and Mirani’s Senior Constable Fred Bagley. Fred does a great job. He has been a resident in the Mirani township for 15 or 20 years now, which is as great an example of community policing as you will see anywhere. I am sure that Fred would be able to find the culprit of a crime before the criminal even thought about doing it. We need to advocate strongly for community policing as we move forward with policing throughout our rural communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061358"></A>
At Eton Senior Constable Gary Knack is a great operator, particularly on the busy Peak Downs Highway. I acknowledge Mount Morgan’s Sergeant Darren McLean, who is the acting officer in charge. Darren has had a very difficult time over some years now. When I first started representing the area of Mount Morgan, he had only two police officers in the town. I believe there are now six officers at Mount Morgan and they have the town under a pretty tight rein. They are able to do street walks late at night, which helps with juvenile crime. The issue of juvenile crime is a fairly big issue. At one time a particular juvenile, who was not yet 16 years old, had been taken to court 30 times. They would take the lad into custody and take him to the courthouse in Rockhampton, but basically he would be released and would almost beat them home to Mount Morgan. That happened on a regular basis. I am not sure that the legislation before the House this afternoon will rectify that situation. Certainly, it was a cause of huge frustration for the police at Mount Morgan. They have that under a certain amount of control, but juvenile crime will always be a huge drain on police officer resources throughout the community.</Hansard-Body>

At Finch Hatton we have Sergeant Dan Graham, who has come back into the police force after retiring. It is good to see Dan back. At Marian we have Bill Feldman, who is the officer in charge there. Many members would remember Bill as a former member of parliament who represented a seat just north of here for quite some time. In the area where my electorate office is at Sarina we have a long-serving officer in Dave Parnell, John Black and Brian Cumming from the traffic police. They are just a few of the police officers whom I deal with on a regular basis throughout the electorate. There are many others whom I meet from time to time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069015"></A>
I have great respect for the work that the police officers do throughout the community. It is a very important role and it is very important from the aspect of the youth in our towns so that they can look up to and respect police officers. The vast majority of police officers I meet and the work they do in the community are exemplary. It was very unfortunate that we had that situation in the Whitsundays as it was not representative of the police I meet throughout my community. With those few words, I congratulate the minister in bringing the legislation forward and I particularly support the police who work in my electorate. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr HORAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba South--LNP) (4.41 pm): In speaking to this legislation, I want to make some comments about, firstly, what is being proposed with regard to ticketing. I think it is something that the police have wanted for some time. If we look at police numbers, the first major increases in Police Service numbers were made by Russell Cooper under the Borbidge government, when the coalition at that time introduced the new police academy at Townsville and introduced the system of ‘retreads’. That is, people who had been in other police forces were able to join the Queensland Police Service. We saw a big increase in numbers then. Although numbers have increased from what they were decades or generations ago, the amount of paperwork and process that police have to undertake now has become very substantial.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069021"></A>
In dealing with criminals--people committing violence and all sorts of other crimes--the police have to go through an unbelievable amount of process. That is the way it is in modern policing. Also, the criminals are warned that they do not have to answer. They can get legal advice. They do not have to answer any questions if they do not want to. For the police--who are being paid by the Queensland taxpayers to provide them with protection and to do their best endeavours to charge people, arrest people and have them committed to trial--in some ways the task is very, very difficult. There are a number of advantages for those who are the miscreants, whereas the police have to make sure that everything is taped and videoed and that all the proper warnings are given to the people who have been arrested. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069022"></A>
I think any system that can look at the lower level of crime or misdemeanours and remove that process so that our police officers who are out there on the street and who are needed on the street can continue to be there is a good thing. Their presence is as important as what they do. Their presence alone can make streets, suburbs and towns safer. It is important that they are visible or that they are in the car and able to respond to traffic accidents, domestic violence and the myriad other things they may have to respond to. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069023"></A>
A ticketing system would provide great efficiencies. Not only that, it would take away some of the work that may be building up before the lower courts. Also, it can be--and I am sure it will be--a deterrent. I think something like 60 demerit points apply in most cases that we are debating here this afternoon. For many people, particularly young people, that would be a serious deterrent from doing it again--the fact that they have been issued a ticket on the spot. They have had the scare, if you like. They have been pulled up by the police for what they are doing. The matter has been dealt with, and very often swift justice is fair justice. It has been dealt with on the spot while the offence is occurring or has occurred and the lesson, with the issuing of the ticket and the fine, should be salutary. You would hope it would be salutary and the lesson learned. They would not have the amount of dollars that they would have to pay and they would not want to do that again in the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069024"></A>
I think that is a good system. There is always a need for checks and balances. Ticketing is limited to public nuisance type offences. I think it would certainly add strength to the move-on powers that police have. I have spoken about this before in the parliament. Again, they were brought in by Russell Cooper in quite a pioneering move under the Borbidge government, and successive governments have increased the move-on powers of police. There have always been certain checks and balances available with those powers. But where those move-on powers were once very restricted to certain areas, such as around schools or a hole-in-the-wall ATM, they have now been expanded to other areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069025"></A>
If, for example, a party is out of control or kids are roaming the streets after a party and there is a risk of violence or risk of them being a nuisance--bashing letterboxes or threatening people in the street--I think a ticketing system would add great strength to the move-on powers. I would be interested for the minister to explain in his summing-up whether that is how it could apply as well. If they are being a nuisance in the streets in the suburbs and are told to move on but they do not move on, can a ticket then be issued straightaway? That is the sort of thing that we need. We have heard plenty of people talk about urinating in the streets. I think there is a lot more to public nuisance than that. I certainly think that would be of great benefit to the police and would add a bit more strength to what they are able to do. The move-on powers can now apply in a very wide range of circumstances. If there is a problem in a suburban street with a party getting out of control, it is important that the police are able to say, ‘Move on. Get out of here. There are other people who live in this street who are entitled to live in peace and safety. We require you to move on,’ and if they do not move on then they can issue a ticket. That would add to the strength of what the police are able to do. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1069027"></A>
In talking about violence, I want to commend a movement in Toowoomba called Toowooomba Says No To Violence. A number of the leading police officers in town are involved in that movement, particularly in speaking to community groups. A number of people throughout Toowoomba--members of parliament, leaders of business, leaders of the community--have signed up to it. It is where people endeavour to act as role models and spread the message throughout our city that violence is not on, particularly violence against women. So we endeavour to make our city a safer place, particularly for women. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069031"></A>
I would like to commend Peter Rookas of the Toowoomba Hospital Foundation, who plays a major role in this movement of Toowoomba Says No To Violence. It is, if you like, quite a manly thing where many of the men and leaders of the city stand up and say, ‘We totally disagree with violence, particularly violence against women, and we want to make our families and our streets in our city safer places.’ The police play a wonderful role in that. I certainly believe that it pays great dividends in making our city a safer place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080318"></A>
The police in Toowoomba have a very busy job. It is a major police district and a large city. We have a court system in the city. There is a major highway through the city. There is a lot of activity for the police in our city. With the Warrego Highway going through the city we have a large number of trucks going through the city--I have spoken about this before--and that is a massive issue. Probably no other city in Australia has to deal with the thousands and thousands of B-doubles that come up the range and through the city. Consequently, there are traffic problems that can occur throughout the city. They have to go through 16 sets of traffic lights from the east and west--that is, coming up the range or traversing the western fall going out on to the Downs. There are a lot of traffic issues. The traffic police are exceptionally busy with that as well as the normal traffic issues faced by a large and growing city. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080320"></A>
With regard to violence in the city, our rate of reported violence is about 12 per cent below the state average. I think the police should be commended for this. They have undertaken particular strategies for key times like Friday and Saturday nights when young people want to be out and enjoying themselves. It is an attempt to make the city safe so that young people can enjoy themselves. They put on extra police and employ good strategies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080321"></A>
Violence does still occur. No-one wants to see it. Credit has to be given where credit is due. The police have been able to get the level of violence in our major city to 12 per cent below the state average. We would like to see it at zero, but, being realistic, if we can be well below the state average it speaks volumes for the actions of senior police officers in terms of the strategies and, in particular, the young police officers who go out on the street and undertake what is, at times, very difficult work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080322"></A>
It is important that our police are backed up in a number of ways. It is very important that our police prosecutors are given the training and support they need in prosecuting matters. The police officers should have police prosecutors who provide the very best of backup for the hard work they do. If they have been out on night duty and made difficult arrests and sometimes dangerous arrests, when they go through the court system they need representation by prosecutors who are highly professional and well trained. That would give them the idea that they are going out and doing this difficult and dangerous work but they are getting backup all the way. I believe it is an important aspect of policing that our police prosecution service has adequate numbers and the officers have adequate professional training so that they are at the highest level. They are very often up against quite skilled barristers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080323"></A>
It is important also that the judiciary recognise the work that the police do and recognise that the police are working on behalf of the public of Queensland. There has to be a recognition of the public expectation. The worst thing we can have is a turnstile system of justice--that is, where people get parole after parole. The frustration that results is that those within the ranks of the Police Service say, ‘What is the point?’ Senior officers have to say to them, ‘You have to keep going and keep doing what you doing and eventually justice will prevail.’ I think it is important to always look at that. In the other portfolios where the selection of the judiciary occurs that selection must be made with the highest regard for values, ability and the recognition of public expectations and the work that police officers put in to see that the public are protected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080324"></A>
One of the great tasks of police all over Queensland, but particularly in Toowoomba, is their involvement with the PCYC. They do a wonderful job. For many young families and children in particular they provide a safe place for recreation in the geographic heart of the city. Many thousands of young kids avail themselves of the services of the PCYC. Probably the best thing they do is through leadership training. The young leaders in their teens are taken away to camp and come back and become leaders in their own right in the PCYC. It is wonderful to see. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080325"></A>
That is an important aspect of policing. It is a part of community policing. Young people learn to belong to an organisation and to respect their trainers and managers in whatever sport they are undertaking. They learn to build-up within their sport to higher levels. They learn to become coaches and trainers in their own right. They learn to cooperate and belong to a club and they can potentially undertake leadership courses and become leaders at the PCYC. There are a number of police officers who work on the PCYC committee in addition to the wonderful police officer who runs the PCYC, Cam. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080327"></A>
A big police station like Toowoomba has many services such as forensic services, communication services and detective services. I would like to commend the police for what they do. I think the proof of the pudding is in the eating when we see the figure for violence which is 12 per cent below the state level. That speaks volumes. Being a major centre, many of the recruits come to Toowoomba once they graduate. They do their first year of training outside of the police academy there. There is a requirement on many of the police officers to not only be out on the beat or in a patrol car but also to take a young constable with them who has just come out of the academy. Part of their training is the six months to 12 months at a major station under supervision. That requires extra effort and training, particularly when they are out on the streets at night. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080328"></A>
I am very hopeful that the part of this bill that relates to ticketing can bring about efficiency and a level of swift justice at that low level of misdemeanour known as public nuisance, which will allow police to get on with their job and have maximum time out in their patrol car answering the calls that they get or being visible on the streets or at the community activities that take place. Their valuable time needs to be far better spent on policing and not on process. </Hansard-Body>

Mr PITT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mulgrave--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.57 pm): I rise to make a very brief contribution and give my support to the Police Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 introduced by Minister Neil Roberts last sitting. Some of my colleagues have covered the various elements contained in the bill, such as the power to issue on-the-spot fines for public nuisance, public urination and associated offences, which is hard to argue with--however, some of those opposite have attempted to do so whilst maintaining they support the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080331"></A>
I want to focus my remarks today on those sections that deal with the assessment of criminal history records for employment screening purposes. Section 10.2A of the Police Service Administration Act 1990 authorises the commissioner to disclose criminal history records, with the consent of the relevant person, to third parties for employment screening purposes via CrimTrac or another police service. Disclosure of criminal history records under this provision is subject to non-disclosure provisions of other acts, including the Criminal Law (Rehabilitation of Offenders) Act 1986. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080332"></A>
The National Police Checking Service Support System, NSS, implemented nationally in May 2010, now provides the opportunity for a more efficient means of transferring criminal history information between police services. The previous inefficient process characterised by manually vetting and transferring records in hard copy by fax and courier has been replaced by an online vetting and electronic records transfer solution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080333"></A>
The implementation of NSS is, however, reliant on the ability of jurisdictions to reuse the full criminal history information data set the Queensland Police Service and other jurisdictions currently make available to the National Police Reference System. This removes the need for jurisdictions, including the Queensland Police Service, to send to CrimTrac and use two separate sets of criminal history information. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080365"></A>
During the recent implementation of NSS the QPS identified a deficiency in the legislation that prevents the QPS from re-using the criminal history data the QPS currently electronically provides to the National Police Reference System for employment screening purposes--that is, secondary use. The QPS also identified that due to the operation of section 10.2E of the PSAA the transfer of records containing spent convictions information to other police services via NSS results in an unauthorised technical disclosure of criminal history information to CrimTrac as the administrator and broker of information via NSS. To allow for the full implementation of NSS by the Queensland Police Service and to take full advantage of the efficiencies associated with the electronic vetting and transfer of records between jurisdictions, Queensland Police Service vetting officers need the ability to manage, review, vet and transfer criminal history records from one system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080375"></A>
As such, the bill will remove legislative impediments in the Police Service Administration Act to enable the use of full criminal history information already provided to CrimTrac through the National Police Reference System for use in assessing criminal history records. The amendments will also authorise the technical disclosure of full criminal history information to CrimTrac in facilitating the brokering of vetted records between police services. The amendments will not change the requirements that the final disclosure of a person’s criminal history to a third party can only be undertaken with the person’s written consent and limited to current adult convictions. The new process will also enhance accountability through a data trail auditing function. In short, this bill seeks to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Queensland Police Service and in my view gets the balance right in terms of community safety and the rights of the individual. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (5.00 pm), in reply: I first take the opportunity of thanking all members for their support. Universally across the chamber members supported this bill and indeed made very positive comments about, in particular, the way in which their local police address law and order issues in their various electorates. At the outset I also want to thank the Police Service for the work that it has done in preparing the material for this bill and indeed also the Prostitution Licensing Authority for the very professional service it provided as well. A number of members have spoken about the way in which the Police Service responds in their communities. However, we should also acknowledge the often unseen work of the Prostitution Licensing Authority. It is not the most visible work that is undertaken within the community, but it is a very professional group of people who take their role very seriously. I pass on my thanks to them for the great work that they do in keeping this industry as clean as is humanly possible.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080385"></A>
As members have identified, this bill provides a much more effective and efficient way of dealing with public nuisance offences and flows on from a recommendation in a CMC report which suggested that ticketing was a viable option for dealing with offences which, in the main, most people either do not go to court for or when they do get to court plead guilty. So a considerable amount of police time is taken up in preparing briefs and a considerable amount of court time is taken up in dealing with matters which, in the end, people are not contesting. Of course the safeguard always remains that if people feel aggrieved by the issuing of a ticket by a police officer the option of contesting the matter in the court still remains, and that is an important provision.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080386"></A>
The government authorised a trial in Townsville and South Brisbane and a Griffith University evaluation found that public nuisance ticketing was a cost-effective means of dealing with this issue, and consequent to that the government of course now through this legislation will be enabling the Police Service to roll it out across the state. There are a couple of important points out of both the trial and the evaluation that I want to mention. Around 46 per cent of people ticketed had no previous criminal history, and this is one of the significant advantages of this bill. There are a large number of people who for whatever reason--a bit of silliness on an evening out--end up having a criminal record. It impacts on their future employment. It impacts on their ability sometimes to travel overseas. The consequences of sometimes one mistake can have quite a serious and significant impact on a person’s life. One of the real advantages to me, to many people in the community and indeed to members of this parliament of this arrangement is that this will enable police in appropriate cases to issue a ticket which then means that an individual is not drawn through the court process and having that recorded against their name.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080389"></A>
The important point to note here is that this is just an additional option for police. All of the existing arrangements where police can arrest, issue a notice to appear, simply caution or move the person on still remain. This is an additional option which obviously will be used quite frequently, as the trial suggested, but those other options do still remain. As a number of members have pointed out, in addition to freeing up court time, this will enable officers to spend more time on the beat dealing with problem people, particularly in some of the hot spots across the state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080390"></A>
A couple of members raised the issue of the impact on vulnerable people, whether they be Indigenous people or people with mental health issues or other disabilities. Police are very conscious of that and indeed are making significant efforts to engage with appropriate service providers to ensure that where diversionary arrangements can be put in place they are pursued. There is no doubt that it is a legitimate question or concern for people to raise this issue about the impact on vulnerable people. As I have indicated, police are aware of that. Additionally, police officers will be required to provide a fact sheet when they issue a ticket which outlines services that people can access if needed. Additionally, members would be aware that the Police Service conducts a very rigorous operational performance review process where local policing activities are scrutinised and local officers and indeed leaders are held to account for the performance in their regions. After 12 months there will be a themed operational performance review on public order offences, so therefore the Police Service itself will focus attention on how appropriately these laws are being used. I am confident that with the training that will be provided and the intent of the Police Service to use them appropriately that is going to occur.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080395"></A>
I will address a few particular issues that members have raised but, just to move on to other aspects of the bill, amendments to the Prostitution Act are basically threefold. The bill streamlines or puts in place a more clear process for disciplinary hearings that the Prostitution Licensing Authority can use. The act does not really contain that much guidance as to how disciplinary proceedings will be conducted at the moment, so the bill really provides a comprehensive outline of how disciplinary proceedings will be conducted, how people will be treated, what rights they have et cetera. In addition to that, obviously in terms of probity--and a number of members mentioned this--there is now the ability for the full criminal history of an individual who might be applying for an executive position or indeed employment within the Prostitution Licensing Authority to have that full criminal history taken into account.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080400"></A>
One issue that is of concern is that some people within the industry do not believe that they should be paying their fees, whether it be licence fees or management fees, on time. In order to address that issue, the bill contains some very sensible and significant provisions which provide for the automatic suspension of a licence or a certificate where the payment is not made but also provides an opportunity for those people who have genuine reasons for exceptional circumstances to enter into a payment plan.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080401"></A>
Just to give the House an indication about the way in which a number of people have been behaving, since 2008 in terms of brothel licences, of 66 licences 42 annual return fees were paid late in that period, with average days overdue of 35 days. Some 17 disciplinary inquiries were commenced in relation to those overdue fees. With respect to managers, of 166 some 101 annual return fees were paid late--61 per cent--and the average days overdue was 23 days and 41 disciplinary inquires were commenced. That is really unacceptable. The Prostitution Licensing Authority relies upon that cash flow. Any business that had to rely upon payments of that nature would obviously be taking action against those creditors, so this is a sensible way to send a very clear message to those in the industry that they need to pay on time. The other provisions relate to CrimTrac amendments, and those amendments will obviously provide a much more efficient means of dealing with criminal history screening. Currently because of the nature of the restrictions under the act, a lot of that exchange of information needs to occur manually and now it can be done electronically.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084549"></A>
I will now address a few of the issues that were raised by individual members. Firstly, I thank the member for Gregory for his support for the bill. He actually described it as good legislation. I thank him for that. I think it is recognised universally that this bill will provide the police with very effective and useful powers. But importantly, the member made the point that it is going to keep a lot of people out of court who do not need to be there. Of course, we have courts and we have jails for people who deserve to be there, but in many circumstances people are committing that one offence--and I go back to that point that in the trial 46 per cent had no previous criminal history--but that recording against their name obviously can have a significant impact. So they can still get the penalty and justice is served. That is a benefit to those people who might just make one mistake in their lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084550"></A>
Moving on to the amendments to the Prostitution Act, the member asked how many people do not pay. I think I have answered that by giving those figures. I think that indicates that it is a significant issue. But also, as did a number of other members, the member acknowledged the good work of the Police Service. I join with him in recognising that our police work under exceptionally difficult circumstances at times. I think anyone who observed the siege that took place in Brisbane yesterday would recognise that at times they are faced with some significant and awful scenarios. But they deal with them very professionally. I know that members in this House give the police their full support. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084551"></A>
The member for Gaven started by saying that this bill was a sensible attempt to reduce the paper chase. In a sense, he was acknowledging that this bill will streamline the way in which police are able to conduct their duties in what is an area of great concern in the community--that is, public nuisance offences. But then he went on--and in a sense I was trying to follow his argument--and seemed to argue that, in the enforcement of some public nuisance offences, we need to take account of the particular services that people find themselves in. He used the example of a bus driver who had to relieve themselves behind a shed somewhere and who ultimately received a ticket. I agree with him: I think police will use their discretion. However, I did make the point--and he did take the interjection--that his argument seemed to be in direct contradiction to his party’s stance on mandatory sentencing. Under the policy pursued by the Liberal National Party with a number of offences, if you commit the offence then, no matter what the circumstances, you go to jail. So I find it a little bit difficult to understand how the member is arguing that particular point, which I agree with, but then stands up in this place and is prepared to support mandatory sentencing, which is his party’s policy in a range of areas.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084552"></A>
The member for Mudgeeraba criticised the resourcing of police. I think she is leading with her chin on that issue, as a number of the members of the opposition do. I make the point that under this government police resources have increased significantly. The member for Toowoomba South raised the issue of increased police numbers under a former minister. I make the point--and these are figures that members will hear me quote on numerous occasions--that when the National Party was last in government there was one police officer for every 507 people. That ratio is now down to one police officer for every 434 people or thereabouts. That is a significant increase in police numbers. Crime rates are down. The average crime rate for all offences is down by around 20 per cent. Property offences are down by 40 per cent. I think the issue of police resourcing is one upon which the Liberal National Party is quite vulnerable. The resourcing that the Labor government has provided has enhanced the ability of the Police Service to significantly reduce crime. Again, in that regard I give all credit to the police for the work that they are doing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084553"></A>
The member for Chatsworth, in following on from the point made by the member for Gaven, made the point that police are able to distinguish between a person who genuinely might have to relieve themselves in certain situations and those who are committing a public nuisance offence. Certainly, there will always be grey areas where people may be aggrieved about the way in which they have been treated but, as I have indicated, people are entitled to challenge these tickets in court if they so desire and that right will not be taken away from them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084554"></A>
The member for Buderim raised a couple of issues in relation to the distribution of health information to sex workers. I make the point that the onus--and it is contained within the conditions of the licence issued to licence holders--is on the licence holders to provide sexual health information at licensed brothels. Of course, Queensland Health also provides information. The member also mentioned a publication that the Commonwealth government produces. I understand that some brothels may have that information available. It is their right to do that. But also an individual licence holder may choose to use other publications of Queensland Health or, indeed, other publications that other agencies produce as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084555"></A>
The member also said that he felt there needed to be some dedicated way in which people who feel uncomfortable in raising matters directly with police about illegal activity can do that. In fact, they can do that now through a range of processes. Obviously, one is Crime Stoppers. People can ring Crime Stoppers at any time if they have information about illegal activity, whether that be prostitution, drugs or any other criminal activity. So people in the industry who might feel uncomfortable about presenting to a police station can call Crime Stoppers. Additionally, they do now contact the Prostitution Licensing Authority about illegal prostitution activities. In fact, in last financial year, out of the 70 complaints that were made directly to the Prostitution Licensing Authority 40 were about illegal prostitution activity. I think the member asked a valid question, but there are those opportunities now. People can go to the police. They can also report anonymously through Crime Stoppers or they can deal directly with the Prostitution Licensing Authority, and that is what a number of people have been doing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084558"></A>
The member for Redlands supported the ticketing on the basis that it would enable officers to have more time on the beat. The member for Toowoomba North focused on the probity issues relating to the PLA and recognised the strengthening of the criminal history screening processes through appropriate use of spent convictions. He also supported the principles of natural justice that will be applied, which means that, where that criminal history checking is to be undertaken, firstly, it must be with the consent of the individual involved and, secondly, they must be given an opportunity to see or know the information that has been presented about them and be given a reasonable opportunity to respond, if appropriate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084560"></A>
The member also referred to the recent retirement of Assistant Commissioner Col McCallum. I join with him in putting on the public record here my respect and appreciation on behalf of all Queenslanders, not just in his local community, for the work of Col McCallum. As the member for Toowoomba South acknowledges as well, Col McCallum has a spectacular policing career. He is well respected right across Queensland, within and without the service, and we certainly wish Col and his family all the best in his retirement. </Hansard-Body>

 I thank the member for Gregory and I also thank the member for Toowoomba South. I also recognise Assistant Commissioner Tony Wright, who has recently been promoted.

The member for Caloundra talked about disorder issues and the good work that police are doing in the Caloundra area. I acknowledge the support given to the bill by the member for Glass House. He made some comments about the police station in his area. I recognise that the station is an old Queenslander, but the Police Service advises me that it meets the current requirements of the service there. But I thank him for recognising and acknowledging the extra two officers who have been placed into the Maleny community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084565"></A>
The member for Springwood spoke about the negative impacts of public nuisance behaviour in many communities and also the positive benefits of this legislation in freeing up police time. I also acknowledge the work that the member has undertaken as chair of the Law, Justice and Safety Committee in its inquiry into alcohol fuelled violence. Obviously through that inquiry her understanding of this issue was enhanced. Therefore, she would well recognise the benefits that this legislation, and particularly public nuisance ticketing, can provide.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084566"></A>
The member for Burnett talked about the impact of this legislation on Indigenous communities. I have already touched on that matter. Obviously, in terms of the implementation of this legislation we need to be sure that any vulnerable people are catered for. Indigenous members of the community are highly represented under existing public nuisance laws and, indeed, under public nuisance ticketing. So obviously these laws are being applied against a higher proportion of Indigenous people than non-Indigenous people. Of course, police have a responsibility to ensure that those laws are applied appropriately. I do know that in many of the communities I have visited police do, where it is appropriate, actively engage in diversionary measures to refer people, whether they be Indigenous people or other vulnerable people, to appropriate support agencies. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1084604"></A>
I thank the member for Nicklin, and the member for Woodridge who followed on from the member for Nicklin, for their positive comments in support of the bill and for their support of their local police. The member for Currumbin spoke about the work undertaken by her local volunteers in policing and also her local police, as did the members for Lockyer and Mirani. The member for Mirani also talked about some issues in the Mount Morgan area. The issue of police numbers was raised by the member for Toowoomba South. He spoke positively about the bill so I do not want to be too harsh on him. Police numbers have increased significantly under the Labor government from when he sat around the cabinet table. He did ask a question about both the move-on powers and the public nuisance ticketing and whether they could be used together. In a sense they are two separate issues. The move-on is obviously a power of direction that can be used appropriately whenever the law is triggered and public nuisance ticketing is an actual offence. Whereas they are different in that sense, they may well be used in the same set of circumstances depending on the situation at hand. </Hansard-Body>

Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 If they refuse to obey an order to move on they are committing an offence. The public nuisance would be a separate offence. So they can work hand in hand. Police obviously need to use their discretion and use the powers appropriately. There is nothing to stop both powers being used concurrently or separately depending on the nature of each issue. </Hansard-Body>

Finally, the member for Mulgrave spoke specifically about the CrimTrac amendments. I thank him for that. It will provide a much more efficient way of dealing with this issue. As has been indicated by a number of members, currently police are having to fax material between agencies rather than simply accessing the material which has already been downloaded or uploaded onto the site. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084608"></A>
With those few words I again take the opportunity to thank all members, particularly the member for Gregory as the opposition spokesperson, for their support of this bill. I do believe that this will be of great benefit to police. I know from speaking to a lot of police on the beat that they feel this will enhance their capability to deal with an issue which is of concern to a number of communities. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

 (Mermaid Beach--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.23 pm): I rise to speak on the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill 2010. I would like to state that the opposition agrees with the intent of the bill but we have some concerns, which I will outline in my speech and through the clauses, regarding specific aspects of the bill that have come to our attention through our consultation processes. With Australia having the least affordable housing in the world this has seen a rise in people seeking alternative affordable accommodation and housing. People are opting to live in a variety of forms of housing. This has seen a growth in the manufactured homes industry and the caravan industry. The current legislation, the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2003, is being amended due to the growth in the industry and the need for certain protection to be in place for residents and owners of manufactured homes and caravan parks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084630"></A>
These amendments have come out of a review of the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2003 which the government has conducted and which was tabled in the parliament on 15 May 2008. The Review of the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2003 Outcome Report I must say is long overdue as the industry is a very fluid one and keeps changing due to the economic needs of the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084631"></A>
According to the explanatory notes the objectives of the bill are to protect homeowners from unfair business practices; to enable homeowners, and prospective homeowners, to make informed choices by being fully aware of their rights and responsibilities in their relationship with park owners; to encourage the continued growth and viability of the residential parks industry; and to provide a clear regulatory framework to ensure certainty for the residential park industry in planning for future expansion. I believe future expansion is an important part of this legislation in protecting these manufactured homes parks and is an integral part of the residential choices that are available out there in the community. The objectives are also to increase certainty for converted caravan owners dwelling in these manufactured homes parks and to improve the presentation of site agreements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111038"></A>
I will now look at some of the major amendments contained within this bill. The first one looks at the protection of manufactured home owners’ rights. The Liberal National Party is strongly supportive of any initiatives and policies that protect the rights of individuals. In saying that, we mean the rights of all individuals whether they be the park resident or the park owner. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 4 of the act to include protecting manufactured home owners from unfair business practices while still encouraging growth of this very important industry. We have seen in some circumstances, as in all industries, unscrupulous business owners taking advantage of people who are honest and unaware and believe others at their face value. Obviously Kevin Rudd believed what Julia Gillard was saying to his face but was unaware of what his deputy was saying behind his back. This can be the case in certain circumstances with manufactured home park owners and also, to some extent, the residents of these parks. However, no amount of legislation or education can completely eradicate unscrupulous operators so every opportunity should be taken to prosecute those leeches who take advantage of a section of society who in many cases are doing it tough. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084633"></A>
The next significant amendment to the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2003 is to do with converted caravans. A converted caravan is a caravan that has had its original design changed and altered structurally with an addition or modification so that it is no longer classified as a standard caravan. As we are all aware, this manufactured homes act specifically does not apply to caravans. With the conversion from a caravan to a converted caravan--and it is very technical to understand completely the amount of work that goes into it going from a non-complying tenancy, if you like, to a complying tenancy under this act--it should be still classified as a caravan and not as a manufactured home. Under the legislation there are a whole different set of regulations needed for the construction of a manufactured home to qualify as a relocatable home under the manufactured homes act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084634"></A>
This type of housing has come about out of a need for affordable housing combined with the want of people to have the ability for mobile home and holiday alternatives. The development of caravans emerged from humble beginnings. As we all know, a travel trailer or caravan towed behind a vehicle provides a place to sleep that is more comfortable and protected than a tent. Of course, tent by definition is also excluded from the manufactured homes act. We all enjoy these sorts of holidays, especially in our beautiful state of Queensland where Australia shines and is famous for fun. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084635"></A>
The caravans had its origins in Europe when travelling Romani gypsies moved from place to place to entertain town folk. This is where the phrase ‘no fixed address’ came from. The world’s first leisure trailer was built by the Bristol Carriage Company in 1880 and was an 18-foot design based upon Bible wagons of the time. The minister would be very familiar with those wagons. From those early days they developed into the variety of mobile accommodation we see today such as caravans, camper trailers, travel trailers, motor homes, pop-up trailers and fifth-wheel trailers. All are classified as either RVs--recreation vehicles--or mobile homes and some can be as well equipped as a standard house. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084669"></A>
I remember well when the legislation for manufactured home parks came into being through a former member for Nerang. I had just joined council in 1988 and the then member for Nerang, Tom Hynd, had quite a few residents from Carrara in what has turned out in the 22 years that have passed to be the best real estate on the Gold Coast involved in the first sale of manufactured homes. There were many difficulties with the owners of those parks at that time and Tom Hynd took it upon himself to bring their plight into the parliament. First of all, he issued a green paper and then followed it up with the introduction of legislation into this House which saw those home dwellers afforded some protection in the vein of what was originally intended, which was a permanent dwelling place on a site that they rented from the park owners. As I recall, at that particular time the park owners had a different intention, which was to let that particular park sit there and have people pay them rent until the time came when they would undertake some lucrative redevelopment of the property in the form of a highrise or some other tourist development down on the Nerang River. They would then have been able to move the tenants out of that park. However, the legislation that came forward gave those people certainty in life. I knew quite a few of them; they were in the Nerang PCYC. Quite clearly, those people were sold a different story to what was intended. Through that original legislation--it has obviously been amended since--we have come to the amendments that we see today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084672"></A>
We are talking about quite a large sector of Queensland society. There are something like 15,000 unit owners around Queensland. It is very much an area for dispute. It is very much an area for further clarification. I have no doubt that we will see further amendments to this act coming through. I certainly congratulate the minister on moving forward, to borrow a good Labor Party term, in bringing these amendments into this House. We have had quite a few submissions from affected groups, both from the park residents and also from the owners of those parks, as to how the legislation before the House did not go far enough in many areas and expressing different views on which way it should have gone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084673"></A>
The two industries--the mobile homes industry and the recreational vehicle and caravanning industry--developed and the legislation today is focused on manufactured homes that are permanent structures that can be relocated if necessary. Manufactured home parks have become increasingly popular over the last 10 years and as times get tougher as we go forward in this century we may see more demand for this type of living. That is why it is increasingly important that we make these private parks workable in terms of the park owners whilst protecting the rights of the residents of those parks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084674"></A>
The virtues of manufactured home parks include their light infrastructure, low ecological footprint, minimal land disturbance, abundant permeable surfaces for stormwater drainage and ease of site restorations and, of course, their affordability. Living in a manufactured home park with provisions for community facilities is becoming popular with residents because they enjoy the extra benefits of this community living including recreational facilities such as pools, community halls and other shared facilities that all residents can utilise in a shared capacity but that on an individual basis would be far out of the reach of those individual park dwellers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084676"></A>
The definition of a manufactured home is one that is constructed almost entirely in a factory. The house is placed on a steel chassis and transported to the building site. The wheels can be removed but the chassis stays in place. A manufactured home can come in many different sizes and shapes. It may be a simple, one-storey mobile home or it could be so large and complex that you might not guess that it was constructed off site. In section 10 of the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2003 a manufactured home is defined as a structure other than a caravan or tent that has the character of a dwelling house, is designed to be able to be moved from one position to another and is not permanently attached to the land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084678"></A>
Clause 6 amends section 10 to say that a manufactured home does not include a converted caravan. However, if the owner and park owner agree then a converted caravan can be considered a manufactured home for the act’s purposes and they can enter into a site agreement governed by the act. This is a mutual benefit agreement that is covered in the amendments coming through to the 2003 act. Clause 7 inserts new section 10A, which states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1084681"></A>
A converted caravan is a structure that--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1084682"></A>
(a)	as originally designed, was a caravan; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1084683"></A>
(b)	is no longer a caravan because of a structural addition or structural alteration.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1084684"></A>
That alteration by structural addition obviously turns it into a manufactured home. One must mention here that ‘squareline’ caravans must come under this definition even though they are a different shape to a standard caravan. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084685"></A>
I now move to the issue of site agreements, which is the subject of much discontent and unease by the parties who enter into them. Hopefully, this legislation will go some way to easing the concerns. Site agreements are contractual arrangements between the owners of a park and the residents of a park. Site agreements are important for the smooth operation of the park business. Clause 8 inserts section 14A to define a site agreement, which is a dispute about whether a park owner or a person can enter into a site agreement under the act, except if the dispute is about a converted caravan site agreement or a dispute about the party’s rights and obligations under the agreement or this act. There needs to be contractual certainty for all parties involved, and I believe this bill moves towards improvements in this area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084687"></A>
Another amendment in the bill relates to the presentation of site agreements. Clause 9 amends section 25 to include new requirements to improve the presentation of site agreements. It states that they should--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1084689"></A>
(a)	be easily legible; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1084690"></A>
(b)	if it is produced by any mechanical or electronic means, for example, by a typewriter or computer--be in at least 12 point font--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1084691"></A>
which I will still need my glasses to read--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1084692"></A>
(c)	be written in a precise way; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1084693"></A>
(d)	be clearly expressed in plain language--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1084694"></A>
The minister might be able to help me in his summing-up to identify what he means by ‘plain language’. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084695"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Lawlor:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Don’t you understand plain language? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084696"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Not coming from the minister. I thank the minister for the interjection. It goes on--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1084698"></A>
(e)	precisely identify the site; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1084699"></A>
(f)	state each party’s name and address; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1084700"></A>
(g)	state a phone number, if any, of the home owner--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1084701"></A>
park manager or park owner. Clause 9 also states that the tribunal may make an order increasing or reducing the site rent on application of the homeowner or park owner. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084705"></A>
Clause 10 inserts section 25A, which states that a homeowner may apply to the tribunal to argue that a site agreement is not written in accordance with the requirements. It may have excessively long sentences, clauses or paragraphs; it may have unnecessary use of technical terms, jargon or language other than plain English, which the minister has committed to explaining to me; there may be extensive cross-referencing, failure to define key terms, excessive definition of terms, particularly in relation to commonly used words; important terms may be buried in fine print or schedules; or there may be terms that place the homeowner at an unfair disadvantage because he or she is not clear about their meaning even if their meaning could be determined by a legal practitioner. The LNP believes any disadvantage to the consumer should be remedied with these amendments, but the act could have gone further. I look forward to future amendments that do just that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084707"></A>
I now turn to the prohibited conditions on site agreements. Clause 10 inserts section 25B, which prohibits certain park rules or terms imposed on site agreements. The prohibited practices include that a regulation may prohibit a stated type of special term in a site agreement or a stated type of park rule; a park owner must not include a special term in a site agreement or park rule that is prohibited from being in a site agreement under the first prohibition above; a park owner must not attempt to enforce a special term in a site agreement or a park rule that is prohibited from being in a site agreement under the first prohibition in the aforementioned sentence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089204"></A>
But what is a special term? A prohibited term is void in a site agreement. A homeowner may apply to the tribunal to decide whether part or all of a stated term in the site agreement is void. On application, the tribunal may declare that a stated term in the site agreement is void or not void, declare that a stated term in the site agreement is void to a stated extent or make an order varying the stated term of the site agreement. I presume that the tribunal will consider the rights of the individual when deciding on the implementation of site agreements for residents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089207"></A>
Clause 11 amends section 36 to prevent fixed-term site agreements. Park owners must not enter into a fixed-term site agreement or vary a site agreement to include a term under which the parties to the site agreement agree to terminate the site agreement. If the park owner does this, then the term is void. Clause 12 amends section 38, ensuring a site agreement cannot be terminated on the basis that the homeowner is not using the home as their principle place of residence. This will allow for manufactured homes to be used as investment properties as long as they have a residential tenant in that property. I believe this is a very appropriate amendment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089208"></A>
Consultation has been a focus of the opposition’s analysis of the bill. We have found that manufactured home owners are concerned about their rights and whether the protection in this bill goes far enough. We have attended the government’s community consultation processes, which I must say has been undertaken far and wide over a reasonable period to give all participants the opportunity to have input. I attended the Runaway Bay consultation meeting that government officers conducted. At that meeting it was notable that consensus was completely absent. However, everybody had the opportunity to put forward their views on the matter. There would have been almost as many different views on what was a proper outcome for this legislation as there were people at the meeting. I was informed that the Beenleigh meeting was also very successful. Meetings were held as far north as Mackay. I am not too sure if they went to Townsville or Cairns in North Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089209"></A>
In its examinations of the bill, the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee noted that considerable consultation was conducted by the government prior to introducing the bill, but that concerns were still evident within the community. The consultation process included a discussion paper and survey, a series of round table conferences, the release of a draft version of the bill in 2009 and the holding of a consultation forum. Residents and park owners, through their association, have raised with the opposition issues that we do not believe the legislation addresses. I will go through those as I discuss the amendments. In terms of industry and community stakeholders, the caravan park owners association has several concerns, including the three-year moratorium period before the converted caravan amendments commence. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Certainly it is to them. I take the interjection of the member for Morayfield. It allows for the owner of a converted caravan the opportunity to apply to the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal, QCAT, to have the converted caravan reclassified as a manufactured home. This begs the question that if it is a converted caravan now, should it be precluded from protection under this particular legislation? Why have three years of litigation to say yes or no? In relation to the site agreements, and as I mentioned to the minister, stakeholders are concerned about the meaning of ‘plain language’. The act gives no guidance to explain it, which certainly creates uncertainty. High on the list of concerns about the legislation was the potential flood of applications to QCAT. Quite clearly, QCAT is already under severe pressure from other areas of legislation and they believe that this legislation will give rise to many more disputes for QCAT to settle. Therefore, they are concerned that QCAT be given enough resources and support from the government to deal with all those matters. They believe that that question will only be answered in time after the enactment of the legislation. A concern was raised that the prohibited special terms are retrospective, which will have major implications. Once they are retrospective, one would think many people will go to QCAT to satisfy disputes from times gone by. Prohibitive agreements will also be retrospective. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089212"></A>
The site rent provisions impinge on the park owners’ rights to increase rent, which can only be done in line with increases in the CPI. Stakeholders argue that rent should be increased not only in relation to the consumer price index, because other specific costs that relate directly to the parks themselves may be much higher. For example, the recent massive rises in the price of electricity, water and fuel impact on operating parks and are well and truly above the CPI. If the operation of a park becomes unaffordable because the park owner is not able to get reasonable and fair recoupment of the costs, they will sell the park. The park could then change entirely in terms of operation. That would mean less of this type of residential property on the market for people to take advantage of. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089213"></A>
QCAT can postpone the termination of a site agreement for up to one year, which causes uncertainty with any proposed development the park owner might be intending to do. In this day and age, contracts are particularly time important. Stakeholders felt it very unreasonable for QCAT to be able to delay a termination by that length of time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089215"></A>
Clause 24 inserts new section 74A, which prohibits park owners from threatening, intimidating or coercing park residents. The concern raised with this matter is that the penalty for the offence can be up to $20,000 and one person’s harsh words may be taken by another person as a heavy threat. They wonder what part of $20,000 will they be liable for in terms of the adjudication through QCAT. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089216"></A>
Park residents are concerned that if they have to move to another site there may not be one available. That is particularly relevant for some isolated park areas. There is only limited compensation for relocation costs to a park within 300 kilometres, as I recall. That is okay if there is another park to relocate to within 300 kilometres, but in some areas there may not be a park available. Residents are worried that the bill does not address their issues in terms of relocation. </Hansard-Body>

The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee analysis of the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill in its <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert No. 8 of 2010</Hansard-Italic>
 explored concerns and issues regarding rights and liberties of individuals. The committee believes that in clauses 6 and 8, as I covered in my speech, it is to do with the definition of a manufactured home, and it is not a converted caravan. The committee went on to say that clause 20 may affect rights of park owners and that clauses 10-1, 17-8, 24-6, 29, 31 and 33 have the potential to affect rights and liberties of individuals in that they would create new penalties under the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act. I think that was clearly the intent when the legislation was designed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093418"></A>
In clause 10, if a park owner makes a park rule that is prohibited he is up for 100 penalty units, which is $10,000. In clause 11, if a park owner enters into a prohibited agreement he is up for a penalty of up to $20,000. These are very significant fines. In clause 17, if a park owner refuses to consent to assignment of a seller’s interest he is up for 20 penalty units, which is a $2,000 fine. Clause 18 provides for a $10,000 fine. Clause 24 provides for a $20,000 fine. The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee went on to say that clauses 10, 11 and 33 may adversely affect rights and liberties retrospectively. Clause 10 may also provide for inappropriate delegations of legislative power. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1093419"></A>
From a philosophical point of view, and as we speak to residents of the manufactured home parks, quite clearly they are a disjointed group. They have no lead agency, no one representative body. In fact, even the legislation clearly directs residents within manufactured home parks to have one voice to speak to the park owners in terms of disputes and in trying to regulate and keep down the number of different views, as I have said before, that the park residents have. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093421"></A>
The parks are spread throughout Queensland. We have quite a few on the Gold Coast, the north coast and the central coast, particularly around Hervey Bay--those sorts of areas. They really need to combine to have a single voice to negotiate with governments on their behalf. Quite clearly, the residents whom we from the LNP spoke to felt disenfranchised. A lot of them are pensioners. A lot of them are doing it particularly tough. There were many comments in relation to the four per cent increase in pension payments not being enough to cover the increase in site rental agreements. </Hansard-Body>

 I understand how some members in the Labor Party do not understand the plight of pensioners and are ready to put them down. I heard the comment that it is never enough, that pensioners are always on about ‘never enough’. As a matter of fact, I inform members of the Labor Party on the government benches that I happen to have a brother who has joined the pensioner ranks. Quite clearly, he is not living like a king and able to afford high increases that the Labor government feels pensioners can cope with. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093427"></A>
I would like to put on record in this House that quite clearly pensioners need to be looked after. The great majority of residential tenancies in manufactured home parks are pensioners and quite clearly they have to be looked after at every opportunity. There should be some direction given, because they are a fractured, individual group of tenants. Whilst we have other tenancy advocacy groups in terms of bodies corporate and other styles of residential living, this particular area of residential living is quite obvious for its lack of organisation and individual aspects which has seen their rights unfortunately eroded over a number of years. So I make that philosophical comment in terms of going back to this legislation. I am sure that in time to come we will see further amendments to this legislation to further protect the rights of individuals in residential parks as an increasing part of the society we have in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093429"></A>
The Liberal National Party is supportive of any legislative changes that protect consumers’ rights. As the shadow minister for fair trading I have spoken to Queenslanders who are concerned that their rights are protected in all areas, and I believe that this bill is a good start. The growing area of utilising manufactured homes as an alternative to standard housing is going to continue to expand, and the industry and consumers need appropriate laws to see the industry cope with that growth. It is a necessary and important part of our residential community options and must be protected by governments to the fullest extent. The opposition will be supporting the bill, but I still hold some of those reservations that I have highlighted in my speech. </Hansard-Body>

Mr CRANDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Coomera--LNP) (5.54 pm): I rise to contribute to the debate regarding the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill 2010. The main object of the act is to regulate and promote fair practices in the operation of residential parks to protect homeowners from unfair business practices and to enable homeowners and prospective homeowners to make informed choices by being fully aware of their rights and responsibilities in their relationship with park owners. According to the draft public benefit test review completed in January 2010, there are around 200 parks in Queensland accommodating 15,000 people. Most of those are in South-East Queensland. We can expect significant growth going forward. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093436"></A>
Broadly, the legislation goes some way towards its goals. But, from feedback from homeowners living in manufactured home parks both on the Gold Coast and in Logan City, it does not appear to have gone far enough. Of further concern to me is the recent occurrence where receivers and managers have been appointed to the affairs of a trust that owns retirement villages. Taking these two things into consideration, there has to be a balance between viability of parks and affordability for homeowners. We are a voice in this place for our constituents, and it is necessary and important for us to put forward their concerns in this place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093440"></A>
People move to these facilities for a variety of reasons. Many people living in these facilities are pensioners. Pensioners are not a bottomless pit of money and they should not be responsible for a park owner’s mismanagement or poor management practices. From my background as a financial planner, I can confirm that many who move to manufactured home parks do so to help with their retirement income needs. Many have not had the opportunity to build a big enough nest egg to live a reasonable lifestyle whilst remaining in their residence. Many have sold their detached home and used the proceeds to buy into a less expensive home, using the money left over to top up their age pension and therefore provide for their retirement income at a level that is a little better than perhaps just receiving an age pension. With escalating costs of living--for example fuel costs, electricity costs and so forth--these savings are rapidly reducing. There are a few points that need to be made here, and I draw on material I have received from people who are living what is fast becoming a very expensive lifestyle through no fault of their own. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093441"></A>
As I alluded to earlier, the rising cost of fuel and electricity is just the tip of the iceberg. When coupled with all of the other increases that all of us are experiencing, any increase to rent for those in a manufactured home park is becoming unbearable. While I am on the topic of rising costs, one cost that affects those who are pensioners in these parks is the rising cost of water. This government has written the legislation that provides relief for pensioners by way of a water rebate to ensure that these pensioners do not benefit. So here we have a situation where we recognise the need to give a rebate to pensioners for the cost of water as it increases. On the other side of the coin, we have many pensioners moving to these types of manufactured home sites who, because they move, do not qualify for that water rebate--same people, same water supply, same usage, no rebate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093442"></A>
Coming back to some figures provided to me by people on the ground, so to speak--park residents--they tell me that they quote the minister, who at various times has stated that ‘residential parks provide cheap and affordable housing to many thousands of Queenslanders’. They say that that may have been true in the past but not since the generous rent increases granted by the tribunal, especially those associated with the so-called market reviews. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097743"></A>
The comparative cost of different housing options that have been outlined to me, using a six-month council rating period in 2009, are as follows. The example given was between a house in Arundel with the six-monthly cost of $1,267 versus a town house in Merrimac with a six-monthly cost of $2,105, which included body corporate fees, compared with rental payments of one site in their village of $3,079. I have not checked these figures. I have taken them on face value, but I have no reason to believe that they are inaccurate. Yes, we can consider the outlay for residents versus the outlay for the town house versus the outlay for the manufactured home site. I alluded to that earlier. We have a situation where people are selling a more expensive home to use the proceeds to move to a manufactured home site. Of course, there is a capital cost to take into consideration in that regard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097746"></A>
The point these people are making is that their available capital, this additional capital, was intended to provide them with a better lifestyle, not to pay the ever-increasing cost of site fees that are well above inflation. One further point that was made was that the tribunal approved a rent increase of seven per cent in April this year and a further five to six per cent in June due to the tribunal ruling forcing them to commence paying for the water usage that I referred to a short while ago. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097747"></A>
These increases put the site costs up $3,448 for a six-month period. So it is $1,267 for a house, $2,105 for a town house and $3,448 for a manufactured home site. The annualised difference from top to bottom--that is, from the house through to the manufactured home site--is $4,362. That equates to a capital investment required of around $110,000. So $110,000 of the proceeds from the sale of the home that they sold so that they would have more money for their retirement years--and in many circumstances that is probably all they ended up with in extra funds--goes into the bank and that $110,000 pays the $4,362 increase in costs associated with them living in that manufactured home site as opposed to living in their own home. So they have gone no way towards improving their lifestyle in their retirement years which, I would argue, was their original intention in many cases. Not one dollar of it goes towards improving their lifestyle. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097748"></A>
Earlier I stated that homeowners should not be responsible for park owners’ mismanagement or poor management practices. Constituents talk to me about the introduction in the legislation of, what they refer to as, vague principles such as ‘viability’, ‘significant’ and ‘unforeseen’. I understand what they are worried about. Of course we all know the meaning of the words, but it is the concept that the park owners have not thought ahead sufficiently to have these matters covered in their business plans that disturbs the homeowners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097749"></A>
They talk about potential site fee increases and other costs being imposed upon homeowners for these and other reasons. They ask: at what level of profitability does a park become viable? Is it viable if it breaks even--that is, after paying all of the salaries of the people who are involved in running the park and breaking even beyond that and perhaps for the park owner a capital return if they at some time decide to move on and no longer manage the park--or is a five per cent profit or perhaps a much higher profit of 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 per cent required? No-one really knows what is regarded as a reasonable rate of return for these park owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097750"></A>
How and who will establish and monitor these issues, they ask. I repeat that the homeowners are on fixed incomes for the most part and there is a limit to how far they can stretch to bail out park owners. Another point that has been made abundantly clear is that the individual homeowners are in a weaker negotiating position than park owners. QCAT aside, at the end of the day it is what they bring to QCAT that it is going to make its decision on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097752"></A>
The park owners are typically company structures with astute businesspeople at their helm. They also have an association that can act on their behalf as a group. The member for Mermaid Beach referred to a failing at the moment where individual homeowners in parks do not have an association and therefore are in a weaker position. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097753"></A>
As I said, the park owners also have an association that can act on their behalf as a group, the point being that they are able to more easily bring resources to bear to support their argument. We have a situation where park owners are collecting rent from homeowners and using those proceeds to bring to bear the resources to fight the individual homeowners. So the homeowners are funding the fight against themselves in relation to any argument that they might have that they might want to put through the tribunal. An extension of this is the concept that a company could use proceeds collected from homeowners in one park--that is, a viable park--to fund another park that they own that is ailing or indeed another business that is ailing that has nothing to do with parks of any description but is simply another business. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097754"></A>
A further point--and I referred to the percentage increase earlier--is that recent increases are significantly higher than pension increases. This cannot be sustained by people on fixed incomes. It was a 13 per cent increase in their cost over a period of just a few months. We are talking about an inflation rate of something in the order of three per cent. We may very well find that some have to sell out and fall back to rental accommodation during their twilight years if the trend continues.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097755"></A>
In closing, I make the point that I made at the beginning of my contribution. The bill goes some way to providing further certainty for homeowners but I urge the minister to make this a work in progress and continue to work on improving the act to more properly address the concerns of an ever-increasing number of retired and near retired residents of manufactured home parks. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (6.06 pm): There is not always a long journey between choice in housing and getting any shelter that one can. Having a home or being homeless after good or bad health is probably the most powerful of all human needs. This bill has a basic aim of delivering some certainty to a critical group of Queenslanders--those defined as living in manufactured homes. A manufactured home is defined as the end result option, that being where the owner rents the site of a manufactured home, owned not by the residential park owner, and owns the home, according to the minister in his second reading speech. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097758"></A>
But what if the owner rents the site from a residential park owner and the residential park owner owns the manufactured home too, as is often the case on the Gold Coast, and critically where the previous owners of that manufactured home did not live in that structure for the three years immediately prior to the commencement of these amendments? All these points are critical not because the bill and the minister’s department have not tried to address the complete issue of definitions but because the bill may not resolve many of the problems facing the homeowners of certain manufactured homes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097759"></A>
For the majority, some of their issues are addressed, but they as a group remain an unhappy lot. After defining manufactured homes, the minister has also taken a big focus on the clarification of what a caravan is when a caravan is not a caravan and when it either becomes a manufactured home or close enough to becoming a manufactured home and when a caravan becomes an entity covered under the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2010 and also when it remains under the RTRA, the Residential Tenancies and Rooming Accommodation Act. It is all pretty confusing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097760"></A>
There is an attempt within the bill to clarify this. I actually think the minister has attempted to work his way through this, as the shadow minister said. There is really some quite interesting detail here that has reached a crescendo in the case of Tamahori v Roofley Pty Ltd 2009. It followed on the review of the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2003 outcome report. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1102039"></A>
It must be said that the current undecided court cases will be heard as though the amendments had not been made, but converted caravans would not be covered under this act. A site agreement can be made between the park owner and the caravan owner under the provisions of the act. Respectfully it might be said that we have at best a two-stream system of judicial fairness and at worst a contradiction of the facts that may lead to a severe judicial and legislated unfairness. This occurs because there are very tight definitions regarding the quantum of modifications to a caravan that define it as a manufactured home but it is loose with the definition about what is and what is not transportable. Realistically in a modern world, nearly anything is transportable. What generally limits that transportability is cost. Everything else is essentially flexible, but if the budget will not allow it and nor is it economically practicable then that alone would seem to be the key ingredient to determine whether a home is transportable or not.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1102040"></A>
I suspect transportability will be tested in courts. The most likely determining factor will be those seeking access to Commonwealth benefits in planning terms to both rental allowances on their homes and whether they have been accepted for those benefits. This benefit may be making a lot of these types of housing developments popular, especially for retiring or the retired population. What some members may not be aware of is that the benefits flow after the property meets the test of the non-freehold or rented land, and that includes nonleased and the dwelling on it theoretically being transportable. In reality, these homes are not really very transportable at all. In a modern world they have less in common with the old Logan unit or kit home and more in common with modern non-brick veneer on concrete floor base-to-ground structures. The closest parallel is the donga--the detachable on-site general purpose annexe. This is either that loved or loathed dwelling now ensconced in Australian folklore.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1102044"></A>
Is this relevant? It certainly is, for this is where the bill will certainly lead many of the existing residents of residential parks or enclaves which are essentially the same. In an era where there is a rapidly ageing population who are seeking less complication in their lives, downsizing of their homes and financial obligations, these manufactured homes will be a very sizeable part of the housing equation in absolute terms as a proportion of these dwellings. It may be that all of the changes are coming too late for many and will not be all embracing enough for the great numbers who in the next 10 years will find themselves either in a residential park or considering buying or renting a manufactured home in a park or an equivalent of it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1102046"></A>
Australia has a housing shortage of 300,000 homes or $100 billion worth of homes. This shortage of 300,000 homes in Australia has an enormous immediate knock-on effect in our community. It is particularly compounded in the growing communities in South-East Queensland. The shortage is not generalised. It is very lopsided and is amplified by economic, social and physical demands. In an economy where mining is booming, we are being pulled between housing shortages in mining or near-mining towns where there is fly-in and fly-out staff and there is a disconnect between demand and supply. Older Australians are also reticent to move because of divorce in their children and themselves, children staying at home longer, loss of social supports because of moving and an equity problem in their savings. Australians, whilst enjoying a high percentage of home ownership, which is still at the 70 per cent mark, have declining home equity and rising mortgages, with an average home mortgage on the Gold Coast of $400,000. This is driving homeowners to look at manufactured homes as a serious option because of the attractive Commonwealth effective subsidies and a liberation of locked up equity found in their retirement options.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1102051"></A>
For those nonowners it gives an affordable option that ensures for many the security of a home free from everything from rates to under 50-year rental families whose lives may not necessarily be acceptable to an older group. This pursuit of a later life of security, not wishing to live near rental properties, being close to those with similar aspirational goals and a flexibility of selling options is very common to many of these. In my electorate of Gaven there are three very large such premises that address the three major market sectors. The public likes it and it wants more of it. The tragedy of this bill is that by limiting incentives to park owners we may see little future investment in these areas. The minister has correctly stated that the bill--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1102053"></A>
... proposes important amendments to strengthen provisions of the act that protect the interests of manufactured homeowners.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1102054"></A>
He goes on to say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1102056"></A>
After having moved into a park, the opportunity for a homeowner to change providers and get a better deal for themselves is very limited.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1102057"></A>
For most a home is a personal choice subject to many conflicts, much happiness and sanctuary. It follows that when a resident either feels powerless or is threatened by loss of control over their own home they might choose security over both convenience and cost savings. The minister is reassuring owners that the bill--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1102059"></A>
... strengthens provisions of the act ... from engaging in threatening, intimidating or coercive conduct regarding site rent issues.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1102060"></A>
He adds--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1102062"></A>
... the act limits the grounds on which site agreements may be terminated and provides for compensation to be payable to homeowners in certain circumstances.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1102063"></A>
Specifically, it might be said that there are some very good examples where both park owners and residents, local governments and state government have got it right for manufactured home owners and some where they have not. I want to raise some of these. Land resumptions for specific purposes over and above that of the needs of the residential park owners is a significant issue. It may be that in some ways park owners may become the poor cousins in comparison to the residents, the adjoining urban residents and governments--mainly local government. We must be careful not to make these parks economically unsustainable because not only will that impede greater investment by future developers and investors--that is, superannuation funds primarily, and there have been some recent failures--but seriously affect those residents whose dwellings are within the confines of the park. The minister correctly highlighted this in his second reading speech when he said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1102067"></A>
... by substantially limiting the grounds on which a park owner may seek an increase in rent outside the terms of a site agreement.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1102068"></A>
He then says--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1102070"></A>
A ‘market review’ of site rent will not be permitted unless it is specifically provided for in the site agreement.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1102071"></A>
This reflects the very legitimate concerns of all those living or wishing to live in manufactured homes who live on fixed incomes, self-funded superannuation and have a very tight budget. The certainty of knowing their probable on-costs are critical to ensuring their personal security.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1102075"></A>
Several years ago at Riverside on the Gold Coast, which is within my electorate, homes were resumed for the construction of a major critical bridge expansion. Some owners and the park owner were dealt with very harshly. The learning curve out of that appears to have not made it into this bill. In fact, the same situation seems to have occurred and has been massaged in terms that were weighted by politics and not in reality. It is stated that the bill--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1102077"></A>
... specifically prohibits the establishment of fixed-term site agreements between homeowners and park owners.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1102078"></A>
The minister has defended the decision by stating--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1102080"></A>
They disadvantage homeowners by excluding their entitlement to compensation if the park owner decides to end the homeowner’s right to reside in the park because the park owner wishes to use their land for another purpose.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1102083"></A>
This is the argument between certainty of tenure, leasehold versus freehold title and fairness to all. It would seem to be lacking in sense to limit a property’s ability to be made more relevant to community need over time by restricting the freehold property owner to how the property can be used. This seems consistent with Labor’s current addiction to the idea of defeating market economics by land locking property through introducing legislation such as the wild rivers legislation that effectively forever restricts economic return from freehold property. The market historically will usually get the best result. In the case of a property where the manufactured home might be sited, if a site agreement was in place and had a 30-year time frame that property would sell or would rent for a much lower price towards the end of the agreement and it may well significantly decline in the last five years of the agreement. This then both facilitates cheaper, more affordable and relevant housing, greater site utilisation, greater capacity for urban renewal and certainty for all.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106524"></A>
Honourable members, these issues are very real and we must be responsible and look to the future here. Many of these residential parks are critically located close to major transport routes, retail properties, rivers, beaches and central city locations. To permanently lock up such large parcels at the whim of very small individual residential renters will give a terrible long-term potential for trouble, not to mention dreadful planning outcomes for local governments and for the state as a whole. The Footscray situation in Melbourne, which has been subsequently corrected, and then the Olympic village in Melbourne and then the issue of Modbury in Adelaide are testaments to these types of disasters--certainly on broader terms, but they can be examined in their own way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106527"></A>
I am all for the protection of vulnerable consumers, but we should pass legislation that has been clearly thought through. I do not think this legislation has been clearly thought through. There are significant alternatives. In manufactured home parks, owners have concerns that extend from concern about park owners finishing off the parks to the letter of their stated intention as to whether or not there would be a body corporate to provide maintenance, to the appointment of staff, who is allowed in, who is not allowed in and how their homes will look externally. In general, most want the village to conform to that which they signed on to and resent when the exemptions occur. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106528"></A>
On the Gold Coast, the trend in these areas is for non-body corporate structures, because the parks have singleton owners with residential homeowners and renters in some. Strangely, this bill does not change the most difficult part of the issue, which means that compensation takes the form of an assumed cost of removal to another site. The failure of this legislation is that currently there is not one relocation site in Queensland and it looks like there will never be one. Therefore, owners have nowhere to move to after compensation and removal costs are taken into account and in most cases they will have to abandon their homes. With no housing, they then may have to seek public housing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106529"></A>
Historically, residential park owners have been either building or moving homes on to available sites and either selling or renting them where the rules--that is, the agreements--may allow. By baulking at one of the most critical areas, the minister via this bill totally imperils a small group who may have legitimate reasons for grievance. The department compounds their tragedy by effectively rendering them homeless under the guise of a very modern view--and I think it is a very loose view--of transportability, which is where I started in my speech tonight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106530"></A>
I cannot accept that in one part of the bill the minister’s view of transportability is very low, but when it all gets too hard for a resident the minister’s view of transportability is very high. To me, that implies that the bill will be tested in court and the issue of transportability will enable manufactured home owners to demand far greater compensation than anyone ever previously conceived. The flaw is critical. It demands immediate amendment. The drafting intention was to leave well alone, but this bill consigns residents threatened with eviction to a different class of resident as soon as they are deemed to be eviction-potential candidates. That lower class of resident means that these people are not just treated differently but also may not be fairly compensated for their loss because, in reality, the ease of transporting their home is low and there is nowhere else to go. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106531"></A>
The sensible option is resumption at market cost of a dwelling, with reasonable expenses and with right of judicial review. This recognises that this is housing that allows residential park management to manage their properties according to the expectations of the community. This is rightfully what they expect of a freehold property owner. There are plenty of examples of significant similar issues attached to these dwellings. If the department had truly committed itself to transparency, public submissions and consultation, most of these issues would be have been addressed. A one-sided approach tends to yield not just an imperfect result but often an unworkable one. </Hansard-Body>

As I said, I have some issues with regard to people who live in my electorate in Gaven, in particular the Riverside Home Park. Ninety-five per cent of those at the Riverside Home Park are pensioners. Although they do indeed pay for their own water and pay council rates, they are not able to claim the annual pensioners water rebate. That is because they lease the land on a perpetual lease rather than own it. Currently, under the government’s scheme, pensioners must be legally responsible for paying council rates. However, it seems unfair that these residents, who pay their own bills and who pay their fair and proportionate share of council rates, who own their own homes and who hold a pensioner concession card, are not entitled to the government’s rebate because they choose to live in a manufactured home park. Equally, currently these people are paying surcharges on their water charges, on top of what are soaring water bills. The situation is intolerable. </Hansard-Body>

When looking at the bill as the sum of all parts, the critical piece of legislation that is of most concern is the one that the minister is keen to assure homeowners of, and that is the issue of denial of the establishment of fixed-term site agreements between owners of residential home parks and homeowners. The minister highlighted the problems occurring in the absence of perpetuity agreements--those being denial of compensation if the park owner ‘decides to end the homeowner’s right to reside in the park because the park owner wishes to use their land for another purpose’ and it is against the policy intention of the legislation. What has resulted in practical terms is that, in the Gold Coast environment, manufactured home park owners will buy manufactured homes, which is occurring, and shut them up empty. Also, the park owners are spending very little in capital improvements on their properties. This is very disturbing. If the trends continue, homeowners will be living in near-dead zones with limited lawnmowing and the rubbish emptied, but beyond that not much will be spent on capital expenditure. I think the minister has consigned some people in manufactured home parks to live in empty communities, in derelict, bland blocks of decaying streets. These homeowners were wanting something different. They wanted some identity and they are sorely challenged. The perpetuity that all sought is the very thing that may kill the goose that laid the golden egg. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106536"></A>
The bill ensures that a record of new manufactured home parks needs to be kept. What the bill should do in view of the problem--which in part is created by the bill--is compile a complete list of homes in parks as well as what happens to them and that list needs to be published annually. With regard to those changes to the bill that relate to caravans, it is very complex. I accept what has been discussed here today with regard to the difficulties of determining that issue of caravans. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106537"></A>
In summary, I think the legislation will be a plus for existing residents and a net negative for future developments. This is a very poor result, on reflection, for many who are soon to retire or who are seeking housing or residential alternatives in these residential manufactured home parks. The bill reflects lopsided consultation with the manufactured home and park owners. The drive appears to be have been ideologically oriented. This bill is the mistaken path of reconciling what is the balance of all situations. </Hansard-Body>

Mr RYAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Morayfield--ALP) (6.26 pm): I rise to contribute to the debate on the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill. This bill seeks to amend the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2003. In the Morayfield state electorate there is one manufactured home park, the Burpengary Pine Village. I enjoy visiting the residents of the Burpengary Pine Village and I look forward to holding my annual Christmas barbecue with them next month. Along with Shirley and John, who are the managers of the Burpengary Pine Village, the residents of the Burpengary Pine Village are important members of our community and I am pleased that this bill will clarify and strengthen some aspects of the current law for their benefit. Although I note that there is always more to do when it comes to legislative reform, I am pleased that some improvement to the current law will flow from the amendments that are before the House today. Nonetheless, I encourage interested and enthusiastic people in my community to continue their push for further reform. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106543"></A>
The explanatory notes to the 2003 bill accurately characterise the motivations for not only the original legislation but also, in my view, the proposed amendments that are contained in the current bill before the House. It is important that I highlight one particular section from those explanatory notes. The explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1106545"></A>
An underlying problem is the basic tension between home owners and park owners largely caused by differing social and economic perspectives. Home owners are generally on low and/or fixed incomes. They have invested substantial amounts of money in purchasing homes, often for retirement purposes, and need security of tenure for the siting of the home in a residential park at a rent level commensurate with their capacity to pay. Many of these home owners have chosen this lifestyle to maintain their independence rather than seeking access to public housing. On the other hand, park owners have invested significant resources in both time and money in acquiring the land and developing their businesses. Different parks have different income and expenditure streams and park owners are not only seeking a return on their investment but also need to ensure the economic viability of their businesses. The Bill recognises these competing concerns and endeavours to provide certainty for both parties. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106546"></A>
It is important to emphasise those objectives of protecting vulnerable people, providing affordable accommodation alternatives to public housing and ensuring the economic viability of the business of the park owner. As such, any reform must be gradual and provide significant opportunities for adjustment for both homeowners and park owners. This bill attempts to strike the right balance between strong, effective laws to protect manufactured home owners and the need to encourage affordable housing alternatives in the residential parks industry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106547"></A>
I note that the main amendments in this bill include inserting a new main object of the act to protect homeowners from unfair practices and enable informed choices by making homeowners fully aware of their rights and responsibilities. This is an important amendment and will not only assist homeowners and park owners in their consideration of the legislative framework but also guide the courts in their interpretation of the act’s provisions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106548"></A>
Other amendments include placing new restrictions on the ability of park owners to seek increases in rent outside the terms of the site agreement, improving the presentation of site agreements and stipulating that agreements must be written in plain English, must not contain prohibited terms that unfairly disadvantage homeowners and must not include a fixed termination date. The amendments also include expanding the types of orders that the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal can make to assist homeowners facing termination of their site agreement, clarifying the definition of a manufactured home by specifically excluding converted caravans and introducing a grandfathering clause to protect homeowners of converted caravans as that term was defined by the Court of Appeal in the Monte Carlo Caravan Park case and allowing a record of residential parks to be established. These are fair and reasonable amendments that advance protection provisions for homeowners and clarify the current law. </Hansard-Body>

Mr RYAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As I was saying before the dinner break, the amendments contained in this bill are fair and reasonable amendments that advance protection provisions for homeowners and clarify the current law. It is important for me to note that I have met with the minister on a number of occasions to discuss concerns that have been raised with me by homeowners. The minister is fully aware of my enthusiastic advocacy and my interest in this reform process. I am grateful that the minister fairly and respectfully considered the concerns raised by me on behalf of homeowners. One of those concerns related to the need to clarify and strengthen the consumer protection provisions regarding the process for terminating site agreements. I would like to spend some time now considering how this bill addresses that particular concern. </Hansard-Body>

As honourable members are no doubt aware, the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act regulates a relatively unique property arrangement. The act applies when a person owns their manufactured home but rents the land it sits upon from a residential park owner. The fact that manufactured home owners often invest significant money when purchasing their homes, coupled with the fact that it can be difficult and costly to move a manufactured home to another location, means that the relationship between park owners and manufactured home owners needs appropriate specialised legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111179"></A>
The Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act contains a number of measures aimed at providing manufactured home owners with a high degree of stability in terms of their ongoing right to reside in a park under a site agreement. However, this must be balanced by the fact that in most cases residential park owners are private landowners and should be entitled to make reasonable lawful decisions about the use of their property. Under the current act, site agreements may only be terminated without the agreement of the homeowner by order of the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal upon application by a park owner. One of the grounds for terminating a site agreement is that the park owner wishes to use the land for another lawful purpose. If the tribunal makes an order terminating the site agreement because the park owner wishes to use the land for another purpose, the tribunal must also make an order requiring the park owner to pay compensation to the homeowner. Compensation orders are intended to cover the cost of relocating the manufactured home and the homeowner’s personal effects to another location. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111180"></A>
Notwithstanding that the current legislation makes these arrangements for compensation to be paid to homeowners, in some cases manufactured home owners have expressed concern that there are relatively limited numbers of alternative sites and parks to which the homeowner can relocate. In addition, it can be very stressful for a homeowner, particularly older and less mobile people, to have to relocate and leave their local social and service networks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111181"></A>
While the cases of homeowners having their site agreements terminated are relatively rare, the consequences for homeowners are very serious and very stressful. The bill seeks to build on the existing protections for homeowners by establishing supplementary orders that the tribunal may make if it decides that a site agreement will be terminated. Firstly, the tribunal will be able to consider ordering the park owner to offer the homeowner an alternative site in the park. Of course, this type of order will only be made with the consent of the affected homeowner and where an alternative site in the park is available. Secondly, the tribunal will be able to postpone the day the termination of a site agreement will take effect for up to one year if it is just and equitable to do so. In considering a postponed termination date, the tribunal will have regard to a range of social and economic factors including the homeowner’s personal and financial circumstances, the availability of alternative accommodation and the financial impact of a postponed termination on the park owner. The scope for postponed termination dates will take some pressure off homeowners whose site agreements are terminated by providing more time for the homeowner to make alternative housing arrangements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111182"></A>
The existing act and proposed additional measures contained in the bill provide homeowners with a high level of stability in their right to reside in a residential park. However, it is important that people considering purchasing a manufactured home understand that in certain limited circumstances their right to reside in a park may come to an end. For most people, choosing to purchase a manufactured home is a major financial and lifestyle decision. Accordingly, I urge all homeowners and all prospective homeowners to contact a lawyer or advocacy group like CAMRA or MHOA for advice if they have any questions about their site agreement. </Hansard-Body>

I would finally like to note the hard work of my friend and constituent Elaine Bastion. Elaine lives at the Burpengary Pine Village and has been a strong advocate for reform. She is passionate about consumer awareness and is an outstanding advocate for her fellow residents. Elaine has correctly identified, in my view, a need to improve consumer awareness about concessional GST and its application by park owners. I have spoken with the minister and departmental staff about this particular issue and I understand that they will give thorough consideration to this issue when the standard forms and information packs for homeowners are being reviewed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111187"></A>
Whilst I acknowledge that there is more to do in respect of reform of this industry, it is important to nonetheless appreciate the improvements to the current law contained in this bill. In noting those advancements to the current law, I also note the significant contributions made by community members, community groups, advocacy groups like CAMRA and MHOA, the minister, the department and individual members of parliament. A lot of people have put a lot of effort into this legislative reform and I feel it is important to note those contributions. I encourage those interested people to continue their advocacy and discussions about further future reform. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111188"></A>
This bill does improve the current law. It clarifies aspects of the current law and strengthens protections for owners of manufactured homes. Accordingly, I commend the bill to the House and I ask that all honourable members support it. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>
(Mr Wendt): Order! Before calling the honourable member for Whitsunday, I welcome to the gallery members of the South East Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, who are here as guests of the honourable members for Bulimba and Chatsworth. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms JARRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Whitsunday--ALP) (7.38 pm): I rise to support the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill 2010. There is a range of financial, social and lifestyle reasons that may decide a person to purchase and live in a manufactured home positioned in a residential park. Traditionally, manufactured homes have offered a comparably affordable housing option which has been attractive to people on lower incomes. The majority of manufactured home owners are older people, many of whom have limited disposable income and sometimes limited housing options. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115564"></A>
The Bligh government’s Positively Ageless--Queensland Seniors Strategy identifies the importance of providing information to older people and improving communication with seniors about the services that affect their lives. In addition to strengthening consumer protection for manufactured home owners, this bill proposes a practical framework to facilitate improved communication with manufactured home owners about their rights and responsibilities and the available organisations and services that can assist them resolve issues and concerns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115566"></A>
Currently, there is no formal record of parks offering sites for occupation by manufactured homes. In addition, national statistical information tends not to clearly distinguish between tourist caravan parks, mixed-use parks offering a combination of long-term and short-term sites and purpose-built manufactured home parks. As a result, data collated by the Office of Fair Trading regarding the number of residential parks offering sites for manufactured homes and the location of those parks can only ever be an estimate. The bill will enable the chief executive of the Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation to set up and maintain a formal record of residential parks which provide sites for the positioning of manufactured homes. This will assist in policy development by providing better information about trends in the sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115568"></A>
The record will also provide the department with better data for implementing more targeted communication and information strategies to help homeowners understand their rights and responsibilities and to access services. The record will consist of the name and address of residential parks as well as the number of manufactured homes in each park. Under the act, the park owners are required to maintain a notice board in the park’s common areas. Park owners must not unreasonably interfere with the right of a homeowner to read the notice board and must not prevent homeowners from placing material that is relevant to the park on the notice board. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115572"></A>
The bill will improve communication with manufactured home owners by allowing a regulation to be made prescribing types of information that a park owner must display on that notice board. This will complement the amendments establishing a record of residential parks and will provide more scope to ensure all manufactured home owners have access to important information about their rights and responsibilities and the advice and support services that are available to them in the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115573"></A>
I understand that the Office of Fair Trading provides a range of information and education materials for manufactured home owners on its website, and I certainly recommend that to those people who might require a little extra information. While Queensland seniors are increasingly sophisticated when it comes to online services, a simple notice board can still be a great way to provide people in a park with useful information, especially those who just do not have access to the internet or, indeed, choose not to access the internet. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115575"></A>
The amendments proposed in this bill aimed at providing manufactured home owners with better access to information are important. In many cases, dissatisfaction and disputes can arise when a park owner or homeowner does not understand their rights and responsibilities or where a party feels that they have no access to independent support and assistance. Issues and disputes between park owners and homeowners can often be avoided or resolved when parties communicate well and have access to quality, timely information and advice about their rights and obligations. There are no winners when intractable and ongoing disputes irreparably damage relationships between a park owner and homeowner and result in a hostile environment within a park. That is not an environment that anyone would wish to live in and it is certainly not conducive to a comfortable lifestyle. I, therefore, entirely support the intention of the bill to empower manufactured home owners and park owners with access to quality information about their rights and responsibilities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115579"></A>
Before concluding, I take the opportunity to acknowledge and thank the people and organisations that actually do step in to support manufactured home owners with that advice, assistance and advocacy. These include the Caravan and Manufactured Home Residents Association of Queensland, the Manufactured Home Owners Association, Legal Aid Queensland, the Caxton Legal Centre, the Townsville Community Legal Service and many other community legal centres throughout Queensland that advise and support manufactured home owners. I also compliment the minister, his staff and the department for bringing this bill to the House. It has been long awaited. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (7.44 pm): I rise tonight to make a short contribution to the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill 2010. The policy objectives of the bill are to strengthen fair trading requirements under the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2003 while maintaining a clear regulatory framework that encourages the continued growth and viability of the residential parks industry in Queensland. The residential parks industry provides housing and accommodation for a significant number of people, particularly in my electorate of Mudgeeraba. I have three residential parks in my area including Casino Village Caravan Park, River Gardens in Carrara and also the Advancetown Caravan Park. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115592"></A>
Previously, I have doorknocked residents in these parks and found that many of these residents living in manufactured homes are vulnerable members of the community due to their health, age or income. In actual fact, most of those residents whom I had the privilege of meeting face-to-face had never seen their local member of parliament. They took the opportunity to discuss many issues affecting their lives including lack of public transport, dental health issues and the rising cost of living, which probably affects them more acutely than most given that their income is relatively lower than people living in other areas in my electorate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115593"></A>
The bill aims to create a regulatory environment that effectively and fairly protects the interests of manufactured home owners, while also supporting the availability of affordable housing options through existing and new residential parks. Interestingly, two of my residential parks are actually on prime real estate with Nerang River frontages where their neighbours just up the road reside in very expensive waterfront properties. Obviously, their concerns and needs are very different from their neighbours who live only a stone’s throw away. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115595"></A>
In the lead-up to the 2009 election, the most recent redistribution would have seen these residents’ community of interest split under amendments to the Labor Party’s submission to the Electoral Commission of Queensland. The former member attempted to redistribute out the ‘presumed’ conservative voters up to Witt Avenue and have them moved into the electorate of Mermaid Beach. This left the ‘presumed’ Labor voters in the electorate as apparently even though they were on the same road frontage and same river frontage they had no community of interest with their neighbours. The Liberal Party submission of course had both being moved out either into Mermaid Beach or Gaven or both in. My preference was always to have them all in. This proved the correct submission given that there was an 18 per cent swing against the Labor Party in this area of Carrara, which also included the ‘presumed’ Labor voters in these residential parks. These residents were crying out for representation and voted accordingly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115596"></A>
Further to the proposed changes to the bill, a review was conducted to ensure that the changes to this act met community expectations and that its provisions remained appropriate. Manufactured homes are described as an affordable housing option. With increasing rates of homelessness and housing stress, housing affordability has supposedly been a priority for all levels of government. The review findings and recommendations were tabled in the Legislative Assembly on 15 May 2008 in the <Hansard-Italic>
Review of the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2003 Outcome Report</Hansard-Italic>
. The bill makes amendments to the act which address issues identified by manufactured home owners, residential park owners and consumer and industry advocates during the review process. The main objective of the act is to regulate and promote fair trading practices in the operation of these residential parks. The bill improves the operation of the act by providing increased clarity about the act’s main purpose. The changes below were deemed necessary for the following reasons: to protect homeowners from unfair business practices and to enable homeowners and prospective homeowners to make informed choices by being fully aware of their rights and responsibilities in their relationship with park owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115598"></A>
The bill, however, fails to change one of the most difficult parts of the act, which means that compensation takes the form of assumed cost of removal to another site. The failure of this clause is that there is now not one single relocation site in Queensland. A number of park owners are now building or importing homes onto available sites as this can be a more profitable business practice. This means homeowners are compensated for removal costs but have nowhere to move to, having to abandon their home and seek public housing. The compensation does not go far in these cases and the waiting list for public housing is only added to. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115599"></A>
The Liberal National Party will not be opposing the bill but continues to have reservations as the consultation undertaken by the government did not include consultation with groups such as the Manufactured Home Owners Association. This indicates that consultation was a very one-sided affair and their concerns were not taken into account in the final draft. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WENDT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich West--ALP) (7.50 pm): I rise to support the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill 2010. The residential park sector is evolving and the Queenslanders who chose to live in manufactured homes are increasingly diverse. However, the majority of people who live in manufactured homes are older members of the community and, unfortunately, many of those can be at risk of financial stress due to their fixed or limited incomes. As such, in my contribution to the debate I will focus on how this bill will address the concerns manufactured home owners have about site rent increases. In simple terms, the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act applies when a manufactured home owner rents a site for the positioning of their home from a residential park owner. In exchange for the right to occupy a site in the park and the ability to use communal areas and facilities within the park, manufactured home owners pay rent to the park owner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115640"></A>
Under the existing act, site agreements must state the site rent that a homeowner is required to pay. It must also state how and when that site rent may be varied. The act also allows a park owner to apply to the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal for an order authorising an increase in site rent outside the express terms of a site agreement. This is because under the act a site agreement is essentially perpetual in nature, that is, it may continue for years and potentially decades into the future, and may be assigned to a new homeowner when the current owner sells the manufactured home. I think that allowing park owners some flexibility to seek rent increases outside the terms of an agreement, subject to oversight by the tribunal, recognises that it can be difficult for park owners to anticipate changes in costs that may arise many years into the future and to design appropriate rent structures that will cover those costs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115641"></A>
As such, it is fair to say that many manufactured home owners are concerned about the current wide grounds upon which a park owner can seek an increase in rent outside the terms of an agreement. Some homeowners note that clauses in their site agreements state that rents will only increase by the CPI and, understandably, argue that it is unfair for the park owner to be able to seek further rent increases that the homeowner has not agreed to. I understand homeowners particularly object to rent increases based on a market review of rent when such a review is not included in the terms of their site agreement. As such, it is clear that park owners need to be able to recover their costs and have access to rent variation arrangements that appropriately and fairly reflect the perpetual nature of site agreements. On the other hand, it is also clear that the manufactured home owners should be able to rely on the terms of their site agreements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115642"></A>
With this in mind, the bill before the House proposes amendments to the act to better balance those sometimes competing interests. Specifically, the bill seeks to improve the operation of the act by significantly limiting the ground upon which a park owner may apply to the tribunal for an order allowing an increase in rent outside the express terms of the site agreement. Under these amendments, park owners will only be able to apply to the tribunal for an order allowing an increase in rent outside the terms of the site agreement where the increase is necessary to cover: significant increases in operational costs, including increases in rates, taxes or utility costs; unforeseen significant repair costs; or significant facility upgrades in relation to the park. The bill also specifically prevents park owners from seeking a site rent increase outside the terms of the site agreement if the increase is based on a market review of the site rent. It is hoped that these changes will provide homeowners with more certainty about how their rent may be increased in the future, but will also allow park owners to seek site rent increases in prescribed circumstances, which may prove critical to protecting the ongoing commercial viability of the park itself. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115643"></A>
However, it is important to understand that these changes do not prevent homeowners and park owners from agreeing to terms in a site agreement that provide for a periodic market review of rent. Nevertheless, homeowners will continue to have a right to apply to the tribunal if they consider a particular rent increase calculated under the site agreement is incorrect or excessive. In addition, the tribunal will continue to be able to have regard to a wide range of matters in deciding whether an increase in rent is fair and equitable in all of the circumstances of the case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115644"></A>
I also wish to note a transitional arrangement is included within the bill that allows park owners to include a market review clause in the site agreement that does not have a market review clause if and when the home is sold and the site agreement is assigned to the purchaser. The ability of a park owner to include a market review clause without the agreement of a seller or purchaser reflects the perpetual nature of site agreements, as well as broader industry trends. In the absence of such an arrangement it can be anticipated that over time a distinct gap would emerge between the rent paid by manufactured home owners with new agreements, which will likely include market review clauses, and those with older agreements that do not include such an arrangement. As one can see, that type of disparity between homeowners would not be conducive to harmony within the parks and I am sure would result in a feeling of unfairness between homeowners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115645"></A>
In addition to this, to limit the capacity of park owners to seek certain types of rent increases the bill expands the grounds upon which manufactured home owners may seek a reduction in site rent. Currently, manufactured home owners may apply to the tribunal for a reduction in rent if the amenity or standard of the residential park’s common areas and communal facilities has decreased substantially or a communal facility or service provided at the park has been withdrawn. The bill expands those grounds to enable homeowners to seek a reduction in rent where services, facilities or amenities that were proposed to be included in the park at the time the homeowner entered into the site agreement do not eventuate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115646"></A>
Interestingly, I also note that the bill establishes a new offence for park owners who threaten, intimidate or coerce homeowners to agree to site rent increase or to refrain from exercising their rights to apply to the tribunal for a review of a proposed site rent increase. I believe that is of great value. As one can imagine, the main object of the manufactured homes act is to regulate and promote fair trading practices in the operation of residential parks. As such, the amendments in the bill dealing with site rent are consistent with that important objective and I am sure will deliver significant protection for manufactured home owners. With this in mind, I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WETTENHALL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Barron River--ALP) (7.55 pm): I rise to support the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill. Queensland’s innovative approach to regulating this sector has resulted in significant diversity in the features of residential parks, as well as the people who choose to establish a home in a park. However, I am mindful that the majority of manufactured home owners continue to be older members of the community and, in many cases, have limited assets and incomes. This is evidenced by the demographic of respondents to the public survey conducted to inform the review of the act. As stated in the outcome report of the review, which was tabled in the House by the then Attorney-General, 80 per cent of respondents were over 65 years of age and about 26 per cent were over 75 years of age. However, we should not overlook the fact that younger people also choose to live in manufactured homes, because they can be more affordable than purchasing other types of housing. Those individuals and families may also be vulnerable to financial and housing stress, and deserve high standards of consumer protection. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115649"></A>
This bill provides the House with an opportunity to make significant changes to support manufactured home owners and to build on Queensland’s tradition of being a national leader in achieving a fair go for people who live in manufactured homes. The main object of the act is to regulate and promote fair trading practices in the operation of residential parks. This is achieved by declaring rights and responsibilities of homeowners and park owners; facilitating the disclosure of information to prospective homeowners; regulating the making, content, assignment and termination of site agreements; facilitating the participation of homeowners in the affairs of the park; and providing dispute resolution methods. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115650"></A>
The bill strengthens and focuses the consumer protection objects of the act by clearly articulating the need to protect manufactured home owners from unfair business practices and also to ensure that existing and prospective homeowners are able to make informed decisions by being fully aware of their rights and responsibilities in their relationship with the residential park owner. The bill also establishes a new offence for park owners who threaten, intimidate or coerce homeowners to either agree to an increase in rent or to refrain from exercising a right to seek a review of a proposed site increase. A maximum penalty of 200 penalty units may be applied to any park owner who engages in this type of conduct and, of course, that is a maximum penalty equal to $20,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120372"></A>
This new offence is not intended to stop park owners and homeowners from engaging in reasonable communication and negotiation. However, behaviour that would make an ordinary person feel compelled to comply with a park owner’s request or demands may amount to threatening, intimidating or coercive conduct. This conduct will be prohibited under the act, and that is a very good thing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120376"></A>
Under the bill, the current prohibitions on park owners engaging in fraudulent, misleading, harassing or unconscionable conduct in the operation of the park are to be expanded to apply to a park owner’s conduct while acting as a selling agent for a homeowner, because the act does allow manufactured home owners to engage their park owner as a selling agent for their home. So it is important to ensure that a park owner engaging in that type of conduct--fraudulent, misleading, harassing or unconscionable conduct--in the sale of a home can be prosecuted under the act. This amendment will achieve that end. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120379"></A>
There are important features of owning a manufactured home that people need to be aware of and understand. This point has been emphasised by other speakers. The first is that, while the act provides strong protection for homeowners, in some cases a site agreement can be terminated. A second critical point is that in some circumstances the act allows a park owner to apply to the tribunal for an order increasing site rent outside the express terms of a site agreement. The bill proposes to insert examples into the act to illustrate that fraudulent or misleading conduct can include a park owner who in advertising or precontractual negotiations indicates that the site rent will only ever increase in accordance with increases in the consumer price index or indicates that the site agreement can only be terminated by the homeowner. This clarification is important because, given the perpetual nature of site agreements, they can last many years or decades and will continue to exist even if the park is sold to a new park owner. As such, it is not appropriate for park owners to give absolute assurances about termination of site agreements or rent increases given that the act does allow for those agreements to be terminated and the rent increased in certain, albeit limited, circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120382"></A>
In closing, this bill does contain important amendments which will complement existing provisions of the manufactured homes legislation which are designed to ensure that manufactured home owners are treated reasonably and fairly in their relationship with residential park owners. For those reasons, I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind) (8.01 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill 2010. People choose to reside in a residential park, the subject of this proposed legislation, for a whole range of reasons. For some it may be as simple as that they cannot afford to obtain any other accommodation. Yet others choose to live in these parks because they spend a lot of time travelling around Australia and they like to have somewhere to call home. There are significant improvements proposed in this bill to better protect consumers. There is no doubt that under this bill there will be significant improvements to the legal protection of residents by way of a comparison to the Residential Tenancies and Rooming Accommodation Act 2008 that at the moment many residents would fall under. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120386"></A>
The most important point in my mind with this bill is the definition of a manufactured home. The minister’s explanatory notes state on page 2--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1120388"></A>
The Act defines a manufactured home as a structure that has the character of a dwelling house, is designed to be able to be moved from one position to another and is not permanently attached to land. Caravans, as defined by the <Hansard-Italic>
Residential Tenancies and Rooming Accommodation Act 2008</Hansard-Italic>
 ... and tents are specifically excluded from the statutory definition of a manufactured home. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120389"></A>
My question to the minister is: what is the case if in one of these residential parks the owners of the park actually build a house that for all intents and purposes looks just like a house in suburbia? It is not built out of bricks and mortar; it is built on steel stumps and is constructed there on site in the residential park. It is not built in a factory. It is not transported to the site. It is built on site. What happens if the owners build not just one, not just two, not just three, not just four, nor just five but perhaps 10 or a number of these dwellings? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120390"></A>
I am seeking clarification on whether this falls within the definition of what is intended under this bill. Is it transportable simply because, like most houses built on stumps, at some stage you could get a removalist to come in, pick it up and move it out? The roads through this village in question--and I will not mention the name--are so narrow that you would not be able to get a house removalist contractor into the village. The houses are built as close together as caravans would be sited and are as close as what some people refer to as manufactured homes, but in reality they were built on site by builders, carpenters and tradespeople who attended the site and built them there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120392"></A>
I understand that these dwellings--perhaps that is the most appropriate word--are listed at over $200,000. Significant dollars are required to be paid for these buildings. What I am seeking clarification on is: are these homes intended to be covered by this legislation? My concern is that, if perchance someone buys one of these new dwellings in the village--they are brand-spanking new; they have not been occupied--and then in the future a disagreement occurs, they cannot pick up the house and move it elsewhere. It is practically impossible. The traditional house removalist would not be able to get his prime mover and trailer into the village. You would have to get a massive chainsaw, cut the house into quarters, pull it apart and remove it. Quite frankly, that is not practical. That is not what would happen. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120393"></A>
I am seeking some clarification because I believe there is a problem with one of the residential parks. I have not studied the fine print. My comments here are intended to be generally reflective of what I understand is happening when I see these dwellings advertised for sale in a residential park. I know of them, and other residents in that park have certainly raised a range of issues with me. I thank the minister for trying to provide better protection for people who currently would be very vulnerable under the current Residential Tenancies and Rooming Accommodation Act 2008. This legislation is certainly a forward step. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120394"></A>
Before I resume my seat, I will touch on one issue that I have touched on before--that is, happy hours. People move into residential parks--most of them are elderly--and they have a happy hour. During the term of the previous government we discussed amendments to liquor-licensing laws in relation to retirement villages that had to get a licence and the process they had to go through. I understand that since the election the minister has introduced an exemption to those liquor-licensing requirements so that people who reside in retirement villages could have their happy hour. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120395"></A>
Minister, because you are a compassionate minister, would you consider giving a similar exemption to people who fall within the ambit of the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill? I believe it is worthy of consideration. I know that there are more important issues, but it is a matter that does affect the residents’ quality of life. All we are talking about is a happy hour--the consumption of a small amount of alcohol. We have no history of domestics or problems in our villages. It is not like a caravan park. When we discussed this some time ago, the advice from the department was, ‘We can’t provide a similar exemption for residential parks because effectively they are caravan parks.’ This is not like a caravan park; this is a very clearly defined category. I am putting it to the minister and to the government that I would like to see an exemption provided to residential parks for the elderly residents who reside there in the same way that an exemption was provided to retirement villages for the elderly residents who happen to be able to afford to reside there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120396"></A>
I thank the minister and his officers for forwarding the draft bills and the material to me many months ago. I went to a number of residential parks in my electorate and we had lengthy discussions about the issues. There is certainly a great deal of interest among many elderly people in residential parks. I ask whether the minister is able to clarify whether a dwelling which is built in a residential park is intended to be included. I see the minister nodding. </Hansard-Body>

Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (8.09 pm): I think it is fair to say that I and many of my constituents are in shock to find the parliament finally debating the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124939"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>

 You’ll get over it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124940"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr POWELL:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 To say it has been a long time coming would be an extraordinary understatement. To see it materialise at No. 2 on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 has left some of us shocked. But, as the minister said, we will recover. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124941"></A>
I have three manufactured homes or residential parks in the electorate of Glass House. There is the Palmwoods Caravan Park in my home town, the Sunstone Gardens in Maleny and the rapidly developing Twin Cedars Lifestyle Villas on Steve Irwin Way at Beerburrum. Back in August last year I raised the concerns of a number of residents from these parks. They were worried about how this bill was being prepared and how it was also being delayed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124947"></A>
It is my understanding that the original review of this act was undertaken by mid-2007 by the office of Fair Trading. The minister will recall there was considerable unease within the residential park community--a community acknowledged by his department to be some 15,000 strong and growing--that the original consultation had been poorly advertised and poorly responded to. Indeed, the first many homeowners knew about the review was when they found reference to it almost a year later on the office of Fair Trading website. Thankfully, the minister did respond positively to the subsequent petition that I sponsored calling on the government to undertake additional consultation. He did so with a series of forums throughout the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124950"></A>
I, like many of my constituents, made it along to the Maroochydore forum. It was great to see such a large turnout and a very robust discussion--I would even say it went as far as debate--with the office of Fair Trading staff around the proposed amendments. It is good to see many of the contributions by residents have been considered and are reflected in this amendment bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124952"></A>
When initially approached by constituents some of the issues they felt needed attention included: key definitions including of ‘manufactured homes’ and of ‘park owners’; clarification of rental charges and contractual or site agreements--there were expectations from both parties in that regard; the licensing of park owners who also operate as real estate agents in the marketing and selling of vacant homes; and, obviously, dispute resolution. As I said, some of these issues have been addressed in this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124953"></A>
The bill does clarify the definition specifically where it relates to converted caravans. As identified in the explanatory notes, the original definitions led to a range of court cases--namely, Monte Carlo Caravan Park Pty Ltd v Curyer in 2006 and Tamahori v Roofley Pty Ltd in 2009--that delivered conflicted outcomes. This bill addresses that conflict by excluding converted caravans from the broader definition of a manufactured home. However, it does offer flexibility by allowing converted caravan owners and park owners to agree to enter into a site agreement under the act should they so choose. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124956"></A>
I would like to pick up on some of the comments made by my colleague the member for Nicklin. This clarification still falls short of the expectations of some when it comes to defining manufactured homes. I am aware that some have called for the removal of ‘relocatable’ and even ‘manufactured’ from the definition; the former because, as the member for Nicklin rightly pointed out, many of these homes are increasingly becoming permanent fixtures and the later, ‘manufactured’, because of the many negative perceptions that go along with the title of a manufactured home park. The bill does acknowledge this in passing by referring to the preferred term of many and that is ‘residential parks’. If the minister, in responding to the member for Nicklin’s concerns, could address those issues it would be much appreciated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124957"></A>
Residents and park owners alike have raised concerns around site agreement. I note the bill addresses many of these concerns in detail. Firstly, it will improve the presentation of site agreements by including a new requirement that they be expressed in plain language. It gives authority to the tribunal to consider whether special terms in site agreements contain: excessively long sentences, clauses or paragraphs; unnecessary use of technical terms, jargon or language other than plain English; extensive cross-referencing; failure to define key terms; excessive definition of terms, particularly in relation to commonly used words; important terms buried in fine prints or schedules--I think that is important to note; a lot of the homeowners in particular do not have legal backgrounds and when those kinds of clauses are deeply buried within a site agreement it can lead to conflict and trips to the tribunal later; and terms that place the homeowner at an unfair disadvantage because he or she is not clear about their meaning, even if the meaning could be determined by a legal practitioner. I guess that takes that last comment a little bit further. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124958"></A>
The act will also allow special terms negotiated between park owners and homeowners to be included in a site agreement. The bill also deals with the issue of fixed term site agreements. It provides homeowners with a higher level of certainty by clarifying that a site agreement may only be terminated in accordance with the act. Permissible terminations will be notice of the homeowner, by agreement between the homeowner and the park owner or by order of the tribunal upon application by the park owner on certain particular grounds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124959"></A>
The bill does not, as many hoped, prescribe a specific formula for calculating the site rent payable by manufactured home owners. It does however provide a number of methods by which site rent may be increased or reduced. It does contain amendments designed to improve fair trading practices with respect to variations in site rent. This will come as some comfort to park owners and homeowners alike and it will give greater direction and clarity to the tribunal. I only wish that it had come into effect sooner. At least one of the residential parks I mentioned before in the electorate of Glass House is currently before the tribunal on this specific matter. Had this legislation been in place their going to the tribunal may not have been necessary. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124960"></A>
It is also good to see acknowledgement in the amended act of the role of homeowner committees. I will refer briefly to the explanatory notes. The act allows homeowners in a residential park to establish by election among themselves a homeowners committee. The function of the homeowners committee is to deal with the park owner on behalf of homeowners regarding the day-to-day running of the park and any complaints or proposals raised by the homeowners. The act also imposes a formal obligation on park owners to respond to complaints raised by the homeowners committee. I think all of those are very good additions to the act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124961"></A>
Unfortunately, we could get situations where conflicting homeowner committees are set up within the one park because of disagreements among the homeowners. That is not desirable. Hopefully, as we continue to progress this legislation, we may find ways in which we can address that as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124962"></A>
The bill seeks to set up a public register or record of residential parks. That is good news. I remember putting in a question on notice last year asking the minister for a list of the parks. The office of Fair Trading was not in a position to provide that. Now that this public register will exist it will go a long way to addressing some of the concerns the shadow minister raised in his speech, particularly the inability of homeowners to join together to get a better sense of where they stand as a lobby group on matters such as this. If they have a better understanding of who else is in the same boat as them it may make them more able to have a consistent voice when talking to government and talking to park owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124964"></A>
I do acknowledge that the compensation issue has been addressed in part. The member for Morayfield spoke at length on this. I did meet a constituent not of Glass House but of Maroochydore because I wanted to get my head around this. While this is not currently an issue in the parks in Glass House, it is certainly occurring on the coast. That is where a park is being closed and there is literally nowhere else for a relocatable home to go. The individual in question has literally rung every park that he could find between Tweed Heads and Gladstone. He has been told that either there is no space or that because of certain covenants that exist within those residential parks he is unable to relocate his home in any of those parks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124965"></A>
Whilst this bill does give that added one year extension clause and it also gives the tribunal the opportunity to order an owner to reposition a home in a park, that is not always possible. There are going to be circumstances where people, such as this gentleman, simply cannot relocate their home. He cannot relocate his home anywhere south of Gladstone. If the minister is able to address how that might be remedied either in this bill or in subsequent amendments that would be appreciated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129649"></A>
I want to raise one other concern of homeowners that I do not believe is addressed in this amendment bill--that is, the licensing of park owners who also operate as real estate agents. It is not happening in all cases, but residents are saying that in some instances when they try to sell their home it is being talked down by the park owner. They are unable to sell it and the park owner eventually steps in and takes over wanting to sell it on behalf of the homeowner. It is a very grey area where a park owner is also operating as a real estate agent. I would be very keen to hear the justification for not addressing this matter in the minister’s summation at the end of the debate and perhaps we might see that addressed in future amendments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129652"></A>
The shadow minister pointed out the comments of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee, particularly whether the bill has sufficient regard to the rights and liberties of owners of converted caravans and of park owners. The committee has received considerable community correspondence on this matter, many of which have been forwarded on to the minister, which highlights the conflictual nature of residing in these residential parks. At the end of the day the park owners are operating a business--there is no denying that--but the homeowners are also endeavouring to live a quieter and more affordable lifestyle. When those two paradigms meet, there will obviously be disputes. This legislation will clarify the responsibilities of park owners, homeowners and the tribunal, but I cannot help but agree with the shadow minister that we may be back amending this legislation again in the not-too-distant future. It is unfortunate given the length of time that has been spent on consultation with the various parties that we may have to do that again. In conclusion, I thank the many homeowners who have taken the time to discuss this legislation with me. It has been educational for me and also frustrating because I do not think that we have successfully addressed all of their issues. Similarly, I thank the park owners whom I have spoken to for their perspective and expertise. I again feel we have reached probably what can only best be described as an unhappy compromise. I hope that the implementation of this bill will help us as legislators to further refine this challenging legislative matter. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr MOORHEAD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Waterford--ALP) (8.21 pm): I rise to support the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill 2010. This is great legislation. This is legislation from the Queensland government that is protecting Queensland seniors who have chosen to take up the option of more affordable, more secure and a socially inclusive environment that comes from living in manufactured home parks. Importantly, this bill recognises a fundamental change in the manufactured homes sector. As many speakers have said, this sector traditionally arose from caravan parks and small movable dwellings and very modest homes whereas now many of the homes in my electorate are virtually indistinguishable from residential dwellings. This sector has gone from small movable dwellings on stumps to buildings of a steel construction on a concrete slab which are virtually indistinguishable from houses in the average residential street. This means that the question of relocatability is becoming more difficult but probably less relevant.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129662"></A>
While the homeowner owns the home and the park owner owns the land, the likelihood of homes ever having to move is decreasing. Essentially, the costs of relocation of these homes and the connection that homeowners have with fellow residents means that homeowners do not have a reasonable choice to move on if they are treated unfairly. This means that homeowners do not have bargaining power in their relationship with the park owner. The legislation before the House protects homeowners by two key means--by ensuring that site agreements do not expire and allowing for disputes to be determined by the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal. Through this legislation the parliament has intervened in the contractual relationship to protect homeowners from exploitation and, in place of contractual negotiations, has empowered an independent tribunal. This is great Labor legislation. It protects people from unfair treatment in the most important thing in their life and, in most cases, their greatest investment--their home.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129669"></A>
This legislation is also very important to my electorate. My electorate is home to River Glen, Regal Waters and three Palm Lake retirement communities--communities that come under this act--providing homes to more than 1,500 people in the Waterford area. The consultation process that was undertaken this year was very well attended by local residents in my electorate for whom these changes are vitally important, and I wanted to acknowledge the member for Mermaid Beach in his recognition of this great consultation. I think he might have to share with the member for Mudgeeraba his appreciation of that great consultation, because she did not seem to get the message and was quite critical of a process which was recognised by most parties as being quite extensive, particularly in providing a copy of the draft legislation for residents to go through line by line, as many of them did.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129673"></A>
This bill makes it clear that the main objective of the act is the protection of homeowners in these residential parks. This is obviously so important in providing guidance to the tribunal about how the act should be applied and interpreted. Many residents are quite timid in bringing matters to the tribunal and feel that the tribunal is not a place where they can resolve their disputes, but by ensuring that this objective is located in the act we are sending a clear message to the tribunal that the purpose of this legislation is to protect homeowners. The bill also introduces a range of other protections. The bill requires site agreements to be clearly expressed in plain language. This gives homeowners a greater opportunity to understand what they are signing when they move into these parks and enforce what rights they have under their agreement. The bill also provides the opportunity to provide regulations that list terms that are prohibited for inclusion in site agreements. This means that terms that are identified as unfair or exploitative can be declared to be of no effect.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129677"></A>
The most important amendment though--and the amendment that is most keenly awaited by homeowners--is the changes to section 71 that take away the ability of park owners to seek market review site rent increases. The ability for park owners to seek market rent increases outside of the terms of the agreement has been of great concern to homeowners. Many homeowners are on fixed incomes and are greatly concerned by the potential for market rent review of their site rent agreements. This amendment gives homeowners greater certainty, knowing that agreements that can run for decades will not be subject to these market rent reviews unless provided specifically in the agreement. There is still an opportunity for park owners to seek increases for significant escalating operational costs, unforeseen repair costs and significant facility upgrades.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129682"></A>
While the government has intervened in these contractual relations to ensure that park owners do not have the power to force site rents up, the legislation does ensure that park owners are able to ensure their ongoing viability and continued investment in these parks. I know that some residents would like us to go further and prevent any increases whatsoever. This legislation has to get the balance right between park owners and homeowners. I also note that homeowners will still have the ability to have a downwards market rent review, something which this legislation has denied park owners. I understand that many homeowners have not had a pleasant experience in hearings before the tribunal. Often what is designed to be quite a simplistic process has ended up being overly complex and legalistic. I do think that the government needs to have another look at the advocacy arrangements in this sector to ensure that tenants do have access to legal or other advocacy for tribunal proceedings.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129689"></A>
I particularly want to thank John King, Ron Longmuir and Jean Campbell for their participation in the consultation on this bill and their lobbying and advice on these issues. I have been able to take their views and expertise to the minister in the drafting of this bill and the consideration of amendments from the draft bill. The bill also provides two other key amendments to protect homeowners from some very sharp practices that have occurred. Park owners will not be able to ask homeowners entering the park to sign an undated termination notice. This essentially has given the park owner an opportunity to renegotiate prices and rent increases for residents who are trapped in a manufactured home park investment. The legislation will also adjust requirements regarding charges for separately metered utilities to ensure that park owners do not charge homeowners more than the cost of providing the service. For example, some park owners have their own electricity infrastructure within the park and have an on-sale agreement to the residents.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129692"></A>
This amendment will ensure that homeowners are not being gouged in those arrangements, particularly when they have no choice of retailer in electricity. When the general market has an opportunity to choose who it is they seek to get their electricity from, sometimes these park owners do not and it is important that there is some protection for homeowners in that situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129693"></A>
This bill provides a fair go for residents of manufactured home parks but it also ensures that park owners can invest to provide more seniors with the great way of life that can come with more affordable, secure and senior appropriate housing, and that is the type of housing that is provided in manufactured home parks. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs MILLER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bundamba--ALP) (8.30 pm): I have two manufactured home parks in my area, Brisbane River Terraces and the Palm Lake Resort at Redbank. I rise to speak in support of this Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill 2010, but there are some issues that the residents of these parks have asked me to bring forward to the parliament tonight. At both of the parks in my electorate there are issues in relation to the different types of agreements. For example, I am aware that some of the residents have agreements that are different and some pay different rents, which causes difficulties among residents. I am also concerned about the deaths of some residents, the potential sale of their homes and the burden that that places on their families. For example, some families find it difficult to sell these homes and in the meantime they have to keep paying the rent and maintain the home, even though there is no use of water nor is there any power use. I am also aware that the burden on these families can go on for years, not months, creating a huge burden for them. In fact, over $120 a week rent can cause severe financial stress for the surviving relatives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134509"></A>
I am also very concerned about some of the Palm Lake Resort agreements. I am aware that some residents have agreements that protect them from mining subsidence. In other words, the owners are responsible for the rectification of the homes. However, the newer tenants do not have that clause in their agreements. So again, some residents have subsidence protection but most others do not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134510"></A>
I would like to talk in detail about the situation at Brisbane River Terraces. I have had a number of meetings with the residents there and I am very grateful that the minister took time out from his very busy schedule to visit the Brisbane River Terraces. We had a great morning tea that day. The concerns that the residents of Brisbane River Terraces have are very real. They do not mind paying the rent--I think it is well over $120 a week--but they say that they are not getting the service for the rent that they pay. For example, they tell me that the garden maintenance is done very unprofessionally in their manufactured home complex. The management tends to employ elderly residents of the village to do that job. The residents are concerned about the safety of these elderly people who are employed to do that job. </Hansard-Body>

The residents are also very concerned about the lighting around the village. They tell me that the lighting is next to none and for elderly people that is dangerous. They do not tend to go out walking at night and they do not go to the clubhouse at night because they cannot see where they are going. I am also extremely concerned, because the residents have advised me that three residents have fallen on the very badly maintained roads in the village and that one resident had to be hospitalised for eight weeks after a fall on one of the roads in the village. I am very concerned about that, because elderly people in these villages should be able to walk comfortably on the roads outside their homes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134512"></A>
I am also advised that the deck on the clubhouse has been a complete mess for over eight months. The residents are saying that little effort has been made by the owners or the management to replace the whole deck. The deck has been a danger for residents for some time and some urgently needed maintenance needs to be carried out on the deck or the deck should be ripped up completely and replaced. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134513"></A>
I know that other MPs have spoken about the sales of manufactured homes in their areas. I am advised that at Brisbane River Terraces one elderly gentleman had to move out of his home into a nursing home, that his home has been up for sale for more than two years and that there has been little effort from management to sell his home. I am advised that his family has been paying the rent on that home for two years--that is the fee in this particular manufactured home park--but the family has also been paying this gentleman’s nursing home fees. That is a double whammy for this family. I do not know how long they are going to be able to keep that up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134514"></A>
The residents also tell me that the village bus is used for collecting garbage as well as transporting residents for shopping. That must a health and safety issue. I am advised that the bus is also badly in need of repair. It is questionable whether the bus is safe to use to transport elderly people. I can only agree with them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134515"></A>
What I am trying to say is that the residents do not mind paying the rent--they are quite happy to pay the rent--but they want service for the rent that they are paying. The people who live at Brisbane River Terraces are really good people. They are the salt of the earth. I do not think it is very hard for the owners or the management to fix up some of these issues that they are talking about. The minister has been out to Brisbane River Terraces. He has seen it for himself. I think the residents there deserve to be looked after better.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134516"></A>
In conclusion, I would like to say that we really need to protect these older people. They are good, honest, decent people. Many of them have worked all of their lives. They have been involved in their local communities and they deserve a safe, decent retirement in their homes. I am very proud that the residents of the Palm Lake Resort and Brisbane River Terraces look out for each other. If there are residents there who are sick, other residents help out. If the residents need to get to a hospital, they help each other. If residents need to have meals cooked for them, they tend to help each other and cook for each other. In times of grief, they all grieve--everyone is sad. But I believe that the residents of Brisbane River Terraces in particular deserve better. I would like to hope that these issues will be fixed and Brisbane River Terraces will become a happier place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134517"></A>
As I said, in my view all the residents are absolutely wonderful people. I am proud to say that, since these manufactured home parks have been part of the community in the Bundamba electorate, I have formed very strong friendships with many of the people who live in these parks. They are more than constituents to me--they are my friends--and I believe that it is my duty, as the state member for Bundamba, to raise these issues in the House on behalf of these older folk so that some resolution can be made for them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134518"></A>
I hope that that can be done by putting some pressure on the owners and the managers of these particular parks. I hope that in the future the owners of these parks take these issues seriously. How would they feel if they had elderly members of their family falling over on roads and ending up in hospital for eight weeks? Would they put their mum and dad into these sorts of situations? How would they feel if the deck was falling down around them and they had to say to their mum and dad, ‘Don’t go and socialise at the clubhouse because you might fall through the floor of the deck’? How would they feel about that? I think it really is not very good in terms of the maintenance of some of these places. This situation would occur not just in my electorate; it would occur in other electorates throughout the state. I think the owners and the management of these parks should get their act together and look after these older folk, because they really deserve better. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134519"></A>
I thank the minister for coming to my electorate. I thank him for coming to Brisbane River Terraces. Hopefully, he might like to come back to Palm Lake Resort at Redbank--</Hansard-Body>

I thank the minister for bringing this legislation into the House. If we can all work together and make life a better place for our older people, that would be very well done. This is very good legislation that has been brought into House. I commend the bill. </Hansard-Body>

 (Broadwater--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(8.40 pm): I rise to speak to the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill 2010. The Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2003 is a very important piece of consumer legislation here in Queensland. One of the central features of the act is that it establishes a requirement for park owners and homeowners to enter into a written site agreement. Essentially a site agreement under the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act is an agreement between a park owner and a homeowner that provides for the rental of land on which the manufactured home is positioned. It also provides for the homeowner’s non-exclusive use of common areas and communal facilities within the park. Written site agreements are important because they help homeowners and park owners have a common understanding of their rights and responsibilities. Written site agreements also assist the parties in avoiding and resolving disputes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139448"></A>
The act currently includes a range of important requirements regarding the presentation and content of these site agreements. In my electorate of Broadwater there are quite a number of manufactured home villages and parks and a number of caravan parks that provide sites for manufactured home residents. These include Paradise Lakes Resort, Emerald Gardens, Hammond Village, Harbourside Gardens, Settlers Village and Pine Ridge Caravan Park. In the lead up to this bill being drafted I arranged for the department to hold a consultation workshop at the Runaway Bay Community Hall. I know that many residents took the opportunity to attend. Whilst the issues discussed were often very complicated, I commend the residents for taking an interest and participating in the consultation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139449"></A>
From meetings with resident group representatives and manufactured home owners on a number of occasions during the review of the act and since the introduction of the bill I know that the security of their investment and the ability to live in their home without fear of their agreements or circumstances changing is particularly important for owners. Since the introduction of the bill and during the review, along with my colleagues the member for Murrumba, the member for Burleigh, the member for Waterford and the member for Morayfield, I have taken the opportunity to talk with the minister about the concerns that residents have raised with us and we have had some opportunities to talk to the department and senior policy advisers. I would like to thank the minister for those opportunities to talk with him directly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139450"></A>
One of the fundamental policies underpinning the act is to provide a high degree of security and certainty in a homeowner’s right to reside in a residential park. I understand that unlike many types of leases, site agreements under the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act are not intended to be for a fixed term. They are essentially perpetual in nature. A homeowner’s interest under the site agreement can be assigned by the current owner to another person who has agreed to purchase the manufactured home. The act provides homeowners with a specific right to sell their home on-site and it also prohibits park owners from interfering with the sale of a home and from unreasonably refusing to consent to a proposed assignment of a site agreement.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139451"></A>
Under the act, a site agreement between a park owner and a manufactured home owner can only be terminated in one of three ways: by notice of the homeowner; by mutual agreement of the homeowner and the park owner; or by order of the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal upon application by a park owner.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139452"></A>
This third option has been raised with me by my residents as of particular concern. They are concerned about how long manufactured park owners will actually have the use of that land for the purposes of residential manufactured homes. I have talked to the minister about my concern that, whilst the tribunal must order the park owner to pay compensation to the homeowner, if the park owner puts in an application to use the land for another lawful purpose, what impact would this have on residents? I am concerned about them finding a comparable location to the park that they are currently living in and them having to move and find a location. I have also raised with the minister my concern about the impact that this would have on affordable housing for Queenslanders and particularly senior residents. I ask that the minister in his summary provide to the House what the government is doing to address this particular issue. As we have heard tonight, many members have acknowledged that a lot of the people living in these manufactured home parks are senior residents who invest quite a lot of money in the purchase of their manufactured home and then they are paying rent on top of that. We acknowledge that they are vulnerable members of the community. Whilst they may have downsized from a previous home, many of them are using manufactured home parks as affordable alternative accommodation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139453"></A>
I understand that a review of the act identified that some park owners are attempting to establish fixed-term agreements which is contrary to the policy intention of this act. These park owners attempt to establish fixed-term agreements by including an end date in the special terms of the site agreement or by convincing prospective homeowners to enter into mutual termination agreements with the park owner before or at the time the actual site agreement is entered into. In addition to being contrary to the intended operation of the act, this practice also places homeowners at significant risk of not being eligible for compensation under the act if the park owner decides not to renew the homeowner’s site agreement. I believe that this is a serious risk for homeowners given that the cost of moving a manufactured home can be in the vicinity of $20,000, depending on the characteristics of the manufactured home.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139454"></A>
We have had many people comment tonight on the definition of a manufactured home. Under the act, where there is provision that the manufactured home owner move their home, it can cost up to $20,000. Under a fixed-term arrangement many residents would be forfeiting this right. Unfortunately, there can be an imbalance in the bargaining positions of park owners and homeowners, because prospective homeowners are unlikely to be as aware of the operation of this legislation as park owners. I understand that some homeowners who have entered into this type of arrangement report that they felt that they had no choice about the termination agreement and if they did not sign it then they would not be offered a site in the park at all. Other homeowners report that the relevant park owner verbally assured them that they would be offered a new site agreement at the end of their existing site agreement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139455"></A>
The bill will address this issue by specifically prohibiting termination clauses and agreements that are entered into before or on the same day as the site agreement. The bill operates retrospectively by making these types of clauses and termination agreements void even if they were entered into prior to the commencement of the amendments. The bill will not stop park owners and homeowners from freely entering into genuine mutual termination agreements during the life of the site agreement. However, it will prevent the unintended use of mutual termination agreements and special terms by some park owners who seek to establish fixed-term agreements, thereby avoiding that compensation for homeowners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139456"></A>
I believe these amendments are consistent with the original intention of the act and will make sure that some manufactured home owners are not disadvantaged compared to others when it comes to their rights about termination of their site agreements and potential compensation payments. The review also highlighted opportunities to improve the rules regarding site agreements. Whilst the act currently requires site agreements to be written in a clear and precise way, the review of the act also highlighted that some site agreements are particularly excessively complex and legalistic in language and this makes it very difficult for manufactured home owners to fully understand the meaning of various terms of their site agreement and can result in disputes about the interpretation of that agreement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144207"></A>
This bill proposes an amendment to require site agreements to be clearly expressed in plain language. This will give manufactured home owners a better chance of properly understanding their site agreement and making informed choices. The Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal will have jurisdiction to consider applications from homeowners who consider that a term of their agreement is not in plain language. If the tribunal finds that a term of agreement is not clearly expressed in plain language, the tribunal will have power to make orders varying the term and prohibiting the park owner from using the same term in another site agreement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144210"></A>
The explanatory notes to this bill obviously contain guidance on the types of factors that can be considered in assessing whether or not the terms of a site agreement are clearly expressed in plain language. Some of the examples given are that the site agreements could have used excessively long sentences, clauses or paragraphs; extensive cross-referencing; failure to define key terms; important terms being buried in fine print or schedules; and terms that place a homeowner at a particularly unfair disadvantage because he or she is not clear about the meaning even if the meaning could be determined by a professional legal practitioner. I think this is a very good inclusion in the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144211"></A>
This amendment is intended to empower homeowners by giving them the best possible chance to understand their site agreement, both before entering into the agreement and during the life of the agreement. The amendment is also complementary with the change to the objectives of the act which highlight the need to enable homeowners and prospective homeowners to make informed choices by being fully aware of their rights and responsibilities in their relationship with park owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144212"></A>
In addition to improving the presentation of site agreements, this bill also aims to address particular issues that have arisen concerning the content of site agreements and in particular the inclusion of some special terms in site agreements. While the act requires site agreements to contain particular information, it also gives park owners and homeowners flexibility to agree to special terms in their site agreements. This is intended to enable park owners and homeowners to tailor their site agreement by including particular terms that suit the individual circumstances of both parties and the park. However, the review also highlighted that in some cases special terms are being included in site agreements that unfairly disadvantage the homeowner and which are not reasonably necessary for the protection of the park owner’s legitimate commercial interests. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144213"></A>
This bill addresses this issue by providing the power for specified special terms or park rules to be prohibited by regulation. Park owners and homeowners will continue to have the flexibility to agree on special terms in site agreements--and these could include a resident wanting to keep a pet or to do some gardening and how that would be done--and to adopt park rules that suit both the parties’ and the park’s individual circumstances except where the special terms or park rule have been prohibited. I understand that these will be considered in regulation. They may include some examples from New South Wales legislation such as issues relating to the use of tradespeople in manufactured homes. A lot of manufactured home residents have raised with me their concern that they wanted to use a particular tradesperson but their manufactured park owner insisted on a particular tradesperson. Many residents feel that that is a little unfair; they would like to engage their own tradespeople to address issues around their own home. Enabling unfair special terms and park rules to be prohibited by regulation will provide significant protection to park owners including those homeowners who already have site agreements as the bill will retrospectively void prohibited special terms and park rules. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144214"></A>
The bill proposes new offences for park owners who include a special term in a site agreement or make a park rule that has been prohibited by the regulation. The bill also provides homeowners with the right to apply to the tribunal to decide whether all or part of a special term in their site agreement constitutes a prohibited special term. I understand that the proposed regulation will be developed in consultation with manufactured home owners and park owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144215"></A>
I would also like to make some observations regarding the provisions of the bill that deal with utility charges being passed on from park owners to homeowners. The Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act includes rules about charges of utility services such as electricity, water, gas and sewerage. The application of these rules depends on whether the homeowner’s use of the utility service is separately measured and billed. I know that the way in which the manufactured homes in my electorate are set up is very different. This particularly addresses many of those concerns in my electorate. I understand that in some cases park owners are charging homeowners more for utilities than the amount the park owner is being charged by the supply authority. The amendments contained in the bill will stop these park owners from profiting from utility bills by making it clear that park owners must not charge homeowners more than the actual costs of providing the quantity of the utility supplied to the homeowner where the homeowner’s use of the utility service is separately measured and charged to the homeowner. This amendment means that all residents in the park who receive separate utility bills, including those in caravans, will be treated equally with regard to the payment of utilities used as the amendments are consistent with the requirements under the Residential Tenancies and Rooming Accommodation Act 2008. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144216"></A>
Many residents have raised with me that they think their rent can only increase by CPI and that in recent years park owners have sought to increase rent based on market review. Residents have told me that they think this is unfair, particularly when market review is not included in the terms of their site agreement. I ask the minister to address these concerns in his summary and clarify how the bill will address the residents’ concerns particularly when, as I have mentioned, the majority of manufactured home owners are on fixed incomes and have invested significantly in the purchase of their manufactured home. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144217"></A>
In closing, I say that I appreciate very much the efforts undertaken to improve consumer protection for manufactured home owners through the changes proposed in the bill. However, I still have ongoing concerns in relation to the relocation compensation of manufactured home owners and, in particular, the market review. I trust that the department will continue to monitor the effects of these issues on residents as a priority moving forward. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Ms DARLING</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Sandgate--ALP) (8.57 pm): I rise to make a brief contribution to this debate mainly because my government colleagues have already covered all of the main reasons that we need these important reforms. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144220"></A>
There are three parks in the electorate of Sandgate that have manufactured homes on-site. One at Brighton has only a handful of homeowners as most of the people there are renting homes or are in caravans, another in Fitzgibbon has all manufactured home owners and the third in Taigum has a combination of homeowners and renters, with plans for further development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144221"></A>
I welcome the improved protection measures in this bill, but I also call on park owners to do the right thing by their homeowners and respect their rights, including the right to live a life full of family and friendship without constant pressures to comply with unreasonable park edicts. These parks are homes to many people on low incomes. Although they do not own the land on which their homes sit, they do own their homes and they deserve to be treated just as honestly and respectfully as any homeowner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144222"></A>
The problem in some parks around the state is that park managers can too easily bully homeowners because of their ability to set park rules. These are home parks, not detention centres. I have seen in my own area how well a park can function when the lines of communication are open. So my message to park owners is this: people do not want to lodge complaints, they do not want to call in the Office of Fair Trading and they do not want to pursue redress in the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal; they just want to live a happy life in the home they have purchased. So please treat them with the respect they deserve. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144223"></A>
I commend the strengthened consumer provisions, especially the amendments that provide further protection for homeowners where a park owner wishes to use their land for another purpose. There are limited options but enormous costs for homeowners who need to relocate their homes when a park owner seeks to terminate a site agreement. It is important that the tribunal can consider the social and economic impacts of a termination. I thank the department, the minister and his trusty advisers for the extensive consultation on these reforms. I thank many of my constituents for their very detailed and frank feedback. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr McLINDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Beaudesert--TQP) (8.59 pm): I rise to contribute to the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill 2010 and to support the introduction of this legislation. Given the significant and increasing pressures in housing affordability, it is timely that the manufactured homes act be reviewed and amended accordingly to make it applicable in just terms and conditions to all parties involved. The main objective of the bill is to promote fair trading practices in the day-to-day operations of the residential parks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153661"></A>
Whilst there is a belief that there will be an increase in residential parks living due to the unprecedented cost of living and housing affordability, we must also be aware that the location and relocation of future parks will most likely occur in areas with less infrastructure due to land valuation and accessibility. I must say at the outset that for legislative purposes we refer to these homes as manufactured homes, which can be quite offensive to some people. I discovered this at a community forum a few years ago, when I was told that it was considered disrespectful to refer to somebody’s home in that manner. Whilst it has quite an impersonal reference, we must put the terminology used within this bill into that perspective.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153662"></A>
I recall from my tenure on the Logan City Council, working in conjunction with the member for Springwood, the impending relocation of Springtime Gardens, which was located in an ideal position in Springwood. Currently, Springwood faces the realities of growth in the area, which puts added pressure on the tenants in terms of where they could relocate to and, in some cases, how they would move as for some the cost of relocating a manufactured home was financially impossible. One single mother was distraught because she was still paying off her home and could not afford to relocate it. In addition, a relocation would create further financial hardship due to the lack of accessibility to essential services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153664"></A>
Having doorknocked throughout many residential parks over the years, I am sure many Queenslanders will be appreciative of this legislation, which will give them necessary protections. I note there has been confusion as to the status of what is deemed a manufactured home due to the many and varied alterations which, over time, can be made to caravans. The amendments contained in this bill will give a specific regulatory framework that will give greater certainty to the definition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153665"></A>
The fixed term site agreements will give far greater peace of mind to those who, in many cases, may not fully understand the legalities of any supposed length of stay agreed upon by the park owner and the homeowner. Of course, the flexibility remains in those agreements, which are disregarded mutually. I note also that retrospective operation of the amendments is necessary. However, I hope that will not ignite any disfavour between parties with standing agreements. Those who may intend to use this to exploit another party would be duly dealt with. It is a good proposition to allow for the establishment of homeowners committees that park owners will be obliged to be responsive to. The committees will resolve any matters arising. The bill confirms that only one committee at each park will exist to prevent the possibility of factional warfare that would see homeowners turn against homeowners and one stressed park owner left to deal with the unworkable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153666"></A>
The list of new penalties outlined in the bill provides adequate protection to the homeowners and discourages the park owners from attempting to misuse or contract out of the policy principles underpinning the act. I look forward to the implementation of this legislation and will be sure to pass the information on to the various residential parks within the Beaudesert electorate. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms SIMPSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maroochydore--LNP) (9.02 pm): Affordable housing means having housing options. Manufactured home parks used to provide one alternative for people seeking a less expensive option than freehold property. They loved their manufactured homes, whether flash or humble, which were located upon a leased block of land. They had neighbours nearby and they understood community. I am talking in the past tense because this is becoming a past life for many people who love their homes but who are being forced out. Unfortunately, this legislation will not stop that problem. With the SEQ regional plan there are winners and there are victims. I advise the parliament that people living in manufactured home parks are victims, as the value of land within the urban footprint has made many of those parks even more valuable for redevelopment, although not as manufactured home parks. They are fast being lost, along with other caravan parks, from within the SEQ regional footprint. They are being squeezed out as properties within the urban perimeter become unaffordable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153669"></A>
I fear that this legislation fails to provide the protection that the owners of manufactured homes are seeking, because at the end of the day if the park owner decides to close down and redevelop and the homeowner has to relocate, there may not be anywhere to go within 100 kilometres. Certainly I face that situation in my electorate. I have constituents whose parks are being closed or progressively closed but they have nowhere to go. There are no alternatives within 100 kilometres. I have raised this issue with the minister and I hear other members of the parliament raising the issue. While I appreciate the attempt to put protections into the act, unless that power balance is addressed by providing alternative sites that people can move their homes to, they will still be left up the creek without the proverbial paddle. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153670"></A>
I suggest that, in addition to this legislation, we need provisions within the SEQ plan and planning procedures that provide incentives for the maintenance of caravan parks and manufactured home parks, because currently they are being priced out of the market, they are being upscaled and redeveloped, and people are losing their opportunities. One hundred kilometres is a long way for someone to move a manufactured home. I know that there is talk of compensation for people who move within 300 kilometres, but the reality is that most people who want to stay within the community where their friends and family live will not want to move more than 20 or 30 kilometres away, and certainly will not want to move 100 kilometres away. One hundred kilometres is a long way away from friends and family. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153671"></A>
In Queensland, as you go further north building regulations change, as properties have to be cyclone proof. There is an historic issue that it may be harder to bring older relocatable homes up to current building standards. Whatever way we look at it, there are a lot of problems associated with relocating what were completely relocatable homes when first established, but today’s higher standards mean that options are a lot more limited. I fear that the very specific issue of land supply will mean that in South-East Queensland manufactured home parks will close down because of the pressures of growth. However, we will also see caravan parks that provide tourism opportunities becoming a thing of the past. I think that is a great shame in the state of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153672"></A>
When we talk about people being squeezed out, we must remember that we are talking about real lives. We are talking about real people who are affected. I have raised some cases with the minister previously and I will mention one here in the parliament. Some of the cases that individual park homeowners have faced have been most unreasonable. A constituent of mine was ordered by the tribunal to be gone by a certain date with no accompanying order for relocation costs. The order to determine the relocation costs was made only three days before they were supposed to have picked up their whole home and relocated to who knows where. That was a completely unreasonable situation caused by the tribunal’s processes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153673"></A>
I have drawn that case to the minister’s attention, but I will outline it for the benefit of the parliament. Initially, on 6 May 2010 my constituent was ordered by the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal to be gone from their site by 18 June 2010. They attended another hearing three days before they were due to be gone, which gave them a bit of a stay of execution. In summary, they were ordered to be gone by a certain date, with no order given at that time as to their relocation costs. The tribunal made the compensation order only three days before they were supposed to have packed up and moved out. There are examples where not only can the practice of some park owners be unacceptable but, as in this case, the tribunal can also fail in its consideration of the impact upon people. My constituents were very distressed because they did not even know what they were entitled to with the relocation and even if they received a compensation package they had nowhere to go to. They were left in a very vulnerable situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158475"></A>
There are some people who choose this way of life. It does provide an affordable housing option, or it has in the past, but we are finding that they are increasingly vulnerable. I will continue to raise the issue that more needs to be done within the planning laws of this state, the South East Queensland Regional Plan, to truly encourage a range of housing options, not just those that are going to be so up-market that people who had previously chosen these options will have no option. They will not be able to afford to live in South-East Queensland. In fact, they will not be able to relocate their home outside of South-East Queensland either, because they simply will not be able to afford to. This issue is not going to go away. We believe that it needs to be firmly addressed. I note that the minister has advised in correspondence to me that the government is considering this matter. I add my voice to those who have spoken about the vulnerability of this group of constituents because they still have nowhere to go. Unfortunately the legislation before us still does not address the issue that they are facing. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs SULLIVAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Pumicestone--ALP) (9.09 pm): I, too, rise to support the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill 2010, which proposes to amend the Manufactured Homes Act 2003. From the outset, I would like to take the opportunity to thank those involved in the consultation process, particularly those officers from the Office of Fair Trading and those residents who attended public consultation forums across Queensland. One was held in Caboolture and it was certainly well attended. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158483"></A>
Discussions have been long, and some have expressed to me that it has taken far too long for the bill to come before the House. Public consultation began over three years ago and has attracted considerable attention. In fact, around 670 written responses were received, and because of the feedback during the process some changes were made to the draft bill. This government is dedicated to providing all Queenslanders with a fair go. While we can cannot provide everyone with everything they want, in this bill we did aim to regulate and promote better fair trading practices in the operation of residential parks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158484"></A>
In the electorate of Pumicestone, which I represent, there are a number of residential parks, and their occupants form a very valued part of our community. Those living in residential home parks have chosen this lifestyle for many different reasons. Parks are an essential provider of alternative affordable housing to about 15,000 Queenslanders. Therefore, the fact that this bill progresses consumer protection initiatives while also allowing for the continued growth of the residential parks industry is very important. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158485"></A>
Some would argue that the bill does not go far enough. Some will be unhappy that it does not cover every individual circumstance, which is obviously impossible. While I acknowledge that there is always more that we can do as far as legislation is concerned, I am pleased that this bill, when passed this evening, will clarify and further strengthen several aspects of the current law for the benefit of occupants. There is no reason that once the bill is implemented people cannot seek further reform to continue to modernise the bill to suit the times and the changing attitudes in the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158486"></A>
I would like to include in my speech a comment from a letter dated 2 October 2010. While others were not entirely satisfied with the draft bill, as I have stated--and I am going to get to their concerns shortly--others, like the chairperson of the Island Breeze Resort homeowners committee, Mr Alan Nichols, were keen to see the bill put before the House with no more changes. He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1158489"></A>
I am writing to seek your support in having the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill 2010 presented as a whole in its current form. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1158490"></A>
The letter went on to say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1163515"></A>
Concerns have been expressed that some Manufactured Home Park owners have attempted to have amendments made prior to the Bill being passed through Parliament. These concerns have been supported by the Caravan and Manufactured Home Residents Association of Queensland Inc. or C.A.M.R.A. Your support to the Minister for Fair Trading would be very much appreciated. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158493"></A>
I have had numerous pieces of correspondence from residents who wanted more changes. One gentleman was deeply concerned that there was still an imbalance between the homeowners and the park owners due mostly to the different attitudes expressed from an economic and social perspective. Residents want security of tenure. They want to pay what they consider to be a reasonable rent for that security. They want to see their rent money being used to further improve their quality of life. Everyone would agree that these are all reasonable requests. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158494"></A>
The park owners--I know many of them, and I have visited many of their residential parks--on the whole have invested considerable funds to develop, make viable and profit from their business ventures. The bill takes note of these competing concerns between park owners and the occupants and tries to provide certainty for both parties. This is why change should be gradual, so that each party is able to adjust to those changes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158495"></A>
Amendments in this bill will also make things clearer for occupants contemplating entering a residential park. For example, the bill includes amendments to improve the presentation and content of site agreements. Many of these have been contentious in the past. They will need to be clearly written in plain English and therefore easily understood. As well, the bill proposes a power for particular special terms in site agreements to be banned by regulation. These have been a problem in the past where agreements or contracts did have clauses that differed and this caused angst among many of the occupants. Amendments will also provide occupants with more confidence and certainty regarding site rent increases by considerably limiting the grounds on which a park owner may seek an increase in rent outside the terms of the site agreement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158496"></A>
There are many other strengths to this bill but, due to the time, I finish by saying that I commend the bill to the House. I believe that this bill goes a long way to protecting homeowners in residential parks from what I would consider to be unfair practices of the past. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158498"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. KL STRUTHERS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Algester--ALP) (Minister for Community Services and Housing and Minister for Women) (9.15 pm): I support this bill. It is just one more way that the state government is building a fairer Queensland, through ensuring that Queenslanders can be secure in their tenancy in a lifestyle that they choose--in this case, in manufactured homes in parks. I thank the minister for his support of this legislation. We are trying to get the balance right here between the rights of the owners of the parks and making sure that tenants in manufactured homes in these parks have security of tenure and things like compensation if they are unfairly moved on at short notice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158499"></A>
The bill gives residents in manufactured homes in caravan parks greater certainty about their rights. Manufactured homes are affordable housing that suit some people’s circumstances. As Minister for Housing, I am very aware that many people call these places home and they have very comfortable and secure homes. In fact, my mother lives in a manufactured home in a park on the Gold Coast. She has said to me on a number of occasions that she has never felt more secure. She has a great group of people in that park and she feels very comfortable there. The only insecurity that is hanging over her head is that at any time she could be moved on. There is encroaching development around her park at Runaway Bay and she knows that at any time she may be required to move on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158501"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Ms Croft:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 I’ll look after her. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158502"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms STRUTHERS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 But she certainly feels very secure where she is at the moment. She knows that she has a great state member in PK Croft, looking after the residents in that park. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158503"></A>
The bill certainly tries to rectify the uncertainty that had come to exist in the law over the rights of owners of manufactured parks. I particularly welcome the changes in this bill that will make the termination of site agreements much clearer. Residents of manufactured homes deserve the certainty and security that this act gives them, and they certainly deserve the opportunity to object to the termination of their site agreements. Residents will also have the right to receive compensation where these terminations are due to a park owner wanting to develop or change the use of the land. The bill also provides certainty, which park owners and operators have told me they want, to invest in a park. The government is keen to provide the business security for park managers to ensure caravan parks and mobile home parks are a viable enterprise for them--an enterprise that they can invest in, upgrade and maintain. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158505"></A>
As minister, I am certainly very keen to make sure that there is a range of affordable housing options for people. It was with great pleasure that I went to the Sunshine Coast last week to officially open the upgraded Woombye Gardens Caravan Park. It is not the usual business of government to buy caravan parks but, being the good Labor government that we are, looking after the interests of low-income people, we have actually bought three of them--at Hervey Bay, Monte Carlo in Brisbane and Woombye on the Sunshine Coast. Those opposite do not support public housing. Those opposite do not support low-income battlers who are looking for security in housing. We have taken the unprecedented step of buying caravan parks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158511"></A>
The purchase of the Woombye caravan park is a great story. We have invested $2.3 million in that caravan park. The 67 residents who are in those new cabins--manufactured, factory-built cabins--in that park, as I went around and went into their homes, told me how good they felt and how secure they felt. It was great to meet people like Noel. Noel was in the Navy. He was a Navy diver. He then did diving privately with mining companies and others out in the Strait. I asked him what had happened for him to get that scar on his head. He told me the story that he had started to cut the jaws out of a shark, thinking it was dead on the bottom of the ocean, but it in fact bit him. Noel, in his 70s, has had a pretty formidable life and is now settling into the Woombye caravan park in his new cabin and feeling very secure and very happy. That is the sort of story we want to hear--stories of people who are doing it pretty tough and on a low income but getting the security of that sort of tenure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163533"></A>
The other area that we have been involved in--and it is quite unusual for governments--to find options for affordable housing is buying up motels and doing motel makeovers. We have done about 20 of those around the state. If members have stayed at the Rum City Motel in Bundaberg they will find that that is now public housing. The old Surf City Motel--or something like that--on Kawana Way is now public housing. These are great motels. We are doing motel makeovers that are providing affordable housing for people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163536"></A>
We have to be creative in how we respond to the needs for affordable housing for people on low incomes. This government is in the business of looking at a range of options including supporting the tenure and security of people in manufactured homes, in doing things like buying caravan parks and in doing motel makeovers. How many new social housing dwellings have we got on line? Four thousand. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PJ LAWLOR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southport--ALP) (Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading) (9.21 pm), in reply: I thank all members who have contributed to this debate on the Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Amendment Bill 2010. I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the many members who have made individual representations to me on behalf of manufactured home owners living within their electorates. It is encouraging that members clearly understand the importance of this legislation and share the Bligh government’s commitment to protecting Queenslanders who live in manufactured homes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163539"></A>
From what members have said we can see how difficult it is to draw the line in the appropriate place. Most members supported issues associated with homeowners but also most supported the ability of people to invest in manufactured home parks. It is a matter of getting the balance right. That is not the easiest thing to do. As a couple of members mentioned, there might be other amendments. All legislation is under constant review. Basically, most legislation is a work in progress. As circumstances change so too must legislation be changed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163540"></A>
The great challenge in regulating residential parks is establishing and maintaining strong, effective consumer protection for manufactured home owners while avoiding regulatory burdens that discourage and stifle the viability and growth of the residential parks industry. This challenge has been well articulated by members in their contributions to this debate. Neither park owners nor homeowners are winners if the regulatory framework discourages the private housing sector from offering sites for long-term occupation by people living in manufactured homes. This bill has benefited from a comprehensive legislative review and extensive consultation processes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163541"></A>
I will now turn to some of the matters raised by members in their contributions to this debate. I thank the member for Mermaid Beach for his general support for the bill, his comments on particular provisions and I note his acknowledgement of the extensive consultation process. The member also noted that the bill contains amendments to require site agreements to be clearly presented in plain language. These amendments aim to help prospective homeowners better understand their rights and obligations under their site agreement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163542"></A>
Whilst it will depend on the circumstances of the case, the explanatory notes provide guidance on characteristics of plain language. Site agreements should not contain excessively long sentences, clauses or paragraphs and unnecessary use of technical terms, jargon and so on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163543"></A>
In response to the member’s comments about the potential increase in the number of applications made to QCAT, the amendments provide homeowners with important means to resolve disputes if they genuinely believe a term of their site agreement is not clearly expressed in plain language. The situation will of course be monitored. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163544"></A>
I would also like to respond to the member for Mermaid Beach’s comments about the changes in relation to converted caravans and thank the member for Morayfield for his acknowledgement of the benefit the three-year transitional arrangement provides for existing converted caravan owners. The amendments provide existing converted caravan owners with a three-year period to apply to QCAT to seek an order for a site agreement if they believe their home meets the definition of a manufactured home under the pre-amended act. They will not be unfairly disadvantaged by the changes. It is a sunset clause, effectively. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163545"></A>
Comments about the retrospective nature of the amendments that relate to the prohibition of special terms were also made by the member for Mermaid Beach. While the member contends that these amendments impact on the existing rights of park owners, it is important to note that homeowners are often in a weaker bargaining position when entering into site agreements. The capacity for an existing special term of a site agreement to become void in existing agreements following the making of a regulation is considered justified due to the long-term potentially intergenerational nature of site agreements and the fact that site agreements can be assigned to new homeowners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163546"></A>
If the amendments do not operate retrospectively, homeowners may be bound by unreasonable special terms in their site agreement for many years, notwithstanding that the terms have been prohibited. As such, it is appropriate that special terms that have been identified as being unfair and exploitative should not be permitted to continue in any site agreements. These important amendments will protect the interests of homeowners and substantially improve the level of consumer protection.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163547"></A>
During consultation the question of coercive conduct that was raised by the member for Mermaid Beach was also raised by stakeholders. In general, a park owner engaging in reasonable communication and negotiations with a homeowner regarding rent issues does not constitute threatening, intimidating or coercive conduct unless their behaviour would make a reasonable person feel unwillingly compelled to comply with the request. The explanatory notes also provide some guidance about these provisions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163548"></A>
I also acknowledge the member for Mermaid Beach’s comments about the potential impact for park owners if QCAT postpones a termination order for up to one year. These amendments ensure that QCAT may consider both the needs and welfare of homeowners as well as the potential impact, including financial, on park owners.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163549"></A>
I thank the member for Coomera for his comments about site rent increases in relation to consideration of the viability and profitability of parks. We have quite validly defended the rights of park owners here. The majority of residential parks are part of the private housing sector and are operated by private individuals and businesses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163550"></A>
He raised a few issues about the cost of running a townhouse in Maryborough, a house at Arundel and a townhouse somewhere else. One cost $1,267, one cost $2,105 and the other cost $3,448 per annum. He says he is a financial planner. I am glad he is not doing my finances. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163552"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is good for you. Under the amendments, park owners seeking an increase in rent outside the terms of a site agreement will need to demonstrate and prove to the tribunal that their business is experiencing significant increases in operational costs, unforeseen and significant repair costs or significant facility upgrades in order to be granted an increase in site rent outside the terms of a site agreement. These types of expenses can be objectively identified and assessed by QCAT when resolving disputes about site rent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163553"></A>
Members, including the member for Gaven, commented on the adequacy of the compensation provisions in the bill. Currently, if a park owner obtains an order from QCAT allowing termination of a site agreement because the park owner wishes to use their land for another purpose, QCAT must also order the park owner to pay the homeowner compensation based on the costs of moving the home and the homeowner’s personal effects to another location.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163554"></A>
In addition, the bill allows QCAT to make additional orders to assist homeowners faced with the termination of their site agreement, including orders postponing the termination date for up to one year and orders requiring the park owner to make another site in the park available to the homeowner, if that is available, of course. Increasing the compensation payable by park owners could conceivably discourage new entrants to the industry, resulting in increased pressure on the availability of sites. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168510"></A>
Given that site agreements are perpetual and assignable and may only be terminated in certain circumstances, park owners have limited opportunities to ensure rent provisions of a site agreement continue to be appropriate given changes in operating costs over time. Therefore, it is considered fair and necessary for the act to allow park owners to seek increases in rent in particular circumstances. Importantly, park owners will no longer be able to seek market review based increases unless this method for increasing site rent has been specifically agreed to and included in an individual site agreement. Importantly, QCAT will continue to have jurisdiction to resolve disputes regarding proposed rent variations. If homeowners do not agree to the proposed increase outside the terms of their site agreements, the park owner will only be permitted to impose the increase if authorised by QCAT. The type of information required may be documents or any other evidence to substantiate and prove that the park owner is facing actual and significant increases in operating costs, unforeseen repair costs or significant facility upgrades.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168516"></A>
Many members, including the members for Nicklin and Glass House, noted that some manufactured homes can resemble more traditional homes and questioned how this may impact on homeowners. The definition of a manufactured home provided in the act is broad enough to encapsulate a variety of different types of homes, from the more traditional mobile homes to larger and more substantial structures. While some modern manufactured homes appear to be permanently attached to the land, many of these homes are designed to be moved and meet the definition of a manufactured home. Homes must also meet local government requirements for construction approvals. In addition, if a park owner wishes to terminate a site agreement to use their land for another purpose, the park owner will be required to pay the homeowner compensation for the move, including where the costs may be substantial. It is important that each person seeks independent legal advice and makes informed decisions about the structure they are purchasing before entering into a site agreement with a residential park owner.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168519"></A>
I note that the member for Glass House proposed that park owners be subject to a licensing regime. The key issue for this type of scheme is that residential park owners own the land the manufactured homes are positioned on. Therefore, revoking or placing restrictions on a residential park owner who is not meeting licensing requirements could result in a park owner being prevented from offering sites for manufactured homes. Manufactured home owners would not be in a better position if the park owner ceased offering sites because moving and relocating a manufactured home can be costly and vacant sites are difficult to find. The act currently contains clear prohibitions in relation to fraudulent, misleading, harassing or unconscionable conduct. These types of behaviours can be investigated by the Office of Fair Trading.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168522"></A>
The bill also contains amendments which further strengthen the act by ensuring these prohibitions apply when a park owner is acting as a selling agent for a manufactured home. The member for Nicklin spoke about an exemption from requiring park owners to obtain a licence so they may benefit from a happy hour. The key difference between retirement villages and residential parks where manufactured homes may be positioned is that there is no age restriction for residential parks and therefore individuals of all ages may reside in a residential park. In fact, I have been to several of these parks, including one at Arundel and one at Hope Island, where quite young people reside. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168524"></A>
Various people have mentioned issues about affordable housing. With regard to the park that I visited at Hope Island, the manufactured homes there are selling for around $500,000. There are not only elderly people there, so it is an issue concerned not only with the fact that nursing homes have the right to have happy hour. There are also issues associated with the age of the people living in the manufactured home parks. However, it is a valid issue and I am still prepared to have a look at it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168525"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Wellington:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Will we have an amendment, Minister?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168526"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No, we will not be doing that. There are risks associated with providing this type of exemption given the diversity of occupants in manufactured homes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168527"></A>
Many members spoke about the need for continued consideration of the issues impacting on manufactured home owners. During the review manufactured home owners reported increasing pressure on the availability of home sites, and this is particularly an issue that was mentioned by the member for Broadwater, who has six manufactured home parks in her electorate and therefore is probably more impacted by this legislation and by the issue of manufactured home parks than any other member here. This issue has been raised by many members, including the member for Maroochydore. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168532"></A>
Whilst the Bligh government is focused on achieving high standards of consumer protection, it is also mindful of the risk that increasing the regulatory burden may discourage existing residential park owners from offering sites for long-term occupation by manufactured homes. It is also important that potential new entrants to the industry have confidence that offering sites for manufactured homes is an attractive commercial proposition. The government will be undertaking further work to identify practical strategies to address the concerns expressed by some manufactured home owners that the number of residential parks offering sites for traditional manufactured homes is not meeting demand for those types of sites within the sector.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168535"></A>
A whole-of-government approach is being taken to identify the barriers and disincentives facing the residential parks industry. Most importantly, this strategy aims to develop options to facilitate the growth and viability of a sector as an important provider of affordable housing options for Queenslanders without lessening the protection for homeowners, and there was reference by the Minister for Housing to steps that she has taken to acquire sites in Hervey Bay. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168539"></A>
The Office of Fair Trading is currently working with the Department of Communities, the Department of Infrastructure and Planning and other Queensland government agencies to identify options for promoting growth in the industry. Encouraging an increase in the stock of sites for manufactured homes will relieve some of the pressure and risks facing homeowners whose right to reside in a particular park comes to an end. The government also recognises that this is an issue that the government cannot resolve on its own. To that end, a public discussion paper is being developed to enable park owners, homeowners and other interested parties to share their experience and expertise with the government in developing effective and innovative strategies to deliver more manufactured home sites. The government is undertaking a public consultation process regarding this particular issue in the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168544"></A>
The member for Bundamba commented on park maintenance. Under the act the park owner has the responsibility to maintain the common areas and communal facilities in a reasonable state of cleanliness and repair and fit for use by the homeowner. As she mentioned, I have been to that particular park and I would agree with her that the people at Brisbane River Terraces certainly deserve a better performance from the managers than they are getting. I certainly witnessed that myself. If homeowners are not satisfied with the standard of the park, as a first step homeowners can consider seeking assistance from the homeowners committee. Under the act, homeowners committees are entitled to present park owners with proposals and complaints. Park owners are obliged to respond to the committee about proposals and complaints. The act also allows a homeowner to apply to the tribunal for an order reducing the site rent if the homeowner believes the amenity or standard of the residential park’s common areas and communal facilities has decreased substantially since the site agreement was entered into.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168553"></A>
There were a couple of other issues raised by members. The member for Nicklin mentioned that manufactured homes are constructed on land which makes it very difficult for them to subsequently remove. As I mentioned, these days you can spend $400,000 or $500,000 on a manufactured home. Of course, firstly you have to reach agreement with the owner and have a site agreement, but the difficulty and cost that it might take to remove the home should always be considered when you are constructing what is effectively a home on someone else’s land. When talking about investments like that, they should be taking legal advice and considering very carefully the difficulties which the member for Nicklin has pointed out in the event that they want to relocate the home. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168554"></A>
The member for Maroochydore mentioned concerns about QCAT. It is not appropriate to comment on the merits of the decision; however, I note the member’s concerns about short time frames for termination orders to take effect and point out that the bill allows the tribunal to postpone a termination order for 12 months.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173724"></A>
In closing, I would like to thank the honourable members who contributed to this debate and also those who took the time, as I mentioned, to make personal representations. I would also like to thank former ministers for their work on this legislation, including the member for Albert, Margaret Keech, who commenced the review of the act in 2007 and who accompanied me on a very informative and enjoyable visit to a purpose-built manufactured home park, Halcyon Waters, at Hope Island. Further, I would like to thank the member for Bundamba for the very informative visit, as I mentioned, to Brisbane River Terraces in her electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173728"></A>
I would like to thank the literally hundreds of manufactured home owners, homeowners’ committees, residential park owners, and consumer and industry representatives who have shared their experiences, expertise and suggestions during the consultation processes conducted during the review and in the development of this important bill. I also thank the departmental staff, including Damian Sammon, David Reardon, Stuart Busby, Anita Eenink and Tafline Gibson for their continued efforts, hard work, assistance, and also my staff, in progressing these significant amendments. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance, Caval Ridge Mine</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173754"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr KNUTH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Dalrymple--LNP) (9.41 pm): I bring to the attention of the House the move by the BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance to increase its fly in, fly out workforce at the Caval Ridge Mine site near Moranbah from 70 per cent to 100 per cent. This application has generated great emotion in Moranbah and mining communities. The residents have every right to be angry because a 100 per cent fly in, fly out workforce would spell social and economic disaster for the Bowen Basin region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173757"></A>
Mining communities in rural Queensland are already suffering from the strain that a high percentage fly in, fly out workforce presents. In his evaluation report the Coordinator-General states that there has been a noticeable decline in the viability of businesses and community organisations as the proportion of the non-resident population in and around these towns has increased. Also a 100 per cent fly in, fly out workforce is in direct contradiction to the government’s growth management strategy to, ‘Ensure economic developments promote growth in rural Queensland.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173759"></A>
I say to the government that approval of this application will not only be not prudent; it will set a dangerous precedent that will commit the long-term sustainability of rural mining communities in Queensland to years of disadvantage and the ruination of lifestyles. The growth of rural Queensland is dependent on families being given the opportunity to remain together, which will encourage social interaction and community participation and ensure the health, growth and sustainability of towns like Moranbah into the future. A non-resident workforce whose families live in urban centres will not have the opportunity to contribute to communities that are already heavily burdened with the negative impact of a high percentage non-resident workforce.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173760"></A>
This is an opportunity for the government to demonstrate a commitment to sustainable rural communities by rejecting any application of a 100 per cent fly in, fly out workforce. The sustainability and future growth of Moranbah, the Bowen Basin region and all mining communities in Queensland is threatened by this application. The government must act decisively to ensure that permanent infrastructure and housing are mandatory to future mining development in this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173761"></A>
I call on the members of this government, as they wait for BMA application, to spend a week in Moranbah’s shoes and they will find that it is more than just a mining town that rakes in revenue for the Treasury coffers. It is a community where parents are raising their children, grandparents are retiring and families are participating to ensure they can enjoy the quality of life that this community has to offer. In reality, Moranbah is a place they call home. </Hansard-Body>

Labrador Men’s Shed</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173764"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms CROFT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Broadwater--ALP) (9.44 pm): I wish to bring to the attention of the House an initiative that has ignited the industrious sounds of grinders, hammers and saws; sparked the development of great comradeship; and, in such a short time, has made a significant contribution to the Labrador community spirit by enhancing the lives of many. The Labrador Men’s Shed officially opened its doors on 12 August this year. It was a celebration of the volunteer efforts of a number of local men who had the goal of establishing a men’s shed on the northern Gold Coast. John and Graeme Muller and Warren Fowler were instrumental in establishing the Labrador Men’s Shed. Their drive and enthusiasm captured the attention of many as they pushed for a space, donations for timber and money to get their men’s shed up and running. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173768"></A>
The Labrador Men’s Shed, which is located in a complex known as the Hub, on the corner of Brisbane Road and Turpin Road, Labrador, is the place for any man over the age of 18 to work on their own projects or help out with some of the great community projects that the men’s shed is involved in. To date, over 80 men have joined the men’s shed. Some of them live in units or in gated communities where a man’s shed does not exist. Some men live locally in houses but just want to be part of a group of men who love to work with tools, have a coffee and a chat and be part of the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173770"></A>
It could be said that what happens at the shed, stays at the shed. However, this army of merry and busy men are working on lots of projects that they are very proud to tell people about and have other men participate in. One community project that has great support, and which is a well-established one, is local Peter Fernside’s project of converting gas bottles into cooking barbecues for Pacific Islander communities. Other projects include the construction of possum boxes and children’s toys, led by Tony Harris offering ‘shedders’ loads of opportunity to work with wood and to help out some local charities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173773"></A>
The men’s shed has already provided the nearby Child and Family Centre with a sandpit box for the kids and has established strong partnerships with the local primary school, police and other government and non-government organisations. The state government’s Positively Ageless--Queensland Seniors Strategy 2010 to 2020 recognises that encouraging active ageing and supporting participation in the community are crucial to enhancing seniors’ quality of life. The government has set a goal to reduce social isolation for seniors through increased community participation in an inclusive and age-friendly community. Whilst the government will investigate and undertake a variety of initiatives, it cannot do it alone. The role of men’s sheds like this one in Labrador will contribute significantly to achieving this goal of reducing social isolation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173775"></A>
At the open day for the men’s shed many wives and family members commented to me about how happy their men were now that they had somewhere to go and to make noise, tinker and be productive. I am pleased to be able to support this wonderful community group and I look forward to hearing more about its success and the ‘shedders’ projects. </Hansard-Body>

Broadbeach State School</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173778"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr STEVENS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mermaid Beach--LNP) (9.37 pm): I rise to bring to the attention of this House the deception and blatant trickery by the Bligh Labor government of the students, staff, families and surrounding residents of the Broadbeach State School in my electorate of Mermaid Beach. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173779"></A>
When I asked the question of the education minister, Mr Wilson, in November 2009, ‘Are there any plans to sell the Broadbeach State School?’ his written was response, ‘There are no plans to sell the Broadbeach State School.’ Yet the officers of Education Queensland have come clean on their plans to flog off most of the school site land and put 600 kids in a high-rise for their education. Either the minister for education was deliberately misleading with his answer in November 2009 or he does not have a clue about what his own department is getting up to. Considering the desperate financial mess that this Labor government has got the state of Queensland into, I think the former is most likely the case. If the government is desperate enough to sell Parklands showgrounds for private high-density housing, then it is desperate enough to sell the Broadbeach State School for high-rise development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173783"></A>
The minister’s latest reply to my question on notice on 16 September this year about the sale of the school was to use sneaky polliespeak and say that there are no current--and I emphasise the word ‘current’, translating into meaning before the next election--plans to sell the Broadbeach State School. If the minister were genuine in his defence of retaining this valuable community asset, he would have ruled out the sale completely. Instead he used weasel words such as, ‘The department would need to undertake further detailed analysis,’ which is similar wording that the Labor Party used before the last election about the sale of Queensland Rail. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173785"></A>
The students, staff, families and surrounding residents can be assured that the LNP will not be sacrificing this wonderful school and its associated land to pay for the horrendous financial black hole that this Labor government has dug itself into. The Broadbeach State School community has a clear choice at the next election between the Labor Party, which is exploring sneaky and underhanded ways by which to sell off their valuable public asset without consulting them, or the LNP, which is committed to retaining the current site and enhancing its value as an education facility. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179231"></A>
The school has almost doubled its numbers since I became the representative in 2006 and there will only be increasing demand for the school in the years ahead, particularly if the light rail option stopping in Broadbeach in stage 1 ever comes to fruition. Premier Bligh needs to put her unqualified vow to the students, families and residents surrounding Broadbeach State School that she will not sell any of this magnificent public asset under any circumstances. If she refuses to make that commitment, the public can expect another dodgy public asset sale after the next election if Labor wins. This property is at the centre of many highrises that have many people living in them who need that open space and need that school for their families for the future of a wonderful Gold Coast and a great Mermaid Beach electorate. </Hansard-Body>

Mental Health Week</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Mrs SMITH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.50 pm): Almost half of the Australian adult population will experience a form of mental illness at some stage during their life, yet two-thirds of those experiencing a mental illness do not seek treatment, largely due to the stigma attached to it. Mental illness does not attract the same empathy as other conditions. I find it hard to believe that in 2010 there are many people who still do not see mental illness as a medical condition. I am proud to be part of a government that is taking steps to reduce the stigma attached to mental health. We are leading the nation with an $8.5 million campaign to reduce the stigma and discrimination associated with mental illness.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179237"></A>
Mental Health Week provides an excellent opportunity to raise awareness of the importance of looking after our mental health and reducing the stigma attached to mental illness. Mental health is a state of wellbeing. It is not just the absence of illness but also the ability to maintain relationships, cope with stress, contribute to the community and enjoy life. Good mental health helps us to more fully enjoy life and the world around us. We respond better to the stresses and challenges of daily life when our mental health is good. The reality is that the vast majority of people who suffer from mental illness do not need to be admitted to acute hospital beds; what they need is treatment and support. Mental Health Week is celebrated in October each year. While it is an opportunity to highlight the positive steps we are taking, we need to commit every day of the year to ongoing recognition of mental health issues and how we might address them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179238"></A>
During Mental Health Week I attended an art exhibition staged by clients of the Gold Coast Mental Health Rehabilitation Service and supported by Gold Coast Hospital clinicians and staff, many of whom were present on opening night. Although I am not artistic, I understand that creating artwork is very therapeutic. It can convey emotions that we may be reluctant to show and speak to us about things we do not want to say. This exhibition was on display at the Southport Public Library and allowed the wider community to see and touch the works and to marvel at the talent displayed. It also helped to promote better understanding of mental illness within the community. I thank those clients who shared with us on the night not only their artwork but also their stories of loss of good mental health and the journey to recovery. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179239"></A>
It is not good enough to just wear a ribbon, attend an event and pat ourselves on the back for acknowledging the issue of mental illness. We need to increase awareness and develop research aimed at reducing the incidence of mental illness. Statistics show that one in four of us will be affected by mental illness, either directly or indirectly. It could be our partners, our children or even ourselves. We cannot afford to ignore this issue. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.53 pm): Before I speak on a significant electoral matter, I would like to pause and personally thank some very important people. Last Thursday my wife, Taryn, was taken via ambulance to the emergency department of the Nambour General Hospital. I would like to start by thanking Matt and Martin from the Queensland Ambulance Service at the Nambour station for their professionalism and comic relief in what was a stressful situation for Taryn, me and our five kids. I know that Taryn had to ask them to stop the wisecracks because it was hurting too much, but their levity certainly helped us all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179243"></A>
To the staff at the emergency department, particularly doctors Andrew and Lisa and wardsman Gary, thank you. Your quick and skilful intervention means Taryn is well and truly on the mend and, Gary, thanks for helping me corral the kids at various times throughout the day. Quite simply, we do not praise the work of our front-line health professionals near enough, so let me take this opportunity to personally say a heartfelt thankyou. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179244"></A>
On a less pleasant note, since the Bligh Labor government announced that the Caloundra South development would be taken away from the Sunshine Coast Regional Council and handed to the ULDA my office has been inundated by community concern and outrage. Whilst I appreciate there is a need to identify and progress suitable sites for development, I share many of the concerns raised by my constituents.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179245"></A>
Firstly, the project was removed from the oversight of the relevant local government. Throughout Queensland it is local government that plans and approves developments such as this. They, better than any other tier of government, are in touch with the sentiments of our constituents in these matters and aim to reflect this in their decisions. By removing this project from local government oversight the Bligh Labor government could be accused of removing a local voice in the progress of the Caloundra South development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179246"></A>
The transfer of the project to the ULDA also removes a number of checks and balances that would normally exist around such developments--another cause for alarm with Glass House locals. Then there are the environmental implications. The council has spent considerable time and money on investigating the environmental challenges posed by this particular development, not least of which is the ongoing status of the Pumicestone Passage and its catchments. Just last week the Ecosystem Health Report Card showed that the passage itself had fallen from a C plus to a D plus rating and the catchments from a B to a C minus. The council will be making its studies available to the ULDA but I would encourage the authority to go further and ensure that there is a full environmental assessment of the development site and its environs. If the outcomes do not add up, do not force the issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179247"></A>
Finally, if this development is to be fast-tracked, we on the Sunshine Coast need vital infrastructure now. We need the CAMCOS now--not a fast bus system from Landsborough to Caloundra, but a rail solution from Beerwah to Maroochydore. If not, all the newcomers to the coast will become car dependent and our roads excessively congested. We need the Sunshine Coast University Hospital now. This is yet another example of the Bligh Labor government foisting its demands upon the people of the Sunshine Coast while it continues to ignore the desires and reasonable requests of the same people. </Hansard-Body>

(9.56 pm): On 9 September, the Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport, the Hon. Phil Reeves, and I officially opened stage 1 and the ground floor of a planned three-storey complex for rowing, canoeing and community use at the Centenary Rowing Club facilities at Riverhills. The state government has provided grants totalling $585,000 to help build the first public rowing club for youth on the Brisbane River in nearly a century.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179251"></A>
The ground floor area is dominated by boat storage and washdown areas, and also has a coach’s room and wheelchair accessible areas. Once it is complete, the club’s new facility will provide a wonderful home base for Queensland rowers ensuring they will have the necessary facilities to become champions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179252"></A>
With 180 junior members, the club is already a first-class community asset. Centenary can take great pride in its youth rowing program, which club executives believe is unique in Australia. As the Parliamentary Secretary for Disability Services, I am pleased to say that the club is strongly committed to including people with a disability in their activities. The club reaches out to schools and the community to offer young people not only coaching and exercise but also social and personal development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179253"></A>
The idea of a state-of-the-art clubhouse along the Brisbane River in Centenary started over 14 years ago with approaches to local authorities made by Peter Cooke on behalf of the Centenary Canoe Club, as it was then called. Peter Cooke joined forces with Russell Poole from the rowing club to take their cause forward as the Centenary Canoe and Rowing Club. Since then, water sports have continued to thrive at what locals call the Mudhole, situated behind the Jindalee Scout Hut along Mount Ommaney Drive. I would hope that their work will continue to be acknowledged in the future and that the new facility and pontoon at the end of Sumners Road becomes home to both canoeing and rowing enthusiasts and is shared by a number of local community organisations looking for a place to meet.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179254"></A>
I am also very proud of the fact that the state government has recently contributed to many worthwhile sporting organisations in the area through the Gambling Community Benefit Fund and sport and recreation grants. Some of the clubs with recent funding include the Centenary Archers Club, Jindalee Districts Australian Football Club, the YMCA, the Centenary Canoeing and Kayaking Club and the Corinda Bowls Club. I often attend trophy presentations or awards days for the Centenary Stormers Soccer Club, the Centenary Junior Rugby League Club, Little Athletics, the Jamboree Heights Swimming Club, the Oxley Swimming Club, St Catherine’s Soccer Club and the Oxley United Football Club. It is great to see so many volunteers and young players making an extraordinary effort in their chosen sport. All of my local sporting clubs do a fantastic job keeping the enthusiasm going for participation in healthy physical activities. They continue to expand their memberships and endeavour to undertake improvements to their facilities for the benefit of young people in the area. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (9.59 pm): Last Friday the Bligh Labor government yet again succumbed to people power in the electorate of Mudgeeraba with another backflip on road issues. In the lead-up to the 2009 election it was fairly obvious to local residents that they had been severely neglected by the Labor government and by their Labor state member, who for eight long years had failed to listen to residents’ concerns about the increasing traffic gridlock which has now become commonly known as the ‘Mudgeeraba car park’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1184746"></A>
Residents will well remember the postcard campaign on local roads that I waged during the election, and the removal of the north-bound on-ramp at Robina Parkway at exit 82 was just one of many spot fires lit under the former member. The Bligh Labor government ignored local residents and planned to remove the on-ramp and replace it with a service road running parallel with the M1 in the flood plain with little consultation with the locals. Local residents were already up in arms with 1,500 cars a day using their local streets to avoid congestion on the overpass. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1184747"></A>
In response to our protest card campaign, over 75 per cent of local residents signed a protest card and posted it to the Premier, demanding that the on-ramp stay open in order to avoid clogging the overpass, prevent rat-running through local streets and ensure that their homes were not further devalued due to traffic congestion and noise concerns. Just last week I received a response from the Premier whereby both she and the Minister for Main Roads had performed a monumental backflip. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1184750"></A>
The department advises that during the early planning for this project the possibility of removing the on-ramp to the M1 at Robina Interchange (Exit 82) was investigated. However, it was discounted some time ago. Please reassure your constituents that the department does not intend to close the ramp.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1184751"></A>
Of interest, following discussions with Main Roads only a few days later, they had no knowledge of the on-ramp change. On Friday local residents and I met with Channel 9 Gold Coast News to make sure that neither the Premier nor the Minister for Main Roads performed a backflip on their own backflip. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1184752"></A>
When questioned by the media on the Gold Coast, the Premier appeared to have no knowledge of the issue even though the letter was personalised to me by the Premier with a specific request that I reassure my constituents that they had finally won their battle. This is one of a number of hard-fought battles that residents and I have waged in the Mudgeeraba electorate. I have been dubbed by our local media as the ‘member for the M1’. I think that this arrogant Labor government is finally learning what people power is in Mudgeeraba as locals are sick and tired of this arrogant, out-of-touch, on-the-nose Labor government. </Hansard-Body>

Ms FARMER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bulimba--ALP) (10.01 pm): I use this opportunity to praise a wonderful group of young people who operate out of the Bulimba electorate and the equally wonderful couple who coordinate the group. I am referring to TS Gayundah, the naval cadets unit which runs from the historic Bulimba Barracks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1184758"></A>
TS Gayundah is the oldest cadet unit in Queensland, having been first established in 1954. I had the very good fortune to be introduced to its members not long after I was elected when their new commanding officers, Phil and Wendy Broxham, invited me to one of their parades. I did not really know at that point what a treat was in store for me. However, having now become a regular visitor at their special events since this first parade, having worked closely with Phil and Wendy as they have strived to develop the unit and having seen these young people grow in stature and confidence, I can say that I am now a very enthusiastic member of the TS Gayundah fan club. The discipline that the cadet unit offers to young people, the skills, the respect for authority, the understanding of what it is to work as a team, the encouragement to take pride in oneself and one’s work--these are just some of the many things these young men and women have learnt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1184760"></A>
When I first met TS Gayundah, the unit had around 18 members. Eighteen months later, they have almost 40 members. This is due in no small part to Phil and Wendy Broxham. I understand that it is often difficult to recruit members in metropolitan units as there are so many other options competing for the attention of people of this age. However, Phil and Wendy, by being the positive, determined people that they are, have forged a unit which is cohesive and purposeful and which responds in spades to the high expectations and also to the genuine love and caring that Phil and Wendy have for them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1184761"></A>
The achievements of the unit are also acknowledged elsewhere. The unit itself was recently named the best unit in the Brisbane flotilla and came eighth overall in Australia. The community also recognises them. I know they were in great demand on the last Anzac Day, making no less than seven appearances at both the local RSL service and at various nursing homes around the area on behalf of the RSL. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1184762"></A>
One of the greatest aspirations of the group over the last 18 months has been to attend some of the significant battle sites in Europe, culminating in a dawn service at Villers Bretonneux. This has required some significant fundraising, which I know has presented its challenges and which has been a goal that has sometimes seemed unattainable. However, with their usual determination and inability to ever give up, the group is now well on its way towards its fundraising goal. Again, Phil and Wendy Broxham have been the linchpins and have done remarkable work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1184765"></A>
I want to congratulate this outstanding group of young people on the way they have developed as people and on their commitment to their community. As we think about Remembrance Day in just two weeks time, it is particularly wonderful to see the respect and admiration of the unit for our armed services personnel, both past and present, and for what they have done for our country. I look forward to working with TS Gayundah in the future and watching them grow even further. </Hansard-Body>

 (Burnett--Ind) (10.04 pm): I rise and table a report given to me by Townsville mother Ann Maitland. This is the second report regarding the tragic death of her daughter Michelle Maitland in June 2009 at Gymnastics Townsville. Since the first report was tabled on 6 October this year, several concerned gym professionals have approached Ann and me with important technical information and observations. It is vital for this House to consider the facts and informed expert opinions found in this report. Workplace Health and Safety Queensland is out of its depth in addressing these matters. On behalf of Ann, I would like to thank the Attorney-General, Cameron Dick, and Premier Anna Bligh for their genuine interest and concern in this serious and tragic matter. I know the Premier took the time to personally meet with Ann. That was very much appreciated, as well as the Premier organising a meeting with the Attorney-General. </Hansard-Body>

Bundaberg nurse whistleblower Christine Cameron has been waiting for 18 months for an official response from Queensland Health to her very serious allegations of patient harm as a result of possible misconduct by employees of Queensland Health. I have spoken often in this place about her concerns and the extraordinary delay that the ESU has been responsible for. Tonight I want to express my disgust at the public comments made by the manager of the Bundaberg Base Hospital, Beth Norton, in response to recent media stories about nurse whistleblower Christine Cameron. Ms Norton’s recent comments are nothing more than an attempt to minimise the seriousness of Ms Cameron’s allegations and to limit political damage. There are unexplained deaths. An elderly woman was tied to a chair. A child was assaulted. Patients’ lives and their wellbeing were placed at risk. Peter Leck and Darren Keating, Patel’s bosses, would be proud of Norton’s devotion to a political party’s misinformation. </Hansard-Body>

I would like to thank Bargara dentist Lincoln Harris of Harris Dental, who donated $50,000 worth of free dental to Gin Gin resident Caroline Michell. Dr Harris profoundly changed Caroline’s life and made sure that Caroline and Adam, her husband, were able to have a beautiful wedding with lots of smiles last weekend. Caroline is a victim of this government’s failed dental health system. Because of a medical condition, she suffered from severe dental decay. Despite being on a public waiting list for years, she was not there long enough to overcome the eight-year waiting list at the Bundaberg Base Hospital. I want to congratulate the Burnett community and the media, who all rallied to help Caroline, her husband, Adam, and her disabled son, Patrick. The Burnett community rallied after the media exposed Caroline’s plight and donated generously. Caroline and Adam are battlers who have had more than their fair share of bad luck. Hopefully, their wedding signifies a new beginning. </Hansard-Body>

Mr PITT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mulgrave--ALP) (10.07 pm): I was thrilled to join Deputy Premier and Minister for Health, Paul Lucas, and emergency services minister, Neil Roberts, to open the new $16.3 million Gurriny Yealamucka Primary Health Care facility at Yarrabah last week, delivering on a long-held commitment that was started through the hard work of the former member. Queensland Health, the Queensland Ambulance Service and Gurriny Yealamucka Health Service Aboriginal Corporation are all co-located at the centre in a unique partnership that will become the model for future projects. The primary healthcare centre brings together a wide range of medical, community and other health services and their existing staff under one roof. The brand new building includes a multi-purpose meeting room and boardroom for the community and services that aim to improve service delivery and encourage a holistic approach to health. </Hansard-Body>

Yarrabah’s two paramedics attended more than 650 jobs last financial year, 170 of which were life-threatening emergencies. This investment recognises the commitment our paramedics make to the Yarrabah community and the value we place on providing the community with health services of the highest standard. </Hansard-Body>

The importance of providing a one-stop shop for health services cannot be underestimated. One of the fantastic features of this joint facility is that paramedics can drive their patient into the station and deliver them directly into the centre’s emergency facility through an adjoining purpose-built door. This saves valuable time and ensures paramedics and health centre staff can continue to work together to achieve the best possible outcome for the patient. </Hansard-Body>

Queensland Health already provides a range of services in Yarrabah, including emergency triage, outpatient palliative care, primary clinical care, immunisation, child health, renal, health promotion and education, support for victims of sexual and domestic violence and transport services to larger centres for urgent and elective medical needs. The centre will also provide facilities for visiting health specialists such as mental health, alcohol and drug services, the child development unit, diabetes services, the eye health team, social workers, GPs, TB screening and more. </Hansard-Body>

The new service at Yarrabah, along with Mapoon and Kowanyama on Cape York, is one of the three pilot sites chosen to transition Queensland Health’s primary health services in discrete Indigenous communities towards greater community control. The opening of this facility and co-location sets the stage for more detailed discussions about how we can work with Gurriny health to increase the community’s involvement in the planning, allocation of resources and delivery of health services in Yarrabah. This includes increasing the number of Aboriginal people delivering those services. On that point, it is fitting that the new building will be named after Sister Muriel Stanley, and will be a worthy memorial to her and her dedication to improving Indigenous health and supporting Indigenous people. My hope is that young people in the community will all know Sister Muriel’s story. I have no doubt that many will seek to emulate her contribution and become health workers and leaders in the community themselves. </Hansard-Body>
