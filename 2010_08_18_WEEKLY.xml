Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, tomorrow I will have the great pleasure of launching a new book on the history of the Queensland parliament. <Hansard-Italic>
The Ayes Have It--The History of the Queensland Parliament 1957-89</Hansard-Italic>
 will be launched in the Legislative Council chamber at 1 pm. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998341"></A>
Long awaited, <Hansard-Italic>
The Ayes Have It</Hansard-Italic>
 has been an ongoing project supported by the Queensland parliament since 1995 which has now been published as part of the parliament’s 150th anniversary celebrations. The book is a fascinating account of the Queensland parliament during three decades of high-drama politics. Beginning in the late 1950s, it examines in detail the Queensland parliament from the days of the ‘Labor split’ of that time, through to the conservative governments of Premiers Nicklin, Bjelke-Petersen and Ahern, and ending with the fall of the National Party’s government, led briefly by Russell Cooper in December 1989.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998356"></A>
Focusing on parliamentary politics, the book discusses the representatives and personalities who sat in this chamber during this time. It explores their priorities and political agendas as well as the many and varied controversies. <Hansard-Italic>
The Ayes Have It</Hansard-Italic>
 has been researched and written by John Wanna and Tracey Arklay. I invite all honourable members to join me and the authors in the Legislative Council chamber to launch this book at 1 pm tomorrow. </Hansard-Body>

Vietnam Veterans Day</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998416"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.33 am): I thank the member for Thuringowa. Today we recognise Vietnam Veterans Day. On this day we reflect on the gallant contribution made by representatives of all our armed services in this theatre of war. We also reflect on the members of our armed services who paid the ultimate sacrifice. We reflect on the tragedy of the loss of young life and the grief suffered by the families and friends of these young service people. This war saw our national government commit not only regular service personnel but also conscripted young men. Five hundred Australian servicemen lost their lives in Vietnam, while some 3,000 were wounded, injured or were victims of illness. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998536"></A>
Vietnam Veterans Day is held on this date because today also marks the anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, which saw a terrible loss of life of Australian soldiers during this terrible war, with 18 killed and 24 injured on this day. This was the first major war event widely covered by television. Day after day Australians had the images of the horror of the conflict beamed into their living rooms. While this enhanced our understanding of the events of the day, it no doubt added to the trauma suffered by loved ones waiting at home. We all remember the gruesome images that we witnessed and we all remember the yearning for the war to end and for our young service men and women to be brought home to be reunited with their families. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998660"></A>
Vietnam veterans have had more difficult circumstances to endure than other returned service men and women. Significant sections of Australian society opposed our involvement in this conflict. Upon return, less appreciation of the contribution of these young men and women was afforded to them than was the case at the end of the two great wars. I am pleased to say that increasingly this wrong is being righted in Australian society with the passage of time. Our Vietnam veterans today correctly occupy a highly respected place in our society, as they should. I join with others today and say that I am honoured to pay my respect to those veterans today and call on this House to reflect on the contribution that these men and women made on our behalf. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.35 am): Today I can announce 30 new art projects to be funded by the Queensland government right across the state. These projects between them will receive almost three quarters of a million dollars in Queensland government funding towards music, dance, design, theatre, writing festivals and cultural history. A new theatre work delving into the history of the Australian South Sea Islanders, an exhibition by kidnapped journalist Nigel Brennan and overseas performance opportunities for Queensland bands are among the 30 projects funded under this program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998921"></A>
Our government offers funding for many different arts projects across Queensland, and I am always struck by the richness, diversity and creativity of the successful applicants, many of whom come from regional, remote and rural parts of our state. This round of funding will explore our cultural history, with a new music theatre work delving into the history of Australian South Sea Islanders in Bowen, which will premiere as part of the 2011 Queensland Music Festival. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999002"></A>
The Mount Morgan social history collection will develop a permanent display about the region’s Indigenous community, while the Museum of Brisbane will research and present an exhibition profiling the city’s Asian-Australian identities. Funding will go towards developing a number of new theatre productions, as well as funding to tour successful Queensland productions nationally. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999049"></A>
In contemporary music, we are helping to fund national and international tours by Queensland based musicians. Writers will benefit from the project ‘Travelling Suitcases’, with a rich range of resources and artefacts about Queensland authors and illustrators available for loan to schools, public libraries and writers groups across the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999109"></A>
Funding is available as part of Arts Queensland’s grant program, which supports high-quality art projects that support the goals of the Queensland Arts and Cultural Sector Plan 2010-2013. I congratulate all of the recipients and I would encourage all members of the House to support those artists who have been successful in this round. <Hansard-Speech-End>

People’s Question Time</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999193"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.37 am): One of the most important and, in my experience, rewarding aspects of my job is talking directly to Queenslanders about the issues that matter to them. But in a state as decentralised as ours there are obviously some Queenslanders who do not often get the opportunity to put their questions and concerns directly to the state’s decision makers. Equally, for Queenslanders in less remote areas, I know that work and family commitments can make it hard to find the time to get along to events like community cabinets. This is where our government’s nation-leading people’s question time session comes in. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999316"></A>
I am pleased to advise the House that later today we will be holding another live online session. It will be the fourth people’s question time we have held this year. There are no limits on the kinds of questions Queenslanders can ask. If it matters to them, we want to hear about it. The Minister for Transport and the Minister for Main Roads will be joining the Treasurer and me on the panel for this session. So for those Queenslanders who might have a great suggestion for improving public transport or our road network or have an issue, question or a complaint, this will be a great opportunity for them to raise it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999427"></A>
There is still time for people to submit their questions and suggestions for discussion. They just have to follow the links from the Premier’s website. This session will also have an innovation--a Facebook page to engage more Queenslanders, particularly young Queenslanders, in people’s question time. Already 127 questions have been submitted online, and I encourage others to join us online from midday today. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Growth Management Summit</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.39 am): On the subject of participative democracy, I am pleased to advise the House that earlier this year, as members will recall, my government took the initiative to give Queenslanders the chance to be involved in talking about shaping their future, particularly in relation to population growth. The Queensland Growth Management Summit brought together more than 200 Queenslanders to debate and discuss ideas for managing growth and protecting the lifestyle we all love. We were joined by thousands of online viewers and hundreds more who had their say via live questions and surveys. The summit was a true forum for dialogue, discussion and debate. In all, summit participants generated around 1,400 ideas to ensure our future sustainability, prosperity and liveability. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002062"></A>
I am delighted to advise the House that the summit has been nominated for the 2011 Reinhard Mohn Prize for Revitalising Democracy through Participation. This award will be awarded by the German based foundation, Bertelsmann Stiftung. Founded in 1977, this foundation has invested around $666 million in over 700 projects which have demonstrated outstanding community involvement and outcomes. The 2011 prize--which is a substantial financial prize--will be ultimately decided by the foundation, but it will take into account the comments and support of people who have visited their website. So I urge those Queenslanders who were involved in the summit on the issue of population growth to go on the website and say what they thought of it. Links to the 2011 Reinhard Mohn Prize are on the Growth Management Summit website and comments and ratings must be completed by 22 August. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Seniors Week</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.40 am): As I outlined yesterday, this is Queensland’s Seniors Week. This afternoon I will have the pleasure of announcing the winners of the 2010 Premier’s Awards for Queensland Seniors. These awards recognise Queenslanders aged 60 and over whose volunteer work has had a significant impact on their community. Queensland’s seniors support a range of charities, community organisations and worthy causes which make a real difference to the lives of many Queenslanders. These people are the real ‘legends’ in Queensland life and it is only fitting that, as a community, we should honour them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002069"></A>
This year marks the 25th year of the awards program and over 450 Queensland seniors have received a Premier’s award since their introduction in 1986. Awards will be presented to 15 recipients at the ceremony this afternoon. This year an additional recipient will also receive a certificate of recognition for their outstanding work in community safety. The 16 winners, which include six Indigenous recipients, will be recognised for their invaluable contribution to Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002070"></A>
The theme of Seniors Week--Positively Ageless--reinforces the enduring benefits of a positive attitude to life. The winners of the Premier’s Awards for Queensland Seniors this year embody that theme, with the incredible passion, energy and commitment they display in their lives. The Premier’s Awards for Queensland Seniors offers us all an opportunity to say thank you to our seniors, particularly those who are volunteers. On behalf of all members of the House, I offer our thanks. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Oral Health</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002073"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (9.43 am): Dental health is an important issue for all Queenslanders. Already the Bligh government has demonstrated its commitment to improving oral health by introducing fluoride in 2008. This vital public health measure will help to reduce levels of tooth decay by up to 40 per cent and benefit the oral health of all Queenslanders. We provide the most generous dental services in Australia, with 45.3 per cent of the population--more than 1.9 million people--eligible for public dental services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002074"></A>
Last financial year, the Bligh government funded public oral health services to the tune of approximately $166 million. Last year, Queensland public oral health services delivered 472,701 occasions of service to adults and 457,272 occasions of service to children aged zero to 15. On an average day in Queensland, there are 1,881 adult dental appointments and 1,804 child and adolescent dental appointments, and 916 children and adolescents complete dental treatment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002075"></A>
Demand for public oral health services is increasing due to population growth, ageing of the population and greater numbers of people retaining their natural teeth. Moreover, Queensland children have long had the poorest oral health in the nation. The AIHW Child Dental Health Survey in 2004 confirmed that Queensland children had more filled teeth, extractions and decayed teeth than any other state or territory. The Bligh government’s introduction of fluoride will make inroads to redress this but it will take time.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002076"></A>
We are also implementing measures to educate Queenslanders of all ages about the importance of good oral health and how to achieve this. A great example of this is the toothbrushing program being run by Queensland Health’s Logan-Beaudesert Oral Health Service. This initiative is successfully working to help over 16,000 children across 43 primary schools and 65 day care centres adopt and maintain better oral hygiene habits. To date, Queensland Health has handed out 16,600 free toothbrushes to children and conducted 2,300 education sessions across the district.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002077"></A>
Dental services for children must be a key priority, not only for us as a government but particularly for parents and members of our local communities. The great work our dental professionals do is very important, but there is one thing it does not replace--that is, it is important that parents play a role in educating their families about good oral hygiene and establishing good oral health routines. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002078"></A>
Having said that, even children with the best oral health will still need to have their teeth looked at and tended to from time to time, and that is something important that we all need to work towards. It requires a three-pronged approach: ensuring families are taking responsibility for their children’s oral health and being proactive in this; implementing public health measures such as water fluoridation; and introducing new approaches to healthcare innovation. That is why I was pleased last week to visit Jimboomba State School to open a new $786,800 super-sized dental van, one of six vans being progressively rolled out across Queensland. In fact, the school captains assisted me to cut the dental floss ribbon we had there.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002079"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Hinchliffe:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Why didn’t you bite through it?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002080"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 You are supposed to put it between your teeth, not bite it. These new vans are the flagship of a $14.15 million program to modernise our public oral health fleet, helping to increase our capacity to treat those eligible for public dental services by providing oral health services for patients of all ages across the state. They are equipped to deal with all types of routine oral health services. These vans are also totally mobile, allowing them to be taken to places where there is limited or no local access to oral health services currently. They are also designed to assist in providing services to special needs patients, with access for wheelchair bound and physically impaired patients. The five remaining super-sized vans will be rolled out over the next six to 12 months and will be allocated to Darling Downs-West Moreton, Metro North, the Sunshine Coast, Townsville and the Gold Coast health service districts. Under this new program, up to 50 new replacement single surgery vans and four new replacement self-drive mobile dental clinic vehicles will also be built. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002081"></A>
Unfortunately, the government’s efforts to improve the oral health of Queenslanders are being hampered by those opposite who are continuing to help block vital funding in the Senate. The federal government’s dental program would have delivered an extra $52.8 million to Queensland and would have provided an extra 187,000 dental consultations and treatments. Queenslanders waiting to receive these dental services cannot access this funding because Liberal and National senators have blocked this funding in the Senate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002082"></A>
Yet the hypocrisy in this area is astounding. Those on the other side of the House have repeatedly made statements and repeatedly written to me about dental health, like the members for Caloundra, Dalrymple, Callide and Southern Downs and even the member for Surfers Paradise. It is time the Liberals and Nationals in Queensland ended their hypocrisy and stood up to their colleagues--</Hansard-Body>

Digicel Pacific</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (9.49 am): Actions always speak louder than words. Yet another international company has voted with its feet and moved to create a permanent home base here in Queensland. Digicel Pacific, part of the Irish owned Digicel Group, is a mobile phone network provider currently operating across Oceania, Central America and the Caribbean. After negotiations with the government, we have beaten Auckland and Sydney, and have secured to Brisbane Digicel’s decision to relocate its regional headquarters from the South Pacific to Eagle Farm, in the electorate of the shadow Treasurer.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003177"></A>
The company has already started recruiting and expects to create up to 29 full-time jobs in the near term. Its decision to relocate to Brisbane means we will be the regional home for a company that operates in 32 markets worldwide, has 5,500 employees and investments exceeding $4 billion. Within our region, Digicel Pacific’s current markets are Fiji, Nauru, PNG, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu, and the company has recently been awarded a licence to operate in Tahiti. It is the biggest telecommunications company across the Pacific Island, with more than 1.7 million customers and employing more than 900 people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003178"></A>
Digicel Pacific has recognised the growth potential of the Queensland economy, the pro-business policy settings, low business taxes, the skilled workforce and the lifestyle benefits which only Queensland can offer. Its choice of Queensland adds to our reputation for attracting high-growth, entrepreneurial companies and acknowledges our state’s expertise in ICT and professional services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003180"></A>
Digicel’s arrival also represents good prospects for Queensland based ICT and telecommunications companies to supply wireless applications and other niche technologies to them into the future, particularly into its expanding market in remote areas such as PNG. It is our proactive work that will continue to grow Queensland’s reputation as an ideal investment location and a great place to do business. While others will go to extreme lengths to talk down the merits of the Queensland economy, the facts tell a different story. The decision by Digicel is a further endorsement of Queensland’s reputation as a first-class destination for investment. Again, actions speak louder than words. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (9.51 am): The construction industry is doing it tough around Australia as it still struggles to recover from the global financial crisis. However, a helping hand has been provided by this government, which is providing more support to the industry than any other state in Australia. We have a massive $17.1 billion infrastructure program protecting 106,000 jobs. The Gillard government has also been keeping the Australian construction industry afloat through the Building the Education Revolution and other stimulus programs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003185"></A>
We have two levels of Labor governments making extraordinary efforts to keep construction workers in work and stimulate the economy. However, in an article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunshine Coast Daily</Hansard-Italic>
 on 11 August, the member for Maroochydore demanded the Bligh government urgently do more for Sunshine Coast construction workers. I note that Mayor Abbot also made some gratuitous remarks. I point out to the mayor that this government is committed to the biggest public construction project on the Sunshine Coast. It seems to have escaped the mayor’s attention that the Sunshine Coast has the biggest public building project in the history of the Sunshine Coast to look forward to--the 9,000 jobs created by the Sunshine Coast University Hospital. One wonders what Mayor Abbot is doing to mirror such activity by the state government and whether he took the same steps to create jobs in the construction industry the way his colleagues on the Gold Coast have done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003188"></A>
However, the hypocrisy and opportunism from the member for Maroochydore rankles the most because of her disgraceful attempt to gain credit for something she opposed. The member for Maroochydore and her party opposed our record Queensland infrastructure spending. Her LNP federal colleagues opposed the BER. They said that it was a wasteful program even though a recent independent report found that it achieved its economic objectives. The LNP prefers to waste people’s lives rather than spend a few dollars.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003189"></A>
The Sunshine Coast is well and truly on the Bligh government’s radar to assist the building industry. From 2013 the Sunshine Coast will have Australia’s--</Hansard-Body>

 I will go back to it, Mr Speaker. The member for Maroochydore and her party are opposed to our record Queensland infrastructure spending. Her LNP federal colleagues opposed the BER.

The Sunshine Coast is well and truly on the Bligh government’s radar to assist the building industry. From 2013 the Sunshine Coast will have Australia’s biggest construction project when 9,000 jobs will start to be delivered on the Sunshine Coast University Hospital project. In a <Hansard-Italic>
Sunshine Coast Daily</Hansard-Italic>
 article on 24 July, the hospital project was hailed as a job saviour of the Sunshine Coast. However, the university hospital would not even be on the radar if the member for Maroochydore or other members on the Sunshine Coast had their way and cut the Capital Works Program as they propose to do. Until that happens, 1,150 jobs are totally dependent on this state government on the Sunshine Coast--again opposed by the four members on the Sunshine Coast who are opposed to our capital works borrowings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003201"></A>
From next year there will be hundreds more jobs at a private hospital at Kawana fast-tracked by this government. Further, the Gillard government has spent $421 million on projects in 213 Sunshine Coast state schools and $64 million on 221 social housing dwellings--again delivering many jobs to the people of the Sunshine Coast. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (9.55 am): It is important that I set the record straight in relation to the recovery of costs associated with government providing water security to the south-east of the state through the South-East Queensland water grid. What I am about to read is the ministerial media statement issued to the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 and reporter Steven Wardill last evening. It is the news you did not read this morning, so I would like to read it now into the public record. It began with this clear statement of fact--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1003207"></A>
No planning or pre-construction costs associated with the Traveston Crossing Dam proposal will be passed on to consumers through water prices. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1009174"></A>
The South-East Queensland Water Grid cost the Bligh Government $7 billion to construct and was a necessary investment to provide water security within the region for generations to come. The expenditure would have been $9 billion had the Traveston Crossing Dam been built. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<A ID="pgfId-1009175"></A>
...</Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1009176"></A>
The Government has been very transparent in its plans and has previously outlined details of the first five years of a 10-year price plan to recover the costs of the Grid. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003216"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Correct. That price path was released nearly 12 months before the Traveston Dam was cancelled. I return to the statement--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1003219"></A>
That plan effectively caps the bulk water price increases in any year. While we may be able to review prices in the final years of the price path, it is too soon to make changes ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1003220"></A>
given that we are still charging below cost for bulk water supplied to the council run water retailers. It continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1003222"></A>
In December last year, the ... Government wrote off $265 million in non-recoverable project costs associated with the Traveston Crossing Dam proposal. No Queenslander is paying any costs of Traveston Dam in their water bill and no costs were ever scheduled for the first five years of the price plan.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<A ID="pgfId-1003223"></A>
... </Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1003225"></A>
This year alone, the Government has incurred a $407 million loss to provide bulk water to the council-run water retail entities.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1003227"></A>
Charging less to provide bulk water than what it cost is why the commitment to the first five years of the price plan must be maintained ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1003229"></A>
Had the Bligh Government not been subsidising this price, we would expect to see the effects of Traveston Crossing Dam immediately in pricing. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1003231"></A>
It is anticipated that in five years the cost of the water grid project could be approaching break-even point. It continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1003234"></A>
At that point, the absence of Traveston Crossing Dam costs may be taken into consideration, which may result in lower price increases for the second five years of the plan than previously anticipated ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1003236"></A>
But all factors affecting the price of bulk water, including population growth interest rates and capital depreciation and operating costs of the water grid also will need to be considered. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003238"></A>
To suggest, as the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 did this morning, that South-East Queensland households are being hit with massive water price hikes to pay off a dam that will not be built is, quite simply, wrong. From the statement I have just read out, for whatever reason or purpose it appears to have been ignored by the <Hansard-Italic>

Police Service, Railway Squad</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (9.59 am): The Bligh government is strongly committed to creating a safe and secure environment for passengers and staff travelling on Brisbane’s rail networks. To that end, we have a dedicated police Railway Squad who are tasked with providing a visible uniform police presence on the Queensland Rail Citytrain network. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004553"></A>
By working with Queensland Rail’s transit officers, the police Railway Squad aims to create an environment that promotes passenger and staff confidence in their personal safety and security. They are also responsible for the delivery of proactive initiatives to deter, detect and prosecute offenders for offences occurring on the rail network. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004554"></A>
Last year the squad was involved in 178 operations, targeting criminal offences and good order behaviour on the network. During this period the squad conducted 27,669 hours of network patrols and issued 3,304 infringement notices. They do a great job in difficult circumstances. I commend the squad for its professionalism and commitment to commuter safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004556"></A>
I am pleased to inform the House today that the Police Commissioner has allocated an extra 10 police officers to join the Railway Squad to further enhance commuter safety. The allocation of these additional officers takes the strength of the Railway Squad to 64 members and means an enhanced focus on providing a safe service for more than 66 million passenger journeys on the network each year. The unit already includes a dedicated intelligence unit, a crime prevention coordinator and a firearms explosive detection dog capability. Five officers will become operational this financial year with the remaining five coming on line in 2011-12. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004557"></A>
This government is delivering on its commitment to a safe and secure Queensland. In this year’s budget we announced funding for an additional 203 police officers as part of our commitment to employ a minimum of 600 extra police officers during this term of government. We have allocated more than $270 million to upgrade, refurbish and replace police stations and facilities, vehicles and equipment. These new Railway Squad officers will mean a safer journey for Queenslanders travelling on Brisbane trains. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. RG NOLAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport) (10.01 am): The Bligh government is passionately committed to public transport and, of course, is committed to the safety of passengers and staff on the public transport network. Passengers should be reassured that South-East Queensland trains and rail stations are safe and that incidents are rare. Over the past five years, the number of incidents has remained steady despite a large increase in public transport usage. According to official police figures, for every 175,000 trips taken, one incident is reported. But one incident is one too many and we want to remain ever vigilant. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004562"></A>
We already have 6,800 CCTV cameras, 54 Railway Squad police and up to 110 transit officers keeping our trains and stations safe. Throughout the day, trains and stations are patrolled by transit officers and the Railway Squad. After 7 pm on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, every train carries security guards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004563"></A>
I warmly welcome the extra 10 police officers who will be assigned to the Railway Squad over the next year. These officers will bring the number of Railway Squad officers to 64. In addition, 10 senior network officers are currently being trained and will be deployed next month. The new transit officers will have extra powers to search and detain offenders and also ban repeat offenders. Our front-line officers are supported by an extensive network of CCTV cameras. I am advised the clean-up rate for crimes on the rail network is good with these cameras assisting police to identify and track down offenders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004564"></A>
We have a commitment to ensure rail staff work in a safe environment. The suggestion that our employees and contracted security guards are told they are to be hands off is quite simply untrue. They are trained to diffuse potentially volatile situations in a non-physical way, but are also well within their rights to intervene to defend themselves or passengers if a situation turns violent. I am pleased to report that customer service satisfaction levels for security and safety on the TransLink network are at the highest levels since the surveys were first conducted three years ago.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004565"></A>
The Bligh government is very serious about public transport security. While the rate of incidents is fortunately low, we are deploying more transit officers and more police to ensure passengers and staff can go about their business safely. <Hansard-Speech-End>

North West Regional Plan</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004569"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. SJ HINCHLIFFE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Infrastructure and Planning) (10.04 am): Last week I had the pleasure of launching the North West Regional Plan in Mount Isa--a statutory plan to guide social and economic growth in the north-west over the next 20 years. With local leadership from the member for Mount Isa and the region’s five mayors we have developed a blueprint which strikes the right balance between the north-west’s social, economic and environmental needs. This will ensure development is appropriate to the region. It will ensure a sustainable economy. It will provide well planned and coordinated infrastructure and services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004571"></A>
This is the most recent regional plan and is evidence that Queensland is leading the way in managing growth. In partnership with the Gillard government we are moving this great state forward. As already mentioned by the Premier, in March the Bligh government hosted the Queensland Growth Management Summit, the first of its kind in Australia. A key strategy to managing Queensland’s population is to promote growth in our regions. To this end, the Bligh government announced on 1 June 2010 an additional $4,000 for first home buyers in regional areas. We have also made plans to support this population growth with strong local economies and jobs with a Queensland regionalisation strategy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004573"></A>
Julia Gillard also understands the importance of Queensland’s regions and has committed heavily to those areas. In contrast, Tony Abbott only has eyes for Sydney and would rob our regions of the investment they deserve. Let me list some of the commitments the Gillard government has already made to Queensland’s regions. They include: $200 million to flood proof Townsville’s roads, while Abbott would watch the city sink in the wet season; $95 million for the Calliope Crossroads near Gladstone, and nothing from Abbott; $54 million for the Blacksoil interchange near Ipswich, and nothing from Abbott; $50 million to the Gladstone Port Access Road, and nothing from Abbott; $48 million to the Townsville Convention and Entertainment Centre, $18 million more than Abbott; $40 million for the Bruce and Capricorn Highway intersection, and nothing from Abbott; and $14.4 million to the Cairns Base Hospital, $7 million to the Mackay GP superclinic and $5 million to the Emerald GP superclinic, all of which will receive nothing under Abbott. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004574"></A>
This list could go on and on embarrassing that wannabe Prime Minister every step of the way. We know Tony Abbott will cut vital funding to our regions and that is why Tony Abbott is a risk the Queensland economy can just not afford. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. KL STRUTHERS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Algester--ALP) (Minister for Community Services and Housing and Minister for Women) (10.07 am): The Bligh government is on track to deliver the biggest social housing investment Queensland has ever seen. On top of our Queensland Future Fund we are on track to see 3,000 new social housing dwellings built by the end of this year with the help of the federal Labor government’s stimulus package. This $1.2 billion investment in the Queensland economy is contributing to 12 straight months of job creation. We have created more jobs than any other state over the last four months alone. By the end of the last financial year our investment in conjunction with the federal Gillard government had generated more than 1,600 jobs in the Queensland construction industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004579"></A>
More than 2,700 dwellings are already underway and due to be finished by the end of the year. In the Far North, around 50 per cent of construction jobs have vanished since August 2008. We have offset that with $51 million worth of housing projects, which are creating more than 320 jobs. In the Wide Bay-Burnett region, 38 per cent of construction jobs disappeared. We are investing another $62 million to help keep another 380 workers employed.</Hansard-Body>

On receiving a letter from me about this stimulus package on the Gold Coast, what did the LNP member for Fadden have to say? He took the trouble to ring my office yesterday. What he did say? He said the stimulus package--and I have to spell it because it is unparliamentary language--was c-r-a-p. He did not say it once. He definitely had his cranky pants on. He said it four times. That is what he thinks of the stimulus package. He and his colleagues in the federal parliament, what did they do about the stimulus package? They opposed it in the federal parliament. </Hansard-Body>

 I do not want you to say it. It is unparliamentary, and it is unparliamentary to try to intrude it into this House by quoting someone else. It also aids the chair if when ministers are giving a ministerial statement they give a statement. What causes disorder in this House is when the ministerial statement starts to attack another member and that other member responds, quite naturally. I then am forced into either trying to listen to the ministerial statement or giving the member who feels offended the chance to defend themselves. So I say to all ministers that it helps the House if when they are giving a ministerial statement they do so and then allow the opposition member to respond if they are under attack.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. A PALASZCZUK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Inala--ALP) (Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs) (10.10 am): Research from quality publications such as the journal of <Hansard-Italic>
Child: Care, Health and Development</Hansard-Italic>
 suggests that the environment in which people live can play an important role in promoting self-determination and independence. People with a disability who continue to live in their own communities can have improved quality of life and reduced social isolation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005915"></A>
The Bligh government is committed to helping Queenslanders living with a disability retain their independence and remain active members of their community. For six years now we have been providing drop-in support services in the Brisbane area. We are providing over $500,000 in funding each year. This can be for things that appear simple to us--making dinner, having a shower or getting ready for the next morning for a medical appointment. However, to people with a disability these tasks can seem overwhelming.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005916"></A>
In Brisbane we have had outstanding success, allowing over 40 people the often minimal support they need to stay living in their own homes. Today I am pleased to announce that I am expanding this project state-wide, investing $2.5 million to allow more than 140 people with a disability to remain living in their own homes. We will direct this funding into a number of regional and Brisbane based non-government service providers so they can deliver the essential support that is needed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005919"></A>
Where is this funding going? In Brisbane, $100,000 is going to the electorate of Ashgrove. In Yeerongpilly, $250,000 is going to the Cerebral Palsy League. In Central Queensland, $219,000 is going to Rockhampton and there is $50,000 for the Central Highlands and Western Queensland Family Support Association. In the south-west, $100,000 is going to Focal Extended at Ipswich and in Toowoomba--where is the member for Toowoomba North?--$250,000 is going to the Cerebral Palsy League. On the Gold Coast, $350,000 is going to Accommodation Network Pty Ltd at Tweed Heads. On the Sunshine Coast--where is the member for Nicklin?</Hansard-Body>

This is good news for the people of Queensland. It is great news because we believe in improving people’s quality of life. We believe in ensuring that people with a disability get the support that they need to lead rich and rewarding lives, not just in South-East Queensland but right across the state. We believe in creating inclusive communities but, most importantly, we believe in looking past the disability and focusing on people’s abilities. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Shipwrecks Survey</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Hon. KJ JONES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ashgrove--ALP) (Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability) (10.13 am): The mysteries of Queensland’s underwater history are set to be unveiled as part of a major survey of our state’s shipwrecks to be undertaken over the next five years. Our coastline is littered with untold stories under the sea, many dating back centuries. Through a state-wide survey to start in Moreton Bay later this year, we hope to discover more about the historic sites off Queensland’s coast to provide a clear picture for the public about the mysteries on our ocean floor. The survey will be carried out by the heritage branch of the Department of Environment and Resource Management, which has recently taken over management of Queensland’s historic shipwrecks from the Queensland Museum.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005945"></A>
We know that there are more than 1,000 historic shipwrecks or abandoned vessels along the state’s coast, as well as in our rivers and bays. But in most cases data on these shipwrecks is often scant and often inaccurate. Every one of these ships is an archeological site which can tell us much more about the lives of past generations of Queenslanders and others who have visited our shores. Through this survey we will tap into the broad range of skills and equipment within our heritage, marine sciences and marine parks units to locate as many wrecks as possible and determine their significance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005946"></A>
We know that there is a wealth of information about unidentified shipwrecks among interested members of the community, historical researchers and diving groups. In the first stage of this survey we will be calling on members of the public, research organisations and these diving groups to help build our knowledge of historical sites, starting with Moreton Bay. Following this, the department will next year commence targeted field operations using technology such as side-scan sonar to confirm actual locations for mapping and preservation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005947"></A>
We want to ensure Queensland’s precious maritime heritage is properly managed and, where appropriate, made accessible to the general public. This survey is an exciting step toward better understanding our state’s underwater history so we can protect our historic shipwrecks for future generations to appreciate.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Trade Training Centres</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Hon. GJ WILSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (10.16 am): Anyone who has visited a Queensland school trade training centre would be aware of their importance. These centres are providing new employment pathways for students who would have once fallen into unemployment. To see this one only has to look at Tagai State College on Thursday Island, which I had the pleasure of visiting some time ago. The state college has centres for excellence in marine science, art, culture and language for students from pre-prep to TAFE. Over the last two years Tagai students have entered university, TAFE and employment in record numbers. Under the college’s service guarantee, every graduating year 12 student must be in university, vocational education and training, or paid employment within six months of finishing school. We are seeing better results in literacy and numeracy, higher retention rates and improved transition into meaningful education, training and employment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005953"></A>
Since 2007 the number of Tagai year 12 students going to university has doubled, with 75 per cent of students having gone on to university, entered vocational education and training or undertaken further study. The Queensland government continues to work with the local Tagai community to build on these great results. The next stage of this partnership is the $1.5 million TagaiSkills Trade Training Centre. The new trade training centre will help ensure students in the Torres Strait have access to a broad range of training opportunities across a total of 17 islands in the Torres Strait. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005956"></A>
The Trade Training Centres in Schools project includes a new building and construction facility, upgrades to the existing hospitality centre at Tagai State College and other matters. The all-weather construction area and engineering workshop is completed, with 20 students currently undertaking training. A major upgrade of existing hospitality facilities will also create an industry standard commercial kitchen with a restaurant. The centre will offer Torres Strait students certificate III qualifications in engineering, construction, cookery and hospitality through partnering with the Tropical North Queensland Institute of TAFE.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005960"></A>
The Liberal National Party would close this centre and cancel local training programs. Mr Abbott and the Liberal National Party would not have the guts to visit Thursday Island and tell them truthfully of their plans to cut these services. The Bligh government wants to give every Queenslander a flying start to education and life. Under the Liberal National Party education and training cuts, we will end up with uneducated, untrained and unemployed young Queenslanders. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Townsville, Infrastructure Projects</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Hon. CA WALLACE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Thuringowa--ALP) (Minister for Main Roads) (10.18 am): Hot on the heels of the Premier’s Queensland Growth Management Summit and the regionalisation forums around the state, Townsville is poised to take its place as our state’s second capital. Indeed, on Friday my director-general and senior executives will head north for top-level talks on roads and transport. You could say that Capital Hill will come to Castle Hill, and roads will be high on our agenda.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007425"></A>
The Bligh government is rolling out a record number of new projects in the north. We are building the infrastructure that is needed to meet our future growth. It makes sense to encourage more people to live and work in the north to ease the pressure down here in South-East Queensland and to build stronger regional economies. This year alone, we are spending $48 million on the Douglas Arterial Road--480 local jobs over the life of the whole project. We are building extra lanes on Kern Brothers Drive--$3 million and more jobs. As the member for Hinchinbrook knows, work is well underway on a $115 million upgrade of the Cardwell Range Road--around 420 local jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007429"></A>
As the minister for infrastructure announced this morning, the great news is that the Gillard government will commit to the $200 million completion of the Townsville Ring Road. That is 1,500 jobs for locals, working on a road that will meet the needs of North Queensland drivers for the next 30 years. It is shaping up to be a big year in Townsville--one of our biggest years when it comes to infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007437"></A>
We are going from strength to strength in the north, proving that we are Queensland’s second capital. On Friday, I look forward to hosting the first of many top-level talks in our region. It is a golden opportunity for us to build on our strengths, to build better roads, to deliver more jobs and to kick-start local economies. We are paving the roads and paving the way for a better and brighter future for North Queenslanders. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Locusts</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. TS MULHERIN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland) (10.21 am): This spring Queensland is facing its worst locust plague in more than 30 years, which is why Biosecurity Queensland has been conducting intensive survey and spraying operations over the winter. Huge swarms of spur-throated locusts are expected to increase in Western Queensland in August. At the same time, Australian plague locusts, which are of great concern in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, are expected to hatch in South-West Queensland. These two different locust species have the potential to damage 1.3 million hectares of Queensland’s valuable cropping land. The hundreds of millions of locusts that are expected make this the biggest plague since 1973-74 are a result of increased rainfall in Western Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007442"></A>
Biosecurity Queensland has been working hard over the winter to mitigate the potential impacts of this plague and so far our teams have controlled 55 swarms, covering almost 13,000 hectares in Western and Central Queensland. Biosecurity Queensland officers have been implementing ground and aerial surveillance and spraying operations, working primarily between Barcaldine, Blackall, Charleville and Cunnamulla. Biosecurity Queensland has been concentrating on spraying plagues in Western Queensland before they move east and threaten our multimillion dollar Central Highlands and Darling Downs cropping regions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007443"></A>
The winter months are the ideal time for spraying, as locusts band together in swarms and present a good target for aerial spraying. Although the control of locusts is a landholder responsibility, locusts are recognised as being a community problem. We have already spent about $200,000 this year, with reports of large swarms already starting to disperse, Biosecurity Queensland will be doing everything it can to find them and hit them with spray. We have also been working with local councils, landholders and industry to communicate the risks posed by locusts and to gain cooperation for spraying. Biosecurity Queensland will continue to undertake an increased control program to do everything it can to reduce the extent of damage caused by this plague. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007446"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. D BOYLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships) (10.23 am): Today I announce $73.4 million in funding over two years to support services and jobs in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. This funding is being delivered under two programs: the State Government Financial Aid initiative and the Revenue Replacement Program. This funding, which is going to some of our most remote councils, translates to over $36 million this year for municipal services and the jobs that go with them. Agreements will be negotiated council by the council as to how these moneys are best applied.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007449"></A>
Projects will include making sure water and waste water systems are in good working order, improving drainage, maintaining roads and building footpaths, especially in the town area. The funding also supports services like rubbish collection, libraries and streetlighting and ensures that communities have access to public facilities, sporting fields and swimming pools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007450"></A>
Of the funding, $32.7 million comes from the State Government Financial Aid program and goes to 16 Indigenous councils. It is needed because these councils do not have sufficient rateable land to generate income, as do mainstream councils. There is also a grant of $564,060 for the Torres Strait Island Regional Council under the Heavy Equipment Management and Training Program. Not only does this money go towards the cost of providing plant and equipment to Torres Strait Island communities but also to training council employees on how to safely use them. The remaining $3.5 million is provided under the Revenue Replacement Program, replacing income previously generated for councils through liquor sales. We have guaranteed the nine councils involved $14.1 million in total over four years to 2012. What this support does is help them provide community services historically funded by profits from canteen alcohol sales. This year’s $36 million allocation takes the state’s total contribution under these programs to Indigenous councils for 2010-11 to $39.9 million. That is state government funding to help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander councils move forward.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Tonight the Prime Minister and the federal opposition leader will participate in a town hall style debate in front of real Queenslanders who are able to ask real questions. Less than an hour ago the Premier spruiked the merits of people’s question time. I will today be inviting media outlets to host a town hall style debate between us on the most important economic issues facing Queenslanders--that is, privatisation of our assets and the AAA credit rating--and I ask: will the Premier front up or will she hide? </Hansard-Body>

. I think all electors have seen more opportunity for more direct answers to unfiltered, direct questions from the public in this election than certainly I can remember in my lifetime. It might have happened a long time ago when the original parish pump meetings were held, but we have not seen it for a long time and I certainly applaud it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009232"></A>
I will be very happy to do the same in the state campaign that is due in 2012. What is the Leader of the Opposition talking about? He is talking about opportunities to debate in an election campaign. I will be happy to do that. What opportunity does the Leader of the Opposition have to debate me on these issues? Every second week that he comes into this parliament he has the opportunity to debate the issues and he has the opportunity to question me. I am very happy to do that every second week. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009233"></A>
I am very happy also to take the question from the member for Southern Downs. Not content to let his leader ask the question of the Premier, he wanted to ask another question. He asked what I have been doing during the federal election campaign. The first thing I did in the federal election campaign was stand up as the first Premier in Australia with the Prime Minister and announce the biggest piece of infrastructure to be funded by a federal government. And what kind of government is it? It is a Labor government that is delivering the rail to Redcliffe. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009234"></A>
I was then very happy to stand with federal minister Joe Ludwig and start the process on the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project. I was very happy again to stand with Joe Ludwig and open the new food and fibre research centre as part of the election campaign. And I was very happy to be on the stage as the president of the Australian Labor Party introducing and welcoming people to our launch. That is unlike those opposite, who have not been seen. I do not think the Leader of the Opposition was even at the launch of the LNP. He was hiding under the bed again.</Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My second question without notice is also to the Premier. Yesterday the Treasurer whinged and whined that no-one was issuing press releases about positive economic data. Today I table the latest figures confirming that corporate collapses in Queensland have skyrocketed by 47 per cent in June this year compared to June last year, a jump never before seen in ASIC records. I cannot find a press release that the Treasurer issued commenting on this data, and I ask: could the Premier advise what positive news there is in a record number of corporate collapses under Labor’s watch in Queensland?</Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for his question. I draw attention to the fact that I certainly did not hear the Treasurer whingeing or whining yesterday. What I heard him doing was condemning those opposite in no uncertain terms for their continual efforts to drag Queensland down. There is no doubt that Queensland has had a rough time in the global financial crisis. The data that the member opposite is presenting is hard evidence that Queensland companies did it tough and some did not survive. What were the plans of those opposite to help the Queensland economy when it needed it most? </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Their plan was to cut jobs. What would that have done for more businesses? They were going to cut jobs out of the public sector. Twelve thousand jobs would have been cut. That is 12,000 people not shopping, not buying food and not buying houses, thereby endangering even more small businesses, even more companies. In fact, people will recall the member for Southern Downs standing around scratching his head saying, ‘What financial crisis?’ Queensland did it tough. There is no doubt about it. That is why we went to the election and said that jobs would be our No. 1 priority. We have kept that promise and we are delivering. It has been delivered for 12 straight months. </Hansard-Body>

What is the proposal that the federal leader of the LNP is taking to the people of Australia on Saturday? Cuts to jobs, cuts to services, sacking people in the federal Public Service and an increase in company tax. That is a tax on Woolworths and Coles--a tax on groceries.</Hansard-Body>

 Absolutely, and you could not get a more stark contrast. Labor will tax the big companies that are making a profit out of our country to put it back into regional areas and those opposite will tax the grocery stores where every Australian needs to buy their groceries every week. Australians do have a choice on Saturday. They should not choose Tony Abbott, who will cut jobs, slash services, wind back the economy, do more damage in Queensland than in any state of Australia with his efforts to pull back on the NBN, and tax every business, every company and every store so that every Australian will feel it. </Hansard-Body>

Ms DARLING:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is for the Premier. Can the Premier update the House on the progress of the government’s plan to create 100,000 jobs and build tomorrow’s Queensland? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010846"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As I have just recalled for everybody, last year the Labor team and I went to the Queensland electorate with a very clear promise. We said we would make jobs our No. 1 priority. We said we would make it our organising and guiding principle to create and deliver 100,000 jobs into the Queensland economy. How did we say we would do that? It was not just pie in the sky. We had a very clear strategy. Firstly, we would keep our record building program going and, secondly, we would have the backbone to make the tough decisions necessary to do that. That is what we have done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010847"></A>
What is that infrastructure program delivering? It is making Queensland the jobs capital of Australia. For 12 months in a row--every single month for the past year--Queensland has created jobs. In the past four months, Queensland has created more jobs than any other state in Australia. In the past four weeks 5,600 new jobs were created in Queensland. That is what happens with a government that is committed to the dignity of work and to ensuring that Queensland families have an income. We are halfway through the term of this government and we are nearly two-thirds of the way to that job target. We are halfway through the term of the government and we are beyond the halfway point in our target. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010848"></A>
Our building program is not just creating jobs for Queensland. We are leaving a legacy for Queensland. We are creating the infrastructure needed by growing populations in communities across this state. For example, we have completed the new $350 million Sir Leo Hielscher Bridge, which is part of a $2 billion investment in the Gateway Upgrade Project, and motorists are already enjoying the benefit of that. In Mackay, the $148 million Forgan Bridge duplication is underway. Motorists are already using the new bridge while the original bridge is being upgraded. In Townsville, the $110 million Douglas Arterial section of the Townsville Ring Road is being delivered. A partnership with the federal Labor government will help deliver the rest of it. In my own area we are building the next stages of the Eastern Busway. We are also building the next part of the big busway network for South-East Queensland, which is the Northern Busway. We are using massive tunnel-boring machines to build Airport Link. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010851"></A>
Importantly, we are building social infrastructure that really underpins the health and wellbeing of communities. We are upgrading hospitals and building world-class facilities in Cairns, the Gold Coast, Mackay, Townsville, Mount Isa, Rockhampton and here in Brisbane. That is the difference between a Labor government that believes in building and a Liberal National Party that believes in slashing. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 There is nothing to laugh about in unemployment. Last year when we went to the election, thousands of Queenslanders were facing a dole queue. We understood that and we understood that if, as a government, we were going to do the responsible thing, we had to put our foot on the pedal and invest in the building program that is building communities, building demand for products and services, and building jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010868"></A>
The jobs that result from our investment are only one part of what happens when we commit to duplicate a bridge, or build a new road or a new hospital. It is only one part of it. What are the other parts? Wherever possible, all the services and materials are sourced from Queensland companies. Queensland companies are getting the contracts and without those contracts the companies would be collapsing. We know that when those opposite have work or jobs to do, such as setting up their commercial website, they send it all to New South Wales. Yesterday we talked about the website, but I did not have a chance to tell the House that the project was given to a New South Wales company. What are they doing?

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms GRACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The Bligh government has been focused on strengthening the Queensland economy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Can the Premier outline to the House how the government is helping Queensland families deal with cost of living pressures? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010878"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In the Labor Party we believe that the greatest thing any government can do to make sure families can pay their bills is to keep them in work. We believe in the dignity of work, we believe in job creation programs and we believe in investing in public infrastructure, all of which drives the economy. We understand that Queensland mums, dads and pensioners want to provide for themselves and are prepared to do that by working hard if work is available. We have been focused on supporting jobs to ensure that Queensland families do not suffer the consequences of the global economic downturn. There is no doubt that there is more work to be done in Queensland and we are getting on with the job of doing it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010879"></A>
However, we should applaud those Queensland businesses that have kept their heads above water in the financial crisis, such as those that have worked with the government to make sure they get contracts out of our big projects. If we look around the world, parts of the United States are experiencing unemployment at rates not seen since the Great Depression and parts of the Japanese economy are falling way behind the performance of Queensland and Queensland companies. We want Queensland families to feel secure in work and that is why jobs will continue to be our No. 1 priority. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010880"></A>
However, we also want to make sure that we are helping Queenslanders to make every dollar count. That is why in the last budget we did everything we could to help, in the financial circumstances we faced. We introduced a new first home owners grant for regional Queenslanders buying their first homes. In the previous budget we abolished stamp duty and mortgage duty for first home owners. We made changes to CTP insurance to help save motorists money. We introduced half-price travel for pensioners and a ClimateSmart Home Service through which Queensland families can save up to $325 annually on power bills. Almost 200,000 Queensland households have taken up that opportunity. We are out there, helping people to use and conserve energy wisely and thereby cut their bills as, indeed, our solar program is doing. The greatest threat to the cost of living of Queenslanders is a Tony Abbott federal government. What has he said? He wants to put a 1.5 per cent increase on company tax. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, that is right. The member for Callide tabled a letter last time parliament sat in relation to a meeting that I had with the member for Cleveland. He raised the matter and I said, ‘I’ll go and have a talk to you about it,’ and then he complains about me physically speaking with people. That is the way those opposite work. They are funny. They complain when they raise something and I say, ‘I would like to talk to you personally about it,’ and I do that, but then apparently that is not responding when I offer to personally meet a member of parliament to talk about their concern. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012780"></A>
I am more than happy to have a look at that. One of the things we have pride in under this government is the very substantial increase in the number of staff that we have employed in Queensland Health. One of the things that we have done under this government is significantly increase the pay for our workforce--whether that be our medical staff or indeed our nursing staff or indeed our allied health professional staff who are at the end of quite a significant process of negotiation for further pay for them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

There is one thing more than anything else that affects the future employment of people in the health system and the continuity of that, and that relates to the future financing of Health. This government this year will outlay $9.99 billion in Health--a record budget, a 10 per cent increase.

 I thank the honourable member for raising the issue of specialist outpatient waiting times, because one of things that was announced the other day by Julia Gillard as a way to help deal with specialist outpatient waiting times was a change in the manner in which you would be able to use the NBN for the purposes of consultation with specialists. We have heard deafening silence from the other side of the House. What is even more concerning is that so many people on the other side of the House represent people in areas that are remote that would specifically benefit from this. Indeed, the member for Warrego in the past has said that that is what he wants. On no occasion has he even bothered to come in here and claim that. </Hansard-Body>

The Bligh and Gillard governments believe in universal public health care. They believe that, regardless of colour, creed or social status, every Australian should be able to access free public health care. It is the foundation of our beliefs. That was Ned Hanlon’s core belief in Queensland as well. We believe in investing in social services like education and health care and believe that we have built a nation where this is a basic right. That is unlike many First World countries. In fact, the intergenerational report comments on the equity in this country compared to most other countries in the world. We know that we in Australia have the second longest life expectancy on earth, and that says something about it. What is more, there is many a First World country where basic health care, much less world-class health care, is not a basic right--the United States, for example. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1012809"></A>
If you are going to hang your hat on a belief, you have to have a policy to back it up, which is more than I can say for the other side of the House and certainly more than I can say for Tony Abbott. Yesterday the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association--which is the only national industry body for the public healthcare sector and the only independent advocate for public hospitals and health services at the national level--released a report card into election health promises. The report card has carved in stone what has been clear for many years with both the Liberals and the Nationals when it comes to health: they have no policies. In fact, it is impossible to govern without a clear vision for what you want to do. Health at a state level is the single biggest item of budgetary expenditure, and the Bligh and Gillard governments have a clear vision for the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012811"></A>
Contrast that with the last state election when the member for Caloundra announced a mental health policy without staff. That is how much he cared about staff then. He cared so much about them that he did not want to have them so he did not have to pay them at all. Many a time we have stood in this House and challenged the other side to deliver a policy, an idea, even a light bulb moment, but time and again they have failed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012812"></A>
It is not just the Queensland Liberals and Nationals who have a policy vacuum. Let us go back to the Healthcare and Hospitals Association report card. In the area of national reform: Labor--establishment of a national health and hospitals network, national oversight with local governance; the coalition--no policy. In the area of national bodies: Labor--establishment of independent, accountable bodies, tick; Abbott--no policy. In the area of local government: Labor--local health networks and Medicare locals implementation plan, tick; the coalition--individual hospital boards, no networks for PHC, some hospital networks, cross. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012813"></A>
On the issue of access to elective surgery: Labor--funding to expand elective surgery places, tick; Abbott--no policy. On the issue of access to emergency departments: Labor, tick--we know the four-hour rule there; Abbott--no policy. In relation to infrastructure: Labor--hospital health fund, tick; Abbott--no policy. In relation to e-health: Abbott--as we have said, and I will say again today, absolutely no policy. I table that document. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am more than happy for her to take a point of order if I am not being accurate here, Mr Speaker. As I said before, I am more than happy to have that issue specifically investigated. But there is one way in which you will make a real difference when it comes to hospitals--and that is investing not only in the bricks and mortar but in the people as well. That is investing not only in the bricks and mortar and the people but also in the services and the throughput that happens there. One thing that we have is a health capital works program of almost $7 billion. The state that is nearest to that is New South Wales at $2.3 billion. Every time we build those new facilities we upgrade them to allow further services to be provided for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

We know that Tony Abbott--he has announced this--would not pay states for hospital beds until they were delivered and he would not commit to 60-40 funding of our hospitals. We know that in the future the inexorable growth that is happening in our health system that will require things such as more operations and more procedures so therefore more sterilising procedures would be unfunded under Abbott. Abbott will not end the blame game. People are sick to death of Commonwealth governments not playing their role. They are sick to death of people like the member for Toowoomba South ripping money out of Rockhampton Hospital, as he did when he was health minister. He wore as a badge of honour that he ripped money out of the Rockhampton Hospital. He did that and he did it with relish.

We have a greater population and we have got stuck into it, yet he is still here reckoning he can make a contribution. That is an absolute disgrace.</Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development. Can the Treasurer update the House on economic forecasts for Queensland’s major trading partners? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014970"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Townsville for her question. Being from Townsville, she knows the importance of trade and the importance of export industries in supporting jobs and supporting the regional economies of Queensland. Queensland is the second most trade exposed state in Australia, and therefore the fortunes of our trading partners are absolutely vital to calibrating the economic policies that we as a state government pursue. Therefore, I am pleased that Consensus Economics has released an update for our major trading partners of last week which shows that across 2010 they are now predicted to grow by 4.8 per cent. That is above the trend growth they have experienced in recent times. Why? Because that reflects the nature of the downturn that has been experienced. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014972"></A>
Where we see the strength is amongst Japan and amongst the rest of non-Japan Asia, amongst the trading nations with whom we do the most business in our region. Those figures also reveal that within the data there are areas of softness. Europe continues to be a big challenge, ticking along at just over one per cent growth. The United States has come back to under three per cent growth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014973"></A>
The lesson from this data is that the risks remain out there, that the big questions remain out there, that the challenges remain out there and that the path to global recovery is one that requires government vigilance. That is why, absolutely, governments around the world require a strong economic plan, a clear understanding, a clear policy framework and clear actions to put in place. That is what we have got. We have a $17 billion building program for the second year in a row. We are building the infrastructure of the future and delivering jobs. We are supporting more than 100,000 jobs, especially in regional economies like Townsville. That is why we have generated jobs for the last 12 months. That is why we have led the nation for the last four months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014974"></A>
Put that in contrast to the policy proposition from those opposite--where they do not have a clue, where they do not have a policy, where they do not have a jobs target, where they do not have an economics strategy. We all remember that their policy is to cut jobs, to cut services, to cut a billion dollars out of vital public services. Who are they cheering for on Saturday? They are cheering for the bloke who wants to cut the NBN, who wants to slash GP clinics, who wants to slash trade training centres, as they continue in the great tory tradition of slashing and burning and cutting services and cutting jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014975"></A>
The lesson is clear on Saturday. If you want to vote for jobs, if you want to vote for growth, if you want to vote for building, then you are going to vote for Labor and you are going to vote for Julia Gillard to keep building Australia’s future. However, if you want to cut jobs and if you want to cut services, then you are going to vote for Tony Abbott and his team from the upper class twitocracy on the other side here--those indolents who are not prepared to lift a finger, who do not stand for anything, who will not chart a course for the future. So if you want to vote for a better future for this state and for Australia then you are going to vote for those people who build this nation and who build this state. You are going to vote on Saturday for a Labor government that will continue to chart a course for the future of the Australian economy. </Hansard-Body>

Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health. On 29 May, a constituent of mine, Mrs Mary Levets, broke her ankle and was admitted to Caboolture Hospital and on the following day was transferred to Redcliffe Hospital. The operation she required did not proceed. On 4 June, Mrs Levets’s husband collected his wife and waited three days for an appointment at the Nambour fracture clinic. Mrs Levets arrived for her operation on 8 June and was told that because the foot was swollen she could not be operated on so was kept in overnight. On 9 June she was sent home and told to wait until she received a letter giving a new operation date. Come 18 June, her husband attempted for four hours to phone the fracture clinic. Mary was then finally operated on some 25 days after breaking her ankle. Can the minister explain why, after bragging in this place on so many occasions about how wonderful the Bligh government is, people like 73-year-old Mrs Levets are forced to wait 25 days and be transferred between three hospitals for a broken ankle? </Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I will actually provide some further information in relation to some of the issues that have been raised before. I indicated before the number of long waits over a year in relation to Queensland Health. At the current time, there are about 137; in 1997-98, before this government came to power and when the member for Toowoomba South was the health minister, they were 8,500. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014982"></A>
The honourable member has raised a question today in good faith about a lady’s surgery issues and I am more than happy to have a look at that. I do know this: when you take our 137 away from your 8,500 you end up with in excess of 8,300. So it is not just the 36 days which I think was the period of time that the honourable member raised; there is a difference between these two governments in that more than 8,300 people would have been waiting over a year for their elective surgery. That is the essential difference. It is unacceptable when people wait too long, and that is why we are absolutely focused on that. What I say today is that there are 137 people waiting over a year for surgery under this government, but there were 8,500--</Hansard-Body>

 We had a year of record elective surgery, we had a quarter of record elective surgery, and the aggregate over long waits across all three categories was the lowest it has ever been. It is true to say that for categories 1 and 2 the long waits are higher; however, 90 per cent of category 1 patients receive their surgery within 36 days. We will continue to target that. It requires the cooperation of our surgeons and we are getting excellent cooperation from the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, including people like Professor Russell Stitz. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The honourable member for Caloundra quite rightly raises the issue of specialist outpatient waiting times. That is why the election of Tony Abbott is such a threat to people, because he will not support training additional doctors and additional specialists. This is a function of one thing and a function of one thing only: the number of specialists who actually operate in our system. The rate that we pay our doctors is superior to any other state so we know that is not a factor. The issue is the training numbers and the places of specialist medical staff that we have. One thing we know is that Tony Abbott constitutes the greatest threat to that because we know that he did it in the past. We also know that when he was in charge of health policy he did things like take over the Mersey Hospital in Tasmania but he did not do anything else. That is the sort of flakiness you get.</Hansard-Body>

Ms MALE:</Hansard-Member-Up>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Once again, I thank the member for the question and for her ongoing interest in matters to do with renewable energy. Once again, I am pleased to stand in this place to talk about a new initiative as part of our overall Queensland renewable energy strategy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015027"></A>
Queenslanders are embracing renewable energy sources, and today I announce a new initiative to help businesses reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save on their energy bills. The Office of Clean Energy will today launch web content that provides examples of how large buildings can switch to clean energy sources, cut power bills and slash carbon emissions. The content will encourage developers and building owners to install on-site, low-emission energy systems including solar, wind, natural gas, and biomass and biodiesel to name just a few renewable energy technologies which can be applied in today’s modern construction environment. It will provide information on the significant benefits of on-site generated power and includes guides on how a developer can go green with energy generation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015031"></A>
The potential savings in cuts to emissions that can be made are remarkable. That is why renewable energy is one of the keys to tackling climate change, but it is new technology so government must take the lead and encourage others to follow. That, after all, is the role of government. We will not shy away from the tough challenges of introducing new renewable energy technologies into Queensland because that is the task of a responsible government, but it is a task that clearly the LNP and particularly its colleagues in Canberra do not understand. Just last week the Leader of the Opposition put out a press release in which the opposition finally shed some light on its otherwise non-existent plan for renewable energy and climate change in Australia. If one read it carefully, as with all LNP policy, one would have probably missed it. With the usual manufactured gusto, it said, ‘Labor likes to make big promises on the environment but they never back up the words and spin with real action.’ This is the same ‘real action’ that climate change denier Tony Abbott has promised on renewable energy--the same real action which will slash $650 million from renewable energy research in this country. Right at the time that we should be investing in renewable energy technologies, Tony Abbott has announced he will slash $650 million from the existing renewable energy research program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015032"></A>
That just follows on from the state LNP. We know from the estimates that, if given a chance, the LNP would slash the Office of Climate Change and it would slash the Office of Clean Energy. The LNP has no vision for renewable energy for Queensland. It is once again a policy-free zone when it comes to one of the most important challenges that this state and this country face in terms of a cleaner energy future for this state and this country. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. We have about 78,000 staff in Queensland Health, and one complaint of bullying is one too many. However, one of the things we know with an organisation that large is we need to make sure that at all levels people understand the appropriate way in which to deal with their fellow staff members. Members of the House would know, for example, that a few years ago in Townsville we had a situation where the cardiac unit was shut down as a result of doctors not being able to get on with doctors. It had nothing in that instance to do with management. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015043"></A>
One of the things that is very important and that Queensland Health has invested significantly in is management training for people at a middle level, for want of a better word. I am not talking about hospital administrators; I am talking about nurses or doctors who manage units. I can say as a legal professional--and I know it is the same in relation to nursing and medicine--that management training is not integral to those professions where it might be in many others. Dealing with people in increasingly complex systems that are working 24 hours, seven days a week is an important aspect of training our own staff. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015046"></A>
That is why, for example, Tony O’Connell from the Centre for Healthcare Improvement has invested a very significant effort in supporting management training at that middle level, because that is frequently the interface between lower level workers and management. It is not at a senior level. The director-general does not go down and direct people individually. We have a network of 240 workplace equity and harassment officers in Queensland Health, and bullying is not acceptable at any point in time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015047"></A>
I will say this, though: while it is the responsibility of everybody in the organisation, while it is the responsibility of every manager in the organisation, frankly, the ability to interact between a director-general or a minister and an individual staff member is inappropriate. We know that there have been examples, particularly on the other side of politics, where ministers have sought to individually intervene to direct staff to do things. We do not do that. It is not appropriate to do that. That is why it is very important for us to ensure that our staff and our managers, particularly at that management level, are appropriately trained. </Hansard-Body>

When this government was elected, there were no busways in South-East Queensland. In recent years we have built 24 kilometres of busways for the south-east.

 Mr Abbott wrote essentially not only that public transport should not be funded by the Commonwealth but also that it is not necessary at all. One of the key divides between the two sides in this federal election is the question of public transport. Labor is committed to building public transport, with substantial money going into the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project and $700 million for Redcliffe rail, while the LNP federally believes not only that it should not fund it but also that public transport, it would seem, does not need to exist at all. </Hansard-Body>

Mr FOLEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Health. It appears that the issue of transporting people to treatment from rural areas where there is no public transport is not covered under Queensland Health policy. There is a denial of access to treatment where there is no family member able to drive these patients. The demographics of Queensland would suggest that this is, and will remain, an issue to be addressed. Will the minister change the policy to allow these patients to have access to timely health services? </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
I thank the honourable member for the question. I am more than happy to seek some further information from him if he has some specific instances, but I will say a number of things about transport when it comes to people in rural areas. There is a Commonwealth inquiry into the Patient Travel Subsidy Scheme. I know that a number of members have made representations in the past in relation to the overnight accommodation level, for example. The mileage level is about at the rate that it would cost in petrol for a four-cylinder car but it does not take into account wear and tear. We cover the full cost of airfares. We have a program of building facilities where we will provide overnight accommodation through various NGOs. We opened one in Rockhampton a little while ago. That is very significant. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017322"></A>
In relation to people who have no ability to transport themselves, I will have to seek some information as to whether there might be situations when it comes to non-emergent matters. In an emergent situation the Ambulance Service or the RFDS would assist. I will have to seek some information about that. I advise the honourable member that that is why the announcement by the Gillard government that it will provide significant funding to allow internet consultations will make a very significant difference for many people. The honourable member for Caloundra spoke about surgical waiting lists before. I have spoken about them. Many of the specialist outpatient waiting times for people are for medical matters. They are not in fact surgical matters and may never require an operation. For example, if a person has diabetes and they see an endocrinologist it may be that they are not going to get operated on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017324"></A>
The opportunity to provide services to people without them having to travel out of their communities is something that we will see more and more of. What we need to do is two things. Firstly, we need to have a broadband network that has sufficient bandwidth that it allows people to talk to each other in a seamless fashion. Secondly, we cannot penalise practitioners, whether they be general practitioners or specialists, who might seek to provide those services. We have had a situation up until the present time that if a person goes to their local GP in Cloncurry and then talks to a specialist in Townsville their GP is out of pocket because there is not an MBS billing schedule for it. That is really quite wrong. This will address that. As I said to members, why Tony Abbott has not sought to match this I do not know because it will make a real difference. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017325"></A>
The other thing that Julia Gillard announced--and Tony Abbott said no, the telephone system is good enough--is the ability to ultimately have an online overnight consultation with doctors and nurses on the equivalent of 13 HEALTH. I know as a parent, particularly when people have their first child, people get very concerned about things that they do not properly understand. It is one thing to talk to someone and describe something over the phone. I am partly colour blind and am not very good at describing colours or flushes or those sorts of things in people. If medical people could see someone over the internet with a reasonable degree of specificity they could then make a difference. I am happy to look at the issue raised by the honourable member. But I also do think that if this significant investment in technology could affect anywhere, it could affect health. </Hansard-Body>

Ms JONES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I know that the member for Capalaba is genuinely concerned about protecting the environmental values of Moreton Bay and the bayside suburbs. He is one of those backbenchers who is constantly coming through my door, whether it is to talk to me about the future prospects of North Stradbroke Island or something else. He is a strong believer in transitioning North Stradbroke Island to green jobs and a sustainable future. He supports our vision there. I will be working very closely with him on our plan going forward to make sure that North Stradbroke Island is a place where people can come, enjoy and experience this wonderful part of our region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017336"></A>
The member for Capalaba has also been a great supporter of the plan that we have to protect greater tracts of koala habitat in his region. Already we have protected over eight hectares on Mount Gravatt-Capalaba Road under a $45.5 million program to purchase koala habitat. He has also supported our government’s position with regard to the long-term sustainability of Moreton Bay. All of these programs are being undertaken by this Labor government because of our commitment to protecting this unique part of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Members would think that that would be enough shock to throw us off our chairs, but it gets worse. True to form, Mr Laming not only tried to pretend that the LNP was green but he asked the taxpayers of Australia to pay for it. True to form, he came out at the beginning of the day saying, ‘I assure you that it is in the guidelines. I did not do anything wrong. I’m sure if you examine it you will find it is in the guidelines.’ But, oops, his campaign manager had to come out later in the day and say, ‘I’m sorry.’ </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017354"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Health. The Queensland Cancer Council has just released data showing that for the 2003 to 2007 period Gladstone had a 10 per cent higher rate of cancers diagnosed compared to all of Queensland. The recent clean and healthy air study dealt with air quality. Will the minister ensure that the causes of this higher diagnosis rate are thoroughly investigated? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017356"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
I thank the honourable member for the question. I am a bit of a fan of Gladstone. I think it is a wonderful city. We take the health of people in Gladstone and people in our regional cities and indeed all of Queensland very seriously. Gladstone is very much an economic powerhouse. Its industry is its strength. There is no reason people of that city should have to worry that polluted air endangers their health. That is why we do the sort of testing we have done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017358"></A>
We initiated the Clean and Healthy Air for Gladstone Project aimed at better understanding Gladstone’s air quality and identifying potential risks to health. Members will recall that the study released relatively recently indicated that it would appear that there are no issues arising as result of that. Additionally, we reviewed data around asthma, miscarriages, total cancers and leukaemia in the Gladstone area in early 2007. The review showed Gladstone had broadly the same incidences of these diseases as the rest of Queensland, with the only exception being a higher rate of chronic lymphoid leukaemia, of CLL. The review did not identify environmental factors such as pollutants that would have contributed to or caused high rates of CLL. It found that air quality and environmental factors could not be blamed. That was independently reviewed by Professor Roder of the Cancer Council of South Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017360"></A>
In relation to the current matters raised by the honourable member, I am more than happy to seek advice from my department. But I do note the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare’s 2010 report, which I would behove members to read, stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1017363"></A>
The National Cancer Clearinghouse 2003 shows that in 2003-2005 the incidence of cancer decreased slightly with remoteness, with combined rates in <Hansard-Italic>
Outer Regional, Remote and Very remote</Hansard-Italic>
 areas 7% lower than <Hansard-Italic>
Major cities.</Hansard-Italic>
 Accordingly, the incidence of most types of cancer was lower outside <Hansard-Italic>
Major cities</Hansard-Italic>
, the exceptions being head and neck cancer (5% higher ...) melanoma (8% higher) and lip cancer (60% higher). The cancers showing higher incidence outside <Hansard-Italic>
Major cities</Hansard-Italic>
 are generally preventable and occur either through smoking and alcohol consumption ... or sun exposure (melanoma). </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017364"></A>
I think we were talking about melanoma and lung cancer in relation to Gladstone. That may in part provide some information. I am more than happy to have that examined.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017365"></A>
In relation to the matter raised by the member for Aspley, I am advised by Queensland Health that Dr Steve Atkin from the Children’s Oral Health Service advised that there was no sterilisation failure at the Royal Children’s Oral Health Service. I am advised that there are four levels of sterilisation checks that are conducted and that a routine check showed the fourth level of validation, a fail-safe audit to ensure other validations were conducted properly, was not conducted on time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017368"></A>
However, when the delay was identified and the audit was conducted, it was shown that the sterilisation had been undertaken properly and there were no sterilisation issues with the instruments. The Chief Dental Officer has also confirmed that he believes appropriate action has been taken to clarify the responsibilities to the appropriate officer at the Children’s Oral Health Service to ensure that the validation issue is addressed. The Chief Dental Officer has further confirmed the annual validation check is the lowest of the four different tests done on sterilised instruments.</Hansard-Body>

 I thank the honourable member for the question. That upgrade was a great announcement and it just shows what the Gillard government is putting its resources into, just like the state Labor government. Our record speaks for itself. In terms of the Suncorp Stadium redevelopment, the Queensland Labor government committed $280 million. What did Tony Abbott and the Howard government commit? Zero! In terms of the Gabba redevelopment, the Queensland Labor government committed $184 million when Tony Abbott and the Howard government committed zero. In terms of the Dairy Farmers upgrade, the Queensland Labor government committed $27 million when Tony Abbott and the Howard government committed zero. In terms of Skilled Park, the Queensland Labor government committed $160 million when Tony Abbott and the Howard government committed zero. In terms of the Gold Coast stadium, the Queensland Labor government committed $72 million and the federal Labor government committed $36 million. Its record speaks for itself. We got nothing under the former Liberal government. Those opposite want to back-pedal. They do not care about Queensland. They want all of the money to go to the southern states. Federal Labor and this state Labor government back the stadiums and back Queensland.</Hansard-Body>

Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (11.31 am), by leave: The member for Caloundra asked a question about the workload of payroll staff and a staff member who is waiting for backpay from the award reclassification process. The letter relates to a reclassification process that has taken place under the last EB7. The staff member sought reclassification of her position and succeeded. This is a process that was agreed to by the government under the generous EB arrangements that have resulted in very significant pay rises and additional staff numbers in Queensland Health. In contrast, the opposition went to the last election promising to cut staff and cut costs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023664"></A>
The letter is self-evident. Most AO2s and AO3s are administration staff--not all, most. There are over 80,000 Queensland Health employees and the reclassification exercise affects the positions of over 10,000 staff in more than 50 positions. The process has taken a number of years and significant backpay is owing. It is not surprising that the process of getting those staff backpaid takes time. That is what the letter says. So we reclassified them and said that we would do the right thing by them and pay them for that reclassification. The process has been undertaken in consultation with unions and staff as part of the interest based bargaining process. I congratulate all parties on this successful outcome.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition) (11.33 am): Today this parliament heard the latest chapter in the tale of Labor’s mismanagement of the economy, yet yesterday the Premier had the gall to come in here and say that Queensland is recovering because of her government’s policies. From 2009 to 2010, the number of companies that collapsed in the month of June skyrocketed by 47 per cent--up from 133 companies in 2009 to 196 companies in 2010. Nine companies per working day are going broke under the incompetent economic management of the Bligh Labor government. That is 196 businesses that will not be employing Queenslanders. Many of these businesses are owned by ordinary Queensland families. Many of these families have lost their homes, along with their business. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023670"></A>
But day after day members of the ALP come into this place and make speeches about how well things are going. They are deluded! This long-term Labor government is crippling businesses with increased taxes, fees and charges. Rego, fuel costs, water charges, road tolls, business licences, public transport charges and environmental levies have all seen double-digit increases over the last year, and it is no wonder that businesses and families are struggling to cope! It offends me that those opposite continue to pretend that people are not suffering. How dare they pretend that businesses are not going under?

As people head to the ballot box this weekend, they need to remember that Kevin Rudd, the former Prime Minister, said that everything was costed and everything was paid for. We had money in the bank and we had no deficit, yet now we have new taxes and we have debt and deficit--exactly what Labor has done in this state. It has given us a fuel tax in the last year and after the last budget we now have a waste tax. During the term of the Borbidge-Sheldon government, from 1996 to 1998, we had no debt, we had no deficit and we had money in the bank. But that is not what Labor will do. That is what Queenslanders need to remember when they go to the ballot box. Labor members will say anything before the election and do something else afterwards!</Hansard-Body>

Mr O’BRIEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cook--ALP) (11.35 am): Last Wednesday I joined with the federal member for Leichhardt, Jim Turnour, to officially open the new $13 million development of stage 3 of the Western Cape College at Weipa. This includes more than $6 million of federal grants. Over the last six years Weipa has been transformed by this government with a new $45 million hospital, vastly better roads, a new swimming pool, boating facilities and a complete transformation of the school delivered over three stages. Schools are the hubs of our communities and our students deserve to learn and prosper in 21st century facilities, which is what is being delivered at Weipa. The Bligh government together with the federal government is spending $10 million a day on infrastructure right across Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023680"></A>
Stage 3 of this campus is just one example of how we are transforming the face of our schools. This development gives the children at this college a new performing arts building, a new administration building for staff and parents, a remodelled and expanded special education unit, staff and general car park, covered drop-off area for the special education unit, a new kiln for the arts students, and an electrical upgrade to the manual arts and home economics building. The Commonwealth’s $6 million contribution built a huge sports stadium which will be used by the entire community and three state-of-the-art science classrooms. Let me assure the House that staff and the community were not complaining about wasting money or any other rubbish Tony Abbott is raving on about at the moment. The community was very happy and proud of the fantastic new facilities which will serve the Weipa community for decades to come. </Hansard-Body>

The Bligh government’s $850 million State Schools of Tomorrow project is also rolling out around Queensland, and Weipa received 10 classroom upgrades as part of that funding. The project has been worth more than $480,000 to that school. These are fantastic new improvements at that school which will drive that community forward in years to come. I am proud to be associated with the great work that we are doing in Weipa, particularly at this school.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Maroochydore--LNP) (11.37 am): When Premier Anna Bligh and Labor say that they are from the government and they are here to help, watch out for their sticky fingers reaching deep into your pockets! Queenslanders face taxing times, and Labor’s answer is to tax Queenslanders more. There is the half billion dollar petrol tax, rego is up 27 per cent and power is up 34 per cent--and water has been an absolute debacle. Once again I rise in this parliament to stand up for Queenslanders and the Sunshine Coast and highlight how the wasteful spending on the SEQ water grid--more than $7 billion--which has no business plan, is now hurting people. That is particularly so on the Sunshine Coast, where our water security was robbed by a one-way pipeline while higher bulk water charges are now landing in ratepayers’ mailboxes.</Hansard-Body>

(11.39 am): Residents in the Yeerongpilly electorate, whom I am honoured to represent in this parliament, are keenly awaiting a design proposal for the Cross River Rail project. Of key importance for local people is the location of the southern tunnel entrance and the associated community impacts. My advocacy for a tunnel portal located in the Clapham area and minimal impacts on the great character and amenity of local suburbs being incorporated into design and throughout construction is well known. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023740"></A>
Recently, the Cross River Rail team undertook the second consultation round of the project and southside residents turned out in force. Throughout the July to August consultation period, nine consultation events were held, 630,000 newsletters were distributed, 3,600 property owners were direct mailed, 153 calls were received on the Cross River Rail hotline, 285 email inquiries were sent to the project email address, 218 online and 195 hard-copy feedback forms were completed and 825 people attended a consultation event. Of those feedback figures, for the southern section consultation events 200 people attended the event at Dutton Park State School, 100 people attended at Moorooka State School and 250 people attended the event at the Fairfield Gardens Shopping Centre. That is some 550 attendances at local southside events and I thank the community for turning out in force and having their say. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023742"></A>
I know the sentiment in the local community well and I, too, await the proposed reference design, including the portal location, going out for public comment later this year. The residents in my local area want certainty about the project design and they want their feedback to be considered in detail. I welcome the assurances that project design recommendations will take into account community and key stakeholder feedback, community benefits and impacts and environmental issues, including heritage values. These are my primary concerns. I also thank the team, especially Luke, Arthur, Julie and Catherine, for their assistance with residents’ inquiries throughout the consultation period. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr FLEGG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Moggill--LNP) (11.41 am): The shambles of kindergarten funding in Queensland is now looking more and more like ceiling insulation. The minister announced a new funding scheme, where we would be given vouchers for $1,200 for children attending kindergartens. On 30 June, he started to back away from that and said that he would guarantee the present DECKAS funding level for all services in 2011. Yesterday, he repeated that claim and under his letterhead had circulated, signed off by the office of early childhood, a letter to parents saying that the kindergarten services will have DECKAS level funding guaranteed until 2014 and that it would be indexed. In other words, he has completely backed away from the new system and gone back to DECKAS. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023752"></A>
But imagine the horror of finding that this minister’s commitment to this parliament and these kindies was a pack of dishonest deception. When the kindy at Condy Park on the Fraser Coast contacted the office of early childhood, despite receiving that letter, they said, ‘No, no, no, the funding cut is still in place’--over $90,000 a year. When the Campus Kindy at the University of Queensland contacted C&amp;K, they were told, ‘No, no, no, the funding cut stands’ and for that particular kindy, it is $60,000 to $90,000 a year. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1023755"></A>
We cannot believe a word this education minister says. He has given ironclad commitments that this funding will not be cut, yet kindergartens across Queensland are getting slaughtered. And who is going to pay? The parents are going to pay when the fees get put up, or when their local kindergarten closes down. This minister needs to get off his backside and explain why he misled this parliament. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Sandgate--ALP) (11.43 am): What do Olympians, Paralympians and Special Olympians have in common? They all love their sport, they love their country and they love the team spirit, friendship, fun and fitness that comes from the long hours of training and competing. However, the difference is that Queenslanders who are selected to compete at the Olympics, the Paralympics or the Commonwealth Games currently receive a bonus grant from the Bligh government, but those selected for the Special Olympics do not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023760"></A>
Over 40 years, the Special Olympics has grown from an American summer camp for people with intellectual disabilities to an international Olympic competition held every four years with local events held all year round. Next year, Athens will host the Special Olympics World Summer Games and over 30 Queenslanders have been selected for the Australian team. Shaun McKee, who hails from Bracken Ridge in my electorate of Sandgate, has been chosen as a member of the Australian soccer team and must raise $7,000 to get to Athens. Today, I am launching an appeal to Sandgate businesses to get behind Shaun with some sponsorship to help make his dream come true. Life Without Barriers is organising to collect funds on Shaun’s behalf and has already received donations. Last week, the sports minister, Phil Reeves, visited my electorate and took the time to meet Shaun and his mum and talk about his plans for Athens and to congratulate him on his team’s win at the national games in Adelaide earlier this year. </Hansard-Body>

Today, I am calling on the minister to look at ways that our government can support Queensland athletes trying to raise funds to travel to the Special Olympics next year. I know that Queenslanders can achieve the target of becoming Australia’s healthiest people. If you need a bit of inspiration, you should go and watch some of our Special Olympians prepare for the most amazing games the world has ever seen.

Mr STEVENS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mermaid Beach--LNP) (11.45 am): I am pleased to report to the House that the Gold Coast City Council task force on short-term rental accommodation has resolved to ban so-called party houses in suburban residential areas. The council will achieve this protection of residents’ rights and amenity through a temporary local planning instrument, which is an action that was supported ably by the Labor member for Burleigh, Mrs Christine Smith, as well as by me, as part of the concerned task force members. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023770"></A>
Mayor Ron Clarke boldly led the task force in the face of much pressure from the vested interest group of party house owners who have been using a loophole in the Gold Coast City Council planning act to run a business in a residential area without any planning application being made. The CEO of Gold Coast Tourism, Mr Martin Winter, debunked the unfounded calls that banning these party houses would be the end of tourism for the Gold Coast by advising the task force that these unapproved, inappropriately located short-term accommodation houses were actually costing genuine tourism accommodation providers money through their backdoor moonlighting activity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023774"></A>
In fact, there are 15,000 short-term accommodation providers licensed through the Gold Coast City Council. The vast majority of those accommodation houses are appropriately located, conform with all tourism accommodation building and safety requirements and have been approved through correct town planning applications. The fast-buck investors in these party houses can still rent out their properties for normal residential tenancy as approved under the planning scheme. So their howls of financial ruin ring hollow in the realm of reality. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023775"></A>
I call on the honourable Minister for Infrastructure and Planning, Mr Stirling Hinchliffe, to expedite the issuing of the temporary local planning instrument for the Gold Coast City Council to bring to a close the unsociable behaviour, the unbearable ruination of suburban amenity, the incessant demand on police resources and the unfair trading advantage these party houses take over approved short-term accommodation venues.

Ms STONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Springwood--ALP) (11.47 am): People driving on the M1 through Logan would have noticed the extensive roadworks that are being constructed at Daisy Hill. Improvements to the Springwood south to Daisy Hill section will progressively be delivered. Weather permitting, we will see major improvements to the Winnetts and Loganlea roads interchange in late 2010. This $490 million upgrade is being jointly funded by the state Labor government and the federal Labor government. The upgrade will provide a huge boost to employment, sustaining an average of 1,409 direct and indirect jobs over the life of the project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023782"></A>
There is no doubt that for many years Queenslanders were ignored and short-changed on road funding by the Howard Liberal government. In fact, I was often asked why the federal coalition government gave money to the Pacific Highway over the border and nothing to upgrade the road in Logan City. Unlike the Liberal and National Party members in this House, I did not stand and whinge and whine; I lobbied both sides of politics for my electorate’s fair share of road funding and federal road funding and I was delighted when the commitment came through from the federal Labor Party and was announced and delivered when it won government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023783"></A>
Today, I again stand in this House asking both sides of politics to give a commitment for more federal funding to keep the much needed upgrade of the Pacific Motorway through Logan City continuing--although I fear I know the answer from Tony Abbott, who has already said that transport infrastructure is a state responsibility. However, I will continue to lobby for the dollars that are needed for this upgrade no matter what level of government and no matter which party is in office. Today, I call on the Logan City Council to give its commitment to the upgrading of the local roads and the streets that will be affected by the upgrade. Improving the roads around the Loganlea interchange would be a good start as to where the council needs to show its commitment to the M1 upgrade. It is now time for the Logan City Council to give its commitment to road funding for improvements of local roads servicing M1 motorists. There is no point in us fixing up the M1 when all motorists do is hit a bottleneck on a council controlled road. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023785"></A>
For 12 years the Howard Liberal government ignored Logan motorists, it ignored the residents in my electorate and it ignored the motorists using our major transport link to the southern states. I call on all levels of government to commit to making sure that this upgrade proceeds. </Hansard-Body>

Mr KNUTH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Dalrymple--LNP) (11.50 am): Yesterday I tabled a petition containing the signatures of 769 Tablelands residents calling on the government to provide funding for signage on all arterial roads and thoroughfares throughout the Tablelands to highlight awareness by all road users and the community of the many bike riders who share the roads. This petition was initiated by Mrs Sharyn Cook, whose husband, Lindsay Cook, was tragically killed in March this year while riding his bike along the Kennedy Highway between Atherton and Mareeba. He was one of three fatalities in the past 18 months as a result of accidents involving bikes and vehicles on the Tablelands. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023826"></A>
These tragic losses of life emphasise the need for improved infrastructure and adequate signage to enhance the awareness of the increasing number of people who are choosing to ride bikes to improve their lifestyle. I acknowledge that this government is interested in promoting bike riding in Queensland and I welcome such projects as the Principal Cycle Network Plan for Far North Queensland. However, the majority of development has occurred in the south-east and urban centres. I would also like to acknowledge the state member for Cook’s efforts in pushing for improved road infrastructure for bike riders on the Atherton Tablelands and in the Far North. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023827"></A>
This petition is asking that the government urgently fund the erection of signs to raise awareness of bike riders to prevent further deaths and near misses on Tablelands roads. There are an increasing number of bike riders on Queensland roads. Research indicates that there are three times more riders per head of population in Far North Queensland than in Brisbane. It is becoming more evident on the Tablelands, where there is a rapidly expanding community of recreational bike riders who ride six days a week at six in the morning. Many Tablelanders are choosing to commute on their bikes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023828"></A>
The fact is that government initiatives aimed at promoting healthier living and greener lifestyles are still premature in regional and rural Queensland. Bike riders on the Tablelands are at high risk of being injured if nothing is done and are pleading for appropriate funding to erect signage to increase bike rider awareness throughout the Tablelands road network in an effort to save our families from tragic and preventable loss of loved ones.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs KIERNAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Isa--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(11.51 am): I am pleased to advise the House that the government has finalised contract negotiations with the Cloncurry Shire Council in respect of the 38-kilometre pipeline which was completed in March 2010 on time and under budget. The pipeline ensures a secure back-up water supply from Lake Julius in times of drought after Cloncurry’s water supply fell to a critical low of three per cent capacity in 2008. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023832"></A>
Construction of the pipeline commenced in July 2009 and was completed in December last year. The pipeline was declared operational in March 2010. This valuable piece of infrastructure contributed greatly to sustaining jobs during the GFC. It created employment for about 20 people locally, sustained employment for approximately 40 project contractors and injected around $3 million into the local economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023833"></A>
Since the completion of the pipeline the government has consulted extensively with the council to assess various proposals for the allocation of costs to achieve the best outcome for all parties. The government assisted the council as it was vital to ensure the costs to the community were kept at a reasonable level. I acknowledge Mayor Andrew Daniels and his council, CEO Graham King, SunWater, DERM and DIP officers, particularly Greg Oliver, for their hard work to finalise the project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023834"></A>
As part of the agreement, the state government will pay the bulk of the costs through SunWater, the government’s water entity. Up to 2014 the council will only pay fixed water allocation costs to secure the entitlement to draw water from Lake Julius and the variable costs for the actual volume of water taken from the pipeline. In this project the state government will absorb all other project costs involved in the pipeline’s construction. The state government has also made concessions to the council in regard to trigger levels in Chinaman Creek Dam for taking water from the pipeline, it being raised from 25 per cent to 40 per cent. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(11.53 am): I rise to speak on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of Queenslanders and their families who are only now starting to see the ramifications of the Bligh Labor government’s latest form of punishment: water torture. Those ramifications are in the form of water bills. Yes, something is rotten in the water across South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023838"></A>
Three weeks ago in my electorate of Buderim mailboxes began receiving Unitywater bills. My electorate office has been flooded with complaints, some very emotional, from people with families who have received bills for hundreds of dollars. The Premier is obviously very concerned about the pain and suffering her water-billing reform would cause to Queenslanders. I have no doubt this is why the Premier did away with the portfolio of water minister. That was a cynical move in an effort to try to distance herself and her government from the form of water torture they are going to inflict on Queenslanders. The cynical moves do not stop there. Unitywater’s website states--</Hansard-Body>

We are talking about water, but does the government seriously think we all came down in the last shower? Do not be mistaken: the Bligh government is getting its cut from water customers as well. Unitywater does not own water. The bulk water charges in everybody’s bills are the cost of water that Unitywater buys from the grid manager. Who owns the grid manager? The Bligh Labor government owns the grid manager.</Hansard-Body>

Queensland will not forgive the Premier and her government for the water torture they have foisted upon them through these water bills.

When people go to vote this weekend, I urge them to take their water bill with them and remember who gave them this bill. Vote Labor out. We can no longer afford them. With increases in registration fees and water bills, this government will break the people of Queensland. Remember this weekend when you vote. Vote them out.<Hansard-Speech-End>

(11.55 am): The new children’s emergency department at the Prince Charles Hospital continues to move ahead. This $45.6 million project will open in 2012 and will deliver great emergency care for northside children closer to home. It will build on the world-class services already provided by the Prince Charles Hospital to this area. This project will deliver designated children’s emergency treatment spaces, 20 beds for short stays and additional children’s outpatient services. Funding for the project was locked in in this year’s state budget. Early works have now commenced and a managing contractor will be appointed shortly. Construction will now begin before Christmas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023850"></A>
As parliamentary secretary for healthy living, I established a designated Family Advisory Council to engage with the community on the development of new services and facilities to be provided. The advisory council consists of 20 members of the general public: a mix of parents, carers and grandparents from within the hospital’s catchment area. This group now meets on a monthly basis, with three meetings having been held to date. I understand that these meetings have all been very constructive, with a range of suggestions made on the development of this important project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023851"></A>
This council will play an integral role in the planning and design of this project, in particular in ensuring that the needs of local families presenting to children’s emergency services are met and ascertaining how services can be managed to best meet these needs. It also allows local parents and carers the opportunity to have direct input into the way in which services will be delivered in this new facility. The feedback obtained from families through the Family Advisory Council is essential to create health services that are truly family centred. I look forward to providing further updates in the future to the House on the work of this council and this project more broadly.<Hansard-Speech-End>

(11.57 am): In 2001 I ran in a council by-election in the old Caloundra City Council area. Out of the nine candidates in the field I ran third. The then member for Kawana, Chris Cummins, made a speech in the House regarding candidates in that by-election and I was lucky enough to rate a mention, although it was hardly a glowing endorsement. Almost 10 years later I have pleasure in giving the residents of Fisher a summary of Mr Cummins’s colourful past before his candidacy for Fisher at this Saturday’s federal election. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023855"></A>
Mr Cummins’s most recent bungle was as a senior IT adviser to the Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology. He was one of the most senior bureaucrats involved in the debacle of changing over the Queensland Health payroll system. I submit to the House that the bungle is ongoing, with no end in sight. When questioned about his role in the debacle, Mr Cummins stated that he had no role in the pay issue and also that as a federal candidate he could not comment on any state issues. The ‘minister for nothing’ has become the ‘IT adviser who has nothing to do with anything’. It is what one expects when two ministers deny responsibility. He was trained by the incompetent best in the Bligh government. </Hansard-Body>

Mr PITT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mulgrave--ALP) (11.59 am): This week is National Science Week and more than 45 state schools across Queensland have organised science activities, including science fairs and Science on Saturday events. The community’s renewed interest in science aligns with state government moves to increase the profile of science in state schools, with programs such as the $37.7 million Science Spark initiative that focuses on improving teacher knowledge and skills to teach science in years 4 to 7, being ably led in Far North Queensland by regional manager Adam Hooper. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1023914"></A>
Last week I presented a Community Service Award to Debbie Townsend, the primary science facilitator based at Gordonvale State School. Deb has recently organised National Science Week activities at Gordonvale and Aloomba State Schools. She was instrumental in Isabella State School obtaining a grant to run its science fair and the science expo to be held next week at Gordonvale State School. She has contributed to the excellent performance of the science program at Gordonvale and is accompanying students from Aloomba State School to the International Kids Teaching Kids Coastal Conference to be held at Caloundra in October.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023919"></A>
Debbie has a long history of bringing science to the fore in the primary setting, previously at Hambledon State School and now at Gordonvale, where she has conducted extensive support activities to make science come alive. For example, she had the Gordonvale SES attend a lesson and had the students learn about the efficiency of different pulley systems by using emergency services equipment to rescue Jack, the training dummy. When not involved with science, Debbie is actively involved with Girl Guides and Brownies, a labour of love for nearly 50 years, and is the first aid officer at Ellis Beach Surf Lifesaving Club.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1023922"></A>
The Science Spark initiative is offering great benefits to teachers and students alike and is helping to build Queensland’s already renowned science community. Deb Townsend is a great example of why the initiative is so successful. She is a passionate educator, both in and out of the classroom setting. She has the spark to ignite passion in her students because she is always willing to go the extra mile to accomplish her goals. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr FOLEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maryborough--Ind) (12.00 pm): I rise to bring to the attention of the House the fact that I, along with many other local members, are hearing an increasing number of people complain about the costs that are levied on them by local government. That puts us in a difficult position. In Queensland there are 73 councils and this growing frustration over the increasing charges is something that we cannot do anything about at a normal level. I table a copy of a document from the Department of Infrastructure and Planning, which offers people the advice that if they have a complaint about their council they should contact that council directly. Of course, people then perceive the situation to be one where Caesar is judging Caesar.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1023928"></A>
Given that our region has some of the lowest per capita income in Australia and that our rates are amongst the highest in Australia, the bottom line is that the bulk of ratepayers can no longer afford this council.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1023929"></A>
I believe Queensland is long overdue for a law which directs all councils to annually submit proposed rates and charges to a totally independent, non-partisan, apolitical authority which has the power to approve, reject or alter all submissions--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I believe that that cost could be shared amongst the 73 councils and, with top-up funding from state and federal governments, it would mean that people could be confident that they were not being rorted, as it were, through charges. A local publican received a $15,000 bill because someone made a mistake in calculating the bill and the council had undercharged him. He told them to go jump in the lake and, basically, the charge was waived. That sort of uncertainty needs to be addressed by an independent arbiter. <Hansard-Speech-End>

This bill implements stage 2 of the government’s swimming pool safety improvement strategy. This bill culminates a two-year comprehensive review of and consultation on Queensland’s pool safety. Queensland will have the toughest pool laws in Australia. I thank all stakeholders who have provided their expertise in the development of the pool safety laws, such as Hannah’s Foundation, the Royal Life Saving Society, the Queensland Law Society, the Real Estate Institute of Queensland and numerous organisations from the pool, building, community title and health sector, as well as all the members of the community who provided their input.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023946"></A>
Between 1 January 2004 and 18 May 2010, 35 children under five years of age drowned in residential swimming pools. Further, in 2008-09 eight children drowned in swimming pools. There are approximately 50 non-fatal immersion incidents each year, with cases that are often characterised by permanent brain damage. In 1991, pool fencing legislation resulted in a dramatic reduction in drowning deaths and, as a result, we know that better laws will save lives. This government will not accept tragedies as inevitable. Of course, nothing replaces adult supervision of children when they are near water, but the new laws aim to drastically reduce the risk of young children entering pools on their own. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023947"></A>
Stage 1 of our improvement strategy commenced on 1 December 2009 for new pools. Stage 2 will mostly cover Queensland’s 325,000 existing pools. Primarily, this bill will replace the current assortment of pool safety standards with a single uniform standard. The bill extends state pool laws to indoor pools and pools associated with hotels, motels and other residential buildings, caretaker dwellings and caravan parks. One single standard will make pool safety laws easier to understand, easier to enforce and easier to comply with. Also, to ensure pool owners have time to adjust and are not unduly disadvantaged, this bill allows a five-year phase-in period for owners to upgrade their pool fencing and safety arrangements, unless they sell or lease the property first.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023948"></A>
Pool safety organisations agree that the risk of drowning is highest during the first six months of occupation, particularly on rented premises. Seventy-one per cent of the drowning deaths involving young Queenslanders between 2007 and 2009 occurred on rented properties. This bill establishes mandatory inspections of regulated pools with a pool safety certificate issued by licensed pool safety inspectors, if triggered by the sale or lease of a regulated property. No property with a non-shared residential pool can be leased without a current pool safety certificate. For all other pools, where a pool is sold without a pool safety certificate a prescribed notice must be given by the seller to the purchaser advising that the pool may be non-compliant. The Pool Safety Council must also be advised that the property was settled without a pool safety certificate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023949"></A>
The bill provides for a six-month phase-in period for pools associated with short-term accommodation to obtain a certificate. This phased implementation is in direct response to our tourism stakeholders, such as the Hotel Motel and Accommodation Association and the Queensland Tourism Industry Council, telling us that December and January is one of their busiest periods. All other shared pool owners will have two years to get ready and plan for upgrading their pool fences to the one standard, and be required to obtain a pool safety certificate. The Commissioner for Body Corporate and Community Management, along with key stakeholders, has advised that this phase-in period is critical to allow bodies corporate sufficient time to comply with the scheme.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023950"></A>
The bill also addresses strong community concern of the risks portable pools pose to young children. It does so by reducing the maximum depth of portable pools not requiring a compliant pool fence from 450 mm to 300 mm, and in doing so brings Queensland in line with the rest of Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023951"></A>
The bill implements Queensland’s mandatory immersion incident reporting system. This will facilitate accurate pool immersion data collection and a comprehensive assessment of the practical operation of our pool safety reforms. The amendments mandate reporting by a private or public hospital and the Queensland Ambulance Service of an immersion incident of a child under the age of five. They must report it to Queensland Health within five business days and include information about the date and location of the incident. Queensland Health will then distribute the information to relevant bodies, including local governments, the Pool Safety Council and the Queensland Injuries Surveillance Unit.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023987"></A>
Most importantly, this information will trigger local government action, as the bill requires local governments to inspect the relevant pool so that appropriate improvements are identified and undertaken. To make sure pool owners and the various affected sectors of new pool safety obligations--such as the pool community title, real estate and legal sectors--know of the new obligations for pool safety, my department is developing a targeted education and awareness campaign. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023990"></A>
The bill also amends the Animal Management (Cats and Dogs) Act 2008 to clarify that American Staffordshire terriers, also known as Amstaffs, are not ‘restricted dogs’. The Queensland Supreme Court recently concluded that Amstaffs are the same breed as American pit bull terriers. As pit bulls are classified as ‘restricted dogs’, this caused significant uncertainty for Queensland Amstaff owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023991"></A>
This bill will also prevent creditors or liquidators from dealing with particular public land and will, instead, revert ownership back to the state. The Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association, the RNA as we better know it, is entering into a development agreement with Lend Lease (Bowen Hills) Pty Ltd in order to redevelop the Ekka site. The purpose of the proposed amendments are to facilitate this commercial arrangement while at the same time guaranteeing that the historic Ekka site is not lost to future generations. Under this arrangement, only that part of the site that is necessary for the Lend Lease development will be available as security for the financial transaction. The balance of the site will be quarantined from the financial arrangements and will remain in public hands.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023992"></A>
Finally, the bill amends the Sustainable Planning Act 2009 to enable local governments to continue publishing material relating to development applications on their websites. Currently, publication of this material may be in breach of the Information Privacy Act (2009). However, these websites are important, widely used tools that facilitate transparency in the IDAS process, which is a matter of critical importance to all stakeholders. The amendment authorises online publication of certain documents or information relating to development applications. A determination of which documents are appropriate for online publication is being formulated with a balance struck between personal privacy and public accountability. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr RYAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Morayfield--ALP) (12.12 pm): I rise to contribute to the debate on the Geothermal Energy Bill. This bill is about balance--balancing our energy needs today with our needs for a sustainable future tomorrow; balancing the interests of agricultural landholders today with the economic demands of the diverse employment possibilities of tomorrow; balancing the current methods for the energy generation of today with the transitional pathways for the energy generation of tomorrow. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024001"></A>
On this side of the House, we believe the mainstream science on climate change. We believe that climate change is happening now and we are committed to playing our part by expanding and investing in a Queensland based renewable energy sector. As someone committed to a sustainable future and as a member of the Queensland parliament’s Environment and Resources Committee, I am pleased that this government is investing in new renewable energy technologies and strategies. By diversifying our state’s energy generation sector and by lightening our reliance on fossil fuels, this state government is securing Queensland’s energy future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024002"></A>
This bill supports the development of a geothermal industry in Queensland within a strict framework of promoting competition, protecting the interests of landholders and creating jobs for the future. As some members may know, geothermal energy or hot rocks energy is a virtually carbon dioxide emission free energy source which has the potential to produce more baseload energy than any other source of renewable energy generated in Queensland. This capacity is important not only for network stability purposes but because it fundamentally lightens our reliance on fossil fuels for baseload energy generation. This technology is a game changer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024005"></A>
This bill is also about supporting landholders and providing a regulatory framework for land access by geothermal explorers and producers. Our renewable energy future must be developed in partnership with our friends in the agricultural sector. As such, it is important that collaborative and constructive frameworks exist and all stakeholders are afforded the due respect and support that they deserve. I am pleased that a Land Access Code of Conduct will be introduced to promote transparency, equity and cooperation amongst stakeholders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024006"></A>
I would like to now spend some time discussing the amendments to the Electricity Act in relation to the retailer of last resort scheme. As members may know, the retailer of last resort scheme was enlivened last year when an electricity retailer, Jackgreen (International), was suspended from trading on the national market. A number of my constituents contacted me to discuss their experience with Jackgreen and their transition to a new retailer under the scheme. As members may know, the retailer of last resort scheme protects customers of an electricity retailer who may be suspended from the national electricity market or otherwise become unable to provide retail services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024008"></A>
The scheme ensures that customers of a failed retailer continue to receive electricity supply by automatically transferring them to another retailer, known as a retailer of last resort. However, there are not insignificant costs associated with providing a retailer of last resort service. Currently, the scheme provides for a retailer of last resort to recover costs by charging transferred customers a fee. This fee can only be charged if it is approved by the independent Queensland Competition Authority. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024010"></A>
Following the successful operation of the scheme in respect of Jackgreen, I understand that some concerns were identified in respect of the scheme’s cost recovery process. Accordingly, I am pleased to see that amendments contained in this bill will establish a more equitable cost recovery process. The proposed new process would spread costs of a retailer of last resort event across all Queensland customers through distributors’ network charges. These events are rare, with only two occurring since the commencement of the national electricity market in 1998. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024011"></A>
The amendments to the act will enable development of an improved cost recovery process to minimise costs to individual customers, whilst encouraging retailers to continue to offer the retailer of last resort service. It will also align Queensland’s retailer of last resort scheme more closely with the proposed national scheme expected to be introduced in the middle of 2012 under Ministerial Council on Energy reforms. Details of the proposed new cost recovery process are being developed in consultation with stakeholders and will be implemented through an amendment to the Electricity Regulation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024013"></A>
I would like to conclude by noting the hard work of the minister, his staff and the departmental staff in respect of this bill. This is a good bill which looks to the future in a responsible, measured and balanced way. This is a bill which supports stakeholders and customers through a variety of sensible amendments. This is a bill which highlights this government’s hard work of developing a diverse and secure renewable energy sector. That has to be good for the Queensland of today and for the Queensland of tomorrow. I commend the bill to the House and ask other members to support it. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs KIERNAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Isa--ALP) (12.18 pm): I rise to speak to the Geothermal Energy Bill 2010. It has been with keen interest during my time in this House to see the progress of so many aspects of the expansion of renewable energy which has been a strong and steadfast commitment of the Bligh government. Representing one of the most promising geothermal regions in the state, this bill sets out to establish frameworks to encourage and facilitate the safe production of geothermal energy to accelerate the expansion of the renewable energy sector in Queensland. The bill also sets out to provide a balanced approach to private land access and recognise and clarify the rights and authority of tenure holders and landholders in relation to access to private land for resource related activities and compensation. This bill amends a number of other acts. However, I will keep my comments particularly to the production and land access. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024053"></A>
Geothermal energy, or hot rocks energy, is a virtually CO<Hansard-Subscript>
2</Hansard-Subscript>
 emission free energy source and has the potential to produce more baseload energy for Queensland than any other single source of renewable energy. It is heat energy contained within the earth’s crust derived from the natural geological processes which may occur in various forms, including geothermal water and steam--that is, wet geothermal energy--or hot dry rocks. Geothermal energy can be used in a variety of small scale applications--for example, heat pumps--and industrial applications, as well as large scale electricity generation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024061"></A>
I am very proud to say that the only wet geothermal electricity generation is in Birdsville, which is in my electorate. It has the capacity to provide for about one-third of Birdsville’s average power consumption. I also would like to acknowledge that the member for Gregory is a very, very strong supporter of this project and of these renewable initiatives in our part of the world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024064"></A>
Exploration for geothermal energy is currently regulated under the Geothermal Exploration Act 2004 and the Geothermal Exploration Regulation 2005. This legislation was intended to be an interim measure in Queensland so that exploration could commence while legislation to enable production was developed. Nine exploration permits have been granted and 31 are proposed to be granted in 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024066"></A>
While Queensland has significant resources of hot dry rocks, many of those resources are not close to large townships or major industrial load centres, which poses particular transmission and distribution challenges to the development of the industry in the state, in addition to the existing legislative barriers to the production of geothermal energy. While recognising that the Queensland government has committed $5 million to the Coastal Geothermal Energy Initiative and understanding that this initiative was launched to identify high geothermal heat-flow areas close to existing electricity transmission lines along the Queensland coast, I believe that the north-west remains at the forefront in respect of geothermal and other renewable energies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024070"></A>
In July 2008, the Premier announced the newly discovered Millungera Basin, which has the energy potential to rival that of the Cooper Basin. It is possible that the Millungera Basin could hold clean energy sources that could provide low-emissions power for the entire north-west region. This discovery, which is east of Cloncurry, is actually in the north-west and right in the heart of the McKinlay shire. I make mention of this find because, apart from the great excitement at the time, since that time we have marched on substantially in the north-west, particularly in respect of transmission potential. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024074"></A>
On 18 June 2010, the Coordinator-General declared the CopperString project to be a significant project requiring an environmental impact statement. The project will provide an electricity transmission network as identified in a clean energy corridor. The significant renewable energy resources would benefit from the ability to connect to the NEM to export electricity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024075"></A>
Just last week, the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, Wayne Swan, announced that a re-elected Gillard government would make the CopperString project the first cab off the rank for the Connecting Renewables initiative. This follows the strong support this project has received from the Queensland government, with both the Treasurer, Andrew Fraser, and Minister Stephen Robertson working over the last few years to find long-term solutions to energy for the north-west minerals province and the prospect of many renewable energy opportunities along the Mount Isa to Townsville corridor. I would also like to acknowledge the visionary leadership of Paul Woodhouse--</Hansard-Body>

Land access matters are highly relevant to the Mount Isa electorate, both for our explorers and miners and for our vast pastoral industry in the north-west. We have seen a substantial and ongoing increase in exploration activity, which has placed a greater emphasis on the importance of developing a policy and legislative framework that clearly articulates the rights and responsibilities of resource tenure holders and rural landholders relating to access to private land for the potential development of this state’s mineral, petroleum and geothermal resources. Significant growth and expansion for resource activity across the state has resulted in increased interaction and conflict between rural landholders and resource tenure authority holders regarding the manner in which these companies access private land and the potential business impacts that resource activities may have on agricultural enterprises. It effectively grants a right of access to private land, so it is therefore incumbent on the government to ensure that it facilitates equitable outcomes for all affected parties. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024086"></A>
I would like to congratulate and thank Minister Robertson, his staff and his department for this bill, particularly the many aspects of the bill that I know will be truly beneficial and will harmonise the relationship between our explorers, our miners and our pastoralists. On that note, I commend the bill to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr SHINE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (12.27 pm): I rise to make a contribution to the Geothermal Energy Bill. It certainly is timely that this bill is being introduced and debated today bearing in mind its applicability to an important area of Queensland, namely the west and particularly the south-west and Darling Downs area. This legislation is of great interest to people who live in my electorate in Toowoomba, although no part of my electorate itself is the subject of exploration or mining that I am aware of. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024092"></A>
Nevertheless, Toowoomba is the regional capital of the Darling Downs and South-West Queensland and, as such, the issues that have arisen as a result of the activities in the Surat Basin are very much to the fore for them. The people of Toowoomba are very aware of the issues arising as a result of the growth of the coal seam gas industry and they are particularly concerned about any danger to the Great Artesian Basin. They are concerned about the proposed open-cut mine at Felton and similar mining operations that are proposed west of Toowoomba at Warra. They are also more recently concerned about the gasification process at Kingaroy that was mentioned last night by the member for Nanango. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

These are some of the more prominent concerns that have been raised in my community as well as in the wider Darling Downs and south-west Queensland. Indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have been lobbied by advocates on both sides of that argument, as you would assume I would be. I am aware, therefore, of the concerns of farmers and, to a large extent, I empathise with them and share their concerns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024128"></A>
Members opposite yesterday were explaining to the House the feelings that landowners had who have been associated with a property for generations, their affection for and love of the land, and their worry about what might be happening. I understand that. Having come from a farm, I am only too pleased that that area is not, and never will be as far as I am aware, the subject of mining interest. But I do genuinely share their concerns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024130"></A>
Their concerns, as I alluded to before, have a wide and deep level of support in the Toowoomba community. Toowoomba is a community that is a retirement centre for people who have come from country areas, from farms and so on, and therefore one would expect Toowoomba people to have sympathy and a connection with what is happening on the land. However, I am also aware that it is not just farmers or people with that type of connection to the land but it is also scientists, particularly scientists in the plant area, who have raised concerns about the various activities of mining of one sort or another that is happening in that region.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024131"></A>
I had occasion to send to the minister, and, indeed to the Premier, an article in the Toowoomba <Hansard-Italic>
Chronicle</Hansard-Italic>
 of recent times written by the Catholic Social Justice Commission, which was concerned about moral issues arising out of the use of land for mining purposes and the obligation that we have to protect farming lands for the production of food and so on. I mention these things because many ordinary Toowoomba residents, other than those with a vested interest, have legitimate concerns about what is happening in the south-west region of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024134"></A>
It was for that reason that I elected to travel to Roma recently to sit in on the community cabinet to gauge for myself the views of the people more directly affected by what is happening in that industry in that part of Queensland, which was a worthwhile experience from my point of view. The people who have concerns call for such actions as a moratorium, pending the carrying out of research to obtain some certainty before the industry is further developed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024136"></A>
The value of the primary production in that part of Queensland is almost immeasurable in terms of their production of food and fibre. That certainly applies to the Felton area and to the Warra area. The honourable member for Warrego, who is in the chamber and who represents a lot of that part of Queensland, is well aware of its value as a food production area of Queensland, and likewise, as I said, with Felton. In terms of Felton, the effects on Toowoomba could be quite significant both from an aesthetic point of view and the amenity itself of Toowoomba with respect to the influence of dust from prevailing winds and so on.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024142"></A>
Farmers have come to me from Cecil Plains, in particular, concerned about the effects of coal seam gas on the Great Artesian Basin. They are worried that saline water et cetera could escape into the Great Artesian Basin from the aquifers where gas is being extracted. They are concerned about the potential for great disaster being caused to that great natural wonder which supports the economy of country Queensland and, indeed, Australia so significantly. These are really genuine concerns that these people have. They are not people who should not be taken seriously. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024145"></A>
Likewise, we had the incident recently at Kingaroy, and I was pleased to hear the member for Nanango acknowledge the efforts of the minister in going up there, listening to the people and taking immediate action to stop proceedings. You can understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, the need in the minds of people for a moratorium so that more research can be undertaken. I do not have it in front of me, but my recollection is that in the past the member for Condamine has called for a moratorium on these sorts of activities. Listening to the honourable member for Callide yesterday, I do not think that was his position. In fact, I think his position was balanced and was supportive of development of this industry providing precautions were taken. I think that is a fair summation of his speech.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024147"></A>
There has to be a balanced view taken here not only being cognisant of the views of what we might call the farming sector. We have to also look at the effects on the resources industry and the welfare, the economic welfare particularly, of that part of Queensland--indeed, all of Queensland and Australia--if we were, for example, to adopt a moratorium instantly without other measures being taken.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024148"></A>
Bearing in mind the nature of this bill, some members have advocated that we should concentrate almost entirely on geothermal production of energy or electricity from this source. As I understand it, that would really be a very expensive way to provide electricity to our consumers who at the moment are already, understandably, not happy with the cost of electricity as it is. If we were to do away with coal produced energy, in Queensland, as I understand it, the cost of production of electricity would go through the roof literally. So I do not think that is a realistic alternative either. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024149"></A>
On that recent trip to Roma I noticed--it was obvious--the economic effects of the resources industry, the coal seam gas industry particularly at Roma, in terms of the economic activity in the town, the nature of the vehicles on the road and the number of vehicles on the road, many of which were involved with the mining industry. Ten years ago it might have been the cattle industry. Now it is cattle but to a large extent mining--people staying in motels, getting off airplanes and so on. The effect of the mining industry there is enormous, but so too is the effect in a place like Toowoomba. Many of the aspects of the mining industry are supported by locations in Toowoomba. Be they administration, manufacturing, construction or transport, these headquarters are often in Toowoomba. People live in Toowoomba and travel from there. Many of the small businesses in Toowoomba are associated with supplying the needs of the mining and resources industry. Many new people have come to Toowoomba. Their children go to Toowoomba schools and they attend health facilities in Toowoomba. All those aspects of living that flow from new people coming to an area are happening in Toowoomba, to a large extent because of the opening up of the Surat Basin.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027519"></A>
Toowoomba is greatly affected and influenced by the oil, gas and coal industries in that region of Queensland to which I have referred. I had an opportunity yesterday to obtain a bit of a briefing in relation to the worth, if you like, of the resources sector in Queensland. The figures I received were these: in 2008-09, the resources sector directly and indirectly contributed 20 per cent of the Queensland economy, 12 per cent of the total full-time equivalent employment, $3.4 billion in royalties to the state government, $4.2 billion in company tax to the federal government and had the highest average weekly earnings of all industries of $2,034. It can be seen that this is already a significant industry not just throughout south-west Queensland but throughout the whole of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027524"></A>
Xstrata is proposing to proceed with major works at Wandoan. The Wandoan coal project has indicative capital expenditure of $6 billion. The start-up date is 2014. It would involve 3,000 construction workers and 1,500 permanent workers. Likewise, that company is involved in the Surat Basin rail project with QR and ATEC. That is a billion dollar project and has an indicative start-up date of 2013-14. Some 750 people will be involved in construction. These are potentially huge investments for the south-west of Queensland. Therefore, those interests have to be balanced and taken into account carefully. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027528"></A>
I am pleased that, in my view, the government recognises the contribution of the rural sector, recognises the need to manage the interaction between the resources and agricultural industries and has the aim to ensure the viability of both sectors and ensure a balance between the needs of both sectors. The range of initiatives being progressed by the government and industry to achieve the right balance between resource development, agricultural production and environmental management have been arrived at. The focus on how to proceed really involves minimising the impacts of resource development on strategic cropping land for a start--and a discussion paper has been issued with respect to that--controlling access to private land and ensuring appropriate compensation, which is primarily the subject of this bill, addressing the impacts on the interests of relevant parties with respect to groundwater and addressing the effective and safe disposal of extracted salt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027530"></A>
These are matters that are not covered by this bill, as I understand it, but they are matters that the government has taken action on or is about to take action on. I refer to things like the evaporation ponds. The transitional arrangements for evaporation ponds will be developed in consultation with industry. With respect to groundwater the government is putting in place a new policy regime under the water legislation which will include the establishment of trigger thresholds for changes to water levels in springs and bores, the application of make good provisions to include the impacts on springs and bores built after the granting of environmental authorities and, finally, the development of a groundwater monitoring regime to be funded by way of an industry levy on CSG producers to be oversighted by an independent body. Some of those matters are not relevant to this legislation but they do touch on the overall general problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027533"></A>
In my view, there is a degree of scepticism and mistrust between one sector and the other. It may well be that an independent body could be looked at to do the research properly. The University of Southern Queensland exists. As I understand, it is ready, willing and able to carry out the necessary research. It has a good standing in the community, particularly in the rural industries of south-west Queensland. I would encourage the minister to make some overtures to the University of Southern Queensland in the hope that it could perhaps provide a valuable service in investigating and ultimately giving the assurances that will be necessary. Obviously, government has a vested interest and the resource industry has a vested interest whereas a body like USQ could be regarded as an independent broker in determining the issues that are alive in that part of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027535"></A>
I commend the minister for the legislation before the House. It is another great step towards addressing these issues which are of real concern to my constituents and people living on the Darling Downs and in south-west Queensland. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr HOBBS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Warrego--LNP) (12.45 pm): I am pleased today to be able to speak in the debate on the Geothermal Bill 2010. This legislation is certainly very much overdue. The bill sets out how the state will regulate geothermal resources and the security of tenure and how resource development, and environmental, health and safety issues are managed in this state. The government has continually failed to recognise the importance of this industry and the needs of landholders. We have a wonderful industry out there. We also have a lot of wonderful landholders out there. There is going to be conflict unless we have appropriate rules and guidelines for people to operate under. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027541"></A>
This legislation does make improvements in the arrangements around access to land by resource companies. I refer particularly to the coal seam gas development that is occurring in my electorate especially. We have enormous development going on out there. There are some very good companies who understand the needs of landholders and understand the needs of the community and are doing their bit. There are other companies that do not seem to really understand those needs at this stage and are looking at it purely as a resource and extracting it as soon as they can. There needs to be a lot of work done by those companies who have not stepped up to the mark in relation to how they approach this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027543"></A>
In 2007, there was a matrix report done that covered some of these things, but not all of them. They all tie in to a certain degree. Nothing was done at all at that time. This legislation is two years late in being brought forward. Had there been some foresight and some understanding of the industry and the complications that may occur this legislation would have been introduced sooner. It is here now so it is good in one sense. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027544"></A>
We are certainly dealing with a reactionary government when it comes to these matters. That is not satisfactory for either the landholders or the resource companies. The companies, in good faith, are putting in enormous resources and effort to try to build an industry. I am sure they are frustrated by the way this is being handled. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027546"></A>
The LNP has a very strong position on this and has announced policies to govern the industry. If people understand and believe in these philosophies it makes it a lot easier to legislate. People know where they are going if they have those parameters and beliefs. For instance, we have announced a charter of property rights that recognises pre-existing rights. If people have that philosophy they know how they can legislate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027548"></A>
We have proposed a commission for future food and fibre for strategic targeting of new, growing and emerging market opportunities. If people understand that they can legislate. Another one is protecting genuine prime agricultural land from mining and other incompatible uses. If people understand and believe in that and do not just talk about it they can legislate. We have proposed resourcing our regions to ensure our regions share in a meaningful investment in their communities. This is a significant change to what this government has done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027549"></A>
We have also proposed the establishment of a rural water advisory panel to monitor and report on the impacts of coal seam gas and UCG. The government does have such a committee but it is not properly resourced. It does not have all the resources it needs to be able to manage quickly these emerging issues. At our LNP conference recently we endorsed even stronger measures to ensure the sustainability of our underground water supplies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027578"></A>
Again, this is a reactionary government. Some 65 pages of amendments to this legislation have been released in a short number of weeks. In fact, there was even another amendment added since the shadow minister was told what was in the legislation and what has come before this House. I welcome those amendments, but it just goes to show that there seems to be a bit of catch-up going on all of the time. With regard to the consequential impacts of compensation, it is fundamental to ensure that such issues are covered in the legislation because people look for them. When they are not in the legislation, people ask, ‘Why were they taken out?’ Why were consequential impacts in relation to compensation taken out in the first place? It is fundamental that we do not do those sorts of things. However, that issue is in the legislation now.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027582"></A>
There are also concerns about issues such as consequential impacts in terms of accounting, legal issues and valuations. These matters are some of the basic and fundamental problems that people are facing. They are trying to get professional people to assist them in terms of valuations and the legal complications. A lot of those people in many instances are very good farmers, but they are not legal people. They need to be able to seek this advice in order to understand what all of the documents mean. They need to have access to good advice. In the past we have seen people negotiate on behalf of companies and those people doing the negotiating on behalf of those companies were retired barristers. It is an unfair fight sometimes when people have to come up against those sorts of situations. It is important that we do it right, and I am pleased that this aspect is covered in this legislation. However, why was it taken out in the first place?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027583"></A>
Land access is not understood by many Labor members in this House, and that is a shame. I genuinely hope that debate on this legislation today in the House may help to explain some of those issues. In the past Labor has never had respect for landownership or the blood, the sweat and the tears that go into obtaining and holding on to a block of land. There is enormous effort put in by families over the years to hold on to the land. They have done that through various impacts such as deaths in the family, probates in days gone by, and drought. Enormous sacrifice and effort are put into that, so that land is very important to them. They own and love that land and want to keep it going for generations. They want to make it a better place. There seems to be a belief on the other side of the House that those people want to try to virtually rape the land and pull every tree out and everything else. That is not the case. They want to make it a better place for their kids, a better place for the future and achieve a better environmental outcome. There are so many people out there trying so hard to do that. There has been a lot of effort put into land care over the years and sustainable farming and management. Australia has some of the best farmers and graziers in the world today. In fact, we lead the world in many of our farming practices. So it is important that we understand that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027585"></A>
When other tenure holders are given the right to explore and maybe develop a mining or gas development on that tenure there needs to be some understanding of the needs of both parties, and that certainly has failed. From the landholders’ point of view, in many instances they do not want to see these people come onto their land. However, the reality is that that is the way the tenures are and we have to try to create a situation where they are compatible as best we can. Landholders do not want them in many instances, but if they are there they need to have the least impact possible. However, if they are incompatible the government should not approve the lease. You cannot mine in a national park. You cannot mine in a state forest area. You cannot take a piece of coral from a Barrier Reef island. You cannot take a piece of wood out of a national park. Mining and gas companies take on these projects in good faith, and they also need to have good guidelines. As I mentioned before, some companies do not understand that. It is the case in Australia now that good Aussie companies discovered all of the coal seam gas and got the industry going but now all of the multinationals have come in and taken over the industry and those Aussie companies are basically world conglomerates.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027587"></A>
Security of property rights is a fundamental policy right of the LNP, and for too long Labor governments have taken other people’s property rights for granted and abused and eroded those rights. A simple philosophy is that if the community requires a private asset for community purposes the community should pay. That is a fairly simple way of looking at it, and the community simply has to pay it. Access to land has always been an issue. However, mining companies moving into closely settled areas has highlighted shortcomings in existing legislation. Access to land coupled with the unknown and uncertainty of the impacts of the proposed development have caused tension.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027589"></A>
For example, let us take the instance of a coal seam gas company forcing its way onto the farm. That, coupled with uncertainty in terms of the impacts on underground water, is a recipe for conflict. There is not going to be a lot of logic at the end of the day after they have been through all of that because landholders do not want them there because they think they will damage their water supply. Landholders have to know for sure that there is going to be no impact, know that the government is looking out for them in good faith, know that there is not going to be a detrimental effect on their underground water supplies. Presently, quite frankly, landholders do not really know that. There has to be more work done in that respect. I know that the government is doing work on this now with staff in those areas and briefings are underway. There is a recognition by the government that it is a major issue and there is a bit of catch-up going on.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027592"></A>
The differences between the mineral act and the petroleum act have caused concern in the past, and this legislation should rectify that to bring consistency with the landholders access code. That has always been an issue with not only the landholders but also the companies themselves in terms of the different cost tenures and so forth that were causing a lot of tension. Compensation has certainly always been an issue, particularly when one considers the diminution of the value of the land. There is always an argument in terms of what a property is worth before and after exploration--that is, if a landholder has no wells or 20 or 30 wells, ponds and a 300-man camp. There are places where even the councils do not know that a 300-man camp is being set up at the end of a road. That is just not satisfactory. The council has to fix the road, because eventually the road gets worn out and torn to pieces if it rains. There has to be something put in place, particularly now that we have the accounting, legal or valuation costs. Where a claimant necessarily and reasonably incurs a cost, they can negotiate and prepare a conduct and compensation agreement. That is important.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027593"></A>
With regard to the point I was making before, consequential damage is now in the legislation, and that is good. It needs to be there just to clarify the whole thing if nothing else. Clarification of these things is very important because people are looking for certainty, but the problem is that they do not trust government. We need to understand that. We have to go over the top to ensure that we cover everything well and ensure that we are doing the best we can so they understand that we have a genuine interest in supporting them in terms of making it easier for both sides--not necessarily just the farming and grazing industry in terms of landholders but the mining companies themselves. They are making a substantial investment in these projects. These companies have to have some sort of certainty and understanding where they are going otherwise they will not develop, and that impacts on landholders as well. Whilst late, this legislation is welcome. I hope we can move quickly in terms of bringing in further legislation if other problems come to the fore in order to quickly resolve them.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr FOLEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maryborough--Ind) (2.30 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on geothermal power. This is a very topical and timely issue, because we realise full well that we need to move towards renewable energy rather than rely on fossil fuels. Recently I had the pleasure to travel to New Zealand with the environment committee, capably and well led by the erstwhile member for Pumicestone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035664"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mrs Sullivan:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Thank you.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035665"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FOLEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, the member did a great job. We had a wonderful trip where we were able to review in one trip wind, hydro, geothermal and wave technology.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035666"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Moorhead:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 That sounds like an awful lot of hot air. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035667"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FOLEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No, we worked very hard. Let me assure the member of that. The one thing that came from that trip was that we realised that, when it comes to renewable energy, you cannot have all of your eggs in one basket. A meaningful mix of renewable energy is required to capture the gamut of energy that is required without relying on fossil fuels. Prima facie, geothermal would seem like the silver bullet that is going to fix all of our energy woes. But, as can be seen with underground coal gasification, one needs to weigh up very carefully the safety factors involved in this type of technology. Is it really worth it? We have to ask ourselves that question particularly in terms of safety, such as risking the pollution of the underground watertable. Once that is done, it is impossible to undo. There are lots of things that probably seemed like a good idea at the time, such as BP drilling for oil off the gulf coast and some of the ecological disasters that have been wreaked in places like Papua New Guinea through mining. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035668"></A>
Whilst there are bad things about this bill, there are also some very good things. With regard to the property rights of landholders, this bill seeks to enshrine a fair and reasonable deal for landholders who may be displaced by geothermal energy projects. Through this bill, the minister is at least trying to make up for the shortfalls of previous legislation by increasing the compensation regime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035669"></A>
I guess there is no finer example of the law of unintended consequences than underground coal gasification. This is very much a new and innovative style of energy creation. Those who are on our environment committee know full well that I am the one who is always saying, ‘Let’s look at some of the new stuff.’ In a sense, solar and wind have become old hat, even though they are very efficient generators of power. We need to look at the cutting edge of energy generation, but before we release that technology to the population as a going concern we need to be very careful that there is safety in place for the watercourse. In recent times we have had great rains, and hopefully that has filled up a lot of the underground watertable. The last thing in the world we should then do is do anything that adversely affects the quality of that underground water. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035670"></A>
One of the advantages of geothermal energy is that it requires a very small footprint in terms of surface area. But we have to be very careful about some of the other issues involved. I am not against underground coal gasification per se; I simply say that we need to be very careful about things like UCG until we can be absolutely sure that all of the safety boxes have been ticked. We just cannot afford to have contamination of our underground water. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035671"></A>
When the environment committee went to New Zealand it visited the offices of Mighty River Power. We then drove to the Ohakuri Dam and power station and had a look at a hydro system that has been in operation for many years. You would look at that and say, ‘Boy, that is some pretty clean, green power there,’ because there is such a high snowfall there. The snow caps melt, the water comes down the river and if you simply put a turbine in the middle of that mixture you can generate power. But again, the law of unintended consequences comes through. When we spoke to representatives of Mighty River Power they said that if they had their time over again they would do it differently in terms of not impacting on fish life and flows in the river system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035675"></A>
The environment committee also travelled to the Aratiatia Dam and power station and looked at the generation of power in rapids, which is basically capturing water and then letting it flow out quickly. That was just a stunning place. Those of us who were on that trip really appreciated the incredible brainpower that must have gone into someone designing such an innovative system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035677"></A>
The committee also went to the Wairakei geothermal power station. I was particularly interested in that power station, because that is a very high-tech plant. Put simply, there is so much geothermal activity in that area that steam is able to be taken from the ground and put into a liquid--the name of which escapes me at the moment--that is highly toxic but has an 80 degree Centigrade boiling point. Clearly, unlike water, which needs to be heated to roughly 100 degrees Centigrade to turn into steam, this liquid can be heated from steam in the ground. That then becomes a vapour and drives a steam turbine. Fluid then simply goes off into condensation tanks, cools down and then the whole process starts again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035679"></A>
Some of the most impressive technology that the committee looked at was wind technology. We met with representatives of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority and we met the chairman of the International Energy Agency’s Ocean Energy Systems. You just cannot go innovation for innovation’s sake. I and a few of the other members of the committee felt that some of the sea technology that was being propagated was not that feasible. I know that the member for Pumicestone had some grave reservations about the paint that was put on these things to stop the build-up of products on them as they sat in the sea. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035684"></A>
The West Wind wind farm was just absolutely amazing. A number of members got some great photos. The size of these wind turbines was just amazing. When you see them on the side of the hill they do not look that big, but when you are up close to them you are absolutely dwarfed by even one of the blades and then you realise that this is a fantastic renewable energy. In some respects I wish we had some of the climate of New Zealand so that we could capitalise more on wind power. All in all, it was a fantastic trip. The committee had an opportunity to see renewable energy at its finest.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035685"></A>
One of the comments that was made--and I think this is really relevant to this debate--is that in any consideration of renewable energy you must look at what is the natural strength of the particular area in which you are looking at creating the power. For instance, we wonder why New Zealand has around 20 per cent renewable energy. Clearly, one of the reasons is that it has such an unstable underground environment. There is so much steam and volcanic activity there that it is a heat resource that can be captured and used relatively easily compared to other places. The minister is well aware of the difficulties of creating geothermal power and, in fact, any renewable energy. The hard bit is to create it in a place where it has efficient access to the main power grid but it is not so closely sited to residences and farms that it might impact on people in a negative sense. </Hansard-Body>

Clause 3 of the bill states that the purpose of the bill is to encourage and facilitate the safe production of geothermal energy for the benefit of all Queenslanders. I would urge the minister to focus on safe production, in particular of UCG. The bill provides for the granting of an authority to explore for or produce geothermal energy; the creation of a regulatory system for the carrying out of activities relating to geothermal tenures to ensure that the carrying out of activities relating to those geothermal tenures that conflict with other land uses is minimised; that people affected by the activities are constructively consulted; that owners or occupiers of the land adversely affected by the activity are appropriately compensated; that land and resources are managed responsibly; and, of course, that the use of renewable energy in the state is encouraged. That will in time become a motherhood statement. We are fast realising that some of the things that are done in the name of producing power are very, very dangerous to the environment. </Hansard-Body>

In terms of geothermal power, it is a relatively simple process. Underground heat is produced by the friction of the earth’s plates rubbing together and the molten core at the centre of the earth. Hot rocks underground heat water to produce steam. That can be accessed in a number of ways. By drilling holes down to the hot region, steam comes up and is purified and used to drive turbines which drive electric generators. There may also be natural groundwater in the hot rocks. Whether it is a hot fractured rock system or whether it is a wet system, they are both valid technologies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038393"></A>
The first geothermal power station was built at Landrello in Italy and the second was at Wairakei in New Zealand. Others are in Iceland, Japan, the Philippines and the United States. In Iceland--and members will recall the volcanic issue of recent times which hurt the aviation industry--geothermal heat is used to heat houses as well as for generating electricity. Even if the rocks are not hot enough to produce steam in their own right, they can still be used efficiently. There is a civic centre in Southampton in England that is partly heated via warm liquid rather than the boiling point temperatures. It has a district heating scheme with thousands of customers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038394"></A>
How useful it is, of course, depends on how hot the water gets, where the hot rocks are to start with and how much water may be needed in a wet system to pump down to them. In that context, water is pumped down an injection well. It filters through cracks in the rocks in the hot regions and comes back up the recovery well under pressure. It flashes into steam when it reaches the surface. The steam may be used to drive a turbo generator or pass through a heat exchanger to heat water to warm houses. As I said before, there is a town in Iceland that is actually heated in that way. If we think about it in simple terms, it is the opposite of an air conditioner. A note of caution is that the steam must be purified before it is used to drive a turbine or the turbine blades will get furred up much like in an electric kettle. When we looked at some of the turbine blades in the hydro schemes in New Zealand we saw there was a lot of damage caused by what would be the most pristine waters one could imagine. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038396"></A>
In terms of the context of this bill, one of the challenges is to find places where a geothermal power station can be built. There need to be hot rocks of a suitable type at a depth where they can be reached by drilling. The type of rock is important because it must be a type that can be easily drilled through. Sometimes in the fullness of time the geothermal site may actually run out of steam. Hazardous gases and minerals may come up from underground and it may be difficult to safely dispose of them. That is my concern with UCG. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1038397"></A>
We have a federal election this Saturday. If Labor wins this election it will be very keen to promote geothermal energy as an alternative to a domestic nuclear industry. If Labor wins the election I think we will see a bull market in relation to geothermal stocks--by the way, that is not an investment tip. There is more to the geothermal energy story than what green politicians have embraced. For alternative energies to be adopted at a commercial level they must provide truly reliable, safe and clean power to real customers and very soon. The companies must also provide investors with growing earnings and profits without huge start-up costs and cost blow-outs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038398"></A>
Queensland is a natural place for a solar energy industry but the amount of money that has to be put into the exercise to create even a 1.5 kilowatt PV system requires a tremendous government spend on that technology. We really have to push the other end of the envelope to make for cost-effective renewable energy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038399"></A>
The short version of how it works is simple. The earth has a molten core. About three to six kilometres below the surface of the earth in some places is a layer of super hot granite that can be as hot as 250 degrees Centigrade. Here is a really stunning fact: one cubic kilometre of hot granite at 250 degrees Centigrade has as much energy in it as 40 million barrels of oil. To put it in context, it is very, very significant and has the potential to reduce our continued dependence on fossil fuel or even replace fossil fuel. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038400"></A>
By the nature of its geology, Australia has a lot of hot granite that is within three to five kilometres of the surface of the earth. We have the potential, if we do this right, to create a revolutionary industry in terms of power production. If we are not careful, the wider context of geothermal exploration could be picked apart by disasters that may happen in areas such as underground coal gasification. It would be a great tragedy to see one sacrificed because of the other. I think that this is a good bill and I would urge the minister to not take the brakes off in terms of safety standards for some of the more cutting-edge projects. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Gladstone--Ind)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(2.48 pm): I rise to speak fairly briefly to the Geothermal Energy Bill and to concentrate in particular on property access rights. I commend the minister for concentrating on that. Whilst the new energy that is being targeted in my electorate is LNG, the impact on landowners does not differ, irrespective of the location of the resource. It is my understanding from talking with landowners in my electorate affected by resource development that their clear impression is that often, as freehold title owners, they lack consideration in relation to entry by companies with an interest in the property and minerals or resources below the ground. They also lack the right to protect their property in respect of the use to which they have been putting it. There has been little opportunity for landowners to exercise their rights in relation to freehold title. My understanding of this bill is that it does address in great measure those issues, particularly in the area of geothermal energy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038433"></A>
I would like to thank the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee for its Legislation Alert No. 7, which comments on this bill. The explanatory notes acknowledge that generally the provisions of the legislation may affect the rights and liberties of individuals. More specifically, justification is provided in respect of individual provisions in clause 28. The notes state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038435"></A>
It may be considered that there is a breach of a fundamental legislative principle triggered by this clause, as the Bill claims as property of the State all geothermal energy. It deems, in existing or future tenures, a reservation to the State to carry out, and regulate, activities concerning geothermal tenures. This may be seen as adversely affecting the rights of a freehold landowner. At common law, there is a presumption that a landowner also owns everything on or below the surface of that land (including all minerals on or beneath the surface) subject to an exception for the ‘royal metals’. Also, there is a general common law right of an owner of freehold land to use his or her land in whatever manner he or she thinks fit. In Queensland, however, the holder of freehold land may already hold it subject to a number of reservations to the State. The Parliament has already reserved petroleum (under the <Hansard-Italic>
Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004</Hansard-Italic>
), geothermal energy (under the <Hansard-Italic>
Geothermal Exploration Act 2004</Hansard-Italic>
) and greenhouse gas storage reservoirs (under the <Hansard-Italic>
Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2009</Hansard-Italic>
) in this manner and is entitled to reserve geothermal energy under this Bill. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1038436"></A>
Whilst the state is claiming, on behalf of all people in the state, ownership of those resources captured beneath the surface of the ground, as I have already said there has been a problem for landowners in the way that they were dealt with not only by the prospectors and those who are endeavouring to develop the resource but also, I might add, by the state government and the state government’s representatives. As a parliament, local government and, I assume, federal government, part of our responsibility is to defend the right of individuals and families to the quiet enjoyment of their land and their home. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038437"></A>
I know from my experience--and I am sure the member for Callide and others whose electorates have had prospecting and particularly extraction of underground resources, whether it is gas or coal, would know--of the tension that has developed within landowners’ family structures and emotional structures. We know that often the development of those resources comes at a great price. That tension can be caused by the amount of time between the identification of the resource, the acquiring of all the permits and the development of the resource. The family almost goes into hiatus in terms of what they can do on their property. It can cripple individuals emotionally and psychologically, it can destroy marriages and fracture families. That has been part of the experience in any electorate that has underground resources that are being developed. Therefore, if this legislation gives greater respect and rights to the owners of the properties in their dealings with the resource developers and also the state, certainly it is a step in the right direction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038438"></A>
Recently in the electorate of Nanango we saw the problems that can arise with new technology in the underground coal gasification industry. Those farmers faced difficulties in circumstances that were totally beyond their control. Indeed, they were relying on the state and the state government’s departments to properly monitor the operators of that enterprise. It has transpired that that monitoring and overseeing was ineffective or insufficient. Some farmers could not sell their cattle until after a short withholding period. There was uncertainty about the health impact not only on stock but also on families. Those are the sorts of frustrations that landowners face because of circumstances beyond their control. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038439"></A>
I am most interested in the parts of this bill that give greater certainty, greater rights and greater clarity to landowners who are in the process of having resources developed on their land. The member for Callide spoke of landowners receiving a landowners’ information pack. Many landowners have had no dealings with industry in the past and are in a disproportionate position of power. Few of them are lawyers and they do not have access to lawyers so may not readily understand the legal implications of their situation and, indeed, whether the proponents are going through the right process in terms of access regimes. There are simple things that need to happen--and they should be simple--such as the spraying of vehicles for weed management. The landowners have to rely on the companies to do the right thing. Those companies may be obligated to do the right thing, but they have to do it practically. In many circumstances, the group or the individuals who carry the greatest risk are the landowners, many of whom have been in situ for many years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038440"></A>
The other aspect of the bill that I seek the minister’s clarification on relates to the retailers of last resort. In his second reading speech, the minister states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038442"></A>
Currently, retailers of last resort can recover their costs of providing this service by imposing a fee on the transferred customers. The amendment in the Bill will enable a more equitable approach, by allowing the costs to be spread across all electricity customers through distributors’ network charges. The amendment will enable the improved cost recovery process to be developed and included in the regulation which sets out the details of Queensland’s retailer of last resort scheme. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1038443"></A>
I seek a clarification from the minister on this. With the deregulation of electricity and the ability for consumers to choose from whom they will buy power, is there a risk that the broad distribution network, that is, the group of people who may not have been speculative in their power purchases, will be caught in this new structure and will be required to pay, in part, the costs of perhaps a failed distributor? I seek clarification that there is equity in this changed structure. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038444"></A>
The bill clarifies that the coal seam gas proponents may undertake agreed low impact surface activities that do not invoke a resource right in underground coal gasification pilot areas. The second reading speech states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1038446"></A>
This will allow CSG production activities in surrounding areas to continue whilst allowing for the trial of UCG technology. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1038447"></A>
The member for Nicklin asked me what was my understanding of that. It appears to me that, whilst a CSG proponent may not have approval to commence resource extraction, they will have the ability to undertake low impact surface activities. If that is the case, I would ask the question: will allowing CSG proponents to undertake low impact surface activities infer or imply to the CSG proponent a fairly positive prospect for approvals to continue on the development? Does it place at a disadvantage the landowners or could they reasonably believe that the CSG proponent, without approvals for underground extraction at a point in time, could be disruptive to the landowner, thus undoing some of the good things that this bill sets out to do in terms of protecting landowners’ rights? I seek clarification on those two matters. I look forward to the minister’s summing-up. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr CHOI</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Capalaba--ALP) (2.59 pm): It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak to the Geothermal Energy Bill 2010. At the outset I thank the minister and his team, both within the minister’s office and within the department, for putting together in my opinion a very important piece of legislation, particularly the amendments which address some of the land access provisions of this bill. I do believe that this bill largely addresses most of the issues that I have heard so far regarding land access conflicts between landowners and project developers in terms of facilitating improved relationships between resource companies and landholders, as well as providing consistent and transparent and, more importantly, equitable access arrangements for private land for these activities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038477"></A>
The Geothermal Energy Bill clearly aims to encourage the growth of the clean energy industry by providing a framework to facilitate the safe exploration for and production of geothermal energy. Exploration for geothermal energy was first introduced in 2004 with the implementation of the Geothermal Exploration Act 2004. That act enabled the commencement of geothermal exploration in the state while the legislation to enable production was developed. The bill only regulates large scale production as determined by a threshold. Geothermal energy production that does not meet this threshold will be regulated if those activities trigger requirements under existing legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038478"></A>
Geothermal exploration and production may be conducted across many parts of Queensland, except in those areas declared restricted by the minister. Restricted areas may be released for geothermal exploration by the minister at a later date. A proponent can be granted a maximum area of slightly over 3,700 square kilometres for an exploration permit. The maximum term for a geothermal exploration permit is five years, with subsequent renewals allowed to a total of no more than 15 years. A geothermal exploration permit holder is required to relinquish part of the area of its permit after each five-year period from the date the permit originally took effect to ensure that land is available for other geothermal proponents. Where a resource has been identified, an exploration permit holder may apply for a ‘potential commercial area’ for a maximum term again of five years. This provides the holder with an option to retain an area of the permit for reasons such as attracting further investment or further research and development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038479"></A>
To support the development of the geothermal energy industry in Queensland, the bill allows a maximum term of 30 years for a production lease with no limit on the number of renewals. Proponents are able to apply for a maximum area of slightly over 1,800 square kilometres for a geothermal production tenure. This bill also recognises existing resource tenures by providing a mechanism to ensure efficient use of the state’s resources by allowing overlapping authorities for exploration and also for production. This bill further demonstrates clearly the government’s commitment to cutting Queensland’s carbon footprint and supplying Queenslanders with cleaner energy and an alternative to fossil fuels by implementing this renewable energy legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038480"></A>
As I participate in a lot of community engagement forums, there is no doubt in my mind that one of the biggest problems with the emerging energy sector--whether it is CSG, LNG or geothermal--is the conflict between landholders and project proponents. I am pleased to note that this bill contains landmark amendments to the way resource tenure and authority holders access private land and how compensation arrangements are arrived at. These amendments are essential in my view due to the increase in interaction and conflict between landholders and tenure or authority holders for land use, particularly in the light of continued strong growth in coal seam gas and coal exploration and development across the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038483"></A>
The new land access provisions will make it easier for private landholders and mining and petroleum companies to deal with the complexities and challenges caused by overlapping activities by providing a uniform framework for land access and compensation across all resources legislation. The key elements of the land access policy framework reflected in this bill include a single land access code of conduct, with all tenure and authority holders required to comply with the code; a notice-of-entry process for designed preliminary activities that will have little or no impact on landholders; a requirement to make a conduct and compensation agreement prior to entry on land for advanced activities that are likely to impact the landholder; graduated negotiation and dispute resolution processes; and improved compliance and enforcement processes for administering the code of conduct. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038486"></A>
This bill introduces activity thresholds that increase the level of regulation as the intensity or impact of the proposed activity increases. This is a sensible measure that balances the level of regulation with the level of impact. Early exploration activities can have nil or negligible impact on private landholders. The bill defines these as preliminary activities, which might include taking rock, water or soil samples or simply walking the land. For preliminary activities, resource authority or tenure holders must give each owner and occupier of the land within the tenure or authority area an entry notice and copy of the land access code at least 10 days prior to entry. Access for these activities does not require a conduct and compensation agreement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038489"></A>
Correspondingly, when the impacts are far more significant on private landholders or occupiers, a higher level of accord is required. These activities are referred to as advanced activities. For advanced activities, tenure holders must be party to a conduct and compensation agreement with each eligible claimant for the land. Where agreement is not reached, the framework provides mediation mechanisms in the shortest possible time frame. To assist in the negotiation process, a standard conduct and compensation agreement template has been developed in consultation with resource and agricultural industry peak bodies, along with a negotiation tip sheet for landholders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038492"></A>
The land access amendments introduce an innovative new requirement for mediation to occur between parties if agreement could not be reached. This has been included on the basis that all stakeholders have expressed a desire to keep these matters out of the Land Court and to use all means to negotiate a mutually acceptable outcome for both parties. If both parties decide, they can always go to the Land Court for a final determination. A detailed compliance and enforcement strategy will be developed to ensure that these new measures achieve their full effect on the ground, particularly with respect to the land access code. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038495"></A>
In the balance of my time I would like to briefly touch on the amendment to the Electricity Act 1994 regarding the retailer of last resort scheme. The scheme protects consumers of an electricity retailer that is suspended from the national electricity market or otherwise becomes unable to provide retail services. The scheme ensures that customers of a failed retailer continue to receive electricity supply by transferring them to another retailer, commonly known as a retailer of last resort. But there are costs associated with providing a retailer of last resort. Currently, the scheme provides for a retailer of last resort to recover costs by charging transferred customers a fee, and at times these fees can be significant, especially for small customers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038497"></A>
A retailer of last resort event occurred in December last year when Jackgreen (International) Pty Ltd was suspended from trading in the national electricity market. The scheme operated successfully to transfer customers of Jackgreen to other retailers. However, concerns were raised about the current cost recovery process. The amendments to the act will provide a head of power to enable development of a more equitable cost recovery process to be included in the Electricity Regulation 2006. The proposal would spread costs of a retailer of last resort evenly across all Queensland customers through network charges. This means that, if a retailer of last resort event were to occur in the future, all customers would pay a very small amount instead of costs being met only by customers of the failed retailer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041471"></A>
Retailer of last resort events are very rare, with only two occurring since the commencement of the national electricity market in 1998. The act amendment will enable development of an improved cost recovery process to minimise cost to customers while encouraging retailers to continue to offer the retailer of last resort service. It will also align Queensland’s retailer of last resort scheme more closely with a proposed national scheme expected to be introduced in mid-2012 under Ministerial Council on Energy reforms. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041472"></A>
I am pleased to support this legislation. In conclusion, I want to comment on the state of affairs of Queensland energy. Most people recognise that in the past Queensland has been known as the Sunshine State, and rightly so with more than 310 days of sunshine each year. In recent times, the Sunshine State has been called the Smart State. It is my view that in the near future Queensland will be known as the Energy State because of our clearly abundant supply of coal--if we can develop a cleaner capture and storage technique--coal seam gas, natural gas, solar power, geothermal energy, wind power and tidal power. In my view, these are all very important for the economic development of this state. They will also provide alternative energy for Queensland. I fully support this bill. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr KNUTH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Dalrymple--LNP) (3.10 pm): The regulations proposed in the Geothermal Energy Bill 2010 and accompanying amendments to the Mineral Resources Act 1989, the Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2009, the Petroleum Act 1923 and the Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004 are a long overdue recognition of the need for a more collaborative approach to mining exploration in this state. This is a rare step by this government towards correcting the understandable concerns amongst landowners that the tenure of land that they have toiled over the generations could be at any moment superseded by a tenure to an exploration company for the resources beneath their crops and pastures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041479"></A>
The member for Callide was right when he said that landowners should never be the victims in the necessary but often times complicated issue of land rights. The bill goes further, ensuring stronger negotiation positions for landowners when dealing with resource exploration companies. However, as stated by the member for Callide, there needs to be a greater effort by this government to make landowners aware of the implications of this legislation, their rights as well as their responsibilities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041481"></A>
Only a month ago, carcinogenic chemicals found by a company monitoring bore samples caused the shutdown of local bores within a two-kilometre radius of an exploration site in the Kingaroy basin. While the restrictions imposed by DERM have been lifted, this highlights the permanent impact that exploration can have on the surrounding area, not only the area for which the resource company has tenure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041482"></A>
The coal seam gas industry is a relatively new and untested industry in Australia. I welcome more stringent regulations which entitle landowners to have their say in the methods that resource companies use on their land for exploration. The perception of the mining sectors as the schoolyard bully with legislative protection has contributed to much unnecessary tension between primary industry and the resource industry. This government’s failure to recognise the importance of protecting the agricultural assets that built this state before the shift in our economy to the energy industry has not alleviated this perception. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041485"></A>
The case in the Kingaroy basin brings to bear an even more critical aspect of this legislation--that is, the need for cooperation where landowners feel and believe that mining companies are not a burden but at times an asset. The greatest asset that we have is security of tenure and that is what has made this country great. To undermine that security through vegetation management, spy in the sky satellites, dob in a farmer hotlines and excuses to ride roughshod over land tenure all in the name of mineral wealth or protecting our environment severely contradicts our democracy and the Australian way of life. The need for legislation which recognises the supremacy of principal tenure is fundamental in upholding the authority of land tenure legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041488"></A>
The proposed legislation does not affirm but goes further towards assuring property owners are to have a say regarding operations and mineral development on the properties for which they hold tenure. Landowners deserve legislation that recognises and respects their contribution to the Queensland economy. Cooperative relationships between parties involved in tenure negotiation should see less delay in exploration and development by the mining sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041491"></A>
It is important for landowners to receive appropriate compensation if they have developed their land for generations and, all of a sudden, the situation changes--whether it is a road going through their property or some development in their region. It is important that just compensation is received for all of the costs that they have put into their land. That is why the LNP has a policy of a charter of property rights. We want to ensure that anyone who is affected in any way when it comes to their land being resumed is appropriately compensated. I commend the minister for this legislation because I believe it goes a long way towards fixing issues which have been around since I was elected in 2004, like vegetation management, reef protection, dob in a farmer hotlines--the whole lot. I commend the minister for showing an element of goodwill towards that.</Hansard-Body>

This is important legislation. Two or three years ago, there was a mine spill at Mount Leyshon mines and there is still leakage and there always has been leakage. That spill went into Clarke Creek, the Puddler, the Two Mile, the Broughton and then into the Burdekin River. It contaminated that water. There were a number of dead birds and the people in the town were ropeable, but the sad fact is that it took 20 days before the EPA came out and looked at that contamination. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041495"></A>
I commend the EPA for what it is doing now at the Mount Leyshon site in working with the company, but at that time it was unbelievable that it took the EPA 20 days to even look at it, when only two weeks before a household that had 5,000 bats above its home was visited by an EPA boss from Brisbane who knocked on their door and threatened them on the grounds that they were disturbing the flying foxes. I hope we never see anything like that, but I commend the EPA for its work with Newmont over the Mount Leyshon mine spill. There is still an issue in relation to the landowners in that area. Some of them have not been able to sell cattle for over two years, and that is why it is very important that we ensure we have protection for our landowners.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1041498"></A>
Queensland’s primary industries provide more than $13 billion to the Australian economy and they were recognised as being a main driver through the global economic crisis. It should also be acknowledged that the mining and petroleum industry contributes $26.76 billion to the Australian economy. That is why it is unbelievable that the present Prime Minister and the previous Prime Minister proposed the super tax. These industries were the main drivers through the global economic crisis, but they are being punished by the government in this act of stupidity. I know of a helicopter pilot who sold his helicopter because he lost three mining projects due to the fact that there is no confidence in the mining industry as a result of this proposed super tax. In regard to this legislation, we hope that this is a step in the right direction to ensuring successful exploration tenure negotiations that will see our mining and energy industry continue to grow through cooperation and due respect to our agricultural sector. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The growth of the mining industry in some parts of Queensland I think has taken everybody by surprise, and no more so than in the Surat Basin to the west of Toowoomba, where exploration was on a relatively minor scale for a while, particularly with regard to coal seam methane. All of a sudden there has been virtually an explosion. The sheer size and scope of it have taken people by surprise. There is potential for tens of thousands of bores to be drilled on a grid pattern that is something like 800 square metres apart. Then there is the joining up of all those various bores or wells that have been put down, linking up to various gas lines, taking that gas to a central point or taking it further to Gladstone to export all over the world through 26 or more supertankers. In just a few years, the industry has almost exploded before people’s eyes.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1044367"></A>
Initially everybody saw it as being really good for the economy. It has the potential to provide diversification, particularly in the Surat Basin areas--in the Western Downs from Dalby through to Chinchilla, Miles, Wandoan, Roma, Taroom and Injune. There are massive areas which are as yet untapped so it could go on for many, many years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044371"></A>
It is important because it is another source of energy with a lot of potential uses in the future over and above the oil supplies of the world. The world’s reliance, and particularly Australia’s reliance, on oil as an energy may well be diminished by the discovery of coal seam gas throughout the area. There have been various estimates of what the extent of it is, but it is in the hundreds of years perhaps of supply of this particular form of energy for export or for our own use.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044372"></A>
Along with that has come a lot of community excitement. There has been work for contractors and for people on the land or those living in rural towns. Those towns have been provided with opportunities, particularly for young men and women to work as contractors, to go away to university to get degrees or technical knowledge, and to come back and work in an exciting field. It certainly has been seen as having great potential to provide additional sources of income, population, growth and liveability to some of the towns by virtue of the extra people, extra facilities and work opportunities. Business is doing reasonably well or certainly far better than before. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044373"></A>
However, in the midst of all that excitement I think everybody lost sight of some of the things that were gradually happening and taking over almost like a tidal wave. First of all there has been the issue of access, which has gone from accessing only a few properties to suddenly blossoming into wanting to access on a massive scale a vast area. As I said, some companies are drilling tens of thousands of wells and bores on a grid pattern right throughout this area. That involves on a massive scale drilling, logistics, accessing of properties and the subsequent follow-up with pipelines and possible disruption to the operations of properties.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044375"></A>
When some of these resources were discovered in low-grade country, it was not all that much of an issue. In some parts of the Western Downs--to the west and south-west--it is pretty ordinary country and it has not been a problem. However, as these developments occur on more developed areas there may be irrigation bores, fenced off areas, cattle laneways leading to yards and cell grazing, a lot of fencing, laser levelled areas for irrigation, flood irrigation and precision farming, and the use of GPS and high-tech tractors that can do up to five or six processes in one pass. All of these sophisticated farming areas are now also being impinged upon by this development. Alarm bells first started to sound when landowners found people coming onto their property without the normal common courtesies, protocols or systems being observed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044377"></A>
Very often a company might have said, ‘We’ll do the right thing,’ but as it filters down to different contractors, subcontractors or sub-subcontractors--for example, two or three blokes in a Toyota Land Cruiser--they just drive past the gate, go over to where it has to be done, peg it out, and the next thing the farmer comes out and says, ‘What are you doing here?’ They say, ‘We’re here to peg out where we are going to drill.’ It was almost like that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044378"></A>
This bill today is the result of a committee that has been put together that included organisations like AgForce to endeavour to have in place a proper code of access regime that respects the property rights of people and that has some common courtesies, systems and protocols in place that go right down to people in particular companies. So there can be no excuse for people just driving onto properties and putting pegs out where a centre pivot is going to go around and all the rest of it. That at least is a move in the right direction.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044380"></A>
One of the problems that we face in Australia is that the resources in Australia belong to the Crown; they belong to the people of Queensland. Sometimes people think from watching movies in America, which has a different type of land title, that if oil is found on your property then overnight you are a billionaire. It is a different system over there. The resources are not vested in the Crown; the resources are vested in the property owner. We have a different system. People often say, ‘They can’t just come onto our place, can they, and do things?’ I know there are certain protocols that have to be gone through, but basically companies can take out mining leases over people’s properties. In fact, I understand that something like 70 per cent of the amalgamated Toowoomba Regional Council, which has combined eight councils into one, is under various mining exploration leases or other types of mining permits. That gives the House an idea of the breadth of these mining leases and the number of people that are being imposed upon.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044384"></A>
Go back a couple of decades with the development of the coal industry in Queensland, and much of it was in Brigalow Belt areas and more extensive grazing areas. It still impinged upon people’s property rights but it had a lesser impact than it is having now. Intense drilling, mining exploration, leases and so forth are occurring close to cities and towns, almost surrounding them; in lifestyle areas where there are numbers of small blocks; and in highly productive areas such as the Felton Valley, to the south-west of Toowoomba, and Haystack Plain, just west of Dalby.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044388"></A>
To the north of Toowoomba in the Acland area, where extensive mining now takes place, only about 1 decades ago that was a tightly knit, mixed farming community. There were little Lutheran churches and other churches dotted throughout the area. That entire area is now a social desert. It is a whopping big open-cut mine. Farms have been bought up all over the place. The whole area has been denuded of people and of houses. The company is running a major rural enterprise with only a handful of people because it has bought up all these different farms that eventually will be part of the coalmining exercise there. That coalmining exercise, I understand, will double in the very near future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047297"></A>
That is the dramatic change that takes place. That is what the people of Felton fear and see happening in their area which is one of the most fertile valleys we could find in the world. The Pittsworth to Millmerran area is responsible for the vast bulk of egg production in Australia. The grain production in the Felton valley is very important. It is grown in the beautiful blacksoil on the creek flats through the Felton valley. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047302"></A>
The phrase that the people fighting for the Felton valley and the Haystack area use is that you cannot eat coal for breakfast. That is very true. These are some of the finest agricultural lands that produce domestic production for Queensland and produce exports for Queensland and Australia. The needs of these people and the balance in the whole system have to be considered as we rush headlong into these massive increases in mining. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047303"></A>
Access is covered quite specifically in this bill through a code of access. This should have been there some time before. The pace of the development has been almost exponential. It is good to see that this bill introduces a code of access so that there is some certainty, some courtesy and some regulation when it comes to how access occurs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047304"></A>
Along with the access problem there is the problem with getting rid of the saline water produced from the coal seam methane process. I will deal first of all with the problem water from the coal seam methane process. Thousands of bores are put down to tap into the coal, depressurise the area and suck out the coal seam methane gas. The gas comes out about 50-50 with water. The estimate is that in the very near future there will be about 350,000 megalitres of water a year that will be extracted with the coal seam methane gas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047305"></A>
Currently, that water is being stored in above-ground ponds that cover 20 acres or so. They are somewhat like the ring tanks that are built on the black soil of the Downs in the hope that the water can be evaporated off. They are also using snow machines to fire the water into the air and evaporate it. That water is salty. In many cases it is well above the 3 parts per million that is safe for cattle to drink. It is too salty to be put into the nearby Condamine River where it could then flow into the Balonne and then into the Darling and down into the Murray. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047306"></A>
It is a serious environmental problem. The salts in this water are not the normal NaCl. The salts in this water contain a lot of fluoride and bromide and various other nasties or chemicals which make up salts that are not good salts. There is a real problem with this. The amount of salt that could potentially be left after the water is evaporated off is not wheelbarrow loads or truck loads, it is train loads--and many, many train loads of salt at that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047309"></A>
The problem is what to do with this water and what to do with this salt if the water is evaporated off. If the water were to go through a desalination process it would be a massive desalination process when we consider that we are talking about up to 350,000 megalitres of water a year. If Toowoomba did not have restrictions it would use 15,000 megalitres of water a year. This is potentially 350,000 megalitres of water per year. It is a massive amount of water to be environmentally dealt with so that the land is safe, the rivers are safe and the environment is safe from this huge amount of salt that is brought up in the water from way down in the earth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047310"></A>
The other issue that has suddenly arisen is the concern that people have about the Great Artesian Basin. It is one of the great wonders of the world. The only reason that Australia is populated in many of the areas west of the Great Dividing Range is there is artesian water. It would be almost impossible to run any grazing operation in Western Queensland without artesian water because the rainfall is not reliable enough. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047313"></A>
This is one of the most precious resources we have. It has been likened to the Great Barrier Reef in terms of its value. Not only is this a great national icon but it also delivers water in those areas. It is old water. We are not sure where it comes from and how it is recharged. Some say that it comes from the highlands of New Guinea and over hundreds of years it seeps through rock. It is very old water. If this water is not carefully looked after and managed by capping the bores and no longer having open drains for water for sheep and the pressure and level of the water is not maintained the levels will seriously drop down and it will take a long time to recover, if at all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047314"></A>
People are worried about the depressurising of these areas with the use of tens of thousands of bores. What is that going to do not necessarily to the artesian bores but to the other bores that do not go into that level but go down into the basalt or other areas? Is the depressurising going to drop the level of water? Will the mining activities impinge upon the viability of farming or grazing operations or impinge upon towns in these areas where there is this rapid development having a water supply? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047315"></A>
What is going to happening to the artesian water from the Great Artesian Basin with this deep drilling in that area? Is it going to allow water to seep from one area to another? Is it going to depressurise areas? What is going to happen in years to come? Will these bores ever be filled in with concrete so they remain an impervious connection between different levels of underground water on different rock shelves and at different levels? Much of this is unknown. Given the pace of the development and the pace of exploration, this is worrying people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047316"></A>
Whilst this bill deals specifically with the code of access there are other issues that we are faced with at the moment. We have to deal with the thousands of megalitres of saline water that is brought up with the coal seam gas. We have to make sure that there is absolute security of water supply from the Great Artesian Basin and from the other underground water structures that are so vital to farming and people being able to live in those areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047317"></A>
I know that this bill deals with the overlapping of leases. Recently we saw an issue in Kingaroy. There was the scare of contaminated water from the coal gasification process going on there. I saw this in its early stages at Chinchilla a number of years ago. People have said it is new technology. It is old technology. It is based on what the Russians used to do in Siberia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047318"></A>
Coal gasification is quite a crude system. The coal underground is set on fire and burnt so that the gas is discharged and comes up through the pipes and collected. Following the drilling down at different grid points and the burning the ground subsides. We end up with properties that are roly-poly and up and down. People would not want to ride a horse through some of these places after a few years. They would have a tumble if they were going at any speed. The ground subsides due to the burning of the coal. It depends on the level at which the coal is. I saw that in the area between Chinchilla and Kogan some years. They were doing initial trials and tests there. I saw the subsidence and spoke about it with the people there. That is the legacy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047319"></A>
The code of access at least addresses one particular problem. But we have ongoing problems and issues. One of the big ones is respect for people’s property rights. I know the LNP has come forward with a marvellous five-point plan that respects property rights. It looks at the issues around food and fibre production and protecting the water rights of people. That is important. What we need in the future is a five-point plan like the LNP has put forward. Areas like Felton and Haystack, prime pieces of agricultural land, could then continue to feed the people of Australia and indeed the world. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind) (3.39 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on the very important Geothermal Energy Bill. At the outset I indicate to the House that the member for Nanango has unfortunately had to leave the parliamentary precinct to visit a very close friend who is dying. If a vote is taken on this bill before the member for Nanango returns and members wonder why she is not voting on this bill after her contribution to this debate yesterday, that is the reason.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050308"></A>
Very clearly, this is a proposed new law to regulate mining and geothermal energy exploration in Queensland, and the bill amends a number of Queensland acts--the Mineral Resources Act 1989, the Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2009, the Petroleum Act 1923 and the Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2009. The bill simply sets out a whole range of new laws to better regulate a range of issues, including the code of access to private land by mining and exploration companies and mediation and compensation issues--an issue which members have certainly touched on in great detail. The bill also distinguishes between preliminary activity and advanced activities. The bill is also an attempt to better reconcile competing interests between freehold land, leasehold land, and mining and exploration permits throughout Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050314"></A>
This is nothing new. The state government has always been challenged to find the best fit to reconcile these competing interests in Queensland. Queensland has a number of categories of land tenure ranging from freehold land through to leasehold land through to a whole range of state government permits. All of those permitted activities enable landowners and lessees to undertake a range of permitted activities. The government also very clearly sets out a range of prohibited activities, and the prohibited activities depend upon the will of the government of the day. History will show very clearly how previous state governments and this state government have reflected the will of the government as to how they want to either better protect certain parts of Queensland, be it our natural land or our waterways, and how other permitted activities are able to take place. Marine parks are protected under the Marine Parks Act 2004. Recreational areas throughout Queensland are protected under the Recreation Areas Management Act 2006. A whole range of different state forest reserves are protected and regulated under the Forestry Act 1959. National parks throughout all of Queensland are protected and regulated under the state Nature Conservation Act 1992. We protect land and waters for a whole range of different reasons.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050322"></A>
With regard to this bill, I note that it has proposed a simple way to deal with overlapping mineral and pilot tenure. At the moment Queensland has three pilot trial underground coal gasification plants. One is at Chinchilla, commonly known as Linc Energy, and then there are two, Cougar Energy and Carbon Energy, in Kingaroy in my Independent colleague the member for Nanango’s electorate. These three underground coal gasification plants are dealt with under this bill pursuant to their respective mineral development licences, and they are, as stated in the bill, licence No. 309, licence No. 374 and licence No. 385. They are specifically identified in this bill with regard to pilot tenure licences. I understand that the bill will enable these activities to continue their underground coal gasification trials until 2012, unless the state government intervenes and stops it earlier. As I understand it, under this legislation these three underground coal gasification trial plants are able to have priority to continue their trial works until the government stops it or on the advice of an expert and scientific panel which is due to report back to the government by 2012, or earlier if necessary.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050326"></A>
The bill also deals with overlapping mining and exploration approvals that apply to the same land. I understand that trial underground coal gasification projects will have priority over coal seam gas projects which may be in that same area, yet I understand that coal seam gas investigations are able to still continue on the basis that they are deemed to be low-impact work as set out in this bill. I note the minister’s second reading speech where he said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050333"></A>
The Bill also clarifies that coal seam gas ... proponents may undertake agreed low impact surface activities, that do not invoke a resource right, in underground coal gasification ... pilot areas. This will allow CSG--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

technology.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1050338"></A>
That is there for us all to see in black and white. There is no doubt about what we are voting for in this bill, notwithstanding the range of other very significant improvements in trying to better manage the conflict between landowner and miner interests.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050341"></A>
That leads me to a meeting that I attended at the last sitting of parliament where many farmers--husbands, wives and children--from the Darling Downs and Central Queensland travelled to Brisbane to parliament. During that meeting I was presented with a letter. This letter was from Friends of Felton, the Darling Downs community, the Queensland Conservation Council, Friends of the Earth and Community Climate Network Queensland. It was a letter to the Premier and the Leader of the Opposition headed ‘Our Land, Our Water and Our Future are Under Threat’. That letter simply asked for a moratorium on coal seam gas development until social and environmental issues are resolved. It also asked for a ban on underground coal gasification and a prohibition on new coalmining and coal seam gas extraction on cropping lands in proximity to towns and areas of high ecological value and adjacent to protected areas.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050353"></A>
These are very valid and justified requests, because over the years we have seen the state government respond to many requests. We have seen the marine parks being protected. We have seen a whole range of changes to laws in Queensland to pass specific acts of parliament to prohibit certain activities and protect others. What disappoints me after listening to the debate that has happened to date is that I understand the position the government has put. I understand the reasons and the lengthy preparation that has gone into the drafting of this bill by the minister, the government and previous ministers. However, my real concern is that we have an opportunity as Independents and members of the opposition to stand up and very clearly say, ‘We want to protect our good quality agricultural land. We want to value our good quality agricultural land because it is prime land and there is not a lot of it around. This is a chance to protect it for the future.’ In this regard, I find the opposition wanting.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050357"></A>
At that meeting I attended with farming families from the Darling Downs a mother came up to me and said, ‘Peter, we know you’re not our local member but please don’t forget us.’ All they want is the state government of the day to recognise the importance of their land--not because they own it but because of the uniqueness of their land because it is so limited in our country and because it is good-quality agricultural land and good-quality cropping land. The disappointment I have at the moment is that the alternative government for Queensland is not flagging that it will protect that land. It is saying a whole lot of words, but when we have an opportunity to stand up and say, ‘We do not want to allow these pilot programs to continue because we want to protect your land because of the uniqueness of it,’ I believe the opposition is found wanting. We have that opportunity.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050359"></A>
The government has placed a challenge before the opposition and Independents because it has included in this bill this very challenging component. The question is: will the opposition join the member for Nanango, me and hopefully other Independents and members of the Queensland Party in saying, ‘No. We are drawing a line in the sand. We will support the calls from the people from the Darling Downs and Central Queensland in saying that their land is special and their land is unique’? We are sending a very clear message that if we have the chance to form an alternative government--whatever form that may be--legislation will be passed to protect their land because of the agricultural significance of it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053438"></A>
Under our national parks throughout Queensland there is a whole range of mineral deposits, but we do not see mining companies lining up to make applications to mine in our national parks. Why is it that this government and this opposition are not prepared to take a similar stand on the good-quality agricultural land in Queensland? There is a limited amount of it. I believe that this is a chance for us to say very clearly that we are prepared to pass similar, strong legislation that sends the message to the multinational companies and the mining companies that are certainly wealthy and able to influence the government, the opposition, or whoever wants to listen to them, ‘Don’t waste your time because this land needs to be recognised because of its agricultural pursuits.’ I will support the Darling Downs community and I will support those parents and those children who are trying to protect their agricultural land by making it very clear that, when I vote on this bill, I will be voting against it because I believe to vote otherwise is sending a very clear message to all of those mining industries that, by supporting this bill, we are supporting the continuation of the pilot trials for the underground coal gasification proposals and perhaps in the future for the coal seam gas projects. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053439"></A>
One of the members of the opposition spoke about how dare other people enter into their territory and pursue some of these issues. Reference was made to the Greens and, in the member’s words, the so-called Friends of the Earth and how they are so quick to exploit the situation. Basically, the member was insinuating that these political activists were influencing and manipulating his or the Liberal Nationals’ constituents. Can I say quite clearly that as an Independent I am not being influenced by the mining companies. I have no bone to pick with them apart from, as an Independent and a representative of state parliament and Queensland, being prepared to go wherever people want me to go to try to support their cause and I believe they have a just and valid cause. My challenge to the opposition as the alternative government for Queensland is to be stronger for their constituents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053441"></A>
I also would like to congratulate the minister for sending out the information packs. I know other members have spoken about this and have also congratulated the minister for them. I would hope that this information pack is able to be circulated throughout Queensland, similar to the letter that the former government sent to all landowners when it chose to change the tree clearing laws in Queensland. I cannot remember another time prior to that where a government wrote an individual letter to all landowners. There is a lot of valuable information in this information pack. But unfortunately, as other members have indicated, many members of our communities do not come into regular contact with politicians and they do not come into regular contact with bureaucrats. Yet there is so much information in this information pack that I believe would benefit and better inform all members of our communities. So can I put on the record my congratulations to the minister for this great information pack and the staff who have been involved in putting it together. I would urge the minister to use whatever means to make many of them available. I am not sure what the current run of them is. I have certainly put in a request for quite a few of these to be delivered to my area on the Sunshine Coast. Whilst I have some mining areas in my electorate, certainly it is not anything to the extent that is on the Darling Downs and in Central Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053442"></A>
The last issue that I want to touch on--and I do not want to be simply having a go at different people; I suppose we all have a chance to say what we want to say--is that I took the opportunity to look at the Liberal National Party’s alternative proposal to have a charter for property rights. I listened to the member for Condamine address some of his constituents and other people at the last sitting of parliament at the entrance to Parliament House. He spoke about the charter of rights but what I did not hear was--and I have not heard this during this debate to date and I have tried to listen to all speakers--any real willingness to say, ‘We can put a line around this area in Queensland and say that this area is to be protected for agricultural purposes.’ We have heard previous governments say that and previous governments do that. My challenge to the Liberal National Party is to go further than their charter of property rights. The people I speak to say, ‘We don’t want compensation. We believe our land is special and unique because of what it is. It should be protected. Why is it that our land cannot be recognised in a similar capacity to our national parks or recognised in the way the Great Barrier Reef is recognised? Why do we not have a government and an opposition that is prepared to give us similar recognition because of the uniqueness of the land that we happen to be farming on?’ A whole range of members have spoken about the greatness of the agricultural value of the land, but I have not yet heard a member from the opposition or the government say, ‘We will legislate to protect it and this is how we are going to do it’ or even to go so far as to say, ‘These are the proposed boundaries for your land.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053443"></A>
Another member of the opposition spoke about how some of their constituents were being influenced or manipulated by outsiders. Can I say that at least Peter Garrett, the federal minister for the environment, has asked some further questions. I wonder what will happen if the government does change. I am not picking favourites; I do not know what is going to happen at the election on Saturday. Quite frankly, I do not know who is going to win. I know in my area we have a federal member who has simply been taking the people for granted. I hope he gets the greatest wake-up call ever, because members in safe seats deserve to get wake-up calls. I believe that may be the only reason I was ever elected, because the former member took the seat for granted. At that time it was deemed by the National Party to be a safe seat and to not worry about it. Safe seats in Queensland can never be taken for granted. I hope that at the federal election this Saturday a message will be sent to all those members who occupy safe seats in Queensland that they should not be allowed to take their constituents for granted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053444"></A>
 I do not know what will happen after the federal election. I wonder if Peter Garrett will stick to his guns and get more information or if his alternative will simply say, ‘Yes, big business, mining companies, we need you because of all the industry and all the money you are going to bring. Forget about the good agricultural land. That can happen somewhere else.’ Maybe it will happen in China. Who knows? I do not know how much good agricultural land China has but, by crikey, we certainly get a lot of imports into our shops in Queensland that have been produced in China. I will resume my seat and look forward to listening to the contributions of other members. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr FINN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Yeerongpilly--ALP) (3.56 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Geothermal Energy Bill--a bill that is central to the ongoing development of renewable energy options for Queensland. The bill is about climate change. At the outset, I say that I believe that climate change is happening, that it is caused by human activity and that action must be taken. </Hansard-Body>

Australia is a country that, comparatively speaking, is not rich in developed renewal energy sources. The proportion of renewable energy generation in Australia, whilst increasing, remains low in a world sense. As we close on 10 per cent, we remain well below the world average, below the OECD average and below countries including Turkey, Mexico, China, Italy and Brazil and way behind India and New Zealand. Today, as we have a target across Australia of 20 per cent renewable energy generation by 2020, our close neighbours across the Tasman have a target of 90 per cent. </Hansard-Body>

New Zealand, with its mountainous topography and fast-flowing downhill rivers, has harnessed this energy with hydro schemes for decades and these schemes are the basis of New Zealand’s place in the top five countries in the world for renewable energy generation. Wind farms are in rapid development. As the roaring forties belt across the New Zealand land mass, some large scale farms are already in operation. As well, local landholders are contributing to the grid in smaller scale with single turbine generation. There are also opportunities for wave and tidal energy generation, with several companies developing prototypes to harness the natural energy of the sea. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053450"></A>
But geothermal energy is one of New Zealand’s most reliable sources of renewable energy. New Zealand’s first geothermal plant opened in 1958 and, whilst geothermal provides approximately only 11 per cent of generation, there are several plants mapped for future energy needs. It is estimated that in New Zealand some 3,600 megawatts in geothermal remain untapped. Geothermal operations in New Zealand are primarily based on harvesting the vast reserves of geothermal fuel that is located very close to the surface, with some plants reinjecting cooled fluids to continue a cycle of generation. This reinjection is critical to the renewable integrity of New Zealand’s geothermal energy production. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056483"></A>
Here in Queensland we are not so blessed with this readily available renewable mix. With a few exceptions, the vast majority of wind resources are along the southern Australian coastline. Similarly, wave generation is at its best in other places--tidal generation too, although the Australian government mapping of current movements indicates some possibility of harvesting this energy. The topography of Queensland has also meant that large scale hydro is not developed in this state, although some smaller scale schemes exist. Much of Queensland’s current renewable energy generation comes from biomass and there are great opportunities to expand this energy source into the future. And we all know about our fantastic solar resources. After decades of work on how to affordably harvest solar, the deliberate focus of this government to advance solar harvesting is getting results. Solar panels on schools and kindergartens, a solar focus for Gambling Community Benefit Fund grants, the feed-in tariff and rebates for solar hot-water systems are all enabling small scale generation to reduce household grid demand and to generate back to the grid. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056484"></A>
When the Solar Bonus Scheme was announced in March 2008 there were 1,200 homes generating power from rooftop panels. By April this year this had grown to more than 23,000 home systems. Along with the more than 180,000 hot-water systems, this has resulted in more than 250 megawatts of power coming from the sun instead of from a coal powered station. Today this government has a target of doubling this generation, with a target of 500 megawatts by 2015: a virtual power station generating power across Queensland roofs. Large scale solar generation projects have also been announced, with an investment in solar thermal at Kogan Creek developing the largest solar thermal project in the Southern Hemisphere. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056485"></A>
Just as solar has taken time to develop into a viable affordable energy source--and there is still a long way to go--we must continue to invest in opportunities to harvest other sources of renewable energy. Geothermal energy is a relatively young science in Queensland, but there is no shortage of people who are excited about its potential. For Queensland geothermal energy is about harnessing the heat of the earth’s core, or the hot rocks as it is better known, to produce steam to drive turbines. What we know is that there are potentially large areas of Western Queensland where the hot rocks may be close enough to the surface to be able to drive geothermal power generation. What we hope is that this energy can be harnessed in an environmentally safe way. What we hope is that this can be done in an affordable way. And what we hope is that this energy source can reduce our reliance on coal fired power generation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056486"></A>
The answer to these questions is dependent on government assisting the development of the geothermal industry and, importantly, implementing the legislative protections to define ownership issues and to regulate exploratory activities. As government invests funds into the industry, most notably investing in the Queensland Geothermal Energy Centre of Excellence and the Coastal Geothermal Energy Initiative, we must also develop the frameworks to enable industry development. The coastal initiative is extremely important. One of the major challenges for much of our geothermal potential is its location in relation to the electricity grid. The far west of Queensland, where geothermal mapping shows a potential energy source, is a long way from the grid and at an estimated cost to develop transmission at $1 million per kilometre this is a significant issue for the development of this industry. But we cannot let cost kill off the opportunity. Development of the industry will require government investment, it will require innovation and it will require governments to grapple with the public and private funding mix of energy generation and transmission. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056487"></A>
This bill continues the development of this framework through implementing government policy for geothermal energy production by underpinning the concept that the Queensland people own all geothermal energy resources; ensuring a consistent approach with other Queensland resource based legislation; and providing security and flexibility for the fledgling geothermal industry. This framework is designed to encourage the production and use of geothermal energy to develop a cleaner and greener energy generation profile for Queensland. We simply must reduce our reliance on coal fired energy generation. It is this government that has placed strong emission standards and retrofitting requirements on any future development of coal fired power stations. It is this government that has developed the gas industry and gas fired energy generation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056488"></A>
I welcome this move away from coal reliance. But in my view we must have a vision for a future that moves away from gas fired energy production also. Whilst gas results in reduced carbon emissions when compared to coal there are nonetheless higher emissions from gas than other renewable sources. We must have a vision and set targets that see gas fired energy generation as a transition phase to a similar renewable energy mix as developed by our New Zealand neighbours. This bill delivers a regulatory framework for large scale geothermal exploration and a regime for land and resource management. The bill encourages geothermal industry investment in Queensland and is the next legislative step towards delivering a cleaner and greener energy future for all Queenslanders. I commend the bill.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.04 pm): In 150 years the world has grown in a spectacular fashion, largely on the back of transmitted energy during industrialisation. Fossil fuels, starting with coal, have largely driven that growth. Coal is still and will remain the key ingredient that drives global growth. Here in Queensland coal remains our key mining export, supplying the second and third biggest economies in the world with feedstock for their power stations and their steel-making plants. Here in Queensland we are diversifying our energy exports to include gas--both CSG and UCG--to a demanding market globally. Enhanced geothermal systems--geothermal energy--is a major new baseload energy producer. In fact, it is the only known method and source of renewable energy as defined with the capacity to carry a large baseload. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056491"></A>
The bill, whilst having a primary focus on geothermal energy, also involves the adjustment of those laws regarding land access. The minister in his second reading speech stated that the new changes have been developed collaboratively with key resource and agricultural sector stakeholders. Fortunately the bill introduces new provisions for access to private land and compensation. This is to be supported. The minister’s description of the five key points are reassuring for all. They have been described today as: compliance with a single land access code of conduct; notice of entry requirements; conduct and compensation agreements; prescribed negotiations; and improved compliance and enforcement powers. With these changes coming in well in advance of the extensive rollout of EGS--that is, the enhanced geothermal systems--landholders can expect to be more fairly dealt with. The issues relating to those affected by UCG primarily would reasonably lead anyone to say that these changes are appropriate, measured and respond to the problems that have been consistently raised by landholders on some of our prime agricultural land. It has been well described in parliament today and earlier. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056492"></A>
The critical changes to be implemented as a result of this bill are those changes I referred to earlier relating to the management of property, access and dispute resolution. There are some other changes in the bill relating to the Electricity Act and the Timber Utilisation and Marketing Act. These are reasonable. Queensland has a fairly long history of access and mining leases and what to do and what not to do. The hope of this bill is that we might just do things a little better. The shadow minister has gone into this extensively. It would be repetitive to go through the issues he raised. I will not go there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056493"></A>
I too remain very disappointed that the fringe green groups have attempted to attach themselves to local farming groups on the Downs challenging primarily UCG groups. Hypocritically, these groups have struck rigid preference deals with federal Labor to facilitate Labor’s re-election federally. How anyone could conceivably entertain open discussion with such pretenders is beyond me. Such are sometimes the actions of desperate people. I do hope that the changes in this bill can give new hope to farmers, their families and local communities that they will not be sold out cheaply to facilitate others’ rights pre-emptively. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056494"></A>
I intend to focus primarily on the issue of EGS and its technical aspects. I endorse some of the comments made by the member for Yeerongpilly in relation to alternative systems globally. EGS has as its core application the use of heat exchange technology; using superheated water pumped from one shallow underground water reservoir to superheated granite fractured seams three to five kilometres underground by very deep wells. The steam produced powers very largely distantly located power plants. The demonstration power plant of geodynamics, which is a one megawatt station, seems to have been reasonably successful as a renewable energy producer. Unfortunately, the power is being generated a long way from where it is needed. As has been described, it currently costs $1 million per kilometre for transmission. It may provide a long-term solution for us and a medium-term solution for baseload supplies for regional communities currently supplied by diesel electric generators. There are plenty of regional centres in Western Queensland that fall into this category. In New South Wales alone over the last three years baseload electrical demand has increased by 2.6 per cent and peak demand by 2.9 per cent consistently. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056495"></A>
The concern from an environmental management point of view is what is the impact of injecting groundwater into deep seams of fractured granite. These concerns range from groundwater contamination to Great Artesian Basin contamination to possible alteration in the earth’s seismic activity. Whilst Australia is at low risk of earthquake, we have had severe earthquakes in Newcastle where there has been extensive deep mining underground and blasting.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062470"></A>
Concerns may be more perceived than based in reality. The earth is 4.6 billion years old with a relative depth of 6,371 kilometres radius and a core temperature estimated to be between 5,000 and 7,000 degrees Celsius. The crust’s temperature is 1,000 degrees Centigrade. Australia is indeed an ancient land. Similarly, its geology is comparatively very old. The areas that are intended to be drilled and tapped are very old volcanic segments of the earth’s crust. One needs to be very careful about potentially destabilising both subsurface ground-holding water and underlying deeper, largely impenetrable rock, creating new aquifers. There are legitimate concerns that the wells either may have a relatively short life or need to be intermittently left empty because the heat contained within the rocks needs to renew itself. Certainly the earth has a deep molten core with vast amounts of retained energy, but the earth is very deep at 6,500 kilometres and the heat can take some time to be conducted to those energy depleted areas in the top 0.088 per cent of its thickness. I intend to go into the details of those granite rocks a little later.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062471"></A>
The energy in those areas is stored energy. It is only renewable energy by virtue of the fact that the energy may otherwise be lost, it does not have to be burnt to produce heat, it does not produce greenhouse gases and its energy coefficient is stored in a different form to those other commonly used materials, that is, it is in rocks. It is different to solar energy for that energy is supplied by the sun and releasing that energy is radiation. EGS is energy coming from the earth, so it is incorrect to group it with solar, wind, tidal, wave and hydroelectric. It may be considered to be nuclear energy. Maybe it is not a true renewable, but with vast energy reserves due to retained heat it is almost inconceivable that these types of stations will have any impact on the quantum of energy needed to retain the earth’s energy homeostasis. As I said, this energy is trapped in granites by overlying rocks acting as an insulating blanket. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062472"></A>
The Queensland site most studied is the Cooper Basin, where 320 million years ago granites were extruded from the earth’s molten core and covered by four kilometres of sedimentary layers of the earth’s crust as an insulating blanket. Primarily, this contains oil, gas and coal, as we know. When it was extruded it was super heated by solar radiation and much of that energy was retained within it. The energy is measured at an average temperature of 250 degrees Centigrade, which is considerably higher than the average core temperature of 180 degree Celsius in Europe, where the geology is more recent. The heat in the rocks is largely naturally occurring through radioactive decay. Therefore, the heat results from both earth contribution and solar sun contribution. As such, it blurs the definition of truly renewable energy. For those who missed the critical words, those core extruded granites contain 50 parts per million thorium 232, 20 parts per million uranium 238235 and four per cent potassium, some as potassium 40. Those radioactive substances are in slow decay and generate 10 microwatts of heat per cubic metre continuously for hundreds of millions of years. This is nuclear power at work. When they cooled originally, the granites fractured, filled with water and eroded. These mini-nuclear reactors, as they are, then superheated the water in those fractures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062475"></A>
By virtue of the temperature gradient, currently in the Cooper Basin it is 60 degrees per kilometre of depth vertically as the wells descend into the earth’s crust, as opposed to 30 degrees Centigrade elsewhere. This reserve is 1,000 square kilometres alone, with one drill hole per square kilometre and each square kilometre containing roughly 40 million barrels of oil equivalent. That means that the Cooper Basin, excluding its existing shale, oil and gas reserves, is a reserve of 50 billion barrels of oil. It is one-fifth the size of Saudi Arabia, 12 times that of the North West Shelf and it has a 25-year, fully developed reserve life if the whole thing is drilled. It is one-fifth the size of the Galilee Basin supply. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1062476"></A>
Our fossil fuels are primarily accused of causing all our current problems and are, in fact, what we are surviving on at the moment. The reason that we need to look for alternatives is only in a small part driven by their burning and the issue of contributing to climate change. A greater problem for humans is the pollution caused by burning fossil fuels close to our communities. Their supplies are really in slow decline and it is far more difficult to find new supplies at a reasonable cost. The major issue is that the internal combustion engine that we are currently using cannot be made more efficient, because of the issue of diminishing returns. You get to the point where as the technology gets better the percentage improvement starts to decline. We have been at that point for the past 25 years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062477"></A>
What has been going on externally are the things that we really need to take issue with. The recent massive solar flares and the Finnish volcano eruption released far more harmful radiation and CO<Hansard-Subscript>
2</Hansard-Subscript>
 than burning 50 years worth of fossil fuels in every country of the world. Strangely, fossil fuels derive their energy coefficient by virtue of photosynthesis. For those who may have forgotten, that is using solar energy and CO<Hansard-Subscript>
2</Hansard-Subscript>
. Plants use carbon to store energy and produce O<Hansard-Subscript>
2</Hansard-Subscript>
 as a by-product when burnt energy is produced. It is only deemed nonrenewable because the production of CO<Hansard-Subscript>
2</Hansard-Subscript>
 is deemed to be a greenhouse gas. Geothermal energy does not produce greenhouse gasses and is deemed to be renewable by virtue of the fact that no-one yet knows whether we will reduce the earth’s capacity to capture and store CO<Hansard-Subscript>
2</Hansard-Subscript>
 by interfering with its own retained energy that is in the rocks. There are only six sites in Australia where this technology is applicable. Those reservoirs are defined as areas where the earth’s temperature is above 225 degrees Centigrade at five kilometres of well depth vertically. As I said, the two major zones are the Galilee Basin and the Cooper Basin, and it is the Cooper Basin that has been most defined. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062478"></A>
One cubic kilometre at 250 degrees Centigrade will, tentatively, yield 40 million barrels of oil. Australia consumes 953,000 barrels of oil annually. The USA consumes 20.8 million barrels of oil. Currently we import 687,200 barrels, we export 300,000 barrels, we produce 586,400 barrels and we are in slow decline. As at July 2009, in Australia 48 companies are exploring for geothermal energy. With $1.5 billion forecast to be spent through 2013, this is potentially big business for Australia. In terms of costings, which I think are relevant at this point, currently the cost for clean coal is 6.5c per kilowatt hour and for black coal the price is 3.5c per kilowatt hour. The cost for solar and wind is 8c per kilowatt hour and is not deemed to be commercially viable. Basically, at the current cost of geothermal energy, the projected cost looks to be 4c per kilowatt hour with green credits, which seems to be within the ballpark of affordability for the nation. Currently, gas costs 4.2c per kilowatt hour. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062479"></A>
Basically, to enable EGS geothermal exploration, we need to understand that we have a 20 per cent renewable target, which it is reasonable to work towards. This is potentially big business for Australia. As I say, currently the power plant will produce only one megawatt, but the intention is to get to a 25 megawatt plant within 10 years. Basically, a 50 megawatt plant with nine wells, five production and four injection, and multiples can be scaled up to a 500 megawatt system as opposed to volcanic plants, which were discussed earlier by the member for Yeerongpilly. They do not emit potentially dangerous gases and elements as do those plants. Technically, they are not renewables under the current guidelines. The gases that are emitted are primarily hydrogen sulphide and cyanide. EGS does not emit those at all, but it does fracture the granites to unlock the heat. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065543"></A>
Currently, 9,000 megawatts of power generated by these systems are installed world-wide. In comparison, for those who may know, the latest nuclear systems are largely 2,400-megawatt systems. That is the general norm. As has been said, these systems are throughout the world. Unfortunately to date, the long-term success of the technology is to be driven in part by need, regional location of power supply, tax breaks and possibly future green energy credits. Without those green energy credits, when it comes to the future growth of the industry, in a world where the global price of a barrel of oil is only currently US$75, it may be that we get to that target a little slower. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065545"></A>
Rather than listening to all the noise about those who claim to be green but have no idea about accessible technology for energy generation, one might consider that the EGS is a small but uniquely applicable alternative energy source that has a unique application to Queensland and Australia. It will never be a major input, but it might be comparable to solar. This is true solar, not the kind that has currently been implemented in places like Cloncurry, where they only had four panels installed instead of 1,200. We have talked a little bit about solar. Basically solar can be generated by smaller units. Solar installations can range from three-kilowatt units that the average home should be looking at to the massive five-megawatt units which power some communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065548"></A>
The issue of biomass was raised earlier. In my electorate of Gaven, the tip at Molendinar, which is a considerable landfill site, will close over the next couple of years. By installing a methane gas extraction system, utilising harvest wells and watering from above using treated recycled water, this continuous system has the potential on the current site to yield five megawatts of power and massively reduce smell and future groundwater contamination. This is green energy at work and does not require much more than a methane concentrator, water and a heat exchanger. It puts all old landfill sites to work long past the dumping of household and commercial waste. This is also a form of geothermal energy. Every megawatt of power generated should earn a measurable green energy credit. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065551"></A>
When the oil price was double the current price, the technology was strongly viable independent of green credits. But, even with green credits currently, it is said that the technology is almost at the point where, at the current cost of coal and with those carbon credits, a fully costed power station with geothermal will break even in comparison to any new coal fired power station. As I say, it comes with obvious economic benefits. We need to ensure that whatever plan comes forward, particularly by the incoming government, it addresses the issue of these green credits that attach to the EGS that can make it represent a key ingredient of the alternative baseload energy mix, particularly in a decentralised state like Queensland. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind) (4.22 pm): This bill is largely a good bill. It supports a worthwhile environmental and energy security initiative--geothermal energy. But this bill has been so badly contaminated with one small provision that will cause me to vote against this bill if it is not removed. The minister in his second reading speech stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1065557"></A>
The Bill also clarifies that coal seam gas (CSG) proponents may undertake agreed low impact surface activities, that do not invoke a resource right, in underground coal gasification (UCG) pilot areas. This will allow CSG production activities in surrounding areas to continue whilst allowing for the trial of UCG technology. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065558"></A>
A vote for this bill will mean that the mining companies using the coal seam gas method of mining, which is still under trial, will be able to continue potentially polluting underground water supplies near Kingaroy, Chinchilla and Dalby, and I cannot be party to that action, as well as wanting to do the right thing by the farmers and rural Queenslanders. If that injustice is allowed to happen in those communities it can happen in my community as well. It can happen in the communities of the Burnett which have prime agricultural land.</Hansard-Body>

Member after member of the LNP has spoken in this place but they have not highlighted the danger to farmers’ property rights of this provision, as stated in the minister’s speech and also in the legislation on page 271, part 4A.

 I take the interjection. Yes, I suppose that feeling may be mutual and it will probably become a bit more apparent why it may be mutual as my speech goes on. However, on this particular issue I think that not only is it time we drew a line in the sand physically in our rural areas--our rural areas which have prime agricultural land--but also it is time we drew a line in the sand in this place and supported the farmers who are manning the barricades, literally, over this issue. How could we not pay attention to the farmers rallying outside this place, the centre of democracy? I feel that by voting for this bill with this provision contaminating this bill I would be selling out those farmers. For that reason, I will not be voting for this bill. The minister in introducing this legislation on 19 May 2010 also said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1065577"></A>
Climate change has been recognised as one of the greatest challenges of our time. The Bligh government is taking steps to reduce the impact of climate change on Queenslanders through recent developments such as the Queensland Renewable Energy Plan, which outlines a road map for the expansion of the renewable energy sector in Queensland. The Geothermal Energy Bill is another strategic response from the government to tackle climate change as we move to broaden our energy mix away from a reliance on fossil fuels. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065578"></A>
I support geothermal but it will be for a different reason than the government. My support will not be to stop climate change. Humans have very little chance of stopping climate change. There is a science called geothermal engineering which may for a while change the weather patterns--which may for a while cool the planet down, if it needs cooling down. However, this cult containing people who believe that man-made carbon is poison and has caused climate change must be challenged and called for what it really is. It is a traitorous, treacherous, religious ideology which will bring about the destruction of the free Western world if the proponents are allowed to continue speaking their rubbish. </Hansard-Body>

Even if you humoured those who worship carbon and went with their argument for a minute that man-made carbon was responsible for heating up the world, Australia produces about one per cent of the man-made carbon emitted into the atmosphere.

This Saturday, Australians and Queenslanders will have a choice. We will have the opportunity to vote in a national election and to choose a government for our country. As you would expect, in the last five weeks we have heard many things from all sides of politics about the ideas that they want to put forward. There are many important issues in this election, but one that it is vital Queenslanders consider and that we in this House have a position on is the question of how we will adopt and embrace the technology of the 21st century--that is, how will we deal with the national broadband network. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068836"></A>
What we have on the one side is a political party, the Labor Party, that is committed to embracing this technology--and not only embracing it but enthusiastically pursuing measures that will ensure it can be brought not only to the communities and the suburbs but into the homes and businesses of every part of Australia. Just as railway lines revolutionised industry and commerce at this time in the last century, we are now on the cusp of another great leap forward when it comes to new technologies and the way they can revolutionise the way that we live, the way that we do business, the way that we learn, the way that we interact with each other, the way that we interact with people across the country and across the world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068837"></A>
I believe that Queenslanders have the most to gain from the national broadband network and that means we have the most to lose. Why do we have the most to gain? We are the most decentralised state of Australia. We are the only state that has more people living outside our capital city than within our capital city, and they are living in major centres, major industrial parts of our state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068838"></A>
Great cities like Townsville, Mackay and Rockhampton are not small, isolated places; these are large populations and they are cities and communities that are driving not only the wealth of Queensland but the wealth of this nation. A city like Gladstone is poised on the cusp of the next great development as we contemplate the liquid natural gas industry. Big international companies are making Gladstone their Australian headquarters, they are wanting to do business with Asian partners and the world. Without the national broadband network, without the high speed access that it brings to the internet and to the information highways of the world, we would be denying the children of Queensland access to the best learning tool of the 21st century. Our teachers would be denied the opportunity to teach our children in even the most remote locations and give them the window to the world that constitutes the internet. Businesses would be denied the opportunity to trade across borders, across time zones and across cultures with the rest of the state, the nation and the world to build capacity and to build opportunities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068840"></A>
Information and communication technology is without a doubt one of the single most important enablers and producers of productivity in an economy. In Queensland, we see economic growth moving ahead of the rest of the nation, but there are large parts of our economy, and this has been the case for a number of years, where we could be doing better when it comes to productivity. What could we be doing in relation to improving technology? It is technology that helps us to do more with less. That is what productivity means. It means using the resources you have and getting more out of it. What is one of the main ways we do that in a modern economy? It is technology. Information and communication technology are the main tools in that area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068841"></A>
We are already seeing this technology change everything about our lives. It will continue to do that at an exponential rate that, frankly, we simply will not be able to imagine and the challenge is to keep up with it. We have no prospect of keeping up with it without a high-speed broadband network that goes right into the regions and the rural and remote parts of our state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068843"></A>
This Saturday, Queenslanders stand to lose the opportunity of a lifetime if we see the NBN fail to be delivered by both sides of politics. It is the Labor Party that stands for the future in this election. It is Labor that understands that the tools of the future, the key to that future, lies in technology. We are not afraid of it. We do not want to take ourselves backwards. We do not want to take Queensland or Australia backwards. NBN is the future of the Queensland economy. It will underpin everything that industry does, everything we do in our schools and everything we do with and between our communities. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (4.35 pm): I second the motion moved by the Premier. I have come here hot off the heels of a meeting with western councils of this state of ours that are supposed to be represented by those who sit opposite.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1068847"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is what they came to see me about. They are big supporters of NBN. Leave yourselves in no doubt that you are selling out the bush if you vote against this motion here today. Those people from the councils get it. They do not vote for us but they expect you people to stand up for them. The two members who were there--the member for Gregory and the member for Mount Isa--</Hansard-Body>

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (Mr Kilburn): Order! Minister, can you direct your comments through the chair.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068849"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will do that, Mr Deputy Speaker. Be aware that those councils west of the Great Divide get this; they understand the importance of NBN. They know how important it is not just for their schools and their health services; they know that they need to have that fibre in the ground to get the level of connectivity they should have in a modern and emerging world. So every one of the honourable members who sit opposite and who vote against this tonight do so with the firm knowledge that they are voting against the bush. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068850"></A>
I also want to talk about the Independents here today, because during our last sitting week we were subjected to the emotive story about privatisation. A vote against this tonight is a vote for Abbott privatising the NBN. What we have seen is the Labor government say that we are going to publicly own this and then we are going to sell it into the private market, just the same way that other Labor governments have done in the past. The state of Queensland--for those ignoramuses who sit opposite who do not understand it--was built on the basis of state Labor governments building businesses and then selling them into the private enterprise. That is exactly what we are seeing here. There would be no Snowy Mountains scheme if it was not for a Labor government after the Second World War doing just this. Where was the business case for that? There was not one; it did not ever happen. Where was the business case for the railway line from here to Rockhampton? It never, ever existed because Labor governments got in behind it and said, ‘We need to have this infrastructure.’ All of this pious nonsense about business cases and all the rest of it falls flat on its face in that regard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068851"></A>
I know that the federal opposition leader does not get the business of tech, and that is fine. I am not particularly expert in that field, but I do understand the pathway to the future for our kids in Australia to compete with every other country in the world. I have been to Germany, I have been to Singapore. All of those places are talking about fibre in the ground owned by the government. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I do not expect the person who sold out Rockhampton to understand that. I do not expect the ignoramus from Toowoomba who is going to vote against the people of Toowoomba tonight to understand this because they are the ones who are going to miss out. Let us go through the list. Let us see which people will be selling out. Mr McLindon will be selling out the people of Beaudesert. The member for Dickson will be selling out the people of Buderim. Ms Menkens will be selling out the people of Burdekin. Mr Dempsey will be selling out the people of Bundaberg. Mr Messenger will be selling out the people of Agnes Water, Apple Tree Creek and Bargara. So the list goes on--Mr Seeney selling out Gayndah, Goomeri, Monto and Moura; Mr McArdle selling out Beerwah, Landsborough and Mooloolah; Mr Hopper selling out Clifton, Dalby, Kingsthorpe, Oakey--</Hansard-Body>

 I did get carried away there. The reality is that the member opposite is on the list here as well as Billy Bayou. Tomorrow every single one of the members opposite will have a media release from my office pointing out how they voted. That will include the Independents. I say to every single member who votes against this motion tonight that every one of their local papers will have that tomorrow. They can justify to their own constituents why they want to put us back into the Dark Ages because of their absolute passion for a rotten, filthy tory federal government coming in and selling out the people of this state. That is what they will be voting for here tonight--not for their constituents, not for the future. They will not be here to support what is going to happen in their hospitals or schools in the future. What they are here to do is play politics and support Tony Abbott and not stand up for their constituents. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072114"></A>
The NBN is a political construct. It has nothing to do with delivering real benefits at a reasonable price. Even the Premier came in here knowing that she has delivered a debt of $85 billion and will deliver multibillion dollar deficits over the next few years and she spoke with no great conviction. No telecommunications company would come near the NBN because they know that it does not make sense. The NBN is about politics, not the internet because Labor’s NBN is an uncosted, unsupported white elephant that has already seen a cost blow-out from $4.7 billion to $43 billion. The people of Queensland know only too well exactly how this happens because Queenslanders have seen this state Labor government mismanage projects time and time again and waste billions upon billions of dollars. We have seen it with the water grid, the desalination plant, the Traveston Dam and the health payroll system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072115"></A>
Labor has zero respect for the hard work and sacrifice of taxpayers to earn the cash to pay their taxes. It arrogantly wastes money like it grows on trees because its members have no idea about business. It is great to talk about vision; however, the six leading members of the government have a collective work experience of 181 years and only two years of that has been spent in the private sector. We see also that there have been no years spent running their own business or starting their own business, no years spent as a director of a family business or a company, no years spent as a director of a public company, no years in a senior position in a public company, no years in a senior position in a private company, no years working in corporate finance, no years working in corporate or business restructuring, no years working in or with a bank, no years of experience in the capital markets, no years in a stockbroking firm, no years in negotiating debt facilities with banks, no years running a small business, no years at the World Bank or IMF or OECD and no years in Treasury or Finance. However, they are happy to have the Premier’s former chief of staff, who probably wrote her speech today, standing up for the NBN. The fact that Mike Kaiser is the chief troubleshooter for the NBN should explain to all Queenslanders that the NBN is just a political construction of the ALP. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072117"></A>
The incredible cost of the NBN--at least $43 billion--will be at taxpayers’ expense. How will we pay off $43 billion? This is very easy for the government, which loves talking in billions--billions not millions. Repaying a million dollars at a dollar per second would take 11.5 days. However, paying back a billion dollars would take nearly 32 years and paying back $43 billion, which is of course the amount that this is now proposed to cost, would take over 1,367 years at the rate of a dollar per second. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072118"></A>
Members opposite talk about vision and all that sort of thing and it all sounds very flash; however, either users will pay massively increased broadband costs or the shortfall in revenue will result in increased taxes for families and businesses. In fact, the heads of agreement with Telstra for the NBN actually requires that Telstra not offer cheaper 100 megabit broadband. That is right: the Labor Party is making sure, right from the outset, that families will pay more for broadband and it is restricting competition just to make sure. As if the cost-of-living pressures are not high enough, the NBN will make it worse for Queensland families. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072119"></A>
We know that under this government there is zero chance that the NBN will be rolled out on time and on budget. We know that the federal ALP has a terrible track record when it comes to delivering programs: computers in schools, insulation in homes, school assembly halls built in schools that are being closed, school tuckshops that cost more per square metre than five-star restaurants. These projects are minuscule in comparison with the NBN. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072120"></A>
They must be joking! How on earth are we supposed to believe that this lot is capable of delivering this promise on time and on budget? But we have a plan to responsibly bring affordable high-speed broadband to 97 per cent of Australians at a speed greater than that promised by Labor. Established telco businesses decided that the risks associated with this broadband folly were way too high. Do we need fast broadband? Of course we do, but we should not be spending billions of dollars on it when a comparable outcome can be achieved for far less. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs STUCKEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Currumbin--LNP) (4.45 pm): I am pleased to second the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Surfers Paradise, that this House supports a fast, reliable and affordable broadband service for Queenslanders. The NBN’s Tasmanian pilot program is a real-world demonstration of the economic incompetence, sheer hypocrisy and rank political opportunism that puts Labor’s political interests ahead of good government and good policy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072125"></A>
Stephen Conroy and the Tasmanian government continue to refuse to tell the public how many people have actually signed up to this pilot. What have we learned from a pilot that has cost up to $700 million? We had an admission from the Labor Tasmanian Premier that he is considering making the NBN an opt-out program for Tasmanians, a sign that he wants to force residents to sign up. Why should it be compulsory to sign up for a program that is supposed to successfully deliver everything Gillard and Labor have promised? To date, only about a half of the 4,000 houses--with no mention of businesses--eligible for the nation’s first NBN rollout have accepted the offer of cable links into their homes. This is no surprise, considering Conroy admitted he had not made any calculation of the likely take-up rate, despite estimated costs of between $500 million and $700 million. More Labor economic incompetence indeed! </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072127"></A>
Yesterday in this House the honourable member for Rockhampton rambled on in his usual manner before tabling a document titled ‘Queensland cities and towns getting optical fibre’. By doing so, he let the cat out of the bag about what Labor’s much vaunted NBN might or might not provide. As usual, Minister Schwarten makes a lot of noise, as he did a few minutes ago, about Labor’s so-called ICT achievements, but the facts do not ever match the rhetoric. Documents that the minister tabled prove that Gillard’s uncosted $43 billion NBN cannot guarantee the high level of service to rural and regional Queensland that he demands. He supports a plan that self-admits it cannot deliver the services it promises. Minister Schwarten did not want us to see what Gillard’s plan actually delivers. Queenslanders should read the fine print before rushing into believing Bligh’s Labor. The document states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072130"></A>
This is an indicative list of towns that will receive some fibre coverage. Many of these towns will also receive some wireless coverage. The list is based on initial detailed modelling work done by NBN Co which may be subject to change following more detailed planning and design work. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1072131"></A>
The statement continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072133"></A>
The fibre modelling is based on NBN Co’s current optical fibre design rules rather than detailed premise and density and may not result in contiguous coverage of all locations within the indicated fibre footprint. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072134"></A>
Minister Schwarten could not even spell the word ‘optical’ in his media releases let alone understand what it means. Let us take a look at Minister Schwarten’s ICT achievements. Labor’s previous broadband revolution, Project Vista, disappeared without a trace. Premier Beattie called this a leading Smart State project. It was due to start in 2007 with a network to run along existing power lines--another failed project; another broken promise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075633"></A>
Queensland Health’s payroll system, Schwarten’s $40 million plus white elephant that cannot pay health workers correctly, has cost $4 million plus since the go live and there is no solution in sight. But then there is the Shared Service Initiative--a $900 million turkey that governments across Australia point to as a textbook example of how not to run government IT projects. With this track record of achievements it is no wonder taxpayers should be highly suspicious about trusting Gillard, Bligh and Labor with their $43 billion NBN promise. </Hansard-Body>

An article last week in the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 by Grahame Lynch, the founder of telco newsletter <Hansard-Italic>
Communications Day</Hansard-Italic>
 and a former editorial director of <Hansard-Italic>
America’s Network</Hansard-Italic>
, said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1075640"></A>
The ALP government’s $43 billion policy, at $2000 a head of population is the most expensive government intervention of its kind in the world. The Coalition policy--at $300 a head--actually ranks comparably to that of Singapore’s national broadband network ... which costs about $200 a head, and New Zealand’s at about $330. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075641"></A>
Grahame says that many of the benefits touted by Labor can be delivered by platforms in the coalition’s plan which excels economically by acknowledging the already substantial broadband infrastructure in place capable of supporting speeds of 30 to 100 megabits per second. This was recommended by the government’s own NBN implementation study. True to form, though, this Labor government will say and do anything to get a vote. After all, it is in their DNA. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.50 pm): Queensland is Australia’s most decentralised mainland state. Unlike very large states such as Western Australia, we actually have people living outside the south-east corner and in major settlements up and down the coast and west of the Great Dividing Range. The story of Queensland has been the story of the development of logistics. It has been the story of airlines such as Qantas. It has been the story of the Royal Flying Doctors Service. It has been the story of Main Roads promulgating roads throughout the state. It has been the story of a rail network being rolled throughout the state in various places. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

An honourable member</Hansard-Bold>
 interjected.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075647"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the honourable member’s interjection. Yes, Australia National Railways was sold by a Liberal National Party government of which Tony Abbott was a member. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075648"></A>
This depended upon people of foresight. Of course, in this country we have learnt the lessons of a lack of foresight, a lack of judgement and a lack of leadership at a federal level when it comes to logistics. We know, for example, that we have a broad gauge railway system in Victoria, a standard gauge railway system in New South Wales and a narrow gauge railway system in Queensland. At the time, New South Wales and Victoria were the only players in the game and Queensland did not count and went for the cheapest option. What was lacking at that point in time was any understanding that at a federal level they might have had responsibility for something like rail. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075649"></A>
If rail was what happened in the 19th century, in the 21st century it has to be fibre optic. There is clearly a role for governments to deal with that, but more importantly for federal governments to deal with that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075650"></A>
The challenge in health is the challenge of distance as well. It is the challenge of how we might provide those services in a state that is very decentralised--not like, as the member for Currumbin says, Singapore which frankly is a city state. We are the opposite of that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075651"></A>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The population of Tasmania exists on the Gold Coast, I would remind the honourable member. It is not just about fibre going past people’s homes. It is what it allows them to do in terms of telecommuting. It is what it allows them to do in terms of seeking medical consultations. Not only did Julia Gillard say the other day that she will actually build on NBN to provide services as a result thereof but she will actually allow people to access health consultation at home on an after-hours basis using video streaming.

<A ID="pgfId-1075654"></A>
In terms of the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the debate tonight not only did he fail to articulate an alternative vision by stating what the opposition’s plan would be but he did not even say what it would do in the fibre network. Those opposite are not used to policy thought. The network is nothing if it does not have those things done on it that actually make a difference to people’s lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075655"></A>
In fact, the federal opposition’s policy, I understand, is based upon a wireless rollout. Here we go. I can remember it. We have just got over the hump in terms of people fighting with federal governments with regard to telephone towers throughout their electorates and their streets. Coming to a suburb near you is the Tony Abbott inferior solution of telephone towers everywhere to give you sufficient density to allow you to rollout a broadband option. I look forward to the speeches in this House from people complaining about that and running a mile away from Tony Abbott’s policy point of view. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075657"></A>
This is actually about what those opposite would do. It is about vision. They have no alternative vision either when it comes to rolling out the broadband--that is, the optic fibre spine itself--or what they want to do with it. As far as they are concerned, it is about emails. As far as they are concerned, it is about sending notes to their friends and that sort of thing. It is not actually about what services they can provide with it because they are not wired in that direction. They are not wired as to what they will do with those services they provide. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075658"></A>
We are and we understand. One does not need to be an IT guru to do it. Frankly, one does not need to think in that way. What people need to do is think about the services they want to provide and what it could enable them to do. If people are in health that is what it enables them to do. If they are in commerce that is what it enables them to do. If they are in consulting that is what it enables them to do. We now know that with teleradiology people can read anywhere in the world an x-ray that is taken anywhere in Queensland that is part of our digital network. Those are the opportunities this offers us. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075659"></A>
Those opposite will consign people in regional and rural Queensland to a life of penury. We know that one thing that people in rural and remote Queensland have been able to do, frankly--for example, with mining--is stay on the farm because they have been able to work in mines as well. What we will be able to do in the 21st century with a decent fibre optic network in this country is say to people in rural and remote Queensland, ‘You can keep that wonderful lifestyle that is the envy of people in the city and still have an opportunity to have a professional or other career at the same time.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075660"></A>
This is about actually using your brains to achieve anything. It is no wonder that those opposite are not capable of thinking of what this actually means in a policy sense. It is a very sad thing. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Maroochydore--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.55 pm): Remember when Labor and Kevin Rudd claimed to be economic conservatives? Well they dumped that pretence quicker than they knifed Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister. I never go into a shop without checking the price tag of what I buy. Price does affect my choices and determines the value of a product. I know that it certainly impacts on the choices of the residents of Queensland and certainly impacts on the choices of those who live in my electorate. It particularly impacts on the thousands of ordinary Queenslanders who do not have a government pay packet to rely on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075663"></A>
Why then does Labor want to keep it secret as to how much it will really cost Queenslanders to connect to its $43 billion NBN plan and how much it will cost people in terms of ongoing costs? We in the LNP are fighting for Queenslanders to have a fast, reliable and affordable internet service, not Labor’s proposal which is the world’s most expensive. There is no business case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075664"></A>
I heard Minister Schwarten bag the importance of having a business case just a few minutes ago. We think that a government that has sent this state broke in a boom should wake up to itself and realise that it does matter what we pay for our infrastructure because eventually people have to pay it back. And guess what? It is poor old taxpayers--the ones it treats like mugs--who have to do that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075665"></A>
Business cases do matter. This minister and the modern Labor Party still believe that they do not matter and they can force this cost upon people. It is embarrassing to see the abuse of power by this government and the way it spends billions and does not do a business case or a cost benefit analysis. Instead it is asking Labor members and other parliamentarians to turn off their brains and vote blindly in favour of the NBN and jump over the cliff like the proverbial lemmings who followed the leader without checking the direction they were going in. Doing that has a very high price. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075666"></A>
Labor’s NBN is a new monopoly which Australians will pay more for in their taxes in access fees. The creation of a new telecommunications monopoly by Labor is not a virtue; it is a vice. It has been forced on people. In the days before Telstra was open to competition Australians paid some of the highest telecommunications costs in the world. Rather than taking us to the future, Labor intends to take us back to the past where government controls things by costly monopoly which is anti-innovation and is just jobs for boys. The government’s role should be to stimulate competition and ensure that where there is market failure people have access to services. It should not be, as Labor’s plan is, to strangle competition and remonopolise services with mandatory higher costs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075704"></A>
Do not forget that Labor’s NBN will be brought to us by the same mob who gave us Australia’s pink batt fiasco of burnt houses and, tragically, people who lost their lives as well as the school building rip-off. They now think they can build a more cost-effective internet service for the nation than the private sector. Well, pigs might fly! This is being endorsed by state Labor--this mob that went broke in a boom and then decided that it would help others go broke by putting up their taxes in an economic downturn. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075709"></A>
We say that Australians have a right to know how much it will cost them individually, and certainly the residents of my electorate of Maroochydore want to know how much it will cost. We have heard that in Tasmania the expected connection cost is between $300 and $800. That is not to mention the ongoing operational costs. But, no, Labor does not want to talk about that individual cost to people. It wants that to be a secret. The NBN should be renamed ‘NOM’--‘not our money’, brought to you by Labor pollies on high salaries and their indentured help who forget that it is ordinary Australians who end up repaying that debt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075711"></A>
I also call on this Labor government to explain what happened to the other internet programs and Reef access that it was promising and access to some of the highest speed internet along the rail services in Australia--I table a number of clippings in relation to that--because we deserve to know what happened to these programs. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs KIERNAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Isa--ALP) (5.00 pm): I am very pleased--in fact, I am delighted--to say that Mount Isa is one of the very first beneficiaries of the Gillard government’s national broadband network. Along with Townsville, Mount Isa was chosen as the first place in Queensland to begin work on the NBN. Around 500 kilometres of optical fibre cable has already been laid from Mount Isa. This includes cable from the border to the Northern Territory and down to Winton. Eventually we will be a key point on the massive NBN cable running from Toowoomba to Mount Isa and on to Tennant Creek and Darwin. Mount Isa is proud to be such an early site for the NBN rollout. We are a perfect example of the great benefits that the NBN brings. The expression ‘tyranny of distance’ has always been particularly relevant to Mount Isa and the north-west, even though we are a world-class centre for industries such as mining.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075727"></A>
With the NBN, Mount Isa can look forward to a revolution in e-business, e-learning and e-health, in employment and in opportunities for our children. We do business with the world and we want to be connected to the nation and the world. Further, Mount Isa and Queensland are very keen to get as many of the 25,000 jobs on offer as the NBN is rolled out over eight years. It would be a tragedy if these jobs were lost to Queensland because the federal opposition leader, Tony Abbott, scrapped the NBN.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075729"></A>
Queensland is the most decentralised state in Australia, but we still want to steer more people towards our cities and towns in rural and regional Queensland. Many regional areas of Queensland have strong job opportunities--don’t we know it?--and a lifestyle that is the envy of the world. However, if the NBN is scrapped, decentralisation will be dead in its tracks. Few people will want to live in a broadband backwater where the digital world is passing them by. We need to get IT experts, doctors, lawyers, manufacturers and other leaders into our regions to revitalise them. But people will not come if we do not have high-speed reliable broadband. These people want to be connected to the nation and the world, not taken back to the era of the pedal wireless by Tony Abbott. I have to say that the pedal wireless was in fact discovered in Cloncurry in my electorate. They want top-class education, business, health and other services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075732"></A>
I notice that Prime Minister Julia Gillard has assisted this process this week in Brisbane by announcing a new Medicare rebate for online consultations. Other NBN benefits for regional Queenslanders include new trade opportunities and better communications; regional businesses can benefit from improved access to online services, including finance and banking, research and information; and regional companies can reach new trade partners and opportunities in Australia or across the globe. </Hansard-Body>

Mr HOBBS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Warrego--LNP) (5.06 pm): Queensland needs a fast, reliable, affordable broadband service. Queensland is a decentralised state with vast distances. We need a mix of optical fibre, of HFC, of wireless, of DSL and of satellite. We need an affordable and a fast network. We do not need a Labor BER $16 billion type broadband scheme where Labor wasted billions. We do not need a Labor home insulation $2.45 billion type broadband scheme that killed insulation workers and wasted hundreds of millions of dollars. We want a credible scheme, a genuine scheme and an affordable scheme. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075748"></A>
Queensland Labor said, ‘Let’s build a water grid,’ and now we have the highest water prices in Australia. Labor said, ‘Let’s manage the electricity distribution system,’ and now we have the dearest electricity prices in Australia. We cannot trust it! Why would we want to put it in charge of broadband, for heaven’s sake? Haven’t we been burnt enough by those people over there and their federal colleagues in Canberra? Our AAA rating--gone under Labor! How on earth is it going to run a broadband service?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075750"></A>
The coalition will deliver a broadband service sooner than Labor. In 2016 the coalition will roll it out--not 2018 as proposed by Labor. So we are ahead of Labor. Rural Queensland needs more wireless and satellite. It does not necessarily need the rollout of fibre-optic cables. The rollout at Scottsdale in Tasmania that has been talked about has shown that homeowners five kilometres out of town cannot get service, so how are people in Western Queensland going to get service if they are two or five kilometres away? So it does not always work, and it is dear. Rural Queensland will have to wait many years to get a fast broadband service from Labor under the NBN. The coalition will deliver it sooner--two years sooner, and to all of those towns.</Hansard-Body>

Mr HOBBS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The honourable member says ‘rubbish’, but can you read, old son? Read the stuff that has gone out there. We will deliver these things. Let me tell the House all about it. We need wireless. We need satellite. The technology is improving. Twenty years ago we never had a mobile phone. In terms of the systems out there, the cabling is expensive. There are distance related expenses. Many areas use wireless because it is far more sensible and easier. My property in Western Queensland was one of the first to use a satellite internet connection. We have done away with that and are now using wireless connections because it is faster, more efficient and cheaper. I am sure that down the track even better satellite systems will be put in place. We want e-health for doctors to diagnose and treat patients remotely. While this is already happening now, a full rollout will happen faster under the coalition than Labor proposes in 2018. The coalition will deliver this two years sooner to all of those places.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079653"></A>
Minister Schwarten, who co-installed the health pay system--do members remember him?--said that rural towns would miss out. Can we believe it? He wants to be in charge of rolling out this damn thing. He cannot even pay the nurses and he wants to roll out broadband! How bad is that? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079654"></A>
The coalition is entirely committed. Some people are having difficulty reading. Let me tell members about the coalition’s plan to establish a national broadband commission that will be designed to manage the competitive selection process to select private sector companies, not a Labor run sister company to try to roll out this thing. We want to have private companies do this. That is sensible.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079655"></A>
What about committing $2 billion in funding for a new fixed wireless broadband network? That is what we want to do. We want to improve the system. We want to make it better. We want to make it faster and roll it out to those areas that cannot get cable. Look at Birdsville. The people in that area are only just getting mobile phones today. They have finally come to Birdsville. But Labor is talking about rolling out hundreds of kilometres of fibre. They do not have to do it everywhere. We need a mix. We want to fund new satellite services for the remaining three per cent of the population who are not covered by other technology. There is going to be a system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079656"></A>

 (Mundingburra--ALP) (5.10 pm): That was pretty incredible. It really was. We actually have another failed coalition policy. By not supporting the government’s superfast broadband for all Australians, will we see an NBN shutdown, 25,000 NBN jobs gone each year of construction, no guaranteed connections, no fibre optics to the home and, in fact, no structural reform to the telecommunications industry, per se. Abbott’s failed policy is a return to the bandaid era, where we will continue to be left behind. This short-sighted focus shows an enormous lack of insight and understanding in a possible Prime Minister. In fact, I think Abbott’s understanding is limited to shared access at home or an internet cafe where we can send or receive an email. If he had his way, Abbott would go back to horse-drawn carriages and pigeons.</Hansard-Body>

Ms NELSON-CARR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am really horrified to think that Tony Abbott plans to scrap the NBN, taking regional Queensland backwards and costing jobs in my electorate. The Townsville suburbs of Aitkenvale and Mundingburra were announced as the first and only Queensland sites in the initial NBN rollout. Further to this there has been an NBN second site announcement, and Townsville has once again been flagged as the location to receive the progressive fanning out of services, which will provide another 3,000 connections to homes in my electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079666"></A>
With the announcement of Ergon Energy as the construction contractor for the passive optical fibre network, I expect about 80 to 100 new jobs to be created in the initial construction in the coming months. In fact, 3,100 premises in my electorate are eagerly signing off on fibre-optic connections into their homes as we speak. Yesterday, the Prime Minister herself was here to see the rollout in Aitkenvale.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079667"></A>
As members have heard, Townsville is a fast-growing economic hub in North Queensland. So we need the very best high-speed broadband to match that growth. Let us face it: the future is digital and the national broadband network will bring us into line with our regional leaders of Singapore and Japan. The NBN will pave the way for Australian business, particularly regional businesses, to access the world quickly. Sending huge amounts of data will take minutes, not hours and high-definition conferencing will be available to all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079668"></A>
Australians live in a very decentralised country and we pride ourselves on our innovation and resourcefulness. We are at the forefront in so many areas, just not broadband. In fact, we are ranked 50th in the world--well below Japan but also behind New Zealand, South Korea and all of our regional competitors. My colleague the member for Capalaba says that one in four jobs in our state is in trade. Our trading partners China, Japan and Korea all have broadband speed. The NBN will cut travel time and cost by doing business online, rural health can have real-time consultation anywhere in Australia, telemedicine will save lives, remote monitoring will keep patients in their homes and, in education, virtual classrooms will mean so many greater options--networking possibilities, rapid access to data and so on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079669"></A>
Tony Abbott will destroy jobs and keep most Australians in the dark. The Gillard Labor government will take us into the future and we will not have time to look back. We need to take that into account on Saturday. We have too much to lose. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Toowoomba South--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.15 pm): It is time to stop these obscene multibillion dollar scams of the Australian tax-paying public that masquerade as political stunts and political schemes. The people of Queensland know what deceit and deception is and to see debt, interest and costs go through the roof. That is why they are going to vote against Labor this Saturday. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079672"></A>
We now have another one of these schemes that has been brought forward by the Commonwealth government that will mirror what we have seen with the insulation debacle and will mirror what we have seen with some of the waste and corruption that has happened in the BER scheme. The coalition has come up with a plan that will give us fast-speed broadband two years before the completion date that has been put forward by the Labor Party. It will be fast, it will be efficient and, most importantly, it will be affordable. That is what Australians are looking for today. They have had enough of this obscene waste of their money masquerading as these political schemes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079673"></A>
The insulation scheme never had a chance of working. Someone just stood up in the federal parliament and said that they were going to insulate every house in Australia when they did not even have the practical common sense to know that there were not enough people trained to do it, that there were not enough pink batts and insulation to do it and that you could never do it in two years anyway. The consequence of this harebrained scheme was that four young men died and probably a whole lot of others were burnt, 96 houses were burnt down, $2.5 billion was wasted, electric wires were stapled to the roofs of houses and it will cost another $1 billion to fix up this rotten, obscene mess, this waste of the hard-earned money of the people of Australia. The scheme never had a chance. It was just a political stunt. If someone were sensible about it they might have said that they would do it over 10 years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079674"></A>
Now, another similar scheme has been dreamt up--a scheme that originally was going to cost $4.7 billion. It is now $43 billion--nearly 10 times more--and everybody in Australia, and particularly those of us in Queensland, who knows the track record of this Labor government would know that that $43 billion is peanuts compared to what it will eventually cost to have this federal government owned monolith that they want to, as Mr Schwarten said, sell to someone in the future. How are you going to sell something that is no longer contemporary, that has been overtaken by wireless or some other form or system, that is overcapitalised, that has no return and is just so cumbersome because it is ill thought out, it is not flexible and it is not contemporary? Once again, billions and billions of dollars that could have been spent on water supplies, hospitals, schools, roads, ports--on things that would give Australia something decent with which to work--will be wasted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079675"></A>
The waste of this federal government knows no bounds. There was the $900 that was handed out twice. Some sensible people put that money into their bank accounts. That did not help avert the global financial crisis. Some people put that money towards paying for their children’s school fees, but most people spent the money on poker machines and flat-screen TVs. The money went to Samsung in Korea and to Harvey Norman. The money went all over the world. It was an absolute waste of $22.5 billion that could have made real things happen in Australia that would have lasted forever. In the Depression the Sydney Harbour Bridge was built and that has been half handy ever since. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079676"></A>
The waste that has happened with Building the Education Revolution is unbelievable. Contractors and subcontractors have been told what they can quote to. They could have given a price and made a good profit, but they knew that they could go to a higher price because the government wanted things built quickly. So they added a few more million on top and away that goes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083196"></A>
We have seen the debt and deceit in this state. The people of Queensland know that the harebrained schemes of this Labor government have led to massive cost increases in water, rego, petrol and gas. Mr Mike Kaiser was kicked out of this parliament for vote rorting. He went down to New South Wales and sent it broke. He then came back up here and made us broke. Now we will see him send the NBN scheme broke. He has a track record for that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083197"></A>
The scheme that has been put forward by the coalition is practical. It uses a number of options, including fibre, wireless, DSL and satellite technologies. It is programmed to have fast broadband to people two years before the Labor scheme. It is contemporary. It will allow for flexibility. Telstra has already said that in one year its wireless technology will be 84 megabytes per second. We are moving that way anyway. We will end up with big cables on the wires of the overhead powerlines disfiguring our suburbs at a massive cost and waste. It can be done faster, more efficiently and more reliably through the coalition at far less cost to individuals. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.20 pm): I support the motion put by the Premier to this parliament. The parliament of Queensland, representing as it does the people of Queensland, should be rushing to support this motion and the rollout of game-changing, nation-changing, nation-building infrastructure like the NBN. Imagine if those myopic folk on the other side, as indolent as they are in this parliament to not put forward a single policy to the people of Queensland, were in charge of the future of this nation? What would have happened if this motley crew were running Brisbane when Clem Jones decided to sewer Brisbane? We would all still be in outhouses.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083200"></A>
What would have happened if those opposite were in charge at the time when it was proposed to roll out electricity across the state of Queensland? As the OECD has noted in the past, back in the 1930s only 10 per cent of America was covered by electricity. By 1950 the coverage was universal. Imagine for a moment the nation-changing capacity that the NBN has in terms of radically changing the way the growth path of the economy of Australia moves. Imagine if we could harness the productivity-lifting power of an NBN providing for high-speed broadband to the people of Australia. What would that do? As has been commented on in the past, it has the capacity by and of itself to lift the productivity of the economy of the nation by more than one per cent. The benefits that flow have been well set out in this debate, whether it is about delivering e-health, telecommuting and the reduction in emissions that comes from that, or the lift in productivity that comes from a person’s ability to work across different time zones through the power of the internet and through the power of broadband. That is what should be the guiding light for those considering this motion here today. The proposal from this federal government is to put in place the economic infrastructure of the 21st century. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083201"></A>
It is no mistake and there is no doubt or surprise that, pitifully, it is yet again the conservatives who are the great wreckers of the Australian economy. While we are the builders, they are the wreckers; while we are the ones who propose, they are the ones who oppose. The story of the development of this nation is the story of Labor governments which can actually look to the horizon. The story of the tories in this nation is to look straight in front of their face at what is in it for them. When it comes to the sort of nation-changing infrastructure that is proposed by the NBN, this state of all states, and those people who represent the more disparate parts of the state of Queensland in this parliament, should be the first to support the NBN. But of course they do not. They wanted to find a cheap line on day one. They have struggled ever since. Tony Abbott has contorted himself and wrung his hands over trying to come up with an alternative to the NBN. He never got it from the start. All he saw was a political line. What he has seen since then is, in fact, the harsh reality that this is the sort of investment in the 21st century that a state like Queensland should be welcoming and that a federal government in the nation of Australia at this point in time should be working hard to put in place. The reality, of course, is that it is these types of visions, these types of views to the future and this type of effort that has the capacity to radically change our growth profile and therefore the prosperity of the people of Queensland and Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083202"></A>
Imagine for a moment it is 80 years ago. I heard the member for Toowoomba South say that he does not want to see poles and wires across the nation. Imagine if that was the view at the time when we rolled out electricity. Those opposite would be happy sitting beside the crystal set, pedalling along, listening to Don Bradman score in the cricket. That is where we would stay. Of course, there is an ability to hope for so much more. There is an ability in this nation to look to the future. This is a debate that was had in this nation 100 years ago about railways. It is appropriate at this stage to have the debate about a national broadband network and to look at what a difference that can make. It has the capacity to game change the economy. It is entirely appropriate for the federal government to propose this infrastructure in the way that it has. On Saturday let us hope that the Australian Labor Party is once again given the chance to build the future of the nation. The nation will long be better off for it. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.25 pm): This afternoon in this debate we have heard it all, but to cap it off, to hear the Treasurer come in here and talk about the Labor Party building the future of Australia, the Labor Party having the financial wherewithal and the financial nous to deliver an outcome that is of benefit to all Australians, takes the cake. It is quite frankly unbelievable that the Treasurer even spouts those words, let alone believes them. I think the great worry for the people of Queensland is that he probably does believe them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083205"></A>
The members of the Labor Party are, of course, the great wreckers of the Australian economy. They are the people who took a $60 billion inheritance and turned it into a $24 billion debt that has not yet been repaid and for which there is no repayment plan. It is the Labor Party that introduced a resource super profits tax in order to try to con the people of Australia that they would be able to balance the budget. They are the people who rack up federally $100 million worth of debt each and every day, 365 days a year, on top of the $400 million each week that is being racked up in Queensland as we refinance $20 billion worth of debt this year alone. That is the economic record of the Labor Party in Queensland. That is the record of the Labor Party in Australia. It is a record that is sending businesses and individuals to the wall in Queensland in record numbers, as we discussed this morning. What does it want to do now? It wants to put another $43 billion on the taxpayers’ tick and drive more businesses to the wall, drive more personal bankruptcies and send more people broke as it goes about increasing taxes and charges, making the cost of living unaffordable and increasing the waste. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083206"></A>
What we see today in this motion is not driven by any concern for the people of Queensland. It is not driven by any concern for the future of our education system. It is not driven by any concern to deliver better medicine to rural and regional Queensland. We know what Labor’s record on those particular issues is. We have the worst literacy and numeracy rates in mainland Australia. Labor has closed down hospitals in the bush and failed to deliver services. The moving of this motion tonight is an attempt by a discredited long-term state Labor government to prop up its equally discredited federal cousins. What we see here is the discredited hand of the former and disgraced chief of staff of the Premier, Mike Kaiser, earning his $450,000 for his paymaster Stephen Conroy. In the dying days of a desperate federal Labor government, this motion is floated to try to con Queenslanders into thinking Labor can and actually will deliver a national broadband network solution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083207"></A>
One has to ask oneself this question: if the solution was so good, if the plan is so wonderful, why did they knife the architect of it in the back just six weeks ago? The electorate in Queensland is wise to Labor’s tricks. As we always say on this side of the House, when it comes to Labor, do not look at what they say or promise; look at what they deliver. Talk is cheap over at Peel Street, talk is cheap in Sussex Street and talk is particularly cheap in the Prime Minister’s suite of offices in Canberra. Queenslanders should consider any promise regarding broadband made by Labor and measure it up against what it has delivered. In Queensland what has it delivered? The Traveston Dam: a failure. Today it was admitted by Minister Robertson that $400 million was wasted. Let us look at the Tugun desalination plant: $1.2 billion and still not working. Let us look at Airport Link: $47 million blown out to $260 million. The Queensland Health payroll system: not delivered. There is an ICT solution delivered by Labor! The Tugun bypass: $47 million. The CAMCOS blow-out: $2.2 million.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083247"></A>
What about federal Labor? Why isn’t it talking about the home insulation program? We never hear about that in its ads. The school stimulus program provided $1.7 billion of identified waste to build glorified barbecue sheds. We have had FuelWatch, Grocery Choice, computers in schools, child-care centres--all those promises were ditched on the way through. The GP superclinics and, of course, the great moral challenge of our time, an ETS, do not get spoken about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083248"></A>
We need a fast, affordable and reliable broadband service. That is what is promised by Tony Abbott and the coalition. We need a government that knows how to deliver on its promises, not a government that continually promises. We need a government that has a plan to end the waste, a plan to repay the debt, a plan to stop the boats, a plan to stand up for families and a plan for real action for real Australians that is affordable. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1087217"></A>
That this House recognises the importance of recreational and commercial fishing and associated industries to Queensland and opposes the secrecy of the deal between the Greens and the federal Labor Party that will close off a minimum of 30 per cent of Australian waters to fishing. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083275"></A>
This Saturday when we vote in the federal election we will not just be voting for representatives and a government way down south in Canberra. In this election, there are a lot of issues that will fundamentally affect Queensland and the lifestyle we enjoy. We all know about the Rudd-Gillard super mining tax in the last couple of months and how it would have destroyed, and may possibly still destroy, jobs and communities in Queensland and how it cost Kevin Rudd his job. Since then Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister, has done her best to keep her backroom deal with the big miners quiet. Of course, there are still questions to be answered by the Premier, who failed to come out and stand up for Queensland jobs even though we were asking about what projections had been done.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083278"></A>
There is no doubt that this Rudd super tax would have cost many jobs and hit Queensland hard. We saw companies withdrawing their investments. Until there was a backflip by the three big companies after negotiating with the government, there was clearly disquiet throughout the economy and in Queensland, which along with Western Australia are the biggest two mining states. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083280"></A>
But there is another very important issue that will also cost jobs and affect the lifestyle of tens of thousands of Queenslanders--that is, the deal to lock up vast areas of sea right along the Queensland coast that are now open to limited commercial fishing and to the public for recreational fishing. It is the sneaky preference deal that Bob Brown and the Greens have done with the ALP to get Julia Gillard and Labor over the line. This is the deal they have done that is just like the sneaky preference deal the Bligh Labor government did with the Greens on the eve of the last state election that has locked up vast areas of the cape and denied local Indigenous communities their right to self-determine and set their economic future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083282"></A>
I have spoken in this place before about having been in Mapoon where the Wenlock River has been subject to a recent declaration by the minister. Those communities are concerned about jobs and job opportunities for their children that have now been taken away from them due to the changes that have been made in the declaration by the Minister for Natural Resources. This deal will lock up 30 per cent of the areas along our coastline and Peter Garrett, the federal minister, has been out there spruiking it. This will destroy commercial fishing and unfairly restrict what is an essential part of Queensland’s way of life--recreational fishing, a healthy and enjoyable activity for generations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083286"></A>
The Greens like to make out that humans are not a part of the world’s environment, that they are actually intruding on it. That is wrong because we are a part of the world’s environment. They think we should be excluded from it. They prey on the worst fears of our children--and that is about the future, the future for our children. I am very confident in the future for our children, but the Greens like to demonise development and demonise many of the things that have made this country a great one. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083287"></A>
There is no doubt that earlier generations--and even mine; I am a typical member of the post baby boomers generation--have taken the environment for granted without a lot of thought for managing our natural assets for future generations, but my children and others have taught me to appreciate that we need to protect our environment and manage our resources and our fishing areas sustainably. We do that but not everybody in the world does it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083288"></A>
Our fisheries are recognised internationally as amongst the best managed in the world. They are sustainably managed so that healthy, locally caught seafood can be enjoyed by Queenslanders and so that recreational fishing can be enjoyed by generations to come. This is done through common-sense bag limits and seasonal closures that I know are respected and observed by the overwhelming majority. In fact, the shadow minister for primary industries, the member for Condamine, and I regularly meet with primary industries groups who tell me about the standards that they have to uphold that are not upheld in other countries, and this is a classic example in fishing whether it is farm fishing or natural fishing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083290"></A>
Let us be clear about what is at stake here through Labor’s deal with the Greens, because if Green preferences get Julia Gillard and Labor across the line on Saturday Queenslanders need to be aware of all of the consequences not just for our economy or our jobs or for increased taxes and higher cost of living expenses, but also for our way of life. If Labor wins through Green support on Saturday, vast tracts of sea off the Tweed, the Gold Coast, the Fraser Coast and further north in the Coral Sea and the gulf will become out of bounds for commercial and recreational fishing. The effects will be devastating. The effects of this Labor-Greens deal will not just be felt on the cape like the wild rivers deal; they will be felt right the way along the coast. In my own area, I know of the cost to commercial fishing families. I know of the effect on the supply of fresh, locally caught, healthy seafood. I also know of the damage being done right along the coast and particularly up north. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083292"></A>
A couple of months ago, I was in Cairns at a public housing development that the local community did not necessarily want. I spoke about this at length with a local resident and commercial fisherman, Bill Izard of Trinity Park, when I was at the Trinity Park development that the Cairns community does not want foisted on them. Bill Izard is the last trawler operator between Cairns and Port Douglas. He has been in the industry for 30 years. He operates a small, 30-foot boat. It is a pity that Bob Brown and the ALP do not bother to take the time to listen to local people in the industry and listen to what is really going on because they would then hear the truth about how bad their policies really are. They are not interested in how their policies will affect the people who are affected by them; they are only interested in how it will play into inner urban areas where people love the idea of voting Green as opposed to the major parties.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083295"></A>
The lock-up of the Coral Sea is irrational. What the Greens and the ALP will do is lock up what is a deep water fishery that is currently fished sustainably by just four boats out of Cairns. They fish for deeper water pelagic fish. Let us be very clear about this: we are not talking about trawling the Coral Reef and taking reef fish viewed by tourists in glass-bottom boats and by snorkellers; we are talking about deeper water fish away from the reefs. Just four boats operate in the Coral Sea, as I have mentioned. They catch pelagic species on lines, not with nets. The species they catch include the migratory yellowfin, the bluefin and particularly the bigeye tuna, a valuable food and recreational game fish. This key point is being ignored, perhaps deliberately, by the Greens and Labor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083329"></A>
Just four boats using lines, not nets, take these fish in the Coral Sea off Queensland. Another key point is that these species are migratory--that is, they swim up and down the coast. They swim north, and once they move through the highly protected Australian waters of the Coral Sea they move on to New Guinea, where its government has sold licences to foreign fleet operators including big operators from the United States. These fleets are big and they use nets. Huge numbers are netted by these fleets and then taken to Thailand for processing, and we then buy tuna back from Thailand. What the Greens and Labor want to do is illogical. It has nothing to do with protecting our environment and saving our fish species. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083330"></A>
Australia has the largest economic fishing zone per capita of any nation on earth. Our fisheries are already among the best, if not the best, managed of all fisheries in the world. Surely, if we are to be honest, if we are to be genuine about protecting the environment, we must also be genuine about protecting our ability to sustainably produce food in Australia and in Queensland. Where is the sense in the Greens and the ALP whipping up fear and hysteria and locking up 30 per cent of our oceans and, in so doing, destroying what is left of our commercial fishing industry and forcing our population to eat imported seafood, seafood that is increasingly being sourced from regions where there are few, if any, controls and the big trawls are anything but sustainable? People in the fishing industry tell me that places like Vietnam and other countries of Asia where they do this type of fishing have completely different standards from ours. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083333"></A>
After all the shutdowns and lockouts that have already occurred, there are now probably fewer than 150 fishing boats still operating on the Queensland coast. Labor and the Greens want to shut these down further and force us to eat more imported seafood. That is not healthy, that is not sustainable and that is not caring for the environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083334"></A>
On Saturday, I urge all Queenslanders to ignore the hysteria, ignore the untruths and reject Labor and the Greens, who will destroy our commercial fishing industry and further restrict Queenslanders from catching a few fish and enjoying a fresh, healthy meal with their mates and their families. What the Greens and Labor want to do is unfair. It flies in the face of the facts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083335"></A>
As I say, I do not believe that the people of Queensland and our children are not part of this environment. People need to look more at what the Greens are proposing. They want to reduce tax breaks; they want to remove capital gains tax concessions; they want to introduce an estate tax with provisions to protect the family farm, the family home and small business with a threshold of $5 million; and they want to abolish the private health insurance rebate. That is what members will not hear about the Greens. They are a danger to all modern-day Australians. </Hansard-Body>

Mr HOPPER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Condamine--LNP) (5.53 pm): I rise to second this motion and speak about something very dear to the hearts and minds of many Queenslanders, including me, and that is fishing. Fishing is a part of the Queensland way of life. Whether it is outdoors on a river, in a tinnie on the bay, with a rod on the beach or out in a bigger boat, fishing is a part of life for all Queenslanders. However, this is under real threat this Saturday. It is under threat from Bob Brown and his crazy Greens supporters who want to lock up huge areas of our coast from fishing. This will destroy commercial fishing and wreck fishing for hundreds of thousands of Queenslanders and their families. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083340"></A>
Bob Brown and Labor have done a sneaky preference deal. The big risk for Queenslanders who love fishing is Greens preferences. The current Gillard Labor government could well win government again. That is when Bob Brown and his crazies will demand their pound of flesh. That pound of flesh will affect the common person who wants to go and catch a fish. For Queenslanders who love fishing, that will mean that vast areas of traditional and much loved coastal fishing spots will be locked up from parents, their children and grandchildren. What are now open waters for families to enjoy will be locked up and no more fishing will be allowed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083341"></A>
If the Gillard government wins with the support of Bob Brown, it will also mean that our well-managed and sustainable local fishing industry will be further shut down and that more and more seafood will be imported, as our leader just spoke about, from foreign waters that are often already overfished--from seas and river farms with virtually non-existent hygiene and environmental standards. We had those standards in place in this nation, we had those standards in place in Queensland and because of a sneaky deal with the Greens we are going to see that totally eroded. We will see it totally eroded so that when a shopper goes into the supermarket she can only buy overseas products, which are not guaranteed to be clean. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083342"></A>
I urge every Queenslander to think very carefully on Saturday and examine the policies of all the parties before casting their vote. The latest polls show that Bob and the Greens may account for 12 per cent to 14 per cent, which is an absolutely frightening thought for many of us and for me as someone who loves fishing and loves eating healthy seafood. Bob Brown and his supporters would have us believe that only they are concerned for the environment, that only they are concerned about climate change and that only they are concerned about sustainable fishing. I say to Senator Brown that, as a farmer on the Darling Downs and a landholder, I am very concerned about the environment. I am very concerned about how Labor has ignored the need to protect prime agricultural land. I am very concerned about how Labor has ignored the need to protect our water, our aquifers and our Great Artesian Basin. As a keen recreational fisherman, I am doubly concerned about how the Greens and Labor are planning to stop families fishing on the pretext of protecting the environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083344"></A>
Bob Brown and the Greens are a pack of shysters. I strongly urge anyone who is contemplating voting green, especially for the Greens in the Senate, to look carefully at all their loony left policies, not just on fishing but also on so-called asylum seekers, free heroin trials--</Hansard-Body>

There are 750,000 recreational fishermen in Queensland who love to fish and 30 per cent of our coastline is going to be locked up. We heard the member for Pumicestone going off her head last night. She should be out there against this, but she is very worried because her husband is going to lose his seat at five past 12 on Saturday night to one of the youngest, most vibrant politicians that this nation will ever see. That is why she was screaming out in this House last night. She is very concerned because her pay is going to be cut in half. Do honourable members know why he is going to lose his seat? Because he is married to a member of the Queensland Labor Party. He is married to a member of this government who has put policies in place and done deals with the Greens. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The motion before us tonight accuses the federal branch of the Australian Labor Party of doing a secret deal with the Greens. It is one of those ‘secret’ arrangements that the Australian Labor Party put out to the media. I recall very vividly--if my memory serves me right, it was 19 July, just two days after the election was called--that every major media outlet in this country covered the story that was out there from the Australian Labor Party. I heard people being interviewed about it and they went into some lengthy discussions. In fact, there were not just small news items; there were lengthy interviews with ministers and spokespeople like Chris Bowen. I would refer the members opposite to a Sky News interview held that day on the midday program. It went extensively into this issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087467"></A>
So I think it bears absolutely no scrutiny to suggest that there is any secrecy about this. It is in fact a well-known, well-publicised, well-established fact that the Australian Labor Party has entered into an arrangement in relation to preferences with the Greens. That is what happens in a democracy. It happens all the time and every political party does it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087468"></A>
In my view, there is absolutely no secret about why a party like the Greens, which has a commitment to the environment, would choose to recommend to its supporters to preference their second vote to the Australian Labor Party. We are the party that has the record and the form on the environment. We are the party that is committed to meeting the challenge of climate change. The federal leader of the LNP, Mr Abbott, had to say about climate change that he believes it is absolute c-r-a-p. </Hansard-Body>

It is interesting to note where the allegiances are in the upcoming federal election.

I am taking advice on whether this material is evidence of an arrangement that may in fact contravene the Australian Electoral Commission’s requirements. Do not come in here talking about secret deals. Every arrangement with the Greens has been fully disclosed, talked about by the Australian public, put out in the media. Everybody knows about it. Everybody is talking about it. It is no secret whatsoever. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. TS MULHERIN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland) (6.03 pm): I second the amendment moved by the Premier. We recognise that fishing is integral to the Queensland lifestyle and economy. In this year’s state budget the Bligh government invested $48.94 million in Fisheries Queensland. We understand the day-to-day challenges faced by recreational and commercial fishers, whilst the LNP and the coalition are merely using fishing as a political football. Every year almost a million people in Queensland fish for a living, for recreation or for traditional and customary purposes. Countless others rely on sustainable fisheries as the focus of tourism and other businesses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087495"></A>
Our fisheries resources are facing challenges such as the potential for overexploitation, increasing consumer demand for seafood, growth in coastal development and the effects of climate change. That is why the Queensland Fisheries Strategy 2009-2014 aims to ensure we derive the optimum economic, environmental and social benefits from Queensland’s fisheries resources. We are dedicated to supporting recreational fishing and protecting the fantastic way of life we enjoy by allocating $15 million per year to support recreational fishing. As part of an election commitment we have held 100 free fishing clinics for young people with a further 100 free fishing clinics being held over the next three years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087497"></A>
Commercial fishing plays a vital role in the Queensland economy. The gross value of production of Queensland’s commercial fishing sector is $275 million, with the total value chain estimated to be around $460 million. The Queensland industry accounts for approximately 17 per cent of the Australian commercial fishing industry. We continue to work with the commercial fishing sector every day to develop market opportunities. We are also working with industry to reduce the regulatory burden in the commercial fishing sector. We are also working with industry to improve efficiencies in both the commercial and the recreational sectors to foster sustainability along the whole supply chain. These are just a few examples of what the Bligh government does every day to support sustainable recreational and commercial sectors in Queensland. We care about the long-term prosperity of the industry and would not insult fishers by using the issue as a political football. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087498"></A>
Meanwhile, the LNP and the coalition are waging a dishonest fear campaign on the future of commercial and recreational fishing in Queensland. Its scaremongering is deliberately misleading fishers and their families and causing unnecessary concern. The LNP and the coalition need to come clean about what financial or in-kind support they have given to the Australian Fishing and Lifestyle Party for advertising. How much of the $17,000 spent on the last two weeks advertising blitz in regional seats by the Fishing and Lifestyle Party did the LNP pay for? I note that Warren Entsch, the LNP candidate for Leichhardt, attended the campaign launch of the Australian Fishing and Lifestyle Party in Cairns last month. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087501"></A>
While the ALP has been upfront, open and accountable from the outset with our Greens preferences, the LNP and the coalition are doing their normal thing--dodgy backroom deals with fishing parties to secure votes for the Senate. The LNP is offering its machine to get on air and speak against the review of the Commonwealth waters--a process that started under the Howard government. The Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, acknowledged that the process started under the Howard government when he was in Mackay. Hypocritically, Mr Abbott also announced that his government would immediately suspend the marine protection process and would not make any declaration without further consultation. The average person on the street thinks there will be nothing more done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087502"></A>
The Gillard government has already committed to extending the process to allow further consultation with industry, fishers and other users. In true LNP and coalition form, Mr Abbott has offered no alternative plan for the industry. He has only offered to suspend the consultation process which is underway. I fail to see how suspending the consultation will leave industry informed and reassured about the process. It would leave the industry in limbo and leave fishers with more uncertainty. While the coalition and the LNP continue to alarm and misinform the industry and recreational fishers, it is evident that the Bligh government supports commercial and recreational fishing and its economic, environmental and social benefits for Queensland. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs STUCKEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Currumbin--LNP) (6.08 pm): I support the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition. With a federal election literally upon us, it is unforgivable that federal minister Peter Garrett refuses to reveal what his Labor government plans to do about recommendations in the marine bioregional planning process. He has sat on this report for some nine months. An election campaign period is the proper time to advise all of us whether Labor intends to lock up fishing waters around Australia. Failure by Labor to reveal its plans must be condemned at the ballot box next Saturday. Considering that Labor has been given preferences by the Greens yet again the whole deal smacks of Peter Garrett doing an Anna Bligh. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087535"></A>
Only 18 months ago Premier Bligh put her hand on her heart and said, ‘You can count on me.’ As a result of doing deals with the Greens, once she won government it did not take long for legislation to be urgently rolled out to pay back the Greens and it also did not take long for the Premier to announce that she would sell off Queensland’s assets, much to the horror and outrage of the majority of Queenslanders. By contrast, the coalition has been upfront supporting a balanced approach to marine conservation. It was in fact the Howard government that commenced the process of establishing marine protected areas around Australia’s coastline, so do not take the moral high ground on the environment with us! Obviously Labor has no intention of engaging in extensive consultation, which is what the coalition has committed to in the past and has committed to once again for this election. Tony Abbott said that the coalition will put a halt to announcing any more of these marine protected areas until the process of thorough and extensive consultation takes place.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087538"></A>
One should not underestimate the recreational aspect of fishing. It is the No. 1 lifestyle pastime of Australians and many believe it is their right to be able to cast a line. In my local area residents have deep concerns about Labor’s intentions for the coastal area from Tweed Heads to Byron Bay. Tweed Heads and surrounding towns rely heavily on fishing and its associated activities. In this area alone thousands of people depend on fishing for their livelihoods, as the activity employs people across a wide range of industries--from the obvious like commercial fishing to retail, tourism, charters and boat building. At a rally at Tweed Heads attended by several hundred concerned residents last Saturday, people expressed their very real fears that their livelihoods will be destroyed with the stroke of a pen, that their industry will be decimated and that they will not be able to pay their mortgages or their weekly grocery bills. Labor’s failure to come clean is putting a huge number of people under intense stress that is completely unnecessary and downright deceitful. The emotion and anger last weekend was palpable. So much for jobs, jobs, jobs!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087541"></A>
Labor pretends to stand up for the worker, but that is only if you are in a union that fills the election campaign coffers! Too bad if you work for yourself or if you fish for a living! A coalition federal government will immediately put on hold these processes to restructure it so it will deliver a bigger, better, fairer say for recreational and commercial fishers and associated industries in all stages of the process. Importantly, new bioregional advisory panels will be appointed for each marine bioregion to provide the vehicle for this expanded industry and community consultation. In line with pre-existing coalition policy and practice, the coalition will genuinely seek to minimise socioeconomic impacts of marine protection areas. In those situations where consultation and negotiation cannot reduce the impacts of the proposed MPAs below levels that are reasonably compensable, compensation, structural adjustment or other appropriate measures will be delivered before any constraints are implemented.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087544"></A>
Labor’s marine bioregional planning process is secretive and skewed towards satisfying extreme Green groups. Whilst the coalition is determined to give fishers a fairer go, the Greens policy supported by Labor to ban fishing in a minimum 30 per cent of all Australian waters would literally cripple the nation’s seafood industry. Many say this would only be the tip of the iceberg before a larger percentage of Australian waters are claimed. People from the Queensland Seafood Industry Association acknowledge that this policy will close down the Queensland and Australian seafood industries at a time when there is a rising demand for seafood and simply encourage overseas production and more imports. Australia has high food safety practices. These are not employed by some other countries and there is every chance an inferior product would be on our shelves. On 21 August we must vote down--</Hansard-Body>

Mr HOOLIHAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It may interest those people with shell-like ears on the opposite side of parliament that in 2003 when dealing with Queensland fisheries the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority locked up 33 per cent of the Great Barrier Reef in green zones and our fishing industry was going to collapse. Surprisingly, the federal government at that time was the Liberal Party and it was in agreement with it--it was by negotiation--and today those green zones are working. In speaking to the amended motion, one issue that gets totally overlooked is that the Labor Party has a better environmental platform than any other party and there is no need to enter into any deals in relation to the closure of waters with the Greens. Certainly there is a preference deal, but by the same token we heard about the preference deal with the Australian Fishing and Lifestyle Party. Let us ask those opposite to put up their hands as to whether or not they endorse that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087553"></A>
One of the issues that should be put before this House is the Queensland government’s support for both recreational and commercial fisheries. Over three years there will be an investment of $34 million in constructing new pontoons, floating walkways and boat ramps and improving safety and access. In my electorate alone there will be a new boat ramp at Coorooman Creek, a floating walkway at Rosslyn Bay Boat Harbour, and another boat ramp will be completed with a floating walkway within the next 12 months.</Hansard-Body>

Mr HOOLIHAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I reckon I can do pretty well with the member for Coomera. When you throw out a line with bait on it, he bites every time. As I said, there will be a new boat ramp and floating walkway constructed within the next 12 months. One issue that should also be taken into account is that earlier this year there was a stock status report released showing strong results for fisheries in Queensland. A new traffic light system was applied and it showed that Queensland fish stocks and fisheries management reform was in good form when approximately 25 per cent of the world’s fish stocks are either overfished or depleted. We heard about pelagic fish where tuna in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic is almost fished out.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087563"></A>
Under the new traffic light system, 62 Queensland fish stocks were considered and 47 have been put through rigorous scientific assessment. Only the snapper stock received a red light. Stock assessment shows snapper at less than 35 per cent of its unfished levels, and it is internationally recognised that fish stocks at 40 per cent or less of their unfished levels are classified as overfished. In actual fact, in Western Australia snapper is also overfished and closures are in place for several months at a time and there are limits on total annual take. A recovery strategy is also being developed in New South Wales to address the overfished status of the snapper stock. So perhaps if parts of Australian waters are closed off for any period of time it is in the interests of increasing fish stocks. The whole approach to fisheries in Queensland has been on the basis of scientific data. Of 61 fish stocks, 21 Queensland fish stocks were being sustainably fished, three were considered not fully utilised, 25 species fall into the yellow light category--which is listed as uncertain--and there is no assessment of 15 fish stocks. We heard the complaints about locking up waters for recreational and commercial fishing. They are not locked up. They will not be locked up, other than in relation to sustainable fishing.</Hansard-Body>

Dr ROBINSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cleveland--LNP) (6.18 pm): I support the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition. Recreational and commercial fishing and its associated industries are worth a great deal to Queensland and Queenslanders. Hundreds of millions, perhaps billions, of dollars of investment and thousands of jobs exist in the industry and allied industries. Fishing is an important industry that in Queensland has continued to flourish in contrast to the problem of overfishing that exists in other parts of the world. Fishing is an important industry and leisure activity in my electorate of Cleveland, as it is in many other parts of coastal Queensland.</Hansard-Body>

Many bayside residents on the mainland and on the islands of Moreton Bay own boats and fish. Many of those boaties and fishers in recent years have become disturbed by the trend under Labor governments to close off areas from fishing without the demonstrated need to take such harsh measures. This Saturday, Queensland boaties and fishers will be faced with the stark choice: to vote for a federal Labor-Greens alliance that has a plan to close at least 30 per cent of Australian waters to fishing or for the LNP and sensible fisheries management. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087600"></A>
Since entering this House I have consistently spoken out about the dangers posed by the Greens-Labor alliance upon recreational and commercial fishing in Moreton Bay. Whether it is the overall failure of state Labor’s approach to the Moreton Bay Marine Park plan, the joke of the government’s approach to artificial reefs, the sending of the <Hansard-Italic>
Tiwi Pearl</Hansard-Italic>
--aka the <Hansard-Italic>
SS Minnow</Hansard-Italic>
--into a storm and losing control of its resting place, the incomplete rollout of the boundary markers for the Moreton Bay zoning plan, or the banning of inverted crab dillies based on one turtle death in five years, I have consistently pointed out that the Labor-Greens alliance has lost its way when it comes to fisheries management. It sends shivers down the spines of boaties and fishers to think that, should Julia Gillard win the election on Saturday, a similar approach to Labor’s failed formula for Moreton Bay is going to be rolled out across Australia by a federal Labor-Greens alliance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087604"></A>
I am deeply concerned about the Labor-Greens 30 per cent closure plan for several reasons. I am extremely concerned about the secrecy surrounding the decision. Instead of putting a detailed plan out to the public, Minister Garrett has kept the details secret until after the election. It can mean only one thing: that there is a lot of devil in that detail. They cannot be trusted. Secondly, I am concerned that Labor, under the influence of the extreme Greens, have created an imaginary problem--that overfishing is rife in Queensland waters--and then devised desperate measures to protect the last few remaining fish when, in fact, the recent Queensland fish stock status report states that only one of 64 species in Queensland, snapper, is at risk of overfishing. But Labor governments, dependent on green preferences to remain in power, have blown out of all proportion the level of risk to our fisheries. Whatever happened to the old adage ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087605"></A>
I studied marine science at James Cook University and since that time I have noted that two kinds of marine science exists. There is the approach that believed that Australian fisheries were broken and needed fixing. Back in the eighties, some of those false prophets of doom predicted that many Australian fishes would not exist by the year 2000. They were clearly wrong. Then there were those who based their views on hard fisheries data and held the informed view that fish stocks regularly come under pressure but, if fisheries are well managed, commercial and recreational fishing does not pose a high level of risk to their viability. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087606"></A>
It is clear today that federal and state Labor governments have been listening exclusively to the prophets of doom. Like the clucky luckys of this world, they are always thinking that the sky is falling in. They continue to falsely believe that the fish stocks are in such decline that the only solution is to close off huge areas of fishable ocean. This is clearly misinformed and wrong. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087607"></A>
Thirdly, gone are the days when Labor had men who were prepared to stand up for the right to fish. Men such as Tom Burns are well and truly gone from this place. Tom Burns was once seen by anglers as a political patron saint, even calling his boat the <Hansard-Italic>
Electorate</Hansard-Italic>
. He had his finger on the pulse of fishing. How things have changed since the green algal bloom has beset Labor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087609"></A>
I am also concerned that common sense has gone by the wayside in such Labor governments. One of the best examples of crazy extreme green science was the banning of inverted crab dillies based on one turtle death, as regrettable as one turtle death is. What a ridiculous decision. The Greens have espoused different positions--three of them. Which one will Bob Brown push on to Garrett this weekend? In conclusion, the answer to the Labor-Greens fishing dilemma is a vote for the federal coalition and for a sound fisheries management strategy. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms JARRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Whitsunday--ALP) (6.23 pm): The pastime of fishing is as Australian as eating meat pies. Most of us have childhood memories that involve fishing. Mine include learning to thread a worm on a hook and bobbing a cork attached to a fixed line over a muddy waterhole in the local creek. We caught yellow belly and jewfish, but I never did grow to enjoy the muddy tasting flesh. I have become much more partial to eating the wonderful array of seafood that comes from our oceans and I have a particular liking for butterfly filleted whiting, crumbed and deep fried. We all love to eat seafood. So the notion that any Australian government would attempt to stop people fishing, as I have heard claimed by that thinly disguised offshoot of the National Party, the Fishing and Lifestyle Party, is hysterical scaremongering to say the least. Make no mistake: the claims made here today by the LNP are nothing more than a political smokescreen to scare the voters. I have seen it all before and by my reckoning Ronny Boswell owes his seat in the Senate to the work of the Fishing Party when it mounted a similar scare campaign at the 2004 election. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

So what are the facts around the federal government’s plans for our fisheries? Minister Mulherin hit that nail on the head yesterday in his answer to a question without notice when he reminded us that it was the Howard government that initiated the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and began the investigations into the Commonwealth’s bioregion program. And why would it do this? What possible motivation would it have for interfering with our God-given right to throw a line in wherever and whenever we want? If members have ever travelled to Asia, they might know the answer. Our fish stocks simply could not sustain unregulated harvest. As the world’s population grows and as demand for fresh seafood becomes insatiable, steps simply had to be taken to ensure that we in Australia establish a sustainable wild fishery. Yes, there has been some pain associated with reducing the commercial fishing and trawling fleet and learning to abide by bag and size limits, but the truth is that we needed to put some limits in place to protect the viability of our vulnerable fish stocks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087615"></A>
I have no doubt that the monitoring of our fisheries will continue--and so it should--and, where necessary to promote sustainability, I support additional regulation of our fisheries. But I am disgusted by the scaremongering and outright dishonesty that has been peddled by the Fishing and Lifestyle Party and the LNP for base political purposes. Here is what Peter Garrett has to say about the Commonwealth government’s intention for fisheries management--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1087617"></A>
... the key thing to understand about the planning processes the Government has in place in relation to future marine protected areas is this--it is a process which requires significant consultation with communities and with fishers and that consultation process is underway. It is a process that identifies Areas for Further Assessment and that is the stage that we are at now, where we are drawing more information, more data and more science into our considerations. And most importantly of all, the marine planning process is intended to balance the needs of those communities of users, including fishers, with the need to protect the environment in the long term. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1087618"></A>
I am absolutely confident that we can reach the right balance in that process. I don’t expect there to be a process which is rushed. I want a process which happens drawing on good science--not one which is politicised by our political opponents who run around claiming that the sky is going to fall in as a consequence of a marine planning process. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087619"></A>
So there it is from the mouth of Minister Garrett. So let us have an end to the hysteria and dishonesty. Only an incompetent government would ignore the need to protect the sustainability of our fisheries. John Howard did not do this and Peter Garrett has not done this and even Mr Abbott has rightly committed to continue the consultation process that has been established by Garrett. Here is what Peter Garrett had to say about the claim that he has done a secret deal with the Greens to shut off 30 per cent of Australian waters to fishing--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1087621"></A>
... there is no intention on the part of the Government to set arbitrary limits in terms of a planning process. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1087622"></A>
Senator Brown might make ambit claims of some figure or other, that too is a completely unproductive contribution to what is a very important, rigorous and balanced process. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087623"></A>
Tonight, I support the amended motion as moved by the Premier. As a member who represents an area that supports both commercial and recreational fishing, I am proud of our role in the protection of our unique reef fishery. Our actions mean that some areas are out of bounds to fishers and at some times of the year certain fish are off the menu, but ultimately this means that there will be fish in our sea when my great-grandchildren dangle their fishing lines in the water. </Hansard-Body>

Mr CRIPPS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Hinchinbrook--LNP) (6.28 pm): When the people of Australia found out in mid July that the Gillard Labor government and the Greens had entered into a preference deal for the coming federal election, many started to get concerned about what Labor had promised the Greens in return for their preferences. It is no surprise that the disconcertedness and the deep sense of foreboding has been the most acute in Queensland, because many Queenslanders were suddenly struck by a terrible sense of déjà vu. It was as if the story of the last Queensland state election was repeating itself. Just as the Bligh Labor government struck a preference deal with the Greens before the last state election, the Gillard Labor government has now struck a preference deal with the Greens ahead of the coming federal election. I represent the electorate of Hinchinbrook in North Queensland and North Queensland has suffered badly after the re-election of the Bligh Labor government, with the implementation of the policies that were part of its deal with the Greens in return for their preferences. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091937"></A>
In North Queensland Labor has extended the wild rivers declarations across vast tracts of Cape York Peninsula. It has introduced the so-called reef protection regulations that are set to keep canegrowers and graziers filling out paperwork for several hours a day without any justification instead of undertaking basic farming activities. Labor has also introduced a ban on the management of regrowth vegetation and created buffer zones that will result in lost production. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091938"></A>
All of these new layers of regulation and red tape have come in in North Queensland within 12 months of the last state election because the Bligh government did a preference deal with the Greens. North Queensland will again be in the firing line if the Gillard Labor government is re-elected and the terms of its preference deal with the Greens are implemented. Now that the Gillard Labor government has done a deal with the Greens, what can we expect in the 12 months after the coming federal election? We can certainly expect that the Labor-Green alliance will force through an emissions trading scheme. We can also certainly expect that the Labor-Green alliance will impose a super profits tax on the mining industry.  </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091939"></A>
But the Labor-Green alliance will not be content with targeting our major industries with new taxes. Tonight’s motion focuses on the fact that the Labor-Green alliance is also looking to impose restrictions on one of the iconic aspects of our lifestyle in North Queensland with the proposal to turn one million square kilometres of the Coral Sea into a no-take marine park and around Australia close off a minimum of 30 per cent of Australia’s waters from all types of fishing, both recreational and commercial. These so-called bioregions have been developed and extended out of the declaration of the Coral Sea Conservation Zone by the federal Labor environment minister, Peter Garrett, who took this extraordinary decision following lobbying from the American based Pew Environmental Group. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091940"></A>
I heard the Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland in question time here yesterday claiming that these no-take zones were being developed through a consultation process with stakeholder groups. That is a breathtakingly dishonest statement because the Coral Sea Conservation Zone was declared without any impact statement. It was declared without any consultation and without any scientific process. The federal Labor government completely capitulated to the demands of a foreign lobby group and announced the establishment of a massive conservation zone in the Coral Sea off the coast of North Queensland. Minister Garrett arrogantly imposed the Coral Sea Conservation Zone on North Queenslanders without even pretending to consult with us. The claim by Minister Mulherin that there has been consultation is fraudulent and fabricated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091941"></A>
The rights and interests of commercial fishing families, of charter boat operators and of everyday Queenslanders to pursue that most simple of recreational activities--going fishing--have been completely sold out. The future of businesses attached to commercial and recreational fishing, such as bait and tackle shops, boat retailers, seafood wholesalers and retailers, restaurants, fish and chip shops that prefer to serve quality, domestically sought seafood and the tourism industry that are critical for North Queensland’s economy, have been compromised by the Labor-Green alliance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091942"></A>
It is a disgrace that the Bligh Labor government has proven itself to be the lackey of the Gillard Labor government. Labor MPs ought to be ashamed of themselves for selling out their constituents. North Queenslanders have seen the obscene results of the preference deal between the Bligh Labor government and the Greens at a state level. I shudder to think what North Queenslanders will be subjected to if the terms of the preference deal between the Labor government and the Greens at the federal level are implemented after this weekend. This weekend North Queenslanders will tell the Labor candidates in North Queensland what they think of their capitulation. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. KJ JONES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ashgrove--ALP) (Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(6.33 pm): I rise to support the amendment moved by the government tonight. The Bligh government is getting the balance right when it comes to protecting our unique marine environment while supporting sustainable fishing and recreation along Queensland’s coastline. This strong and clear articulated vision is in stark contrast to the contradictions that we see time and time again from those opposite. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091945"></A>
While the LNP opposition here in Queensland wants to throw out the rule book and let uncontrolled fishing drain our waters of fish for the future, we know that a sustainable industry means a thriving and surviving industry. That is why my ministerial colleague the Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland released the Queensland Fisheries Strategy last year. It aims to ensure that we derive the optimum economic environmental and social benefits from Queensland’s fisheries resources. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091946"></A>
Our fisheries resources are facing challenges, such as the potential for overexploitation, increasing consumer demand for seafood, growth in coastal development and the effects of climate change. We recognise that these are challenges that the industry faces and we are taking action. We have a plan. Tonight we heard the member for Currumbin boast in her contribution about the 30 per cent closure introduced by the Howard government, yet the rest of those opposite denied it. What is their position? The member for Currumbin was telling us not to get excited over here because they were the ones who introduced that. The rest of the LNP was saying that it was bad policy and should not have been implemented. Where do they stand? I guess it depends on which member one talks to. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091947"></A>
The member for Cleveland in his contribution talked about the phony science behind green zones and the fact that they do not work. I want to put on the record tonight his total disregard for any turtle dying in Moreton Bay. That is in stark contrast to the crocodile tears we see consistently from the member for Noosa, who, as the shadow minister for climate change and sustainability, is someone who is meant to care about the environment and who did not bother to make a contribution tonight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091948"></A>
Let us have a look at the independent science in relation to green zones and how they work--the bioregions that the member for Currumbin boasts about and the rest of them deny have any effect. The CSIRO in its latest research has found between four and 11 times more legal size male mudcrabs in sanctuary zones. Fish catch rates have also shown similar trends, with many more legal size fish in these sanctuary zones. These were the first results from a five-year scientific monitoring program in Moreton Bay by research partners including the CSIRO, the University of Queensland and Griffith University. The evidence continues to get stronger. I am pleased to inform the House tonight that the most recent results from the study of the green zones, which have been in place for just over a year, show that mudcrabs from this area are already larger and more abundant than they are in the adjacent non-green zones. Data is also indicating that certain fish species are becoming more abundant in new offshore green zones around Henderson and Flat Rocks. </Hansard-Body>

Ms JONES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The fish are biting tonight. We have exposed just how fraudulent the argument of those opposite is. They are the ones who came into this House and pretended that there was some secret deal between the Labor Party and the Greens. The first sentence from the member for Hinchinbrook started with the words ‘in July’. What is the date today? That is right; it is halfway through August. The contribution from the member from Hinchinbrook was, ‘The secret deal which was revealed in July.’ Wake up, Australia! </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091952"></A>
Every single contribution from the LNP tonight--one after another--has actually undermined the motion it has moved in the House. The reason that is the case is that those opposite do not believe the motion before the House. This is simply base politics. The only revelation we have had tonight is the revelation by the Premier that the LNP was the one with the secret deal which actually probably contravenes the Electoral Act. Tonight, once again, the LNP has not been open and transparent. The LNP does not want to see a sustainable fishing industry, in contrast to the Bligh government’s planned approach, which is working with industry. The LNP has to resort to dirty political tactics because it has no policy, no plan and no vision for the future of Queensland. It is a shambles. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A ID="pgfId-1096170"></A>
We have heard how Queenslanders are hurting from the high costs of living and we have listened. That is why we are calling for a freeze on registration hikes, which is LNP policy, and we are giving the Labor government a chance to do the same and reject the latest increase. The question is this: is this Labor government willing to listen and respond to the pain of Queenslanders who are really struggling with the high costs of living? That struggle has been added to by the fact that over the past couple of years this Labor government has increased vehicle registration costs by up to 27 per cent. Two hundred thousand Queenslanders have signed two petitions calling for relief from this registration hike. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096171"></A>
I call on the government to freeze vehicle registration charges, to listen to the people of Queensland and to understand that what is occurring in Queensland has resulted from a government inflicted downturn being felt by many businesses. This morning we heard how the number of failing Queensland businesses is significantly higher than in the rest of Australia. Queensland is bearing the burden of a government that has put up costs beyond the other states of Australia. Queenslanders cannot pay for this cumulative impact, which is reaching into their pockets and causing real hardship. It is time for Queensland motorists to have relief rather than rebuff from this government. I am calling on the government to listen to the people. They are hurting, and a lot of that hurt is the result of a range of costs that have been imposed through this government’s decisions and directly through higher taxes and charges. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096172"></A>
In the past two years we have seen the cost of registration go up by up to 27 per cent. This regulation also brings significant increases to heavy vehicle registration and those costs are passed on, through business, to consumers. As I said, it is LNP policy to freeze vehicle registration charges in our first term and give people relief. However, tonight Labor has the opportunity to hear the message of the people and also freeze registration price increases. In that way, it can make up for what it has done in regard to the other taxes and it can start to listen to the people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096173"></A>
This government went to an election promising not to get rid of the fuel tax rebate. It broke that promise and now Queenslanders are paying more than $500 million out of their pockets for that petrol tax. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100186"></A>
We have also seen this government significantly increase the tolls on the motorways. That is having an impact on pensioners, people who work and commercial businesses, some of whom have found that their costs on the motorways have gone up by 350 per cent. So the government needs to listen to the people. There is an opportunity to stimulate the economy in Queensland by listening to the people and not burdening them with these accumulative increases in costs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100189"></A>
The RACQ estimated that the average Queensland motorist was paying up to $220 more this year as a result of the petrol tax, increased registration fees and toll fees being forced upon them. There is an opportunity for the government to redress this or it could once again ignore the will of the people. I want to remind government members of some of their own promises. We heard that they have broken their promise in regard to the petrol tax. Queenslanders have now had that fuel tax rebate taken away from them, and the imposition of that tax has flowed through the economy and has had a significant impact. When state Labor government members were talking about the first increase in registration fees, they did not come out publicly and say what they were going to do with that money. Publicly they tried to say that they would put that increase into roads. I want to table a letter signed by the Treasurer, Andrew Fraser, on 8 December 2008 which puts the lie to that claim that it was all about money going back into roads. </Hansard-Body>

Government members tried to keep this myth going that it was all about increased funding going to roads, but we saw in the budget this year that road funding for the state of Queensland was slashed by $250 million, not increased. They cannot lie straight in bed in regard to what they tell the public and in regard to their promises before the election about taxes and what whey do afterwards. We want to see some honesty and we also want to see some relief for those who are hurting the most. People really are hurting with the accumulative impact of the government’s costs on them. The sticky fingers of the government keep dripping into their pockets and ripping out their last dollar.</Hansard-Body>

I also mentioned the truck registration hikes which are flowing through. These come on top of another increase, which is in fact the increase in the fuel excise which adds 9c a litre. The decision of the transport ministers throughout Australia to agree to this truck registration hike has meant that, firstly, this huge increase will flow on to consumers and, secondly, an unintended impact may be that it is more likely that people will go away from some of the more efficient combinations--</Hansard-Body>

Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is right; Queensland is diversified. There is a real likelihood that, because it is in fact favouring other combinations, we will see an increase in the number of trucks on the road, not a decrease, as people opt to go for a combination that cuts their registration fees but makes a bigger impact on our roads due to the fact that you cannot move that amount of freight with the B-double combinations under this current cost. There is a real concern that this move has not taken into account the unintended consequences in that it actually discourages some of the more efficient combinations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100200"></A>
I call on the minister to heed the concerns of Queenslanders about this particular impact. While there is a place for appropriate national regulation, ultimately and firstly the minister has to stand up for Queensland and stand up for understanding the impacts on the cost of living in this state. We are not like Victoria. If you drive three hours out of Melbourne, you are close to the borders. If you drive three hours out of Brisbane, you are not even halfway across the state to the west and you are certainly nowhere near even getting halfway up the coast of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

 Correct. This state is different because of the nature of its geography and that requires an understanding and a respect. This is something that we are aware of from talking to people in freight and also from talking to those consumers who, at the end of the day--</Hansard-Body>

I note that this government has no remorse for the pain it is inflicting upon ordinary Queenslanders, be it through increased freight costs or directly through their registration for their cars. It stuns me that government members do not get it. People are fed up with the way that they have abused their trust. They deliberately misled them in regard to removing the fuel tax rebate and imposed a tax upon them through the petrol bowser and now there are ongoing costs accumulatively through registration. If they do not get it now, when will they get it?</Hansard-Body>

 We have also seen reports about how the average cost of living for Queenslanders has risen by about $1,200 a year. Across the board, we are seeing increases above CPI, particularly driven by higher power costs as a result of this Labor Party misleading the people of Queensland. We have higher water costs, higher toll prices, higher registration fees and certainly higher petrol costs, and there are many other areas that the government has a direct responsibility for. I want to table this article as well because it outlines again the stress that people are under in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

When will government members ever listen? When will they understand? When will they respond in a way that will finally give some relief to people where it matters and allow them to get on with their lives? If government members really cared about the people of Queensland, if they cared about stimulating this economy throughout the regions of Queensland, if they cared about saving businesses that are no longer viable due to higher costs imposed by the government and the fact this is the most regulated government in Australia--with double the number of pages of regulation of some of our near state neighbours--then they would change that. </Hansard-Body>

I call on government members to heed LNP policy, freeze the registration increases, listen to the people about those impacts, stop putting their heads in the sand because Queenslanders are hurting and that is why they are crying out for a government that understands. If government members do not support our motion to see the freezing of this registration hike, then clearly they have not listened to the people of Queensland.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (7.58 pm): I wish to second the motion put by the shadow minister, the member for Maroochydore. Governments must not do things that can be reasonably avoided if the implications of their actions are unfair and unreasonable. Unfair and unreasonable actions should be decided on the basis of available evidence made in an environment of the impartial application of principles and processes that are deemed appropriate by consensus support of the quorum of democratically elected representatives responsible to develop such principles and processes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104515"></A>
Similarly, agencies designated by the quorum are charged with delivering the policy in a framework to the public that reflects the intent of the policy and allows the public to self-select those regulations that include them where their own individual situation or actions are prescribed by legislation. As such, there is a debate about whether this action by the Bligh Labor government has the right to increase the registration beyond what is reasonable, in this case by CPI, and a fixed increase over and above that of the previous registration fee applying to the Transport Operations (Road Use Management--Vehicle Registration) Regulation 1999 part 16, primarily this regulation. </Hansard-Body>

 The member for Barron River should just listen. I am trying to say that there is a clear case of, firstly, gouging fees from motorists in Queensland unreasonably and, secondly, a potential breach of section 51 of the Constitution. It is the second point that I would like to emphasise primarily. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104520"></A>
I completely agree with the sentiments expressed by the member for Maroochydore regarding price gouging. To all her comments I would add the following facts, which may have escaped the Bligh Labor government’s attention. Motorists’ costs are increasing by $220 per person. The 8c per litre fuel levy was scrapped, adding an extra $500 million in costs to Queensland motorists. Queensland is the most expensive state in Australia to own and operate a car, yet we are the most decentralised state. When added to tollway increases of between 30 per cent and 100 per cent, we have a clear case established for unfair cost recovery and unreasonable charges by this government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104522"></A>
If we are truly the Smart State, firstly, should it not be cheaper to own and operate a car in this state? Secondly, should registration not go up by CPI only, if at all? Thirdly, if times really are so tough because of the GFC and the recession we did not have to have, why would this government increase the cost to average Queenslanders of getting around? Fourthly, why would the state need to charge more than any other state for cost recovery? The truth is that there is no justification for any of these things. This was a decision made in a vacuum by desperate people--Labor. Therefore, the LNP and I are calling for a fair go, a fair go for families, small business and for all motoring Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104523"></A>
I suspect that this exorbitant fee could also be deemed constitutionally illegal and may be challenged under section 51, chapter I, part V of the Commonwealth Constitution. Specifically, it appears to breach the major provisions relating to discrimination between states. Motor vehicles do move beyond state borders and routinely do so. Commercially, it is more likely. Members need to know that a B-quad used for cattle transport from western Queensland to South Australia now attracts $28,000 in registration in Queensland. There is considerable evidence to support a section 51 challenge. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104526"></A>
Motor vehicle registration is a significant component in the everyday cost of living of average Queenslanders. There can be no justification for the price hike on electricity, which is up 30 per cent, fuel is up eight per cent and rates are up seven per cent. The major component of water is up 25 per cent and potentially is up 300 per cent in six years. The average charge for water for a family for six months is currently $245. As I say, motor vehicle registration is also up. </Hansard-Body>

South-East Queensland is now ranked amongst the least affordable places to live in the world, ahead of New York, London and Santa Barbara in the US. In a study of 272 markets in the Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey, 62 markets were identified as unaffordable and 22 of those were Australian. The Gold Coast comes in at No. 4 just after the Sunshine Coast, Brisbane comes in at No. 22 and Melbourne at No. 8. The factors noted are the cost of living, lower wages and rising property prices. Furthermore, in contrast to the Labor obsession with overregulation and a failed SEQ plan, the review stated that housing unaffordability has been driven by the devastating impact of land use regulation and the false belief that denser means cheaper. Twenty-four per cent of respondents to a recent poll on the website Gold Coast.com run by the <Hansard-Italic>

 revealed that they were thinking of moving to another city away from the Gold Coast. </Hansard-Body>

Is this ignorant Labor government listening to the public? Has it got any idea why the public hates the Premier and the Labor brand? It is because they cannot handle the intolerable increasing burden of costs due to Labor waste and mismanagement. This week Labor members should have hung their heads in shame when it was revealed that Queensland was the only state in Australia to not even grant a concession or free travel on public transport for Seniors Week. Seniors deserve a fair go for their contribution to the state and the nation.</Hansard-Body>

 Has it occurred to anyone in this chaotic Bligh Labor government that the rapid transit scheme on the Gold Coast is not linked to heavy rail but instead terminates in two locations where there is no public parking. Ten million tourists come to the coast annually but they will never use it because it is neither rapid nor mass transit. Gold Coasters and today’s editorial in our local newspaper have stated that this is a mass transit scheme to nowhere because the missing link is incomplete in the current plan, which is a link to the heavy rail, primarily at Helensvale. Yet here we are spending $1.8 billion, with the major sum going to suppliers who are well beyond our shores. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104535"></A>
These numbers sound so familiar. We have been talking tonight about the NBN plan, this $43 billion plan that started off as a $6 billion plan in 2007. People do not realise that the annual interest bill on $1 billion alone is $46.7 million every year. Then a capital return has to be made on it as well. This comes at a time when ordinary Queenslanders cannot afford to pay their car rego because they would never have budgeted for this manifest Labor incompetence in increasing their charges. This increase is totally unjustified. It is wrong. Do Labor members really know what these significant costs are? Do they understand how hard it is to pay it back? This Labor government has lost its way. It has alienated the Queensland public and it deserves what it has got coming to it. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms FARMER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In the 2010-11 budget the Bligh Labor government committed $4 billion to transport. Why did the government do this? Because it is committed to a safe, efficient and integrated transport system. Why is it committed to a safe, efficient and integrated transport system? Because that is what is required to connect people and communities, to move goods, to deliver services, to provide access to employment and education and to social services and recreational activities for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104543"></A>
What does $4 billion deliver? Here are some examples: $219 million for the Gold Coast Rapid Transit system; $150 million to continue construction of a busway connection between the South East Busway and Main Avenue, part of $833 million for the first two stages of the busway; $61 million to continue construction of cycle links to enhance the cycle network of South-East Queensland; funding of 100 per cent of all rail services in South-East Queensland; funding of 60 per cent of all Brisbane City Council buses; funding of 100 per cent of all new buses in South-East Queensland; a $50 million boost for bus services through South-East Queensland, providing 60 per cent of the funding for the almost 53,000 bus services per week delivered by the Brisbane City Council. What are we spending our money on in Main Roads? We are spending $3.3 billion, three times what the LNP spent on roads when it was in power. Our road building program is creating around 30,000 jobs a year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104585"></A>
I have never heard those opposite object to any of these initiatives. I have never heard them object to any of the services that are being introduced in their electorates. In fact, they are always wanting more. What I do hear them talking about is how the government needs to cut spending and how the government should not be raising revenue to provide the transport and road services it does provide, which is essentially what this disallowance motion is about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104586"></A>
What I would like to know from those opposite is what transport and road services they are going to cut. At the last election they talked about a three per cent efficiency dividend. They have reconfirmed that since. How is this going to affect the provision of services by Transport and Main Roads in Queensland? Are they going to cut public transport? Are they going to cut roads and infrastructure? Is it going to be road safety? They need to tell us. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104587"></A>
We need to take transport and main roads seriously in our state. Thank goodness the Bligh Labor government is doing just that. We know that Tony Abbott is not doing just that. We know, for instance, that he does not even rate public transport as worth a mention. Whose jaw did not drop to the floor when we heard of Tony Abbott’s pronouncement on public transport in his book <Hansard-Italic>

 I would like to ask the 700,000 people who commute across the South-East Queensland public transport network every day what they think. Good-quality, affordable public transport is one--not the only but certainly one--of the most essential services we can provide to Queenslanders to maintain their quality of life. We know that if we can encourage public transport patronage then we are also addressing traffic congestion and helping to reduce our carbon footprint. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104601"></A>
I do not know about LNP electorates, but these are issues that my constituents talk to me about a lot. I would like to talk specifically about public transport. Public transport patronage has exploded in recent years. The Bligh Labor government is totally committed to providing a public transport service, making it affordable and making it safe. Since 2004 patronage on the TransLink network has increased almost 50 per cent, from 123 million trips to over 180 million trips last year. This is around five times population growth. These impressive patronage figures are in response to the record level of funding injected into the TransLink network by the Bligh government. TransLink is funded to the tune of $1.9 billion to create accessible, reliant, efficient and safe public transport services across South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104603"></A>
This is not a cheap commitment from the government. It is structured in such a way as to provide the maximum opportunity for the commuter. Is this what the opposition would like to cut? For every dollar spent by the customer on public transport, the government contributes $3. Is this what the opposition would like to cut? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104604"></A>
There are few better examples of how the Bligh Labor government is providing an affordable public transport system than the recent introduction of the go card. This initiative is a winner and it is applauded across the country. More than 62 per cent of public transport trips in South-East Queensland are taken with the go card. That is equivalent to over 113 million trips with the go card so far. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104606"></A>
People can save money on the card. Trips on the card are on average 30 per cent cheaper than with paper tickets. The government has provided even further support to commuters by giving away $10 cards to those who have already given a lot to our community--to our seniors, to our charity organisations and other not-for-profit organisations--to help make their introduction to the electronic card a smooth transition. Over 300,000 people have taken up this offer. I think that means they like it. Is the go card what the opposition would like to cut? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104607"></A>
The Bligh Labor government delivered 301,000 new seats in the 2009-10 financial year. This equates to seating capacity for 15 million additional public transport trips across the next financial year. The breakdown comprises 30,000 additional weekly seats on the Gold Coast, Cleveland, Ipswich, Doomben and Rosewood lines, 215,000 weekly bus seats across Brisbane, 40,000 weekly bus seats across the Gold Coast, 10,000 additional seats for school services and buses in the Logan-Park Ridge area and 8,000 additional seats on the Brisbane CityCat services. Many of these lines go through the electorates of LNP members. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms FARMER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Many of these lines go through electorates represented by LNP members. Which ones would those opposite like to cut? It is interesting to note that if the opposition’s three per cent efficiency dividend had been implemented there would be a reduction of 170,000 seats per week on the TransLink network. I would like to be in the LNP party room when they work out which of their constituents got to miss out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104610"></A>
I know that the LNP wants to talk about prices. If those opposite are talking about offering concessions and subsidies to the people who need it the most, let me tell members about some of the concessions that the Bligh Labor government offers. The government is committed to providing concessions to our pensioners and concession card holders whenever possible. It is expected that the Queensland government in 2010-11 will provide an estimated $1.32 billion in concessions to pension, concession and Seniors Card holders. Of this amount, the Department of Transport and Main Roads will provide approximately $357.8 million in concessions, with an estimated $91.7 million relating specifically to registration related concessions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104612"></A>
This figure increases each year due to population growth and with an ongoing growth in the ageing population. The government is working hard to ensure that this system remains sustainable and to ensure that the benefits continue to be received by those who need them most. What are some examples? They are half-price car registration fees for pensioners, discounted taxi travel for people with a disability and half-price travel for pensioners and students using buses, trains and ferries. Then there is the $24 cut to CTP insurance on car registration from which every car owner would benefit. Now, which of these would the LNP like to cut? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104613"></A>
It is impossible to know where the LNP is coming from. The government is well aware that the cost of living is a big issue. That is why we have a massive job creation program, which the LNP opposes at every turn. The LNP does not want us to create jobs. It does not want us to raise revenue but it does want more of everything. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104614"></A>
I am proud to be part of a government which is committed to doing whatever it has to do to provide a good quality of life for Queenslanders, sometimes in ways that require politically difficult decisions.

(8.17 pm): I rise to say a few words in the debate on the Transport Legislation (Fees) Amendment Regulation (No. 1) disallowance motion. I am glad that you are sitting in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker O’Brien, because I am sure you will understand what I am talking about here. I refer to how disadvantaged rural and regional Queenslanders are by those opposite being so reluctant to assist car owners. Those opposite seem to hate car owners, and particularly V8 Land Cruiser car owners. I am sure there are a lot of them up in the cape. The registration cost for these vehicles has gone through the roof. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

The RACQ says that the running costs per year for a V8 Land Cruiser have increased by $1,445 under this government. These are your poor, battling constituents that these blokes hate. They hate the poor battlers in the cape. They hate the fact that they drive V8 Land Cruisers. They have to drive V8 Land Cruisers because they do not make anything else. The four-wheel drive Land Cruisers do not come in anything else but V8. They are more fuel efficient than the six cylinders. Those opposite are taxing them out of existence.

Yesterday the member for Waterford said that he supported public transport, yet it is the poor battlers in Waterford and Beenleigh who are now paying extra registration fees because he will not help them. He is a disgrace for that electorate. Those people are paying more for rego and more in fuel tax. The poor battlers of Waterford, Beenleigh, Loganlea and Eagleby are the ones who are paying because the member for Waterford will not help them. The member for Barron River is a disgrace for those poor Far North Queenslanders who are battling away trying to pay their rego bills and trying to pay extra fuel costs. It is an absolute disgrace!</Hansard-Body>

Mr RICKUSS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The member for Barron River has sat there and carped half the night here about the increased registration costs that are being paid by his constituents. It is just a shame that he will not stand up and represent those poor battling car owners and those poor battlers who have to pay these increased registration costs and increased fuel costs. It goes on. The member for Morayfield has been just as bad, supporting him in carping here half the night. The member for Yeerongpilly is the leader of the choir, carping away at those poor battlers who are trying to pay increased registration costs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109114"></A>
How ridiculous is it that it is cheaper to register a triple trailered road train than it is to register a B-double? It is cheaper to register a road train that is 40 metres long than it is to register a 26-metre B-double. How ridiculous is that? There is no common sense in any of these registration hikes. It is just ridiculous! Transport companies which have a base in my electorate such as Nolan’s, Lindsay, Freshway, Mitchell and Rocky’s Own are being penalised by this government going over the top with registration fees and there seems to be no rhyme or reason for it. There seems to be no rhyme or reason for why a B-double would be more expensive to register than a triple trailered road train or a double trailered road train. A B-double will hold only 12 pallets on the first trailer and 22 on the second trailer whereas a road train will hold 22 pallets on all trailers--that is, 66 pallets. How stupid is that? It makes no sense.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109126"></A>
Taking into consideration the statistics, B-doubles are very safe vehicles. I received some statistics recently from Victoria which show that B-doubles are miles safer than single trailers, yet the government is trying to increase their registration so that they go out of existence. I am extremely disappointed that the members on the other side of the House, even the member for Bulimba, are not standing up for the battlers in their electorates who have to pay these increased registration fees and increased fuel costs when the government is subsidising public transport to the tune of 75 per cent. How ridiculous is that? Anyone who lives outside the metropolitan area is being totally disadvantaged by this mob opposite. People just cannot believe the increases in rego and fuel costs. It just goes on and on and on. I hate to harp on, but it is a crying shame that this mob opposite do not have an idea what the real world is like. They talk about public transport, yet I am sure that the mob opposite--</Hansard-Body>

They just do not understand how the battlers in Queensland are being ripped off. People in outer suburbs such as Flagstone where there is no public transport are being ripped off because they have to pay this dear rego. I just cannot believe it. This regulation should be repealed.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (8.23 pm): I, too, am pleased to contribute to the debate this evening on the disallowance motion moved by the shadow minister. I am pleased to contribute to this debate because the regulation we are seeking to disallow cuts to the chase when it comes to Labor’s economic mismanagement and it clearly portrays the alternatives that will face Queenslanders when they next decide who will govern this great state. Let us start with Labor’s economic mismanagement. This regulation will pass on another CPI increase to licence and vehicle registration fees. On its own this may appear insignificant, but on the back of last year’s 17 per cent to 22 per cent increase it is yet another slap in the face for Queensland’s struggling families.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109133"></A>
Last year the LNP stood in this House and denounced that outrageous fee increase for what it was--a desperate money grab by a desperately broke government. A quick look at the RACQ’s analysis shows this. Let us take a four-cylinder car that in 2008-09 cost $263 to register. In 2009-10 that amount jumped to $308.25, an increase of 17 per cent. If we take a six- or eight-cylinder car, the increase is even greater. If we compare that to other Australian states, Queenslanders get a greater sense of the magnitude of this slap in the face. In New South Wales--the most expensive of the other states--it costs $245.20 to register a small car. In Victoria--the cheapest--it costs $178. What do we pay in Queensland? $308.25. The average across all other states is $191.29. What conclusions did the RACQ arrive at? It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1109135"></A>
The Queensland Government portrays itself as low taxing compared with other jurisdictions. However, the data on registration costs presented in this FactSheet make it clear that vehicle owners in Queensland face the highest government-imposed fixed costs in Australia.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1109137"></A>
Queensland motorists have enjoyed the benefits of an 8.354 cents/litre fuel subsidy that is not available in other states. To some extent, this has balanced the very high registration costs in Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1109138"></A>
Should the registration costs increase further, and the fuel subsidy be removed, Queenslanders will face the highest vehicle ownership and operating costs in the country.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1109139"></A>
None of the proposed increase in revenue to the Queensland Government is dedicated to fund transport infrastructure or services. It will go to consolidated revenue, where it will replace other shortfalls in revenue due to the economic downturn, or other increases in government expenditure.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109140"></A>
And there we have it. The Bligh Labor government did remove the fuel subsidy. This Bligh Labor government continues to funnel more than a billion dollars in revenue raised through registrations into consolidated revenue, not into transport infrastructure, and this Bligh Labor government is yet again increasing registration fees. It finishes off a trio of blows that see Queensland motorists facing the highest vehicle ownership and operating costs in the country.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109141"></A>
If that was the only cost-of-living increase confronting Queensland’s struggling families then perhaps it could be justified, but it is not. The vehicle operating cost increases have flow-on impacts on groceries and daily services, as businesses pass on their own increased expenses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109142"></A>
And then there are electricity increases and water increases. Just on that alone, constituents in Glass House--constituents who have used tank or bore water for the past 10 years--now pay $223 a quarter for that privilege. Where will it end? Kevin 07 and the federal Labor Party fought an election on cost-of-living increases and his commitment to reduce the burden on Australian working families. But after what Queensland has seen since, one must ask: was that the fake Labor Party? Has the real Labor Party stepped forward at both the federal and the state level over the ensuing three years? Queenslanders know that the answer is a resounding yes--the real Labor Party crippled by economic mismanagement, the real Labor Party stumbling from one failed initiative to another, the real Labor Party forced to raise taxes and fees to offset its mountainous debt repayments, the real Labor Party that does not care about cost-of-living increases after all.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109144"></A>
That brings me to the alternative being offered to Queenslanders. When it comes to reining in cost-of-living increases, only the LNP has a plan. The LNP, upon restoring the state’s AAA credit rating, has committed to reinstating the fuel subsidy. Only the LNP has committed to freezing registration costs for cars, boats and light trucks during its first term in government. Whether it is the federal election this Saturday or the state election due before March 2012, Queensland’s struggling families have a decision to make: do they vote for the real Labor Party, which will do and say anything to win their vote, which will continue to tax and levy them to make up for its economic mismanagement, which will force cost-of-living increase after cost-of-living increase upon them; or will they vote for an LNP that has a proven record of economic management and a commitment to put a freeze on registration cost increases like the ones contained in this regulation?<Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (8.29 pm): I rise this evening to contribute to the debate on the disallowance motion moved by the LNP. The purpose of the disallowance is to highlight this state Labor government’s ongoing gouging of motorists in Queensland with high fees and taxes. The subordinate legislation provides regulations for about 16 acts. However, our concern is the Transport Operations (Road Use Management--Vehicle Registration) Regulation 1999. The LNP will use this disallowance motion to highlight its policy that is designed to ease the burden on families in Queensland, unlike the bleating of federal Labor’s working families and downward pressure on interest rates--all from Labor governments that go bust in a boom and turn the coalition’s surplus into a spendathon. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113725"></A>
We are seeking to challenge the government to adopt our policy and freeze car registration and give people a break. The LNP will freeze for its entire first term in office the registration fees for cars and light vehicles, along with recreational boats, trailers and horse floats. In the past two years, registration has increased by a whopping 27 per cent, putting further pressure on struggling families. Car registration and the removal of the fuel subsidy will add an additional burden to Queensland’s struggling families who are under threat of further economic pressures bought about by a Labor state government that has gone bust in a boom.</Hansard-Body>

The price increase is the latest hit for the state’s drivers, after hefty registration cost increases came into effect last year, while the government scrapped the fuel subsidy. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113763"></A>
Labor has done nothing to reduce the burden on Queensland families. Labor ministers sit in their ivory towers without a care in the world for the struggling families and senior citizens of this state. Registration has gone up a whopping 27 per cent. So we would expect road funding to increase accordingly. But it has not. Funding for roads is down in this year’s budget by $250 million. It will be no surprise to anyone in this House that roads are the biggest issue in my electorate of Mudgeeraba--and I am sure members will hear about that further this evening. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113764"></A>
Mudgeeraba was a marginal Labor seat for eight years and the entire area was repeatedly ignored by a government that never expected to hold the seat for as long as it did. The residents of my electorate are sick and tired of this arrogant, out-of-touch, on-the-nose Labor state government, which pinched money from the Howard government and upgraded the M1 in Labor seats in Brisbane. We have a Minister for Main Roads who will not face locals on the hard issues. He will not come down to listen to residents or their state representative.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113765"></A>
Registration costs go up, but when the money needs to be reinvested in better roads for Queensland, our roads see none of it. Queensland once had the proud title of being one of the cheapest states in which to own and operate a motor vehicle. That title is long gone and we are now the most expensive state in Australia in which to own, operate or register a motor vehicle. On top of that, every time ordinary mums and dads fill up their vehicles with petrol, it costs them more now than ever. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113766"></A>
Under Labor, when it deregulated the electricity industry, we were promised that electricity prices would not rise. As we now know, that is not the case. Electricity prices have gone up. That is another broken promise. When this Labor government took control of South-East Queensland’s water assets, once again residents were told that prices would not go up, but they did. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113767"></A>
The fuel tax is another broken promise. This Labor government has failed to plan for the tough times. During a period of great growth and income it has wasted millions and millions of taxpayer funds on dodgy deals and projects that could have been run more efficiently by a five-year-old. The LNP’s policy to freeze registration fees for cars and light vehicles, along with recreational boats, trailers and horse floats, will at least give residents some hope and comfort that they will not be getting hit in the hip pocket year after year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113768"></A>
The LNP is well aware of the hardships being faced in the community and it will deliver on its promises. That is the difference between the Liberal National Party and Labor. We are the true economic conservatives. We know how to run business and we know how to stick to budgets--unlike the others, which went bust in a boom, lost our AAA credit rating and are more spin than substance. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WENDT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich West--ALP) (8.35 pm): I rise to oppose the motion of disallowance moved by the member for Maroochydore. Despite the speech from the member for Maroochydore, I believe that the motion that she has moved and the arguments that she has made are short-sighted and, as such, typical of the approach that the LNP would take to governance in this state. That is because, in its most basic form, this disallowance motion means $63 million would be taken out of the budget bottom line.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113771"></A>
I would now like to concentrate my comments specifically on issues associated with the motor registration and CTP initiatives which were announced earlier. It is quite plain that this government has never taken lightly the cost of living pressures that Queenslanders face. That is because we know that every dollar counts. That is why in this year’s budget the Treasurer announced a reduction in the CPT insurance levy for all motorists of $24, which will be effective from October this year. However, that is not all; it should be noted that the current government also provides significant levels of concessions for vehicle registration to qualifying pensioners, seniors, charitable and community service organisations and, of course, our primary producers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113772"></A>
For instance, in Queensland, for holders of a pension concession card issued prior to 1 July 1994, the concession benefit is a reduction in the registration fee portion to a flat rate and for holders of a pension concession card issued after 1 July 1994, as well as all eligible Seniors Card holders, the registration fee portion is reduced by 50 per cent. That means that in 2010-11 the Department of Transport and Main Roads will provide approximately $357 million in concessions, with an estimated nearly $92 million relating specifically to registration related concessions. That means that the government is using the fees collected from vehicle registrations to make a record investment in Queensland’s future. As such, we continue to invest more in roads than we collect in vehicle registration charges. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113773"></A>
By way of example, I think it is worth noting that, currently, registration charges generate around $1.2 billion in income. However, the government provides $2.145 billion in funding for road construction and maintenance. Further, the government also spends more per capita on roads funding, which is different from what the member for Mudgeeraba said a moment ago. In fact, it is around $732 per person in Queensland and this is more than its counterpart in New South Wales, which spends around $382; in Western Australia, which spends $227; and in Victoria, which spends around $205 per person. I think that demonstrates clearly the level of commitment that we have to building a strong future for all Queenslanders. It shows how we want to keep investing in infrastructure and services while the opposition only wants to make cuts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113774"></A>
However, I am aware that one sure way to increase the cost of living pressures on all Queenslanders is to have high unemployment, because without a breadwinner families will face an uncertain future and many will be unable to meet the most basic costs. That why it is important to remember that the opposition took a plan to the last election that would have cut jobs in the public sector and destroyed jobs in the construction industry. If members remember, the opposition’s plan was to halt our record building program. This, of course, would have been a job killer. By maintaining our building program and not cutting services, this government took the most responsible course of action in the face of the very real threat of recession. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118403"></A>
We did not put our foot on the brake of the Queensland economy; rather we accelerated investment and created jobs. In view of this, the member for Maroochydore’s motion tonight seeks to take $63 million out of infrastructure and services and I, for one, cannot support this as it would mean more job losses and more families facing an uncertain future in my electorate and right across Queensland. I suppose this is typical of their approach to government. As we have already seen in this federal election campaign, a similar plan from Tony Abbott and the coalition government would see cuts to services and a refusal to invest in infrastructure, with more jobs lost and more families under pressure. I cannot support this motion.<Hansard-Speech-End>

(Redlands--LNP) (8.40 pm): Tonight I speak in support of the disallowance motion for the Transport Legislation (Fees) Amendment Regulation (No. 1) 2010, which is subordinate legislation No. 100 of 2010. I find it interesting sitting here listening to the debate from both sides of the House. It is almost like the two worlds have crossed over somehow. We seem to be defending the battler while those opposite, who built their platform and their party on supporting the working class and the battler, have completely left them out in the cold. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118406"></A>
This disallowance motion is important in trying to put some kind of brake on to help people draw breath. Instead of having people treading water, members of this government are currently standing them on their heads and drowning them. It is not helping our community. My office is in a shopping precinct and when I look out the window I notice that the number of people has visibly declined, and it is because of the knock-on effect of all the fees and charges. Government members talk about registration being capped to CPI. That is a myth. It is simply a headline that the government has manufactured through its spin doctors. That is about the only thing that Labor does have that works in an amazing fashion. That CPI is only for this year. When one compounds it with last year, we see there is a 27 per cent average registration increase. That is unacceptable. When one looks at car ownership, as we have repeatedly heard tonight, we see we have gone from being one of the cheapest states in Australia to own and operate a motor car to one of the dearest. That hurts people. Queensland is a big state. We are probably more reliant upon our motor vehicles than many of the smaller states and Western Australia, which is centrally focused. In Queensland a car is not a luxury; we see it is a lifestyle necessity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118407"></A>
This government has historically targeted the motor car. Look at the tolls. I have had a number of small business operators come to my office. They own small rigid-body vehicles, such as single axle flat-tray towies, concrete trucks, small furniture removal trucks or small courier vans. They have now been bumped up a class. Their increases have been astronomical. They have gone from being classified as a motor car to being classified as almost the equivalent of a semitrailer. It is absolutely bizarre. These are small business people who employ people locally in South-East Queensland. These are the ones who are not able to employ people. These are the ones who are going broke. We heard earlier today the level of bankruptcy of small business in Queensland. I think it was 47 per cent that I heard from the member for Southern Downs earlier this morning. They are jobs. Those opposite talk about jobs and pretend to represent jobs but that is completely wrong. They have been completely flat-footed. They have been causing bankruptcies. They are driving people into the poorhouse because registration and fuel prices have gone up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118408"></A>
The government was very quiet about that in the run-up to the election, I hasten to add. It talks about keeping costs under control. All of the tolls on all of the motorways and all of the fares have gone through the roof. Labor is about driving up the cost of living. It is inflation. The cost of water, the cost of electricity, the cost of every single thing that people do under this government costs a fortune. When I look into these shopping arcades in my local area around Victoria Point I can tell members that the stores are trading very low. I can tell members that the people who used to go there and shop do not have that disposable income anymore. I can tell members that those retailers are letting people go. I can tell members that those people are now unemployed. </Hansard-Body>

 Withdraw unconditionally. Queensland is now the most expensive place to own a car, with costs going up $220 per vehicle. That is clearly unacceptable. The government is hurting this community. We hear a lot from those opposite about this side of the House being a policy-free zone. Those opposite choose to hear some things but not to hear others. We have a very clear policy that, when we win government at the next election, we will freeze rates. I throw down the challenge here tonight to those opposite to adopt our policy and freeze registration and start listening to those people who are struggling under the weight of this incredibly oppressive brutal regime that is this Labor government. It is completely destroying the fabric of small business and destroying this community. The best that we hear tonight is that there has been a reduction in the CTP. The government has not put its hand in its pocket for that CTP. It is actually coming from those service providers and the commissions that they pay. They are making those unlawful. The government has not stepped up to the plate. It is not helping the community. It is not listening to the constituents that it pretends to represent. I again throw down the challenge: adopt our policy here tonight and freeze registration. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr EMERSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Indooroopilly--LNP) (8.48 pm): Queenslanders are hurting from increases in the cost of living and nearly every day they are confronted by another example of the Bligh government hitting their back pocket. Labor is making sure every Queenslander pays for its incompetent economic management. Labor seems to view Queensland motorists as its cash cow. In contrast, the LNP recognises that Queenslanders are hurting under Labor. That is why the LNP will freeze registration costs for cars, boats and light trucks during its first term in government, but there is no freeze from Labor. Labor is forcing motorists to make ever-increasing contributions to the state budget to make up for its failures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118462"></A>
Queensland has become the most expensive state in Australia to own and run a car. The fact is that the Bligh government is taking motorists for a ride. Both welfare and motoring groups have warned that motoring costs are escalating beyond the reach of many Queenslanders. As RACQ spokesman Gary Fites said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1118465"></A>
It is fair to say motorists are getting close to the breaking point as far as the cost of motoring is concerned ... but the State Government has motorists over the barrel because cars are a necessity for Queensland households. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118466"></A>
Last year most vehicle registration fees rose by 17 per cent and this year they will go up once again. In the past two years alone, the revenue collected from motor vehicle registration has risen by 30 per cent--from $1.014 billion to an estimated $1.31 billion in 2010-11. Since 1 July, it has cost $627 to register a large car in Queensland, compared to $178 in Victoria and $246 in Tasmania. Vehicle registration fees now account for 13 per cent of the government’s total tax take and are one of the largest single-source tax revenues. While motorists pay more, the government is allocating less of its resources to the road network. This year spending on roads will fall by 6.6 per cent, which is down more than $232.5 million, while motorists will pay an extra $50 million in registration fees.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118467"></A>
One of the clearest examples of how much Queensland motorists are hurting is how many are late in paying their registration fees. Hundreds of thousands of Queenslanders were hit with more than $27 million in late fees for failing to pay their annual vehicle registration bills on time. Motorists paid about 600,000 late payment fees of up to $48.05 each in the last financial year, funnelling in excess of $73,000 into the state coffers every day. This is a record number of defaults. This controversial fee, initially $40, was introduced by the state government in 2003 and rises annually. From 1 July it increased to $49.15 for vehicles and $12.22 for trailers and recreational ships. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118468"></A>
However, it is not just the registration fees that are increasing the cost of living for struggling Queenslanders. Queensland motorists have gone from paying the lowest petrol prices in Australia to the highest in the year since the Bligh government’s fuel tax was introduced. Monitoring by price watchdogs FUELtrac and MotorMouth showed that in July Brisbane had the highest average unleaded petrol price of all mainland capitals, at $1.27 a litre. Let us not forget that this is a fuel tax that the Bligh government ruled out. On 3 June 2008 in parliament, Premier Anna Bligh said of Queenslanders--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1118472"></A>
I will not kick them--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

that is, Queenslanders--</Hansard-Body-Continued>

when they are down and I will not abolish the petrol subsidy. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1118475"></A>
On 16 January 2009 in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
, Treasurer Andrew Fraser was quoted as saying--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1118477"></A>
Make no mistake about it. We’ll be delivering a fuel subsidy scheme. It will stay in place. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1118478"></A>
Of course, after the state election, in the 2009-10 budget, the Treasurer scrapped the fuel subsidy, costing Queensland motorists an extra 9.1c a litre in fuel. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118479"></A>
In this financial year the burden on South-East Queensland motorists has increased further, with the government lifting tolls across the Queensland Motorways network. A single Gateway bridge crossing is up 30 per cent, from $2.95 to $3.85. From 1 July 2010, tolls for the Gateway Motorway increased by 30 per cent. The toll for a private car or a small truck rose from $2.95 to $3.85, a spike of almost $1. The toll increase is being used to drive up the revenue base for Queensland Motorways as the government pursues its sale. Higher revenues mean that the government can seek a higher price for the asset. The Bligh government has also developed a detailed proposal to charge distance tolls to use major south-east roads, including charging motorists 12c a kilometre. The government has ruled it out, but can it be believed? It also ruled out scrapping the fuel subsidy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118480"></A>
The new smart driver’s licence is supposed to be cost neutral, but instead the cost of a five-year licence will jump from the current charge of $73.30 to $96.05 next year and $152.50 by 2014-15. That will be the equal highest cost in Australia. The Queensland Council of Social Service’s board president, Karyn Walsh, has said that the increasing cost of living was putting pressure on the 400,000 people living below the poverty line. She said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1118483"></A>
There are a significant number of people who are underemployed so the predictability of their income is a challenge for their expenses. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1118484"></A>
There are many people who don’t have the luxury of a choice between public transport and a car--a car is an essential in a lot of communities where there isn’t the infrastructure of public transport. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118485"></A>
Even if they can access public transport, Queenslanders have been hit by an increase in the cost of living. From 1 January 2010 go card fares rose by about 20 per cent and paper ticket costs are climbing by around 40 per cent. Fares will jump by 15 per cent annually from 2011 to 2014. Whether it is the costs of registration, petrol, drivers’ licences, road tolls or public transport, this Labor government continues to increase the cost of living for Queenslanders. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Caloundra--LNP) (8.54 pm): With the election of Tony Abbott on Saturday, in Canberra we will have a coalition government that will know how to balance the books, as opposed to a Labor Rudd-Gillard government that took us into deficit and continues to take us into debt on a daily basis. That government has completely wrecked the economy of this nation and then claimed the credit for the hard work done by Howard and Costello. That government is mirrored by the government in this state. Every day that we come into this House we see Labor members cloak themselves in the garb of helping and aiding the working man. They say that they defend the rights of the working man and working families, but at the same time they tax working families out of existence. This is one more example of it imposing heavier and heavier financial burdens on working people right across this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118488"></A>
This government has a long history of making commitments and then breaking them. The government’s decision to sell Queensland assets never went to the people or the polls. The Treasurer made no comment about it and neither did the Premier. Then suddenly we find that the assets of this state, which generate income for the coffers of the state, are being taken away from the people of state. Day in and day out, electricity prices are increasing. I can recall Premier Beattie standing in this House and saying that competition would ensure that prices went down. Does anybody in this House believe that their power bill has gone down since Premier Beattie handed over that asset and capacity to private enterprise? The prices have gone up, even though under the act the minister has the power to regulate the increases. However, week after week, month after month, the minister has sat in this House and done nothing, even though the act allows him to control and regulate electricity prices. It is an absolute disgrace. </Hansard-Body>

In this state the costs of water have been passed on to ordinary taxpayers because of this government’s incompetence. The burden of its need to pay debt is now being borne by households right across Queensland, including those on the Sunshine Coast. Now registration charges are in the firing line. This government endorses the role Julia Gillard played in knifing Kevin Rudd in the back. He was the working man from Queensland. He worked for the Labor government. He worked for Wayne Goss. He is a Nambour boy. If that is how the Labor Party treats its own federal parliamentary leader, it will have no compunction in sticking it to ordinary, everyday, hardworking Queenslanders. There is no doubt that they do not care, so long as they stay in power. It does not matter who they whack, who they fire, who they charge up, as long as they stay in power. They cloak themselves as the servant of the working man, but that is an absolute joke. On a daily basis they stand in this place and claim to be there for the working men of Australia, but all they have done is increase charges, increase taxes and increase registration fees. Registration has now increased--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 And it is worth hearing, Madam Deputy Speaker. In the past two years, registration charges have increased by 27 per cent. For ordinary householders, that means a little less money for food, for luxuries, for rent and for other things that we take for granted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123281"></A>
It means an erosion on a daily basis of the core components that make up the family unit. It also means that there is a significant impact on small businesses which have to pay an increased registration because this government is simply trying to craft back more income to pay its own debt. It is very interesting to look at the added cost of the petrol rebate being removed. Queenslanders are paying $500 million more each year because this government did not get its sums right and this government has dudded the state of Queensland and the people in it. There is no doubt that this registration is simply an impost on Queenslanders to raise additional revenue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123285"></A>
The member for Bulimba raised the issue of public transport. I can say this to the House now: I wish we on the Sunshine Coast had the luxury of complaining about public transport because the CAMCOS rail corridor--that thing that goes on and on and on forever and will never, ever be built--is costed at something like $2 billion to build and it will go on forever and ever. I would love to be able to say we have to consider public transport on the Sunshine Coast, but we do not have any. We still have to pay the other costs associated with this government trying to make things work for it and trying to pay its debts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123287"></A>
I now go to Unitywater. What a marvellous entity that is! It was formulated by the government to try to assist the people of the Sunshine Coast to deal with the issues of the water crisis that enveloped this state. The government has put in place this entity to try to resolve those matters but no-one can get through to them, no-one can contact Unitywater. My office has been inundated by people who have been waiting on hold for up to 45 minutes on two or three occasions. You cannot get them to return a telephone call and you cannot get Unitywater to answer their telephone, let alone deal with the concerns customers have got. This is causing an additional great distress to the people of the Sunshine Coast and right across Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123290"></A>
Residents are making it quite clear that the water bills imposed by this wonderful Labor government on the residents of the Sunshine Coast are two or three times what they paid in the past. Their bills have doubled or tripled, and this is a direct result of this Labor government’s inability to deal with the issues of its own negligence and its own neglect of the financial capacity of the state to pay its own debts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123291"></A>
At the end of the day, it comes down to one very clear point. This government has failed the people of Queensland. It is trying to graft every single cent it can to cover the black hole that the Treasurer and the Premier have gotten us into. We have lost our AAA credit rating, we have lost our capacity to borrow at a minimum level, and we are now slugging the taxpayers of this state in an endeavour to recoup that loss. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123293"></A>
I hope we will toss Gillard out this Saturday. The next step is to make certain that this state government, which is rotten to the core, is tossed out of this state and we get in place a government that will balance the books, produce the infrastructure, produce the capital works and make certain that we go into the whole of the state, not just the marginals that the government tries to protect. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. DM WELLS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Murrumba--ALP) (9.02 pm): Honourable members from the opposition side of the House have treated us tonight with an extraordinary ebullience and an extraordinary farrago of rhetoric, but I think the keynote speech came from the honourable member for Redlands. He set the tone of the debate. He said that it was an unusual debate; the term he used was that the parties seemed to have crossed over and the LNP was defending the battler. There lies a certain unconscious admission that it is not actually their historical role to defend the battler. When you hear the LNP purporting to defend the battler, then anyone with a normal judgement might very well wonder what is actually going on. Is it really just a theatrical performance that is going on? Is it perhaps something that might have a certain touch of insincerity about it? The extent to which they extrapolated their quite unreasonable rhetoric perhaps gives some verisimilitude to the proposition that there was some insincerity involved in it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123297"></A>
The notion from the honourable member for Redlands was that this was a brutal regime of taxation and the remarks of the honourable member for Maroochydore were that we were ripping the last dollar out of the pockets of the battlers. These pieces of rhetoric go far beyond any reality that anybody could possibly have a grip on. When you remind yourself of the remark of the honourable member for Redlands about how they have crossed over, you can also remind yourself of the remark of Shakespeare, which was designed exactly for people like the honourable members opposite that the devil can quote scripture for his purpose. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123298"></A>
Let us have a look at what actually is happening here. The things they said would have moved me to tears had I not some more substantial grip on reality. This is the reality of the charges. In 2010-11 in Queensland, the cost of a five-year driver’s licence is $96.05. Compare that with every other continental state: in New South Wales, it is $151 compared to Queensland’s $96.05; in South Australia, $150; in Western Australia, $116; in the ACT, $145; and in Victoria, $158. Over a period of time, the Queensland driver’s licence will increase. By the year 2014-15, it will get to $152. That is what it is in New South Wales now. By then, it is likely that the driver’s licence cost in other states will have gone up and it will preserve Queensland’s position at the bottom of the pile of the continental states in terms of charges. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123299"></A>
So when you look at the relativities of it, the relativities of it put it in a completely different category from the ones that the honourable members on the other side were expatiating about. The horrors and the Scrooge-like Dickensian cruelty that they were attributing to the government are actually not happening. If you take a reality check--and that reality check is the figures that I have just read to you--it is not as they were suggesting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123300"></A>
We would expect that an opposition might want to oppose an increase in fees and charges. Obviously, it is good politics to oppose an increase in fees and charges. Obviously, you would not want to say, ‘Let’s put up fees and charges,’ or at least you would not want to be out there at the front saying that if you were the opposition, but if you were the opposition and a responsible opposition that gave some thought to your long-term credibility, you might want to provide some kind of rationale for your proposition that we should not put these charges up by this amount now. You might want to say, for example, why it was that you wanted to keep Queensland’s rates low in terms of this particular tax--unless of course you were going to give up taxing altogether. I do not think even the most extreme of the rhetoricians from the other side of the House--not even those who tore their hair and ranted and waved their arms in the air as they were arguing against any increase in these fees and charges--want to stop taxing everyone on everything. So they would have to be selective about what taxes they froze. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123302"></A>
They were saying they wanted to freeze this tax for some reason perhaps. Was that reason just because it was the tax that was in front of them at the moment? Surely they are not opportunistic like that! What was lacking from the opposition’s argument was any sort of rationale as to why these particular taxes should be frozen and, in cases like the instances I have just given, at a level lower than the rest of continental Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123303"></A>
A responsible opposition would have provided that kind of rationale. Let me ask a question: what benefit would there be at this particular turning point in history in keeping registration motoring costs generally so low that it artificially reduced the attractiveness of the alternative means of transport, which was public transport? How responsible would it be to adopt a policy that made it disadvantageous to choose the public transport option? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132832"></A>
What would a responsible government do? Would a responsible government give motoring its real actual cost--the cost that it would have on a level playing field--or would a responsible government do what members opposite are saying and artificially make public transport disadvantageous by putting all sorts of unrealistic brakes on the kinds of increases which are happening in other states to motoring? At this turning point in history when if we have not had peak oil we will have it soon, at this turning point in history when fuel shortages will be a reality very soon, at this turning point in history when we do not have infinite fuel available to us to run the internal combustion engines that we now have, it would be folly of the grossest kind to make it seem artificially that motoring was an easy option--because it is not. It is not an option that we can have sustainably forever at a cheaper rate than reality dictates. </Hansard-Body>

I would have thought that a good conservative opposition would take the attitude that the father of modern conservatism, Edmund Burke, took. I would recommend his thoughts to honourable members opposite because, if they are determined to be conservatives, they might as well be logically consistent ones. At the declaration of the poll in Bristol, Edmund Burke said that your representative owes you not just their diligence but also their judgement and they betray you, rather than serve you, if they abandon their judgement to suit short-term convenience. I would recommend those thoughts to honourable members opposite to come out as an opposition and say, ‘Yes, we support these price increases.’ It would be courageous for an opposition to come out and support these price increases. It would show judgement; it would show responsibility. However, given the limited reserves of these virtues that the honourable members opposite have, perhaps it is as well that they should conserve them for some more important occasion. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Toowoomba South--LNP) (9.12 pm): As motorists pay their increased registration and pay their 10c a litre extra on fuel and as they try to manage their household budgets with the ever rising costs of running their car, electricity, water, gas, stamp duties and everything else, I am sure the esoteric rumblings of the member for Murrumba and words like ‘vicissitudes’ and ‘farrago’ really come to mind as they endeavour to meet their weekly budgets in the working class suburbs of Brisbane. </Hansard-Body>

We on this side are a bit more pragmatic. We do recognise that people are struggling and that people, particularly those on low and fixed incomes, find that the longer the Labor government is in power, the harder it is to make ends meet. Tonight’s debate on this disallowance motion is all about the costs of running a vehicle. It might be nice to think that people can use public transport, but that costs money too and those costs go up all the time. However, most people need to get their kids to school or pick them up from school because of where their workplace is located or to drop the kids off at sport on the weekend and it is absolutely essential for modern life to have a car. </Hansard-Body>

Under this government we have gone from having the cheapest registration in Australia to now having the dearest registration in Australia. We were the only state that did not have a fuel tax, and after the deceit and the deception of the last election we now have a fuel tax. As the member for Indooroopilly pointed out, in the month of June we had the dearest fuel in Queensland. So all of our advantages of cheaper registration and cheaper fuel, which helped small business, which helped keep down the costs of freight--and every single item that goes into our supermarkets is delivered on the back of a truck--have dissipated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132841"></A>
We heard the member for Murrumba selectively talk about the comparisons between the cost of a driver’s licence in our state and other states. However, he did not mention the cost of registration or that just a couple of years ago this government jacked up the stamp duty on cars to such an extent that someone buying an old, second-hand Falcon worth about $16,000 would have to pay an extra $200 in rego. If a tradesman needs a LandCruiser ute to conduct their business or take heavy loads, that is going to cost them another $2,000. That adds to the cost of doing business or running their rural or city operation. </Hansard-Body>

This debate tonight is another chink in the armour of the Labor government as Queenslanders come to realise what has happened since 1998. The profligate spending, the waste, the disregard for proper control of costs, the billion dollar blow-out in the original cost of the western corridor recycled water pipeline, the hundreds of millions of dollars lost on the aborted dam at Traveston, the money lost on the blow-outs in prices on the Tugun bypass--the list goes on and on. The wastage has been obscene. That wastage is the wasting of precious taxpayers’ money. It is not the government’s money; it is the hard-earned money of the people of Queensland who have paid their taxes to the Commonwealth government. Some of that money then comes back here to the state. Those people are paying all their fees, levies, registration and charges. It is their hard- earned money that the government holds in trust and spends. That is the money that has been wasted by the hundreds of millions of dollars to the point where we are approaching a debt of $85 billion. What has the government planned to pay that off? Apart from selling off our state-owned assets--cashing them in--which bring in more income than the interest they will save, the government does not have a plan. Its plan is to just lose the election, walk away, take no responsibility for the $85 billion debt and leave it to someone else--the LNP--to manage because it is too big for them to manage. They have built it up and then they will just walk away and say, ‘Oh well. Blow it. We will leave that to someone else.’</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132846"></A>
There is no plan for the capital repayment. There is no plan for the payment of the interest. We have reached the disgraceful stage of being the only state in Australia that has lost its AAA rating. That costs us hundreds of millions of dollars a year in penalty interest over and above the normal interest that we have to pay on that massive and ever-growing debt. It is the people who pay. The government accumulates the debt and the people pay it off because the government, in effect, is the government of the people, but it is the people who are going to have to pay. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132847"></A>
That is why the sentiment, the anger and the angst during this federal election campaign in Queensland has been so strong against the Labor Party. People living anywhere in Australia know that the consequence of profligate, wasteful, disinterested control of the finances, of just throwing money around willy-nilly as though it grows on trees, is increases in the price of water, gas, electricity--basic things that every house needs and cannot do without--petrol and diesel, registration, cars and other charges that the government increases continuously, and it is the people who pay. They have to pay it every week. The people who are trying to put food on the table, trying to put the kids through school and trying to just survive and be good hardworking people in the suburbs and towns of Queensland are the ones who have to pay for this power grab by the Labor Party and its wanton waste and mismanagement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132848"></A>
Tonight’s debate has been all about the transport industry, the car industry and so forth, and there is another item that I want to bring forward. That is the massive increase that this government has put in place on the registration of B-doubles. Semitrailers have virtually been usurped by B-doubles and B-triples because they provide a more efficient and safer way of transporting goods on roads. As I said, almost everything that moves around Australia travels by truck. Honourable members only have to travel the Warrego Highway up to Toowoomba to see this. Every day 4,000 trucks, nearly all B-doubles, traverse our main street. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HORAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, 16 sets of traffic lights. I take that interjection. It is a disgrace that one of the very first things the Rudd government did when it came into government was rip out the $700 million that had been allocated for the Toowoomba bypass. It will be forever condemned in Toowoomba for that short-sighted and cruel action. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132885"></A>
The cost of registering a B-double annually is going to rise to $15,340. That is about $4,000 more than the registration for a double road train. It is $2,000 more than the registration for a triple road train. That means that people who have been running B-doubles, which are safe because they can brake more safely, can be driven at the legal speed limits on our highways and are far safer than a road train configuration or two trailers together, are going to tempted for sheer economic reasons to look at going back to the less safe system. I think that is not only a short-sighted move by the government but also one that could be quite dangerous. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132886"></A>
This government says that this was a national principle agreed through COAG. When this government is ruled and controlled by debt it is only too happy to accept when COAG says, ‘We should jack up the costs for registering a B-double.’ It makes business harder and harder. It means that people have to put up their freight rates. That hits the people who buy these goods in our shops. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132887"></A>
It is easy to find examples of this. We are talking about people who do the majority of the carting of the vegetables out of the Lockyer Valley and those who cart the cattle down to the meatworks in Dinmore or Brisbane or the Brisbane Valley which supplies the south-east corner. All their cartage costs in providing for our economy are going to go up. Not only will electricity, water and registration costs increase for low-income earners and everybody else; the cost of their food and essential items is going to go through the roof. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132890"></A>
That is what this debate is about tonight. In the budget debate the LNP has made a number of major policy announcements. These add to the ones we have already made. One of those was that we would freeze the cost of registration. The member for Murrumba said, ‘Why that?’ It is because of the arguments that we have put forward with regard to how important cars are to people and families in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132891"></A>
We know about the massive costs of motoring in Queensland imposed by this debt-struck Labor government. We know that families need to be able to afford to operate their cars. The transport industry needs to be able to afford to run its vehicles. That is the greatest thing we can do to keep costs down for average working families in Queensland. I give all my support to this disallowance motion moved by the shadow minister. It is about time Queensland got some relief from Labor’s costs. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (9.22 pm): I rise to support the disallowance motion on the Transport Legislation (Fees) Amendment Regulation (No. 1) 2010. I oppose this regulation not because we are going to have a federal election in a couple days and not because I need to justify the actions of the Liberal National Party or the ALP federally but because we have 78 pages of increased fees and charges to Queenslanders. There is no other reason. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132894"></A>
I think it was the member for Ipswich West--and I am sure he will correct me if I am wrong--who highlighted the fact that if this disallowance were successful there would be $63 million taken out of the budget and mostly from rural and regional Queenslanders. That is a lot of money out of the budget. But, more importantly, it is a lot of money for people to find in increased fees and charges. As other speakers have said, many of those charges relate to B-doubles and heavy transports. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132895"></A>
Over the years that I have been in this place we have seen a fairly constant change in the method of transportation used in Queensland. It used to be that most of our commodities--not bulk commodities but commodities in general--were transported by rail. Over time that has been diminished so that only bulk commodities, such as coal, were encouraged to be transported by rail. All of our foodstuffs, grains and animals are transported on our roads. The increases that are proposed in this regulation will significantly increase the cost to transport vehicle operators. It is a concern because that is passed on to consumers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132896"></A>
There were a couple of comments made by members in the chamber that I want to comment on. Some would have been recorded by <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
 and some would not have been. The member for, I believe, Morayfield made a comment when the member for Gaven was speaking. The member for Gaven was talking about the removal of the fuel tax. The member for Morayfield--and he has only been in here this term--said that Howard introduced it. I am concerned to hear that because it is misinformation and a misunderstanding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132897"></A>
The fact is that nobody changed, per se, the status of any of the states in relation to fuel tax. It was determined by the Federal Court that the allocation of fuel tax by the states was ultra vires--that is, it was outside their legal ability. That meant that the federal government then had to levy taxes on fuel and tobacco. Queensland was the only state, I believe, that did not have a fuel tax. Therefore, the fuel rebate in Queensland was a recognition of the fact that Queensland did not have a fuel tax. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132898"></A>
The angst, I guess, for voters in Queensland was that we had no fuel tax and we had a rebate to recognise that. The state Labor government went to an election and said that that rebate would remain and straight after the election removed the rebate, effectively making us a fuel-tax state. So John Howard did not do anything about the fuel tax. He was merely a facilitator to ensure that the Federal Court decision was appropriately administered. It was this state Labor government that removed the rebate and effectively made Queensland a state that levied a fuel tax. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132900"></A>
I think it is important that we remember that in the south-east corner there is significant, sound and well-subsidised public transport infrastructure. I think people in my electorate, in the electorate of Nicklin, in the electorate of Nanango, in the electorate of Maryborough, in the electorate Mount Isa--indeed in any of the country electorates--would love to have a public transport system such as the one that is in the south-east corner, but we do not. We do not have buses or trains that can carry us to all of the services that we need. We need vehicles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132902"></A>
Any increase in the cost of running a vehicle for individual members of the community or any increase in the cost of running a bus or truck is a direct cost to us as individuals. We live in a diversified state. All of those costs add to our cost of living. These 78 pages of increased costs are going to add to the cost of living for families in this very diversified state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132903"></A>
If people live in Brisbane they could probably do without a car, providing they were very organised and were able to catch a train or bus to do their shopping, to attend medical appointments or to do school runs. I lived down here for my last year or so of high school and I caught a train to school. People who live in Gladstone cannot catch a train to school. Indeed, in some areas they cannot catch a bus to school. They have to have their parents or a car pool arrangement to take them there. These increased costs will add to the cost of living. </Hansard-Body>

 I am supporting the disallowance motion simply because this will add to the cost of living for families in our communities. If you live in the south-east corner the impact is probably less, unless of course you drive a truck or some kind of heavy vehicle. If you live in rural and regional Queensland, these costs will impact. There are also increases in the cost of shipping. There are also increases in the cost of access to the ports of Gladstone and further north such as Weipa and other places, and I would acknowledge that the commercial entities are probably better able to absorb those costs. The cost of piloting is going up according to this amendment regulation. All of these 78 pages of regulation changes will add to the cost of living, particularly for those people in rural and regional Queensland who have no other alternative but to run their own vehicle.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132951"></A>
Mention was also made about CTP insurance and the $24 rebate to Queenslanders. I am not going to comment any further than that because there is a bill before the House, but from my perspective and from the perspective of people in my community we are very sensitive to price increases. These fees are not the only ones that are going up. Electricity has gone up. We have already had debates about that. The cost of water is going up. Rates are going up. It needs to be recognised that the cost of living of families in Queensland is not isolated to each individual item. It is an aggregation of items. It is the cost of living in relation to motor vehicles, to trucks, to food, to water, to electricity. It is a cost impost on families who are finding it very difficult to survive, and it is on that basis that I support the disallowance motion.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. RG NOLAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport) (9.31 pm): This is a motion to disallow Transport Legislation (Fees) Amendment Regulation (No. 1) 2010. Should this motion be passed, the fees that would be disallowed cover tow truck licences, smart card licences, the annual levy for marina berths which are calculated by length, operating a commercial ship as a ferry service, operating a commercial ship to transport goods, personal watercraft licences, recreational marine licences, taxi service licences, limousine service licences, driver authorisation for taxi or limousine, the annual taxi industry security levy which goes towards the security cameras that exist in taxis, and vehicle registration.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132956"></A>
It is, as such, a far more comprehensive regulation than has been widely acknowledged in this debate. At the outset the member for Maroochydore made the point that she had no choice but to disallow all of the provisions within the regulation. This quite simply is not the case. Section 50(1) of the Statutory Instruments Act 1992 provides that the Legislative Assembly may pass a resolution disallowing subordinate legislation--that is, a disallowance motion may be brought. But section 50(5) of the Statutory Instruments Act defines subordinate legislation to include--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1132961"></A>
a provision of subordinate legislation.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132962"></A>
As such, the proposition that has been put to the House by the member for Maroochydore that all of the fees and charges which I just outlined must, by definition, be disallowed in an attempt to disallow certain provisions of the regulation is quite simply not true. Therefore, this disallowance motion is quite simply flawed from the outset because the motion which has been moved does not in fact reflect what the member for Maroochydore claims to the House was her intention. There is a fundamental flaw at the heart of this motion.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132963"></A>
Nonetheless, I think it would be generous of the House to apply the principle of charitable interpretation. Because the member for Maroochydore was unable to bring forward a motion that did what she said she intended to do, let us in this debate discuss what it is that the member for Maroochydore said rather than what exactly the member for Maroochydore did. The member for Maroochydore in speaking to the motion which she put forward made two arguments. She argued that she wished--not that she did--to disallow the provision which related to heavy vehicle registration because she thought, and the member for Toowoomba South argued along similar lines, that changes in heavy vehicle registration fees were unfair and in particular she thought that some of the variances between different kinds of heavy vehicles would lead to distortions in the freight market. The second point that the member for Maroochydore argued was that she wished to implement an LNP policy to freeze ordinary vehicle registration charges for a period of three years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132964"></A>
Let me deal with heavy vehicle registration charges first. Members should be aware that it is the case that in Queensland heavy vehicle registration charges went up from 1 July. However, members should also understand that Queensland is a signatory to a national scheme whereby truck registration is consistent across every state in this country. Why is that? The freight industry, as everyone would expect, operates across state borders. The trucks that start at Hoepners in Ipswich or at Nolan’s at Gatton, as the member for Lockyer said, travel to Sydney and to Melbourne and to Adelaide and sometimes to Perth. So the first principle is that for heavy vehicles there is a consistent national scheme of registration charging.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132967"></A>
How would things work if there was not a consistent national scheme? Of course what would happen if there was not national consistency for heavy vehicle registration is that from year to year all of the heavy vehicles being mobile would register in the state with the lowest charge. It would be like the Panamanian registered ships--that is, all of the heavy vehicles would be registered in one place. If one state had its budget first and then the next state undercut its heavy vehicle registration charge, that state would lose all of the heavy vehicle contribution to that state’s roads. When you have a heavy vehicle industry that operates across state borders, it is quite simply for obvious reasons necessary to have a consistent national charging regime.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132969"></A>
The second point that I believe the House should understand is that the heavy vehicle registration regime we have in this country, not just in this state, operates on the principle that trucks pay for the damage they do to the roads. So it is the case that in the last national agreement B-double trucks changed to a different extent than did different kinds of heavy vehicles, but that was because there has been extensive research undertaken at a national level which showed that the existing relativities were not right and that B-doubles were not paying the full cost of their damage to the roads. I thought the member for Gladstone made an interesting point. She argued the case for rail freight, and I entirely agree with her. I think that in this country what we should see is more rail freight wherever practical. But we cannot get that if the trucks are not paying for their damage to the roads, because if the trucks are not paying for their damage to the roads that means that taxpayers and other motorists are subsidising the trucks and that the trucks are being unfairly advantaged in relation to rail freight. So this charge ensures the integrity of the national regime and, in so doing, ensures national consistency so that there is the same registration charge from state to state. It also ensures that the trucks pay for the real cost of their damage to the roads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133001"></A>
The second point that the member for Maroochydore argued was that it was LNP policy to freeze the cost of car registration for the term of a future LNP government. I am the member for Ipswich. I understand, I reckon much better than the member for Maroochydore or the member for Indooroopilly, who has just lectured this House, what it is to represent people who in many cases struggle to make their budgets meet day to day. I understand what it is to represent people who genuinely add up the pennies every day and every week. I also listen very closely to my constituents when they tell me what they need to get by and one of the things that they say is that they need better roads so that they can drive to work in a job which in many cases is part of the state government’s building program, which enables them to make a living. </Hansard-Body>

The LNP brought to the House a completely unfunded policy proposition. The LNP walked in here tonight and said, ‘We have this policy and we are going to freeze registration.’ Does any member here recall in this debate tonight the LNP telling us how much this policy would cost?</Hansard-Body>

Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No. They came in here tonight, as usual, with a whacking great unfunded promise. They have done it on the day that Tony Abbott walked away from his own election costings. What happened today in the federal campaign? The LNP at a national level brought down its financial costings for the campaign and Tony Abbott did not even front up to the press conference. What happened in here today? On the day that Tony Abbott walked away from his election costings the LNP in Queensland did not even bother to try to produce theirs. They came in here with a hundreds of millions of dollars commitment and they did not even bother to put a figure on it. What kind of economic management is it to walk in here with a funding promise that would cost hundreds of millions of dollars, a funding promise that is not new, that was originally made in the budget some months ago, and not even bother to try to put a figure on it? That is economic ineptitude of the highest order. It is typical of what we see out of the well-funded, well-resourced but completely lazy and intellectually bereft opposition. It is what we see in this place every day of the week. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133007"></A>
What was the smoking gun that the member for Maroochydore brought to the table? She trotted in here and put on the table a letter that was released, to my recollection, in the election campaign--a year and a half ago--that said, shock horror, the registration money is going to go into the Consolidated Fund. Golly! Do you know what? Every year in Queensland we spend about twice as much on roads as we collect out of registration. Should we adhere to the principle that the member for Maroochydore would appear to advocate--that there has to be a direct correlation between registration collection and roads spending--Queensland’s road budget would halve. This year in Queensland this government will spend $732.39 per person on better roads for my constituents and yours. New South Wales will spend $382. Victoria will spend $205, and Western Australia--a state much bigger than this one--will spend $227. I understand that people save this money, but this money goes into better roads for Queenslanders. What the LNP has done is come in here with a hundreds of millions of dollars commitment that it has not even bothered to cost. <Hansard-Speech-End>

When I was quite a little girl I watched my father take the wheel off a vehicle. He had a red tin with grease in it.

Mr CHOI</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Capalaba--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.56 pm): A couple of weeks ago I was pleased to take part in the Shared Visions forum held recently in the Redlands. This was the second of 20 forums to be held around the state. The Shared Visions forums present an opportunity for people to have their say in shaping this government’s 10-year plan for supporting Queenslanders with a disability. The Bligh government’s vision is for a community where people of all abilities can participate and contribute, feel valued, follow their dreams and live the kind of life many of us take for granted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1138235"></A>
The plan sets out 10 priorities, followed by a number of key strategies needed to help us get us there. Shared Visions forums have a tradition of positive, passionate and insightful discussion about where we should be headed. The Redlands forum was no exception. People with a disability face challenges every day, whether it is going to school or the playground, looking for training and jobs, deciding where to live, playing sport or going for a meal with friends. However, this government plans for the future. While some strategies can be implemented within three years, others are more ambitious and will need longer action over the life of the 10-year plan and beyond.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1138236"></A>
The plan will build on what is already happening and has already attracted a record investment in disability services in Queensland. On 2 June the Premier and the Minister for Disability Services announced that the combined Commonwealth and state budget would deliver a record over $1 billion for specialist disability services for the coming financial year. This is the first time the Disability Services budget has topped $1 billion. It represents an increase of more than 13 per cent on last year. A new $12.5 million package of recurrent funding for the new financial year will support a suite of early intervention initiatives for people with a disability, their families and carers. The 10-year plan will allow us to focus the funding so that more people with a disability have fairer access to services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1138237"></A>
I would briefly like to touch on the state government’s report titled <Hansard-Italic>
Building bright futures: an action plan for children with a disability--birth to eight years</Hansard-Italic>
. The first eight years is such an important time for children with a disability and their families. We are determined to ensure that families are able to access supports and services in order to ensure their children achieve their full potential. That is why I was pleased to join disability services minister Annastacia Palaszczuk when she announced $30,000 in state government funding for the Horizon Foundation in Capalaba. The program offers children aged zero to five years with specialised play sessions to help them learn. This unique program recognises the strengths of family relationships and the importance of informal support networks. I encourage Queenslanders to get involved in the Shared Visions forums being held across the state. We will be listening to your ideas about how to create stronger communities and to achieve our shared vision.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (9.59 pm): Much has been said about the weekend that Splendour in the Grass hit Woodford. I will be honest and admit that I am not really into Wolfmother and certainly I have not signed up to the Scissor Sisters’ fan club. However, I was disappointed that I missed out on tickets to hear artists such as Florence and the Machine, Clare Bowditch and Megan Washington, not to mention Paul Kelly and the band currently on constant replay in my car, Mumford &amp; Sons. There is no denying the festival was a massive success at its new, albeit temporary, home. However, it is not without some difficulties for locals. Quite frankly, despite the annual Woodford Folk and Dreaming Festivals, Woodford was not prepared for the enormous influx of Splendour ticket holders. To be honest, the uncertainty surrounding a festival of this scale was reflected in the conversations I had with locals in the lead-up to Splendour. I remember being at the Woodford Show in June, talking to the Woodford Show Society President, Doug Chicken, about his concerns. Locals’ fears appeared to be confirmed when many parents could not get through to their schoolkids on the Thursday afternoon, because the D’Aguilar Highway had turned into a car park.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1143314"></A>
But Woodford embraced Splendour in the Grass and the verdict is nothing but positive. The catchcry going around town is ‘See you next year, Splendour.’ Much of that has to do with the countless volunteers who kept up spirits in and around Woodford. Many volunteers gave up their valuable time, but I will mention just a few. Firstly, from the Woodford Show Society, Barry and Margaret Ferris, Peter and Bobbie Winkel and Ron Trim are incredible people who welcomed the Splendour campers with open arms, providing comfort and, at times, some much needed support to stranded young campers. Exhausted from being on and off their feet for the entire duration--Barry and Margaret actually camped on the floor of the show secretary’s office--not once did they complain. Instead, they enjoyed the experience of exchanging stories with the travellers, administering first aid to festival goers and learning new-age art from a talented young Scottish girl. They even got to know who some of the current artists are, even if they are scratching their heads or stifling a laugh at the more outrageous names. Ron described the guests as ‘a bunch of great kids’ and, in return, the campers showed nothing but respect to the Show Society people. All up, the Show Society is happy to have the campers back next year; it just needs to make a few adjustments to the facilities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1143315"></A>
I also mention Councillor Adrian Raedel, his partner Kerri and Sergeant Jason Renwick of the Woodford police. Adrian and Jason spent the better part of four days responding to complaints about traffic and noise, as well as dealing with the logistical issues associated with tens of thousands of camping festival goers. In Adrian’s case, that was on top of his normal duties across division 12, which is one of the largest divisions in the local government authority. He and Kerri even found time to help the Woodford scouts with their manically busy barbecues. Until till next year, Splendour--and this time I am getting some tickets! <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Waterford--ALP) (10.02 pm): Sometimes as politicians we spend much of our time resolving constituent queries and working with local community groups and do not get an opportunity to research and consider some of the big issues facing Queensland in the future. Over recent years I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with a number of young Queenslanders through the Queensland Parliamentary Internship Program.

 Parliamentary research report by Jamie Nuich, titled ‘Looks like a child, acts like a child, treated like an adult: human rights implications of the pre-adjudication treatment of seventeen year olds in Queensland’ [<HypertextLink>
<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=5310T2780" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL">2780</A></HypertextLink>
]. </Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1143323"></A>
Jamie’s report analyses the treatment of 17-year-olds under Queensland criminal laws compared with that of their younger counterparts under the Youth Justice Act 1992 in the context that the international human rights framework requires both groups to be treated as children. The Children’s Services Act 1965 first established the definition of child for the purposes of youth justice as being 17 years. In 1988, the Kennedy review of Queensland Corrective Services roundly criticised Queensland’s juvenile justice system. In 1990, the Convention on the Rights of the Child provided rights for children and defined children as persons under the age of 18 years. Even though Australia is a signatory to that convention, Queensland law continues to treat 17-year-olds as adults when it comes to arrest, prosecution, remand and release, and sentencing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1143326"></A>
Jamie’s report is an informative and objective look at an important issue for Queensland’s justice system. Unfortunately, the political debate around juvenile justice has not been so informed or objective. The LNP and its predecessors have never stepped back from using young people as political fodder in law and order campaigns. We need to make sure that we can be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime. That means we need to take another look at whether 17-year-olds, who are in grade 12 now and in a few years time will be in grade 11, should continue to be treated as adults in our justice system and in our prisons. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (10.05 pm): Tonight I rise to bring to the attention of the House the appalling lack of safety for workers and motorists during the M1 upgrade from the Nerang South interchange to the Gooding Drive interchange. The minister has publicly stated that temporary concrete safety barriers would be installed for the safety of roadworkers by December 2009, when the widening of the M1 was to commence. Since work has commenced, a large and deep ‘V’ has been cut between the north and southbound lanes which fills with water when it rains. Whilst some of the barriers are in place on the southern lanes to stop them falling perpendicular into a ditch filled with water, there are none on the northbound stretch. Motorists have only a small margin for error. If you are unfortunate enough to be in an accident, you may find yourself drowning in the ditch before emergency services have had time to free you. Emergency services, particularly the fire brigade, have expressed their concerns about having to cut a motorist out of a car with water swirling around them and that it would be nigh impossible to treat a patient who had to remain in the car in the case of spinal injuries, let alone have to cope with the prospect of drowning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1143330"></A>
Since the commencement of construction works, there have been six accidents along this stretch of road. Some of those have been due to motorists having to avoid huge potholes in the road which are caused by the extreme weather we have been experiencing on the Gold Coast. Only last Friday I personally had to swerve from the outside lane into the inside lane northbound to avoid a pothole. Luckily for me, there was no-one in the other lane. However, I witnessed the driver of the car behind me do the same manoeuvre and almost sideswipe the car in the next lane. Only half an hour later there was a major accident on this stretch of road, between exits 77 and 75 northbound. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1143331"></A>
Compounding the issue is commuter arrogance and a total disregard for the safety of workers and motorists in this construction zone. Motorists, particularly semitrailer and B-double drivers, are ignoring the 80 kilometre per hour roadworks speed limit that has been posted whilst construction takes place and are being clocked travelling at well over 100 kilometres per hour. The lanes are very narrow and, with a truck passing you at 100 kilometres per hour, you can be literally buffeted off the small road shoulder. Countless numbers of residents and even my own staff have experienced this and been quite frightened by the ordeal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1143332"></A>
As the newly dubbed ‘member for the M1’, thanks to the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
, I call on the Minister for Main Roads to keep his promise of installing safety barriers along the north and southbound lanes immediately. Statistics released recently show a dramatic increase in the number of motorists slowing down substantially in areas with fixed speed cameras. The number of offences has decreased by 78 per cent in Southport and 41 per cent in Broadbeach. That is not about revenue raising--and I am pleased that both ministers are in the House tonight--but it is about protecting the lives of roadworkers and motorists alike. I call on the Minister for Police to install a fixed speed camera for the duration of the roadworks to prevent further accidents. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Redcliffe--ALP) (10.07 pm): There was a buzz at the Youth Space on Saturday night as 80 young people mingled with myself, the member for Petrie, Yvette D’Ath, Moreton Bay Regional Councillors Rae Frawley and James Houghton, Youth Space President Kelly Clancy and Vice-President Sarah McCartney, manager Jarryd Williams, staff member Ben Vanovic and Chameleon Community Housing Manager Carmel Reithmuller over cocktails and canapes as we answered the questions young people wanted to ask on issues important to them. This Youth Fusion Summit dinner was the culmination of a two-year youth engagement project funded to the tune of $40,000 through the Bligh government’s Youth Engagement program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1143338"></A>
Resident youth caterers, Connections Catering, provided a fabulous meal to enjoy while the young people fired questions at representatives from all levels of government over issues dear to their hearts. Those included immigration and race discrimination issues, religion, transport, homelessness and housing, and youth participation in government. The questions were posed in a positive spirit, with young people listening actively and displaying a refreshingly mature attitude on all issues. Many of those young people had been homeless for many years and have worked towards tertiary education through Queensland government funded flexischools and youth services and have gained employment after participating in the Bligh government’s Skilling Queenslanders for Work and Green Army programs. The outcome of the evening was an agreement to come together to discuss the current important issues every six months. It is great to see that the youth services the Bligh government has put in place to support young people are enabling them to resolve their issues and move ahead to a meaningful and productive adulthood. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148466"></A>
The Youth Engagement programs are an effective way for the Bligh government to listen to young people in Redcliffe and right across Queensland. It is one more strand in the Bligh government’s Toward Q2 plan to build strong communities, because the Youth Engagement grants enable young people to know they are listened to and they enable this Labor government to design responsive services for young people who become disengaged because of earlier life experiences. An effective, caring government is about allowing people to grow and shine, and that is what the Bligh government is all about--building strong relationships, healing families and allowing young people to grow into stable, responsible adults with a healthy outlook. That is a record the Bligh government is proud of. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148469"></A>
To support these programs, it is vital that the federal Labor government is re-elected because the opposition intends to slash and burn if it is elected so it can have a black bottom line on its budget sheet. The Gillard federal government will ensure two levels of government working together will produce a better community for our youth, for all Queenslanders and for Australians.</Hansard-Body>

Water Charges</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr BLEIJIE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kawana--LNP) (10.10 pm): I have received numerous complaints from constituents in my electorate relating to an increase in water charges imposed on them as a result of actions undertaken by the Bligh Labor government. The outrageous charges have added even further pressure and burden on many household budgets because this Labor government is a crisis driven government that is always on the back foot. The wasteful spending on the $7 billion South-East Queensland water grid, including the hundreds of millions of dollars wasted on the scrapped Traveston Dam project, has ensured that Queenslanders are paying more--a lot more--for their water. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148474"></A>
Individual councils were initially responsible for local water infrastructure and distribution until the state government requisitioned them in what some described as ‘the great water swindle’. In legislation that was passed earlier this year, three new bodies were created for water distribution in South-East Queensland. Unitywater was established as the water distribution authority for the Sunshine Coast and Moreton Bay Regional Council areas. I have written to the CEO of Unitywater, Mr Jon Black, to ascertain a breakdown of the associated set-up costs and how these have impacted on consumers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148477"></A>
The Bligh Labor government has positioned itself to escape the blame for the higher water charges and continues to play the buck-passing game rather than own up to Queenslanders. While Unitywater staff and management cop the abuse from a hostile public, the state has washed its hands of the mess it created. The accounts that have been distributed contain a charge for bulk water, a state government charge to recoup some of the costs involved in wasteful spending initiatives. People are certainly going to have to be far more frugal than they once were and make use of water-saving initiatives such as water tanks, greywater and other water-saving mechanisms. I would also encourage people to keep an eye on any suspected water leaks because any misused water will be felt very hard in the hip pocket.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148478"></A>
Community groups and organisations have received massive hikes in their water costs and for some it will simply mean the end of operation. Businesses, and in particular small businesses, have also been slugged with increased charges. While some may not be able to absorb them, the costs will end up being passed on to consumers, meaning it is a double-dip charge. All of this indicates that this increase in charges can be best described as a great big new tax on everything. My concern is how this will impact on the cost of living expenses for my constituents. Many people are under pressure already and those on fixed incomes such as pensioners will be the hardest hit, which is often the case with Labor governments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148479"></A>
The system was fine until the Beattie and Bligh Labor governments got their grubby hands on the water. I call on the Bligh government to end the wasteful spending and look at any measures it can implement to encourage residents to purchase water tanks and other water-saving mechanisms. The federal Labor government has been just as bad as our state Labor government since it took office in 2007. Between the December quarter 2007 and the June quarter 2010, the cost of living has continually risen under federal Labor. One thing Queenslanders can do to stamp their disapproval at these cost of living increases is to vote for Tony Abbott and the coalition on Saturday. Is it any wonder a gentleman at the people’s forum tonight asked a question along these lines: ‘Prime Minister, how can we trust federal Labor when we have been so let down by state Labor?’ </Hansard-Body>

Attendance records were broken as 22,000 people flocked to the show. This was 106 years of bringing the country to the city, 106 years of sideshows, great music and performance artists, choirs, terrifying rides and outstanding exhibits. This was 106 years of bringing excitement, education and entertainment to the children and citizens of Pine Rivers. The 2010 Pine Rivers Show was bigger and better than ever. Ashton’s Circus appeared this year. The famous KAOS Motorbikes returned with not one but two backflip stunt riders, and there were fireworks. The ever-exciting pig racing was not to be missed. The Education Pavilion featured all of the school displays as well as the hotly contested colouring-in competition. This year saw the Pine Rivers High School F1 racing cars with their interactive demonstration; this was an amazing demonstration of speed and engineering. </Hansard-Body>

I congratulate the show committee for an outstanding effort year after year. I especially mention secretary Toni Gilliland, who not only helps produce a great show but is also the President of the Pine Rivers Junior Rugby League Football Club, the mighty Bears. It just goes to show that the old adage that if you need something done give it to a busy person is just as true these days, with Toni being a perfect example.</Hansard-Body>

The Pine Rivers Show committee has been innovative in keeping attendance high. It has developed a system of sponsorship which enables primary school children in free if they are accompanied by a paying adult. One of the sponsorship opportunities is to sponsor a piglet in the piglet races. I hasten to point out that these races are short and through a gentle maze with a reward for all piglets at the end of the race. As a proud farmer’s daughter, I was delighted to take up the sponsorship of a piglet for the last two shows. I am very happy to be able to advise the House that my piglet won the most races this year. This means I am the recipient of a handsome trophy proclaiming that I am the owner of the champion pig of 2010. As I said, I was delighted to sponsor the show, and this has led to me receiving my first ever trophy. So my sincere thanks go to the appropriately named MP Automotive Repairs of Petrie for its generous support of the show and for providing the trophy.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1148486"></A>
I commend the show society and all the volunteers who work so hard to bring us the show every year. I will be back next year with pleasure. I would also like to thank members Murray Watt and Carolyn Male, Senator Mark Furner, the candidate for Dickson, Fiona McNamara, and their staff and supporters for their assistance at our very popular stall. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr DOWLING </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Redlands--LNP) (10.15 pm): Tonight I wish to raise with the Minister for Main Roads an issue in Redlands, and I am pleased to see he is in the House tonight. There are three intersections where roadworks have been promised and are certainly long overdue. These are the upgrades at the intersections at Beveridge Road, Ziegenfusz Road and Dinwoodie Road along Cleveland-Redland Bay Road between Cleveland and Victoria Point. They are roadworks that were promised at the previous election and each year before that, and they are long overdue. I have sat in this House and I have listened to the minister waxing lyrical in his ministerial statements that there are roadworks signs everywhere--roadworks here, roadworks there, signs everywhere you go. He is a fantastic performer in the House but can I tell the minister that there are no roadworks signs in Redlands. There are no roadworks signs in Redlands for two reasons. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Mr Speaker, I rise to a point of order. The honourable member is deliberately misleading the House. There are millions of dollars worth of roadworks in Redlands. He is offensive and he is misleading the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148500"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Order! I would say to the honourable minister that it is wrong to accuse somebody of deliberately misleading the House. There is a convention that you cannot accuse the member of that. However, if you feel that the member has taken action against you personally, then you can seek the retraction, but I ask you to withdraw the fact that you believe he has deliberately misled the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148501"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Speaker. I find those comments offensive and I ask the honourable member to withdraw.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DOWLING:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I withdraw, but there are no roadworks signs at the three intersections named--at Beveridge, Ziegenfusz and Dinwoodie roads--and I would be more than happy to show the minister that part of town and show him that the signs are clearly not there. These roadworks were due to commence about a year ago, but there were problems with tree offsets. It is almost like an episode of <Hansard-Italic>
Yes, Minister</Hansard-Italic>
, where there were two departments that could not work together and could not manage to work this program. The tree offsets were agreed and everything should have been done and dusted. They had let contracts and they have had to let those contracts lapse. They are now redoing tenders so that these roadworks can finally commence. I am hoping and praying that those roadworks will actually commence in September/October this year and be finalised about five years later than they should have been. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148541"></A>
This situation is a complete disaster. It is a complete mess. It is a dysfunctional department that has oversight of this. Clearly, there are two departments warring with each other. Someone needs to wake up to the fact that when roadworks are carried out trees are going to come down and the offsets are going to occur. It is not that hard. It certainly should not hold up the project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148545"></A>
There are three schools located near these three intersections. They are Faith Lutheran, Carmel College and Bay View State School. The three principals are concerned that these roadworks are being delayed for far too long and those three principals, Anthony Mueller, Berenice McLellan and Peter Black, are all concerned at the delays caused by this government and the impacts they have had on these school communities. These three intersections are incredibly dangerous. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DOWLING:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I withdraw the statement. There is only one thing that I worry about, and that is the phone call that will come one day saying that one of my children has been hurt or one of the students at one of those schools has been hurt at one of those intersections. Will the minister accept responsibility for the safety of those students? </Hansard-Body>

Mr PITT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mulgrave--ALP) (10.21 pm): In 2007 cardiovascular disease was the primary cause of death for over 46,000 Australians, representing one-third of all deaths that year. Despite major gains over the last 40 years, there is still a 50 per cent chance of a person dying with their first heart attack. Cardiovascular disease continues to have a major effect on the health of Australians. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148567"></A>
For the last three weeks local patients have been able to have their heart procedures at the Cairns Base Hospital thanks to a $4.18 million investment by the Bligh government in the new cardiac catheter laboratory. Around 80 per cent of all local angioplasty patients will now be able to undergo their procedure close to home, without the need to travel to Townsville or Brisbane. However, it is not possible for the government to fund every piece of equipment. This is where organisations like the Far North Queensland Hospital Foundation are so valuable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148569"></A>
The foundation is a not-for-profit charity that works tirelessly on behalf of our community to assist the activities and services of the Cairns Base Hospital and the Cairns and Hinterland Health Service District. The Yellow Pages Cardiac Challenge is the foundation’s largest fundraising event--a three-day, 335-kilometre cycling event from Cairns to Cooktown. Since it began in 2007, the ride has raised more than $400,000 to assist with the purchase of state-of-the-art equipment and provide support services for the patients and staff. The foundation is hoping to raise in excess of $250,000 from this year’s Cardiac Challenge to fund more cardiac equipment at the Cairns Base Hospital. Coordinator Glenys Duncombe is to be congratulated on her ongoing efforts.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148572"></A>
In previous years I have led the Cardiac Challenge as it left from Cazalys, Mulgrave Road, only to farewell the riders at Smithfield. But for 2010 I have taken up the challenge to ride the whole distance and have convinced my friend and colleague the member for Barron River, Steve Wettenhall, to join me. ‘Pittenhall Pedalling Pollies’, as our team is known, has been gearing up for the event, taking any spare opportunity to get in a training ride. I must thank my wife, Kerry, for agreeing to come along as our support team. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148574"></A>
Last year the ride attracted more than 175 riders. Registration for the 2010 ride has exceeded expectations, with 264 people registered. This is well above the 225 rider target. With this number of riders now in training on our region’s roads, I ask that motorists take extra care. Last month the founder of the Cardiac Challenge, Peter McNally, was knocked from his bike. Peter had open heart surgery in 2003 and wanted to give back to the community. This bike ride is his way of helping others who also have heart problems. Peter’s accident is a reminder that all cyclists are vulnerable on the road, regardless of their experience.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148576"></A>
Raising money for our Cairns Base Hospital Cardiac Unit is a great cause. To date, more than $132,000 has been raised and with 37 days, seven hours and 10 minutes to go until the start of the ride I hope people will take the time to get behind the ride before it kicks off on 25 September. Fundraising from this bike ride will help us improve the odds for heart patients in the Far North. <Hansard-Speech-End>
