Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.34 am): Last week when the inspiring Dimity Dornan was named Suncorp Queenslander of the Year she responded with a comment that would move even the hardest of hearts. Ms Dornan, a renowned speech pathologist and founder of the Hear and Say Centre which has given the gift of sound to hundreds of children, said, ‘If you’ve ever seen a child’s face when they hear for the first time, it is impossible to deprive them or their family of that.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998465"></A>
Our government is listening and that is reflected in our funding of this very special sector in yesterday’s state budget. Every Queensland child who needs dual cochlear implants will now receive them under our new initiative and the remarkable Hear and Say Centre will also receive a significant financial boost. Our government will contribute an extra $5.5 million this financial year, amounting to $16.5 million over the next four years, to double the number of paediatric cochlear implants available for Queensland kids and to expand children’s hearing services. We will do this by allocating $2.46 million of that funding to the Hear and Say Centre to continue its groundbreaking work with hearing impaired children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998476"></A>
The Hear and Say Centre is one of the world’s leading cochlear implant centres, giving vital assistance to infants and children whose hearing problems affect their fundamental ability to communicate. Around 300 children are identified with hearing problems in Queensland every year and around 60 to 100 children will go on to need hearing aids or cochlear implants. We know that early detection and intervention of hearing loss is critical to giving our kids the best start in life and the work that this centre does gives Queensland children every opportunity to get the best out of their education and support as they get older. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998485"></A>
Of the children with a cochlear implant who use the centre’s services, 97 per cent to 99 per cent are able to participate in mainstream schooling by the age of five. This new funding means 66 Queensland kids will be able to access a full package of auditory-verbal support through the Hear and Say Centre. Now that we have universal screening for children and cochlear technology is so good, we have more and more parents wanting to give their kids the best start. We know that dual cochlear implants work even better than a single one where appropriate. This funding guarantees that every child who needs single or dual implants will get them as well as enable us to provide them with the ongoing support and therapy that is needed. Additionally, $2 million in funding will go to the centre for capital investment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998496"></A>
This package means that Queensland now has the nation’s most comprehensive cochlear program. Our government’s groundbreaking universal newborn screening program is a major investment in our children’s future. Since its inception in 2004 the program has screened more than 279,000 newborn babies, some as young as six hours old. More than 98 per cent of Queensland children are now screened within 30 days of birth. This allows us to provide cochlear implants or hearing services for those children who need them from the earliest age.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998505"></A>
Just seven years ago only one child under the age of three months was fitted with hearing aids. Thanks to our Healthy Hearing program, by 2008 there were 34 children under three months who had been identified and fitted with hearing aids and a further 34 were fitted by 12 months of age. This funding will double the number of publicly funded cochlear implants in 2010-11 and provide for additional implants every year after that. What it means is that in the forecasting no child will be put on a paediatric waiting list for cochlear implant surgery.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998516"></A>
I was very pleased to be joined by the Deputy Premier and the Treasurer this morning on a visit to the Hear and Say Centre and to meet with mums and dads whose children are experiencing the benefits of this technology and who are actively being supported with speech and auditory therapy from the Hear and Say Centre. I look forward to seeing that centre go from strength to strength with the services it is providing to children. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.38 am): At the height of the global financial crisis our government established a jobs squad made up of industry, business, academia, social services, unions and public sector leaders. The task of the members of the jobs squad was to provide inside information on their own sectors of the economy and provide expert advice on how to protect jobs in the most difficult of circumstances. As the worst economic crisis the world had seen in nearly a century bore down on Queensland, our focus first and foremost was on protecting and creating jobs. We are not out of the woods yet, but we are seeing major signs of recovery and strong employment growth.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000817"></A>
In many ways it is a sign of how far we have come in the past 12 months that we are now seeing a rapidly growing demand for skills in key industries such as the fledgling liquefied natural gas industry. Our government is committed to ensuring that Queenslanders have the skills they need to harness our state’s bright future for themselves and their families. That is why today I am pleased to provide further details of our announcement yesterday to create a new industry-led statutory authority to drive training, investment and skills reform in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000820"></A>
Skills Queensland will bring together industry leaders to direct government investment in skills and workforce development, and to advise of reform in the vocational educational and training system. This new body will develop vocational training and labour market programs and plan priorities for skilled migration into Queensland. It will provide training plans for emerging industries and effective responses to critical events such as the closure or downsizing of major employers. Skills Queensland will include industry leaders, plus the relevant directors-general from both the education and training and employment departments. An interim steering committee will be established to ensure that the new body can hit the decks running when it commences operations at the end of the year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000821"></A>
Our government believes that during periods of growth we should give Queenslanders every chance possible to take advantage of that opportunity. That means our vocational and training systems need to respond quickly to deliver skilled workers into the jobs that are needed. We also need to ensure Queensland is able to keep pace with the demands of a growing and changing economy. To do that we need a genuine partnership with industry. The creation of a new statutory authority, the Queensland Skills Commission, sends a clear signal to industry that they will have a greater say in the direction of skills development in Queensland. We are already seeing the benefits of that type of partnership. In March we announced a $10 million coal seam gas/liquefied natural gas industry training program, where industry will match the government’s contribution dollar-for-dollar to train workers in this new industry. By August this year, under this program, we will employ the first of approximately 2,500 trainees, who will begin a new career in our emerging LNG industry. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.40 am): Our government is committed to protecting and creating jobs. We have maintained our record capital building program, pledging $17.1 billion this year and supporting 106,000 jobs. However, our government recognises that we must also support industry to create the conditions needed to support continued job growth across our state. For that reason our budget delivers a raft of measures to help Queensland businesses, big and small, grow into the future. We have extended the 125 per cent payroll tax rebate for apprentices and trainees for another 12 months, at a cost of $8 million. That means Queensland still has the lowest payroll tax rate in the country. New South Wales, which made one of the centrepieces of its budget the reduction in payroll tax rates from 5.75 per cent to 5.45 per cent, still is nowhere near Queensland’s rate of 4.75 per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000826"></A>
In the next financial year, the government will continue to support Queensland businesses with programs that promote innovation, competitiveness and productivity. As I have just outlined, the new industry-led Queensland Skills Commission will drive training and skills reform. Skills Queensland will support industry investment and align training programs with real jobs, where the jobs are and where they are likely to grow. We recognised that improved productivity is a key driver of business success. That is why a new $2.5 million Innovation Vouchers Award program will help Queensland-based small to medium businesses improve their productivity. This pilot program will provide up to $50,000 for every eligible business for the use of new and innovative practices, such as the development of mandatory new machinery or the development of more sustainable workplaces. The pilot will provide businesses with redeemable vouchers that they can use to access research and expert advice to grow innovation in their companies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000827"></A>
In this financial year ongoing funding of $5.5 million to the Jobs Assist program will continue to provide an integrated package of support for businesses still feeling the impacts of the global financial crisis. This budget also delivers red tape reduction for our vital resources industry, with the provision of an additional $12.5 million over four years to deliver streamlined mineral and petroleum tenure approvals, and an extra $18 million over four years for a new mining exploration program to maximise Queensland’s exploration and resource potential, and continue to stimulate and attract investment. As well as all these measures, there is $7.5 million over four years to support economic development projects through the Queensland regional development initiative. This is used to assist regional development organisations focus on skills development and regional investment opportunities for businesses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000828"></A>
The budget sends a very clear message that Queensland is open for business and these initiatives are good examples of a government working with businesses to realise their full potential. I am very pleased that business groups have welcomed the state government’s allocation to some of these programs, particularly the infrastructure spending. Steve Greenwood from the Property Council of Australia says that the industry is positive about the budget. He says the sector will benefit from major infrastructure spending and stable property taxes. He states, ‘And that’s a very good thing for property investors and property owners.’ Paul Bidwell from the Master Builders Association says the spending will help struggling commercial builders. He states, ‘Every little bit helps.’ Chris Rodwell from the Australian Industry Group says the budget provides a strong platform for economic growth. He states, ‘It’s very significant indeed that we continue to have strong spending in infrastructure.’ The Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland has said it welcomes the government’s commitment to more responsible spending. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.44 am): Finally, it gives me great pleasure to conclude my remarks today with some mention of the Arts budget this year. From the South Bank cultural precinct to our regional centres and beyond, Queensland has a vibrant and thriving arts scene. The Millennium Arts Project includes the Gallery of Modern Art, the new Queensland State Library, the Centre of Contemporary Art in Cairns, the Brolga Theatre in Maryborough and The Edge at the State Library, which are now built and going strong. Those infrastructure developments were put in place as part of our Millennium program, which started more than 10 years ago. The National Carriage Factory in Toowoomba is also near completion and will open towards the end of year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000840"></A>
Arts investment has increased by 68 per cent since this government came into office in 1998. This year the total investment in the sector is $232 million. We have come a long way in the past decade and now it is time to launch the next chapter of arts and cultural development in Queensland. Yesterday the Cairns cultural precinct took a giant step forward with the Queensland state government’s commitment of $40 million in state owned land for the project and our one-third share of the planning money requested by the Cairns City Council--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I can advise the House that the people of Cairns are very enthusiastic about this project. The project was proposed by the Cairns business community and supported by the Cairns City Council, and a submission was put forward to the state and federal governments seeking one-third shares in what will be the most substantial cultural precinct anywhere in regional Australia. And where better than Cairns? It will breathe new life into the Cairns economy when it is needed most, it will add a major new attraction to the Cairns visitor experience, and it will be a showcase for Indigenous art and performance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000847"></A>
Over the next four years we will also see more than $12 million in new funding to ensure that the Queensland Art Gallery can keep delivering major exhibitions into the future. A further $1 million over the next two years will enable planning and design work on the major redevelopment of the Queensland Museum, which is the one state cultural institution that did not see a significant redevelopment as part of the Millennium project. The special role of Indigenous art is also recognised with a further $1.2 million over the next two years towards the Cairns Indigenous Art Fair, which promotes Indigenous art from all over Queensland. Regional arts infrastructure will also get a new $4 million boost over the next four years. This program will provide funds to regional art and cultural facilities for upgrades and to enable councils and others to plan, with the state government, for new infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000849"></A>
We all know that a thriving arts and cultural sector is an important part of liveability, whether you live in Cairns, Charleville or Brisbane. A dynamic Queensland arts sector also means jobs and a boost for local economies. It deserves to be supported and that is what we are doing in this year’s budget. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (9.49 am): The Bligh government is sticking to our strong economic plan of delivering more jobs, building infrastructure and investing in Queensland’s economic recovery. There is no portfolio that more starkly illustrates the benefits of the Bligh government’s strong economic plan than Health. Our infrastructure and jobs strategy means that we are building or rebuilding hospitals across Queensland, hiring 1,200 new clinical staff this coming year and increasing overall Health expenditure in the coming year to $9.99 billion. The reason we can afford this record investment in health services and infrastructure assets is that we have chosen an economic path that invests in a capital building program delivering in the areas government investment is needed most: hospitals, roads and schools--key government services and key public social infrastructure assets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002028"></A>
In the Health portfolio, the government’s strong economic strategy is delivering in spades. The Health budget will grow by 10.5 per cent on last year’s Health budget--well above the state’s 2.6 per cent population growth. Our massive $7.33 billion health infrastructure program--the largest ever undertaken in the nation’s history--is building and expanding hospitals and health services from the Torres to the Tweed and securing Queensland jobs. Queenslanders will not benefit from that vital social infrastructure unless we stick to our strong economic plan, and that is exactly what we are doing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002029"></A>
We are upgrading and expanding emergency departments at Logan, Redlands, QEII, Caboolture, Ipswich and Toowoomba, as well as a dedicated paediatric emergency department at Prince Charles. Major hospital infrastructure projects are already underway in Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Mount Isa and Rockhampton, delivering more beds and expanded services for local communities. Nearly 200 projects across the state will secure close to 40,000 construction jobs over the life of the projects--half a billion dollars this year alone on the Gold Coast University Hospital. Each and every one of these jobs is a dividend of the government’s economic strategy that puts jobs first, and that would be put at risk by the cost-cutting, job-destroying policies of those opposite. </Hansard-Body>

In fact, the 96-bed, new ward at Nambour Hospital will open by the end of the year--which, last time I checked, was six months, not 18 months. That is another typically politically motivated comment from the AMA, that is in fact less critical of the LNP than Tony Abbott is. </Hansard-Body>

 I welcome in the budget the funding to ramp up services on the Sunshine Coast--and that was due to the work of the clinicians, working with Queensland Health and me, not the politically motivated AMA.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Of course he is embarrassed about it, because his leader made no further commitments. We went to the last election with a commitment to employ 3,500 extra doctors, nurses and allied health staff over three years. After only 18 months we are well ahead of target, with an additional 2,827 clinical staff employed since the last election. We are 80 per cent of the way towards our health jobs target less than halfway through the term. That is what our strong economic plan is delivering into our hospitals. </Hansard-Body>

For the first time, the government will invest $8.5 million over four years for a mental health social marketing campaign to raise awareness and reduce the stigma associated with mental health issues. Remember those opposite? They had volunteers. Medical research has received a massive funding boost out of this budget. That is how much the Deputy Leader of the Opposition cares about people with mental illness. He stood by the member for Caloundra, and the member for Burnett said that the turning point in his relationship with the LNP in the last election campaign was when his mental health policy was volunteers delivering services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002054"></A>
There will be $31.2 million initial funding over four years to support the Queensland Institute of Medical Research and $1 million over four years to the Wesley Research Institute. For Queensland’s most vulnerable children, we will invest $16.5 million for children’s hearing services to increase the number of cochlear implants, boost early intervention and expand therapy services. Queensland will have the most comprehensive children’s hearing program in the nation. Mr Speaker, when you see those children’s faces light up and when you see what can be achieved, it makes even the greatest capital expenditure seem nothing in comparison. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1002056"></A>
The state budget will boost funding for cancer services in regional Queensland by $194.5 million operational and $179.3 million capital funding over four years, providing new and upgraded cancer centres throughout Queensland. That means 26 extra chemotherapy chairs, two additional linear accelerators and a positron emission tomography scanner at Townsville and enhanced tele-oncology and chemotherapy treatment services at Mount Isa. These are all the benefits of a strong economic plan delivering health services for Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002060"></A>
Mr Speaker, you cannot invest record amounts in health services to benefit Queenslanders unless you stick to an economic plan. That is what the Bligh government is doing. The AMA nationally called for 3,700 beds to be built in Australia. We are delivering 1,700 in Queensland and $7 billion worth of infrastructure build. New South Wales is the closest, spending about $2 billion. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (9.55 am): Yesterday this government delivered a strong, sensible budget--one that will stand the test of time and one that puts us on a course to return to our AAA credit rating. It builds the recovery and it forecasts lower debt, lower deficits, stronger growth and more jobs. This is a budget that shows that our plans for reform and the plans we put in place last budget are delivering. We have charted a course to deliver our AAA credit rating and we have the discipline and the determination to stick to it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002067"></A>
Standard &amp; Poor’s, the rating agency, acknowledged yesterday that our ‘steady-as-she goes budget will strengthen the state’s structural budgetary position’. S&amp;P went on to say that ‘the rating remains on a stable outlook, an upgrade may be possible’ and said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002070"></A>
In particular, if the proposed assets sales go ahead and the proceeds are used to retire debt--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1002071"></A>
which is exactly our plan that we are putting in place--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002072"></A>
then Queensland’s net financial ratio could decline to around 110% of revenue--a level consistent with the 100-110% Standard &amp; Poor’s identified as a possible trigger to reassess the rating. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1002073"></A>
What does that mean? They say that our plan is working and that we need to stick to it, which is what we will do. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002074"></A>
An integral part of the plan for rebuilding the recovery will be the delivery of our huge $17.1 billion building program to support growth today and provide the infrastructure critical for our future productive capacity and future growth. What does business have to say about this? The Australian Industry Group gave it the tick. The Property Council gave the infrastructure spend the tick. The Transport and Tourism Forum of Australia gave the infrastructure spend the tick, with our commitment to improve public transport. Even the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland said, ‘On balance, it’s a fair budget.’ They said that we were pursuing the right plan with our plan to put these commercial businesses to the market. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002078"></A>
Isn’t the silence from the other side of the chamber all of a sudden entirely instructive? It is a silence, of course, that we know has been going on for about a year now. But we all wait because the countdown is on. Put the rocket ship on the launch pad--26 hours to go until all will be revealed. The Queensland Resources Council said that we were on the right track and endorsed the programs we put in place for the resources sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002080"></A>
While this year’s budget will see the balance sheet strengthened, it will also lend a helping hand to Queenslanders who need it most. This budget delivers increases in electricity rebates for pensioners and seniors, to help our most vulnerable with the financial pressures through a $216 a year electricity rebate--something which the Queensland Council of Social Service has welcomed. The early childhood sector--C&amp;K and Independent Schools Queensland--has welcomed our commitment to spend $60 million to bring forward the construction of 40 additional kindies by 2012. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002085"></A>
The Wilderness Society and the World Wide Fund for Nature have both praised the introduction of our reforms to waste and the new commercial waste levy, as have business groups such as the Waste Contractors and Recyclers Association. The Local Government Association has also endorsed it and business groups like the Australian Industry Group say that we have got the settings right and have praised our determination to work with industry over the next 12 months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002088"></A>
This is a budget which focuses on what Queensland needs for the future. It is a budget that reflects the strategy we put in place. It reports on the recovery we are building and shows that we are on track, with a plan, to return to surplus, to regain the AAA credit rating, to deliver a net new 100,000 jobs--just as we said we would. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Capital Works Program</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003461"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (9.58 am): Yesterday I was pleased to detail jobs in many infrastructure projects in which Public Works is involved. Yesterday’s budget reinforced that message and committed funding to continue the Capital Works Program. This government’s massive building program is delivering infrastructure and jobs. We can do this because we have an economic plan and we are sticking to it. We said we would protect our capital works budget and we have. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003463"></A>
Public Works continues to manage huge projects, such as hospitals, schools, courts and correctional centres, on behalf of other government agencies. On top of that, Public Works also manages a host of its own major projects. These include the $47.6 million six-star green-star rated Joint Contact Centre at Zillmere. The centre will be shared by Smart Service Queensland and Queensland police. In total, nearly 360 jobs are being provided on that project. In Cairns, work continues on the $79.5 William McCormack Place stage 2 government office building, supporting approximately 600 jobs over the duration of the project. Nearby in Mareeba, $6.5 million has been allocated for a government office building and learning centre, providing an estimated 34 full-time equivalent positions. Further north, the $13.5 million government office building being constructed on Thursday Island is creating approximately 90 jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003468"></A>
On the Sunshine Coast, the $79.9 million Maroochydore office building is taking shape. The project will generate an estimated 600 jobs in total. If yesterday’s budget did not commit to those projects, what would we see happen? Those cranes would come down and those workers would lose their jobs, and that would have happened if those opposite had won the last election.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003469"></A>
In Brisbane, the site infrastructure works to create a platform for the Boggo Road Urban Village are due to be completed in late 2010. This $45.5 million project will support 350 full-time equivalent jobs during construction. As an integral part of the new Boggo Road Urban Village, the $378 million Ecosciences Precinct, which includes an $88 million contribution from CSIRO, will be completed ahead of program in late 2010 and will create over 2,900 jobs. Yesterday the Treasurer also signalled a commencement of the $450 million Queensland Police Service training academy by providing $50 million to allow for the planning to start to get this project to the market so that it is completed by 2014-15, which will also create 3,500 jobs. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1003470"></A>
Finally, I want to congratulate the mighty Goprint for again producing an accurate, timely and secure set of budget papers for this year’s budget. Goprint staff worked well beyond the call of duty to deliver on time and with the usual high quality--as they have done for over a century. I congratulate all those workers at Goprint who worked through the night to make sure that these documents were on our desks yesterday in a timely and accurate fashion.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Solar Energy</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003474"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (10.02 am): Our government has a plan to turn Queensland into the solar state. It is a plan that will build a new green industry to create green jobs for Queenslanders. It is a plan that will allow us to reduce our carbon footprint and lessen our impact on the environment. It is a plan to move toward a renewable energy future for our state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003475"></A>
We have a plan for a solar future, and yesterday’s budget means we can make that plan a reality by delivering $115 million worth of solar initiatives over the next five years. This is the largest single funding commitment for solar deployment in Queensland’s history, demonstrating our government’s determination to move towards a renewable energy future. We are moving towards that future with initiatives like CS Energy’s carbon reduction program. We have provided $35.4 million towards the program to help support the development of major renewable energy projects like the solar boost project at Kogan Creek. Our commitment of more than $35 million for CS Energy, together with $31 million from the federal government for this project, means Queensland will be home to the largest solar project in the Southern Hemisphere. It is projects like those being developed by CS Energy that will see Queensland’s reputation as a solar hub continue to grow. As the projects grow, so too will the industry and the green jobs that come with it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003476"></A>
Our plan is not just about the solar industry; it is a plan that involves every Queensland household. Indeed, this year’s budget ensures all Queenslanders can do the bright thing and switch to solar, with initiatives like the $60 million solar rebate scheme which is providing residents with rebates of $600 and $1,000 for the installation of solar hot-water systems and solar heat pumps. It is not only Queensland homes that we are targeting. The budget also includes $5.8 million for a new Solar Kindergartens Program. This funding will go towards the installation of solar PV panels on the roofs of new and existing kindergarten buildings built or upgraded over the next four years. This means our kindies will be able to be more energy efficient and the next generation of Queenslanders will have the chance to learn about the benefits of renewable energy and take those messages home.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003477"></A>
Our government has a plan to double our state’s solar energy capacity over the next five years. This year’s budget will see us continue to deliver on that plan, and the people of Queensland will reap the benefits. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. GJ WILSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (10.04 am): Queensland children state-wide will be able to access extra kindergarten services under a plan by the Bligh government to fast-track 40 new state-wide services. The 40 extra services come on top of the locations of 68 extra kindy services that are already planned to open by the end of 2012. The bring-forward cost of the 40 new services will be $60 million. This is in stark contrast to the last state election, when the LNP policy was to completely cut the spending on new Queensland kindergartens. We are investing $321 million to make this happen and we are building state-of-the-art facilities for Queensland children to enjoy a flying start to learning and life. This comes on top of $10 million being spent on new school infrastructure every day in Queensland by the state and the federal governments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003482"></A>
We know where those on the other side of the chamber stand on new infrastructure in Queensland schools. They stand divided. On the one hand, they make a public call for the freezing of new infrastructure in Queensland schools, yet when it comes to their own backyards they want more spending on schools and they do not care whether it is state or federally funded. The divide does not stop there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003485"></A>
The South-East Queensland corner Liberals say we need to stop spending in regional Queensland because it costs more, while the regional National Party members want more spending in their schools. The member for Moggill, for example, claims that just because you live in a remote part of Queensland you do not deserve new infrastructure because it costs more. The member for Currumbin claims we should pre-empt the outcomes of consultations with regional communities and just cancel any new buildings. Meanwhile, the member for Hinchinbrook is committed to keeping one of his local schools open and supporting BER buildings in his electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003486"></A>
The Bligh government wants to keep all small schools sustainable. We want all students to have a flying start in education. That is exactly what we are going to do with the record education expenditure in this budget.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. CA WALLACE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Thuringowa--ALP) (Minister for Main Roads) (10.07 am): The Bligh government is tackling congestion on busy roads with sensible, workable solutions. We have just doubled the number of roadside traffic cameras in South-East Queensland. It is a win for motorists, with 50 new web cameras rolled out across the region. The cameras stream live vision to the traffic website, alerting motorists to potential hazards, traffic snarls and delays. Our new web cams will save time for people who lead busy lives. People will be able to click onto the website, work out where the trouble spots are and plan their journey. We are installing the new cameras in more than 50 busy roadside locations on the Sunshine Coast, in Brisbane and on the Gold Coast. The sites have been carefully chosen. They are places prone to congestion and traffic build-up. Next month, we will have 100 web cams up and running.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003490"></A>
The Bligh government is serious about tackling congestion and making life better for motorists. We have made tough choices as a government and they were the right choices. That is why we are able to deliver a first-class road network for Queenslanders. The $315 million duplication of the Houghton Highway will go a long way towards slashing travel times on both bridges. I look forward to joining my colleague, the member for Sandgate, in some fishing on that bridge as we inspect that new fishing platform. The new Sir Leo Hielscher Bridge, part of the $2.5 billion Gateway corridor, means motorists will have six lanes all the way from Nudgee to Nerang--and six months ahead of schedule. The $1.95 billion Ipswich Motorway upgrade from Dinmore to Goodna includes six lanes, with room to expand to eight in the future. That is what I call planning for growth. We have almost $1 billion to upgrade the Pacific Motorway between the Gateway and Tugun to give motorists a smoother, swifter and more seamless run. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. RG NOLAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport) (10.09 am): Yesterday’s record Transport budget of $7 billion--the third highest portfolio spend in the Bligh government--secures jobs, ensures sustainable growth and helps lay the foundations for an economic recovery. The budget provides: an extra $179 million for trains, buses and ferries; the fast-tracking of the Springfield railway line at a cost of $646 million; $35 million for the duplication of the railway line from Keperra to Ferny Grove, including a major railway station redevelopment at Ferny Grove; $61 million for cycling infrastructure; $197 million to continue constructing the Northern Busway from Enoggera Creek to Kedron; and $150 million to extend the Eastern Busway from Buranda to Main Avenue at Coorparoo. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003534"></A>
The Bligh government is also about to undertake the biggest upgrade of train stations in South-East Queensland since services began in the 1860s. As announced in yesterday’s budget, $200 million will be spent in the coming financial year to spruce up around 50 railway stations. Renovations at stations will range from major works such as new lifts, escalators and expanded car parks to basic revamps like new toilets, fresh paint and new seating. Another great feature of this program will be the installation of LCD screens at a number of stations. The screens will provide commuters with real-time service information, including countdowns to arrivals and departures, details about special events and other important information for train travellers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003536"></A>
From this year Queensland Rail will be a designated passenger carrier and Queensland commuters will see better customer service as a result. The rail station renovation will be the biggest clean-up blitz ever seen on the Citytrain network. It will take us from the steam age to gleam age. The renovated stations are used by 90 per cent of daily passengers, meaning that most commuters will benefit from the upgraded facilities as part of their daily rail commute. Almost a third of stations will receive some form of upgrade, with work to be prioritised over the coming weeks. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (10.13 am): The Bligh government has a plan for a safe and secure Queensland, and the 2010-11 state budget handed down by the Treasurer yesterday demonstrates that we are sticking to that plan. In my portfolio that means a massive $1.8 billion allocation for the Queensland Police Service. This record budget allocation--an increase of $110 million on last year--is made possible because the government has taken the tough decisions to ensure front-line service delivery is not compromised. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003548"></A>
We said that we would deliver an additional 600 police during this term. This year’s police budget is another step in that commitment with funding for an extra 203 police positions this year, joining the more than 10,000 sworn officers already on the beat. These officers are doing a great job, with the overall rate of crime down 26 per cent between 2000-01 and 2008-09.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003549"></A>
The Bligh government is determined to keep that trend going. That is why we are getting more officers on the beat proactively working to reduce crime and investigate crimes when they do occur. The government is also planning for the future. We have allocated $50 million towards the ongoing development of the new Queensland Police Academy at Wacol. This funding will assist the Police Service in having this facility operational by 2015, providing a modern facility from which the next generation of police officers will be trained.</Hansard-Body>

This budget also delivers funding for the new Badu Island Police Station, Oxley district forensic facility and district support facility in Townsville, as well as the Murgon Police Station and watchhouse, Camp Hill Police Station--being built at Carina--Lockhart River Police Station and the Sunshine Coast district water police facility. More than $50 million will be invested in the latest information and communication technology to support front-line police officers. This includes investing in a new weapons licensing system, a new computer aided dispatch system, a digital integrated traffic camera system and a permanent telecommunications interception capability.</Hansard-Body>

Contrary to media reports today, the budget also includes funding for the continuation of the One Punch Can Kill campaign. The government previously announced a $700,000 commitment, to be spent over two years, for this campaign. This budget demonstrates that the Bligh government is sticking to its plan of having a well-funded and well-resourced police service for Queensland. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Shark Control Program</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Hon. TS MULHERIN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland) (10.15 am): This week new acoustic alarms or pingers, which alert whales to the location of shark nets, will be trialled on the Gold Coast. With 13,000 whales expected to pass along the Queensland coast this whale migration season, the Bligh government is committed to minimising the impacts of its Shark Control Program on non-target species such as whales. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003557"></A>
The new pingers have a longer and louder noise specially aimed at alerting whales to the location of shark nets. The new pingers will complement existing dolphin pingers, which have been installed on shark nets since 1996. Last whale migration season, six whales were entangled in Queensland shark nets. All were successfully released by the state government’s Marine Animal Release Team. That is a relatively small number, considering there are up to 13,000 whales migrating back to southern waters, but it is still six too many.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003558"></A>
A number of pinger prototypes have been designed and will be fitted to Gold Coast shark nets this week to test their durability in the ocean environment. The alarms have been developed by a Queensland based specialist acoustic device manufacturer and give off a louder noise for a longer listening period, making it easier for whales to hear. It is important to recognise that these alarms are designed to alert whales to the presence of nets; they are not designed to scare them away from the equipment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003559"></A>
In total, we will have 90 pingers in the water at any one time. That is three on each Queensland shark net from Mackay to the Gold Coast. The aim is to have pingers on all nets by August. This will be in time for the second half of the whale season, when young whales are more likely to come closer to shore and become entangled. After that, pingers will be fitted to the nets from 1 May to 30 November each year. The public are strongly encouraged to report any whale entanglements by calling the shark control hotline on 1800806891. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. SJ HINCHLIFFE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Infrastructure and Planning) (10.18 am): The Bligh government believes in the delivery of infrastructure and jobs for Queensland. That is why we made a plan and stuck to it. This year’s budget funds a $17.1 billion Capital Works Program that supports 106,000 jobs--the highest infrastructure spend in Australia for the 10th year running. In the last 10 years this funding has provided busways for Brisbane, the return--I repeat, the return--of rail to the Gold Coast, the upgrade of air and sea ports in Gladstone, Townsville, Cairns and the Mackay region as well as numerous health and hospital upgrades. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003563"></A>
For my portfolio this budget means more than $486 million in capital spending over the next 12 months to continue an ambitious infrastructure and planning program to provide jobs. I am pleased to report that funding for the remaining South-East Queensland water grid projects will top $315 million in 2010-11. That is $202 million for the Northern Pipeline Interconnector stage 2 and $105 million for the Wyaralong Dam, among other projects, to provide water security for South-East Queensland’s two million residents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006163"></A>
These projects will also continue to provide jobs, wherever possible sourcing local workers and businesses. The Northern Pipeline Interconnector stage 2, the second stage of the reverse cycle pipeline to link the Sunshine Coast to the South-East Queensland water grid, has already generated a total of 416 jobs and a local spend of more than $13 million. A total workforce of 650, with up to 60 per cent to be hired locally, is forecast to be reached in August 2010 on the $440.4 million project between Landers Point and Noosa. The $348 million Wyaralong Dam, which in conjunction with the Cedar Grove Weir will deliver enough water for 300,000 people each year, will generate a total of 420 jobs in the delivery of that project. The project is currently employing an estimated 370 direct workers and subcontractors, with more than 50 per cent from the local area.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006172"></A>
The Wyaralong Dam project has also sourced goods and services from more than 400 businesses, with about 45 per cent from the local area. Wyaralong Dam is also helping break the unemployment cycle and aiding the environment, with a total of 61 Green Army recruits involved in the project. So far, 36 of those involved in the green traineeships have gained local employment following graduation. The next work placement, which starts on 21 June, will see 10 participants at work on the construction of recreation trails around the dam. These important projects are further evidence of the Bligh government’s plan to provide infrastructure and generate jobs. We will continue to deliver water security and infrastructure through the nation’s biggest building program at $17.1 billion, protecting 106,000 Queensland jobs.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Willawong, Proposed Residential Development</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006177"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. A PALASZCZUK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Inala--ALP) (Acting Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability) (10.21 am): The Lord Mayor has reportedly expressed concerns about a medical waste disposal facility operating at Willawong in Brisbane’s west. Specifically, he has raised concerns about the facility known as Ace Waste being located in proximity to some residences. I wish to respond to media reports today to address the Lord Mayor’s comments and provide a clearer picture of the issue being dealt with at a state and local level. Ace Waste has been operating at Willawong since 1993. It is the only facility in South-East Queensland capable of disposing of certain types of medical waste that are required by law to be incinerated. Brisbane City Council has been examining planning options for expanded residential development to cater for population growth in the wider Oxley Wedge area for a number of years. However, it was only recently that the Department of Environment and Resource Management became aware that council had proposed a large residential development for a parcel of land adjacent to the Ace Waste facility. Council sought advice from DERM on its proposed Paradise Wetlands neighbourhood plan.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006180"></A>
Let me be very clear: council had wanted higher density development in close proximity to a medical waste facility--indeed, within 300 metres of the facility. This is a lot closer than the nearest households, which are about 800 metres away. The state government has said no way. This year DERM informed council that it believed the proximity of 300 metres was insufficient. DERM encouraged council to consider a Draft State Planning Policy for Air, Noise and Hazardous Materials which recommended a distance of 1,000 metres away from areas that contain facilities such as Ace Waste for future developments. This facility is located away from higher density residential areas with established buffer distances and suitable conditions on its operations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006182"></A>
Let me be absolutely clear that the facility is operating within its development approval conditions and Queensland Health has advised it does not consider there to be any current health risks to the nearest residents. However, sensible planning dictates that residences should not be encroaching on the facility’s surrounding areas. In response to DERM’s advice, the council commissioned SIMTARS, an arm of the Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation, to undertake an air study to evaluate health risks and advise on separation distances. SIMTARS acts as an independent consultant with a world-class reputation of assessing, researching and testing health and safety risks of industry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006186"></A>
The council commissioned study has three stages. The first stage involving theoretical modelling of emissions has now been completed. The model, using average emissions for Ace Waste and the landfill flare, revealed that levels of modelled contaminants were within national guidelines at existing residences. It also indicated that nearby workplaces were not at risk of harm. But to establish more than adequate separation distances for future residential planning, an additional worst-case scenario model was run, and this was the subject of media reports today. This model was purposely very conservative, assuming the facility operated 100 per cent of the time at peak operational levels. It was intended to overestimate the impacts of Ace Waste’s emissions and exaggerate the potential effects to identify the features of such a worst-case scenario. It is important to note that this modelling has never and will never be based on the facility’s actual operations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006187"></A>
Council and the state government both agree that the investigations are incomplete and further study is required to determine the actual risks. Stages 2 and 3 will provide this information. DERM is committed to continuing to assist the council commissioned investigations and will work with council to keep the community fully informed of progress. This case, above all else, is an effective demonstration of DERM acting as an environmental regulator. DERM stepped in to prevent what it saw as inappropriate planning. This case highlights the very real reasons why a State Planning Policy for Air, Noise and Hazardous Materials is so important--to guide councils on appropriate buffers between industry and households. DERM takes its responsibilities as an environmental regulator very seriously and takes action against all breaches of environmental conditions and legislation. DERM will continue to work with both Ace Waste to ensure its continued compliance with its environmental conditions and the Brisbane City Council to ensure that residential development maintains suitable separation from this facility.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Helping Out Families Initiative</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006192"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PG REEVES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mansfield--ALP) (Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport) (10.25 am): Tomorrow I will be introducing legislation into the House to make changes to the Child Protection Act which will facilitate the Helping Out Families initiative, announced yesterday by the Minister for Community Services and myself. Personally, I cannot think of anything more precious than a newborn baby. At such a wonderful yet vulnerable stage, there is no more important bond than between mother and child. That is why the Bligh government has made the tough decisions and stuck to its economic plan to ensure that this year’s operating budget of $695.9 million for child protection focuses squarely on keeping our children safe. I am proud to announce $55 million in funding to be allocated over the next four years to the new Helping Out Families initiative, an early intervention and prevention pilot to be run in Logan and Beenleigh from October this year and the Gold Coast from early next year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006197"></A>
I spoke of the important and vital bond between mother and child, and that is why the Helping Out Families pilot will ensure every mother with a newborn child will receive up to six visits from a registered nurse within the first three years of the child’s life. This will ensure that mums and dads are getting the sort of help they need during such a life-changing time. The initiative also includes further assistance, with a provision for families requiring more intensive help to be offered an additional 15 visits over a 12-month period. The focus of the visits will be to enhance the confidence and capacity of parents and carers in their parenting role. They will help with information about immunisation, preventing injuries, promoting reading for future literacy skills, safe sleeping and encouraging breastfeeding and optimum infant nutrition.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006203"></A>
Also included in the Helping Out Families initiative is the formation of the Family Support Alliance, an early intervention and prevention support network which will receive referrals from Child Safety and then assess and support families with children of any age with the relevant services they might require. Also incorporated in the Helping Out Families initiative are the 11 new Indigenous family support services being established for Indigenous families across the state. These will receive funding of $8.5 million per year on top of the $55 million four-year pilot. This government has stuck to its economic plan and made the tough economic decisions to ensure the safety and future of our children. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition) (10.29 am): The opposition is provided by this parliament with a budget to conduct its operations. That budget is expended in accordance with the guidelines contained in the opposition handbook and supervised by the Ministerial Services Branch of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. MSB was established as a recommendation of the Fitzgerald inquiry to provide independent oversight and control of expenditure incurred by ministerial officers and, by extension, the opposition. Ministerial officers and the opposition operate under guidelines based on similar principles, with all expenditures, of course, being audited by the independent Auditor-General. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006266"></A>
The opposition handbook contains detailed guidelines relating to expenditures by the opposition on advertising. Those guidelines had traditionally been applied by the officers of MSB, who independently certify in advance, without informing the government of the day, that the advertisement complies with the guidelines. This system has worked successfully for many years, with the opposition office being prepared to change proposed advertisements in order to comply with the guidelines. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006267"></A>
A couple of months ago this system was subject to change when the Director-General of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet, Mr Ken Smith--a person with whom the Premier has a personal contract of employment--unilaterally asserted the right to personally approve all opposition advertisements in lieu of the role of the supposedly independent public servants of MSB. Following vigorous discussions between Mr Smith and the opposition office, Mr Smith, who did not personally agree with the decisions of his officers, chose to refer to the Integrity Commissioner. Dr Solomon, the Integrity Commissioner, has indicated that he proposes to consult extensively in relation to his review, which will take several months. I am in the process of writing to Dr Solomon to suggest that any such review should also address advertising by governments as well as oppositions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006270"></A>
Yesterday, as part of the opposition’s strategy of response to the government’s budget, my office sought to place an advertisement in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Just as the government places advertising at their expense. A draft of the advertisement was forwarded to MSB at 7.42 am. Notwithstanding reminders of approaching deadlines, it was not until 12.13 pm that Mr Ken Smith responded, raising a number of concerns. Those concerns were addressed in a response at 2.05 pm. Because of failure to identify what changes to the proposed advertisement would be needed to satisfy the director-general’s concerns, a decision was made to place a different advertisement that was previously placed two years ago. This is an advertisement that has previously been approved by the department, paid for from the opposition budget, not the subject of an adverse comment by the Auditor-General and praised by the Premier in parliament on 4 June 2008. The only change was updating the relevant figures to accord with the current position and the removal of a reference to a defunct website. The director-general was advised of this at 5.46 pm. At 6.21 pm the director-general advised--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1006274"></A>
I have clearly stated that no advertising should proceed pending the outcome of the review by the Integrity Commissioner. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006275"></A>
This raises a fundamental principle of democracy in this state. This is an issue of not only a government censoring an opposition’s budget reply but also the ethics of an opposition having to seek prior approval from the Premier’s directly appointed department head. It is reminiscent of the most corrupt of administrations. Here we have the personal political appointment of the Premier of Queensland telling the opposition that it cannot utilise funds provided by the parliament to engage in advertising pending the conclusion of a review lasting several months by the Integrity Commissioner. There is no suggestion, of course, that the government will be subject to any similar ban by the director-general. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006276"></A>
This is partisan political behaviour by the director-general that arguably amounts to official misconduct within the terms of the Crime and Misconduct Act. Accordingly, I advise the House that I will be writing to the chairman of the CMC requesting the launching of an urgent inquiry into this political abuse. In addition, Mr Speaker, I will be providing you with copies of all relevant material in order that you might consider what action should be taken to ensure that the privileges of an essential element of our democratic government--namely, the opposition and its capacity to effectively challenge and oppose government actions--are not inhibited by the partisan behaviour of the government’s public servants.  </Hansard-Body>

Resource Super Profits Tax</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.35 am): My first question without notice is to the Premier. I refer to reports that the first likely major industry decision following yesterday’s state budget is the cancellation by Chalco of its refinery project in Bowen, which the government said would generate 3,600 jobs, and I ask: when will the Premier tell the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, that she will not be his party president but instead will do her job as Premier of Queensland and stand up for the thousands of jobs that are being put on the scrap heap because of Labor’s new super tax on mining? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006305"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. Let me say a couple things. Firstly, there is nothing in the state budget yesterday that relates in any way to deliberations by Chalco about the viability of its project. Secondly, when we took this project to international tender we had a number of stipulations, but the most important was that the winning bidder would have to not only be able to exploit the resource productively but also have a refinery that would see value adding and more jobs in Queensland as a result of us opening up that project. So what Chalco has to get over the line is not only a bauxite mine but also a refinery on the eastern coast of Queensland. It is a tough project to get up--it always was--and I look forward to it getting up. But I will say this clearly: Chalco was awarded this project on the basis of secondary manufacturing of this product in Queensland and it will be subject to the firmest possible view by this government that it will only get access to the bauxite mine if it can deliver what it said it would deliver, as any other international tenderer would have been required to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006306"></A>
Let us just remember, shall we, where this bauxite deposit comes from. This was put to the international market. Why? Because the National Party and those opposite were part of a government that gave it away, said they could only hold the lease if it was developed within a certain period of time and then never, ever held the French company to account on that. So it held up that resource, which belongs to Queenslanders, and the company held it for 35 years without a single job, without any resource activity on the lease. What did this government do? We said to the company, ‘Too bad, you have not met your requirements. This belongs to Queenslanders and we are going to make sure there is an international company that wants to actually create jobs here.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006307"></A>
We want to see this project developed and we are working hard with the company to do just that. In fact, we have put on the table, as we have made public in the past, funds for common user infrastructure to assist. But what we will not do is walk away from the requirement that whoever exploits that bauxite will be required to do secondary processing at another facility. We will not simply see it put on ships and taken elsewhere for those manufacturing jobs to be gained in other countries. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006308"></A>
If that is the policy of the Leader of the Opposition then he needs to tell the people of Bowen, who probably stand the best chance of getting that refinery. He needs to stand up and say that under his government, should he ever be lucky enough to get here, they will take the bauxite and send it offshore and there will be no secondary processing jobs. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My second question without notice is to the Treasurer. Over the next year the interest on government debt will more than exceed the $1.2 billion in extra royalty revenue coming from what commentators are calling ‘mining boom mark 2’, and I ask: why is this reckless government spending the proceeds of the boom before the boom arrives?</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. He clearly participated in a different budget speech yesterday and has read a whole set of newspapers this morning from a different planet and a different state. What we put in place yesterday was a budget that observed a strict fiscal discipline. In the charter of fiscal rules that is contained in the budget papers yesterday, what did the budget papers show? They showed that that fiscal discipline was in place, that the expenditure constraint was below the level of population growth and inflation last year. We met the zero net real per capita growth on expenditure constraint. What is the evidence of that? Well, the deficit not only for the coming year but across the forward estimates is more than halved as we allow the revenue that is coming back from the recovery that we are authoring, the recovery that we are building, the recovery that we are putting in place, to go through to the bottom line. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006357"></A>
What are we doing with the proceeds from the economy picking up? We are sticking by the rules we put in place. We are flowing that through to the bottom line of the budget, halving the deficits across the forward estimates as we build a sustainable recovery. What the budget yesterday shows is that the plan that we put in place, the discipline that we put in place, is flowing through to the bottom line. It stands in stark contrast to the contribution from the Liberal and National parties in this state during the term of this parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006358"></A>
We are now within 25 hours of the time at which the Leader of the Opposition is proposing to finally give us an inclination about what his policy is, what policy he will pursue, what choices he will make, what programs he will cut, what efficiency dividend he will put in place that will slaughter 12,000 jobs out of the public sector and attack the front-line services that a growing population and a growing state needs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006359"></A>
One year on from the original promise, we are now inside the last day for seeing what the Leader of the Opposition is going to propose. What the people of Queensland deserve tomorrow is not a budget whinge in reply; what they deserve is a budget in reply that proposes an alternative, that puts forward a plan. We have a plan. It is put in place. It is working. It is delivering lower deficits. It is delivering lower debt. It is delivering higher growth. It is delivering more jobs. There has been nine months in a row of job generation because we put that first and foremost in what we said we would do. The budget handed down yesterday puts that plan in place, shows that it is delivering and delivering for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006360"></A>
What are we intent on doing here? We are intent on sticking to a plan that will build a stronger future for Queensland, that will return the budget to surplus, that the ratings agency says will put us on track to getting our AAA credit rating back, a plan that we said we would carry out, a budget in place that is delivering. That is what this side of the parliament has offered. What will the other side of the parliament offer tomorrow? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The Queensland opposition is provided with a budget and it is entitled to use some of those funds for public advertising. I am having this checked, but I am not aware of that being a right or an entitlement in any other state in Australia. Frankly, I think that, when they see those full-page ads in the paper, members of the public would be very surprised to know that in fact they are paying for that political advertising by the opposition. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As I said, I think that members of the Queensland public would be very surprised to know that those full-page ads are actually being paid for by the public of Queensland. The guidelines on this are very clear. What those guidelines make clear, firstly, is that such ads, in order to be eligible for public financing, should not be or should not be perceived to be party political in nature and they should not have excessive reference to photographs of the leader. I think the Leader of the Opposition learnt that lesson last year. Importantly, they are available to promote the policy of the alternative government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006368"></A>
There have been a number of ads in the last six months, and many of the people in this House would have seen them, which have been funded at public expense which do not meet those guidelines. They are, by any reasonable assessment, party political in nature. More concerning, none of them promote the alternative policies of the Leader of the Opposition or his party.</Hansard-Body>

I have heard some outrageous claims by those opposite this morning about my director-general. Let me make this very clear: under the Financial Accountability Act of this parliament the director-general of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet is the accountable officer--no ifs, no buts. The public expenditure being made by the Ministerial Services Branch on behalf of the LNP is subject to scrutiny by the accountable officer, the director-general of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. Given growing concern about the increasingly party political nature of these ads--and I think they are getting increasingly hard to justify to the public--the director-general, after discussions--</Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am entitled to a view on this, as every other Queenslander is, and I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to walk down the street with his ads and ask members of the Queensland public whether they ought to be paying for them. This is the subject of assessment by the Integrity Commissioner because I think the guidelines do need to be clear in fairness to the opposition, in fairness to the public purse. I think ongoing arguments about it from staff from the Leader of the Opposition’s office are not helpful. The Leader of the Opposition’s office was advised in writing yesterday that, given that the Integrity Commissioner is now reviewing this matter, further ads will not be approved. He chose to put the ad in anyway. I think it is important that this is clarified. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006372"></A>
As I said, this is the best resourced opposition in the country. No other opposition gets publicly funded political ads. The Integrity Commissioner will provide some assistance with this. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Treasurer. This morning the Treasurer referred to the Moody’s report on the budget. The Treasurer failed to say--and I quote from the report from Moody’s in relation to the reinstatement of the AAA credit rating--that Moody’s will monitor the introduction of a new resource rents tax as part of the national reform proposal and new healthcare funding arrangements which will be considered as a part of its deliberations on the reinstatement of the state’s AAA credit rating. Does the Treasurer agree that the mining super tax will affect Queensland’s ability to recover the AAA credit rating that he and Labor lost?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008485"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for the question. Here we go! We have the first insight into what tomorrow’s opposition budget reply will be about. Because they are so devoid of any capacity to talk about policies at a state level, tomorrow they will spend about 25 minutes talking about a federal tax proposal, constructed in front of them, to avoid the fact that they will not be able to go the distance talking about state policies. It will be a short episode. It will be a short little interlude on matters relating to the state, because it will be all about the federal resource super profits tax. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008488"></A>
The reality is that at three separate places in Budget Paper No. 2, the strategy and outlook document--at pages 42, 88 and 142 from memory--it talks about the resource super profits tax. The point that is being constructed by those opposite is that somehow the budget documents are deficient for not factoring in a resource super profits tax that has not been legislated, that is not in place and that is still under determination. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008489"></A>
I wonder what they would think of an excerpt from the WA budget papers. Last time I checked, a Liberal government was in office in WA. What does it say?

<A ID="pgfId-1008491"></A>

<A ID="pgfId-1008493"></A>
Those opposite should get on the phone to Colin Barnett and their Liberal mates in Western Australia and tell them that they are a bunch of duds. If they do not do that, the reality of the situation is revealed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008494"></A>
We will make sure that we do the hard yards to get this policy right, and that is what we have said from day one. We believe that the regime that has been put in place can work for investment in jobs, but does it work at this point? No, it does not. What will we do? We will continue to do what this side of the House does, which is to roll up our sleeves, do the policy hard yards, make sure that we work with the federal government and industry to get the taxation right so that Australians and Queenslanders get their fair share. That is what we have been determined to do from day one. </Hansard-Body>

What have members opposite been determined to do? They have been determined to lie in the hammock, to play solitaire, to not talk about any alternative proposals, to preside over a party that is falling apart. That party was only ever a sham marriage. It was only ever a cobbling together of disparate and arguing forces and it is being revealed for what it has always been: a total and utter fraud. </Hansard-Body>

Ms O’NEILL:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Premier. Can the Premier outline what the government’s $15 million solar package will mean for Queensland and the government’s aim to double our use of solar energy over the next five years? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008502"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for her question. I know that she has a keen interest in renewable energy, as does the entire Labor government. We are committed to growing our use of renewable energy, including in the solar area. I am very pleased to advise the House that the Minister for Mines and Energy has given an outline of the extra money that we will be putting into this year’s budget to grow the solar industry in Queensland. One of the centrepieces of that allocation is $35 million to CS Energy, in conjunction with a $31 million allocation from the federal government, to build a thermal solar booster plant at CS Energy’s Kogan Creek Power Station, which is a large coal fired power station. That solar thermal boost will increase the station’s capacity by 44 megawatts and significantly reduce its carbon emissions. It is important to understand that this will be the largest solar thermal power station in Australia. Indeed, it will be the largest solar thermal power station in the Southern Hemisphere and one of the largest in the world. Queensland’s claim to be the solar state of Australia is well and truly on track. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008507"></A>
I congratulate CS Energy for working with the company Areva. Areva has some of the most advanced solar thermal energy technology in the world. This will be the largest deployment of it anywhere in the world. At Kogan Creek in the south-west of our state, in an area that is emerging as a significant energy corridor for Queensland, we will not only see significant new energy supplies from gas fired power and from clean coal fired power, such as the very high-tech Kogan Creek plant, but we will also see a very significant addition to our solar power efforts. We are committed to doubling our use of solar power within five years, and having this as part of our program will certainly help meet that. This is equivalent to over 38,000 solar hot-water systems and the project will create 120 jobs in its construction phase. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008510"></A>
This program will join our budget commitment for this year of $5.8 million for solar kindies and our other programs such as the solar schools and hot water rebate programs. This all adds up to mean that whether it is in the home, in community organisations, in businesses or in large institutions, we are seeing solar power drive Queensland. Kogan Creek is the next development in that commitment. It will be the biggest solar thermal power station in the Southern Hemisphere and where is it? Here in Queensland! </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Treasurer, despite receiving increased royalties, increased Commonwealth grants, increased GST and increased taxes, the best this government can do to help Queenslanders is a miserly 6c a day cut to CTP insurance that does not cost it a cent. Isn’t the CTP cut simply a cruel hoax, given that the cut is entirely consumed by the CPI increase in vehicle registration for most family cars? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008519"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question--the shadow Treasurer who has occupied that space for two years and has not produced a single economic policy. Let us recentre this debate for a moment. Imagine if this government yesterday announced a $24 increase to the compulsory third party insurance regime. Imagine the crocodile tears from the toff from Clayfield if we had increased it by $24. Yesterday afternoon he was on radio, redolent of one of his political heroes, Senator Amanda Vanstone, saying it was not worth a milkshake and a hamburger. I do not know what goes on in Clayfield, but it would be a pretty expensive milkshake and hamburger that cost $24. It would be a Wagyu beef hamburger and a Barambah Organics milk milkshake, with a double soy latte on top, that cost $24. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008521"></A>
I make the point that if we had increased the CTP by $24 yesterday they would have been standing up, crying out about the burden being put on households. They would have been standing up for people they have never cared for and have never put a single policy in place to assist. They would have been decrying us, saying that the $24 would be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. However, because we have cut it by $24, they have to try to invent some opposition to it. This government makes no apology for going after the trailing commissions that exist in the compulsory third party insurance regime to cut compulsory third party insurance by $24 and deliver a saving to people on their registration bill. Why have we determined to do that? Because of the strict fiscal rules that we put in place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008522"></A>
Yes, times are tough and the revenue position does not allow us to undertake across-the-board taxation cuts. We continue to maintain a taxation level that is $400 below the national average. What did we do? Last year we started work on the policy hard yards to make sure we could put in place a cut to deliver some relief to Queensland households. Far from being a cruel hoax, it is a real cut of $24 to the ceiling, which we will legislate for during the next sittings of parliament to be in place by 1 October. In that debate the test for those opposite will be whether they will stand up and vote for a cut in the CTP insurance regime ceiling for Queensland motorists. We know what they will do. They will stand up and vote for it, because they know--or they should pretend to know--that $24 does matter. We have put in the policy hard yards to deliver on this. Any sort of opposition to it by those opposite merely reveals that they have absolutely no idea what the vast majority of Queenslanders think. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, that is a good point from the Minister for Transport. The opposition leader once believed in fluoride; he does not now and maybe he will do something differently on Thursday when he delivers his speech. I am pleased to confirm that the Queensland government is investing $24.9 million in 2010-11 to boost dental services in North Queensland, part of $45 million over four years. The honourable member has fought tooth and nail, so to speak, for that allocation. It will establish dental clinic training facilities on the James Cook University campus to train third- and fourth-year students and on the Townsville campus to train fifth-year students. We will now have three new universities in Queensland training dentists, and that is good news for the people of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010199"></A>
More than 1.9 million Queenslanders are eligible for dental services--45 per cent of our population. That is more than any other state. Indeed, in this budget we are investing big dollars in dental services, with an estimated 2 million occasions of service for 2011. In fact, our budget is the biggest in Australia for dental services by a country mile in per capita terms and is about the same size as New South Wales. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010201"></A>
We have seen in his comments the Leader of the Opposition talking about what he thinks in terms of spending cuts. He has expressed his view. Of course that sits totally against two other things that the opposition have done in relation to dental services. First of all, time and time again they are calling for more investment in dental services. So clearly they do not want to invest money in that or they want to cut something else to do it. Time after time they have refused to put the pressure federally on Tony Abbott, who is holding up federal funding in the Senate for more services. That would have delivered $52.8 million in dental funding to Queensland over four years and provided for 187,000 visits--an initiative that would have greatly assisted Queenslanders. Not only are they dishonest in terms of calling for more services; they do not even support putting pressure on Tony Abbott. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010202"></A>
It is very interesting. Tony Abbott is in town and he has expressed his view about the wonderful creation of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition--his opus maximus, the LNP. What did Tony Abbott say about the LNP? He said he was happy with a few candidates. How many is he happy with in Queensland? Three--Warren Entsch, Ken O’Dowd in Flynn and George Christensen. And he is not happy with anyone else. How could someone like Andrew Laming, who has an obstetrics diploma, is an ophthalmologist and has an MPA from Harvard, ever get off the back bench? Let alone this crowd over here. The simple fact of the matter is that the Liberal Party is a weak link and the LNP is the weakest link in the Liberal Party. Those opposite have no policy when it comes to dental services. We will roll dental services out in rural and regional Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

 this morning. Mr Abbott is reported as saying, ‘Lift your game, Abbott orders fractious LNP’. The old tactics committee of the LNP should have tabled this up the top. What is he reported as saying? ‘It certainly needs to sharpen up a bit.’ There is probably no real argument about that. He said, ‘It’s not terminal but we’re starting to see the return of people who were involved in factional fighting in the Liberal Party. If they manage to get back in, it will sink the whole show.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010226"></A>
What is happening inside the LNP? Mr Abbott is reported as saying, ‘Unfortunately the LNP has been totally overtaken by turncoat Liberals’--of them there are a few--‘and hardcore Bjelke-Petersen style National Party types, and this has meant precious campaign capability and experience is not being used.’ Was it on display in the last two minutes? Remember the ringing endorsement that the Leader of the Opposition gave the opposition whip, for all his experience and tactics and the great way he could contribute to the parliament--with a massive own goal over the top of the head in the last 30 seconds. Of course that silence and that total incapacity to even do something as simple as run a question in question time is reflected in their total policy incapacity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010228"></A>
What has this government done? We have delivered a budget that charts a course for recovery. We have delivered a budget that forecasts lower debt, lower deficits, higher growth and more jobs sooner. It puts us on course to achieve a AAA credit rating, as Standard &amp; Poor’s said this morning. What do they say? They say that our plan puts us in the zone. What will they say about the Leader of the Opposition on Thursday? Will they have anything to say at all? Will the Leader of the Opposition have anything to say at all?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010231"></A>
Now we are inside 24 hours until the Leader of the Opposition, in all his impotent rage, stands up here and--just like the powder puff, glamour shot obsessive he is--produces nought, nothing, no policies, no alternative, nothing to go forward for the people of Queensland because he has been far more interested in the glamour shot. He has been promising us the money shot, but what has happened? Absolutely nothing. In all his impotent rage he stands there with a whinge and a whine, wrings his hands, talks about the future and produces nothing. Instead, all he does is stand atop as a figurehead of this brown’s cows collection of old timers and good timers, playing solitaire, doing nothing, sitting in the hammock, bludging off the taxpayer, ripping the taxpayer off for their advertising. What a bunch of lazy frauds! </Hansard-Body>

 My question without notice is to the Minister for Health. This morning I was contacted by a nurse who works within my electorate who was due to be paid last Wednesday, 2 June 2010, and had been promised every day since then that she would be paid ‘tomorrow’. This morning she finally received a pay advice from Queensland Health and that pay advice has a net pay of zero. I table for the information of the House the pay advice from Queensland Health which shows a due date of 2 June 2010 and a net pay of zero. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Mr Speaker, I rise to a point of order. I want to make the point that the notice of motion that was given by the Leader of the Opposition does not deal with the issue that I raised specifically. I asked a specific question about a specific nurse. I dispute your ruling and I question your ruling that the question I asked was pre-empting the discussion on the motion tonight. The question that I asked was about a specific case and it is not mentioned in the motion in any way, shape or form. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1012139"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The grave difficulty I have been placed in is that I have a notice of motion that deals with payrolls. As I explained to the honourable member for Toowoomba South, his question went to the heart of that. The position I am placed in with the notice of motion is that I have to be consistent in my rulings. I would therefore invite the honourable gentleman, if he disagrees with my ruling, to move dissent from it. The position I have been placed in is that I have a notice of motion before the House. I have ruled one way for the member for Toowoomba South and I do not feel I can duck in and out of that. That is the position the chair finds itself in and, accordingly, that is my ruling. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The people who are interested include those whose jobs depend on, for example, the $117.8 million that will be spent this year on construction jobs at the hospital in the honourable member for Burleigh’s area. If we do not agree to do that through this budget, that project stops. It is pretty simple. It is all very well for you to misuse taxpayers’ money--</Hansard-Body>

Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is all very well for honourable members opposite to misuse taxpayers’ money to tell people that you should not borrow money, but the net effect of it is this: every one of those construction workers who depends on a job like that would have to walk off the job. They would not have a job, whether it be at Lotus Glen, out at Gatton or on any of our projects throughout regional Queensland. What that ad which they attempted to put this morning, with the disgraceful use of taxpayers’ money, should really have said at the bottom was: ‘By the way, get rid of all the building workers in this state and get rid of all the projects.’ </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012162"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Health. I refer the minister to the capital works program for the health department this financial year of which $365 million for critical health infrastructure was not spent, causing projects to be delayed, including emergency department improvements and the Townsville Hospital and Bundaberg Hospital expansions. Minister, with the access block running at an average of 34 per cent across the state and critical projects being delayed, how much longer will people continue to lie on a trolley rather than on a real hospital bed?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012164"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for his question. Our capital works budget dwarfs that of other states when it comes to health. Our capital works budget this year in Health over the forward estimates is in excess of $7 billion in the Health Action Plan. This year it is about $1.6 billion, off the top of my head. In fact, the Gold Coast University Hospital is half a billion dollars. Of course, in a state like Queensland where we have significant rain problems--and I think we had significant ones in Townsville--that will cause delays in some projects from time to time.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012165"></A>
Let us be very clear about the choice that you have in this place, and we will see this choice tomorrow when the Leader of the Opposition delivers his budget reply. When he is given the choice between Forestry Plantations Queensland, with a return on capital of half a per cent, and delivering a Health capital budget of $7 billion, we will see where he stands. The opposition leader has thus far stood criticising the government for our Health capital projects rollout, yet at the same time he has said that he does not want to privatise anything. That is of course unless you are quoting the member for ‘Santoro’ Clayfield--</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1012167"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 He has said on the record time and time again that he wants to sell the electricity assets. The simple fact of the matter is that the opposition leader does not want to sell government assets and put that money into health facilities. The simple fact of the matter is that the opposition is not committed to a Health capital building project. This government is putting its money where its mouth is, with $9.999 billion in recurrent expenditure. We will continue to build a record capital works program in Health and that will result in more and more services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012168"></A>
We had the AMA president in the media on the Sunshine Coast saying that we would not see beds delivered there for 18 months. Well, we will see the Nambour 96-bed wing completed at the end of this year. One would think the AMA--that is, the industrial wing of the Liberal Party--with people such as the Rockhampton president as a Senate candidate, would have something to say about the state budget. Yet it does not, and it never criticises at a state level Tony Abbott or indeed the LNP. Tony Abbott is a bigger critic of the LNP than the AMA is.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012169"></A>
We will continue to build our record capital works building program. The AMA wanted 3,700 beds nationally; we are delivering 1,700. In the course of about five years, we have doubled our expenditure in Queensland Health. We have 1,200 more clinical workers this year, and the best the intellect in the member for Caloundra could do was deliver volunteers working in mental health. No wonder he is not even considered as deputy leader for the LNP.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1014034"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question because we know the pressure that Queenslanders are under. Many families are doing it tough, and that is why this year’s budget provides increased support for vulnerable members of our community. As announced by the Treasurer, we are introducing a Medical Cooling and Heating Electricity Concession Scheme, worth some $216 per annum. Pensioners and seniors will also benefit from a boost to the electricity rebate, taking the rebate they can apply for to $216. The Electricity Life Support Concession Scheme will also go up to $440.30 per year for consumers using oxygen concentrators and $294.85 per annum for consumers using home kidney dialysis machines. They are some of the rebates that are providing relief for Queenslanders who need it most.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1014036"></A>
There has also been someone else talking about electricity recently, and that is the Leader of the Opposition. An extraordinary exchange took place just this morning between Madonna King and the Leader of the Opposition. It went like this--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1014037"></A>
Madonna King: You just raised electricity. Can you guarantee that electricity would be cheaper for Queenslanders if you were Premier? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1014038"></A>
Mr Langbroek: I could guarantee that tomorrow--in now less than 24 hours--I can guarantee when I do my budget reply we are going to deal with some of those costs. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1014039"></A>
Madonna King: No, that is not what I asked you, though. The question was, ‘You raised electricity, do you believe electricity prices, you could bring them down if you were made Premier?’ </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1014040"></A>
Mr Langbroek: I can guarantee that we’ll make sure our increases are not the increases we are seeing under Labor. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1014041"></A>
Madonna King: Yes, but you’re already flagging there would be increases saying that. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1014042"></A>
Mr Langbroek: Oh, I think.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1014043"></A>
He recovered shortly thereafter. He stated--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1014044"></A>
Queenslanders everywhere I go are feeling the pain from electricity and rego and we’re not going to say that we’re actually going to say we’re going to have decreases two years from now. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014045"></A>
When the pressure was put on, he squibbed it. When the simple question was asked, ‘What will you do about electricity prices,’ he had nowhere to go. Can I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that the first thing he needs to do if he is going to have an impact on electricity prices is move away from the commitment made at the last two elections to underground powerlines--an initiative that would cost $35 billion. That is $8,750 each and every year for the average Queensland household. He has to move away from that commitment that he made at the last two election campaigns before he can do anything about electricity prices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014046"></A>
We know what they are really going to do. As we heard from the member for Clayfield only a couple of years ago, those opposite not only support privatisation of the retail arm of electricity but also support selling the generators and selling the poles and wires. What I want to hear from the Leader of the Opposition tomorrow is a repudiation of what the member for Clayfield, his shadow Treasury spokesmen, said a couple of years ago in this place that they would sell the lot. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health. I refer the Deputy Premier to recent correspondence that I have had with him regarding Australian of the Year award winner and nurse Toni Hoffman who says that since the Bundaberg health crisis she has not had a decent holiday or a break because she has had to use all her official Queensland Health leave entitlements preparing for royal commissions, giving evidence to royal commission and preparing for criminal trials or giving evidence to criminal trials. Can the Deputy Premier please explain whether it is fair, moral or ethical that this government has treated a valued employee and inspirational Queenslander in this shabby manner? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014052"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I acknowledge that Toni Hoffman is a great person and that she has played a wonderful role in public issues in Queensland. I will find out what the rules are in relation to public servants giving evidence and the extent of leave that is available for them to do that. Generally when people give evidence they are entitled to witness fees and the like. If they are giving expert evidence there are different levels of fees available as well. I will have that investigated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014053"></A>
It is admirable the way the court system operates when people do their public duty and give evidence, either voluntarily or under subpoena. I am not suggesting that Ms Hoffman would have done it under subpoena; I am sure she would have done it voluntarily. I will make some inquiries in relation to that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014054"></A>
I am sure the honourable member would expect, though, that the treatment that would be provided would be equitable in all the circumstances, vis-a-vis the number of other Queensland Health employees who are giving evidence in matters. I do not want to canvass any specific issues. I know there are specific matters that are currently before the court. I will find that out and let the honourable member know. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1014061"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. The Premier and Treasurer have said it right. Education is the cornerstone for the growth of the Queensland economy and the Queensland community. That is why there is record expenditure in this year’s budget of $9.53 billion. That is up significantly--$257 million or 3.29 per cent--on the previous year. Nearly a quarter of the Queensland budget is dedicated to building this cornerstone for the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014062"></A>
That includes 316 extra teachers and teacher aides. It also includes paying the highest comparable wage rates for beginning teachers in our education system. It also pays for putting our outstanding senior teachers on a new performance pay rate that is equal to other states. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014063"></A>
I will tell members one thing: as I have been travelling around Queensland in recent months and from the feedback I have heard from the 60 or 70 forums conducted on the flying start discussion paper not one person has approached me and said, ‘Stop spending money on education in Queensland schools and spend that money on building railway lines for coal companies.’ Not one person has done that. They know where we should be investing public money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014064"></A>
The opposition has a policy--and it has recently reiterated its policy--on freezing capital works, freezing the building program in education, freezing the rollout of kindergartens and 36,000 staff to go. There has been no new policy since the reiteration of that policy. There have been no new policies, no new vision and no new ideas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014066"></A>

That is what the education portfolio is providing. That is what parents and students expect. We are delivering on that.

Mr WELLINGTON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade. I refer the minister to my statement in parliament yesterday on the proposed Woolooga-Eerwah Vale high-voltage electricity transmission line. Will the minister instruct or request Powerlink, a state owned corporation, to accept the offer from the community action group PAGE to inspect their proposed alternative corridor for the powerline and grant a 14-day extension for submissions to be made regarding the proposed powerline corridor? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. I did note his speech in the chamber yesterday and his request on behalf of his constituents for an extension of, I believe, two weeks for the receipt of submissions into the proposed Woolooga-Eerwah Vale transmission line project. Just a bit of history first. My understanding is that Powerlink has written to stakeholders, including landholders directly affected by the project, advising of its intention to seek ministerial designation as community infrastructure under the Sustainable Planning Act.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016151"></A>
Public notice was also placed in local newspapers, and during this time all interested parties have had the opportunity to make submissions on Powerlink’s proposal. As I understand it, submissions close today and hence the relevance of the member’s question. The PAGE group has raised some issues regarding Powerlink allegedly not adhering to process, including a claim that Powerlink did not write to all affected stakeholders. This is an issue that must be raised with Powerlink and I understand that that issue has in fact been raised. I have also been further advised that Powerlink responded to this claim and granted an extension to specific landholders who had not received a letter informing of the community infrastructure designation. Again, this is a matter for Powerlink and PAGE in the first instance. My role will be the assessment of the final responses to all of the issues raised. Any concerned landholders and community groups have until today to lodge their final submissions with Powerlink.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016154"></A>
I am advised the 9 June deadline was set according to the guidelines about the environmental assessment and public consultation procedures for designating land for community infrastructure which was put in place in 2006, and those guidelines are established by the Sustainable Planning Act. Powerlink’s processes are set out under schedule 5 of that document. Therefore, to grant a further extension, I am advised, would require an amendment to the Sustainable Planning Act, which I am sure the member who asked the question will agree is not practical or warranted in the circumstances. Under normal circumstances I would receive such requests and view them favourably, but given the constraints on me by the act--as I said, it is not something that I have discretion on--I certainly understand the approach that the member for Nicklin is making on behalf of his constituents. I can only encourage those constituents to make sure that they get whatever information they have to Powerlink by the close of business today.</Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Minister for Transport. Can the minister outline what the budget delivers for public transport services in Brisbane and what funding is provided by other levels of government?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016163"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I can, and I thank the member for Brisbane Central for her question. There is a stark contrast between the three levels of government in their commitment to public transport. At a federal level, while the Howard government did nothing for Queensland public transport, the Rudd government has stepped ably into the field, putting $365 million into the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project and $20 million into the development of the Cross River Rail project. At a state level, over the last five years this Labor government has more than doubled its TransLink funding from $600 million in 2004 to $1.38 billion today, and this Labor government is paying fully for the operation of each and every one of the 125 new buses that the Brisbane City Council will build this year. So when the people of Brisbane drive around and find themselves sitting behind a big new blue and yellow bus with the words ‘500 new buses for Brisbane’ on the back of it, the people of Brisbane should think that that is thanks to the state government, because this government is paying fully for the operation of those 125 new buses.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016167"></A>
There is one level of government that stands in stark contrast to the other two in terms of its contribution to public transport, and that is the one level of government which is administered by the LNP. In 2004 when Campbell Newman was elected as the Liberal Lord Mayor of Brisbane, the Brisbane City Council paid for 50 per cent of the operations of Brisbane transport, particularly Brisbane City Council buses, and that fifty-fifty split with the state was a longstanding historical arrangement. In 2010 the Brisbane City Council under the LNP administration pays just 40 per cent of the cost of Brisbane City Council buses because Campbell Newman has done to public transport what John Howard did to health: they have progressively withdrawn from their share of a funding contribution such that in 2004 the council paid 50 per cent and today it pays 40 per cent. With the Brisbane City Council’s budget being handed down today, I call on the LNP administration to match our funding contribution. If it does there would be $27 million more for better buses, which we pay for. We pay for those buses in total and in full.</Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Minister for Main Roads. Queenslanders will pay more in vehicle registration--an increase of $239 million--and a fuel tax--an increase of $500 million each year--together nearly three quarters of a billion dollars coming out of road users in Queensland.

 I rise to a point of order. Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order concerning the rulings of the House this morning with regard to anticipating debate on motions of which notice has been given. Due to the circumstances in this House, there are an increasing number of motions accumulating on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
. I would suggest that some of those motions at least have the potential, if the ruling that was given this morning is extended to all of those motions, to seriously curtail debate on the budget bills.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016190"></A>
In particular, I would draw your attention to one such notice of motion which deals with the royalties to regions question. If the interpretation of the anticipation rule is applied to that motion in the same way that it was applied to the questions that were asked this morning, I would suggest that debate on the budget bills is going to be seriously curtailed. Mr Speaker, I think there are other motions on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 which present similar problems.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016192"></A>
I would ask you, Mr Speaker, to either reconsider the rulings that were given this morning by a formal notice to this House or to refer this issue as a matter of urgency to the Standing Orders Committee so that debate on the budget bills can proceed in the traditional way without being curtailed by the precedent that has been set this morning by this ruling.</Hansard-Body>

 after 30 days. Nevertheless, it is always my intention to allow both sides maximum discussion. I will get back to you in a fully considered way, and that is what I intend to do.

 (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition) (11.39 am): After seeing the performance by the member for Thuringowa and the member for Mount Coot-tha, I think there must have been something in the water in 2004 when they came into this place. What we have learned from the budget, which we are discussing now, is that you cannot believe a word this government says. On the cusp of a federal election, it will do and say anything and, as we make a detailed analysis of the budget, we will see that it will hide everything.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1022223"></A>
We have now had different reasons from the Treasurer about privatisation. Over the past couple of years privatisation has been about delivering better services for Queenslanders, repaying debt and replacing the lost income. But of course, the government has its income back and now it is all about restoring the AAA credit rating. I note that today the Treasurer says that the $603 million from the sale of Forestry Plantations will provide services to disadvantaged families in Logan and Beenleigh. So privatisation is not about repaying debt. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1022225"></A>
This morning on ABC Radio the Treasurer came out with the statement that householders in Queensland are probably spending less because they incurred too much debt, which they put on themselves during the boom years. That is exactly what this state has done. But of course, the Treasurer does not acknowledge anything like that. All he comes out with is statements such as ‘brick by brick’, ‘tough road to hoe’ and ‘it is not a blockbuster fairytale but one that turns the page’. He also says, ‘The task is not done.’ This morning the Treasurer also said, ‘It is a theoretical proposition that has not been undertaken so that makes it of no real utility’, ‘The bigger they come the harder they fall,’ and ‘climb down out of their trees’. This morning he also said that the budget was ‘a helping hand to those who need it most, as is our calling’. He thinks he is Churchill. Then we heard him say, ‘The budget will stand the test of the time’--of course, until the midyear economic fiscal review. The Treasurer also says, ‘It will require our resolve--something we have in spades’, ‘roll up the sleeves’ and ‘do the hard yards’. That is all we get from the Treasurer: words, not action. </Hansard-Body>

 (Waterford--ALP) (11.41 am): To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, to lose one candidate may be regarded as misfortune but to lose two members of the Queensland parliament, a member of the federal parliament, two candidates and a councillor looks like the rabble of the Liberal National Party. This morning I rise to welcome the member for Gregory, Vaughan Johnson, back to this place for another sitting week. I must say to the member for Gregory that, after the last sitting week, I did not think he would make it back. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022231"></A>
During the last sitting week Queensland watched in amazement as the LNP started leaking all of its dirty laundry about Michael Johnson, the then LNP member for Ryan. There were allegations of secret commissions, fundraising for flowers and, of course, the ever-suspicious purchase of a scooter. Everything that Bruce McIver and the bovver boys of the LNP could leak on Johnson they did. But by Thursday it was all over and Johnson had been expelled. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022235"></A>
But then the LNP started on Johnston. The LNP started tipping the bucket on her, too--Nicole Johnston, LNP member on the Brisbane City Council team. Allegations that she pushed over a chair were wielded and then Johnston was gone from the LNP. Councillor Johnston quit before being pushed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022237"></A>
With the LNP Councillor Johnston gone and the federal LNP member Michael Johnson being expelled, I was worried that poor state MP Vaughan Johnson would not be back or would be sitting up the back of this chamber this week. I thought that the Johnson faction of the LNP was not doing too well after the last week’s sitting. But maybe, coming from the National Party, Vaughan Johnson has Bruce McIver on his side, leaving him the last Johnson standing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022238"></A>
With the opposition leader hiding from the cameras during the last sitting week, who would have thought it could have got worse? On Monday night the LNP lost another one. Good old Bruce McIver was at it again. Federal LNP candidate Hajnal Ban was disendorsed after a tribunal finding that she had used a power of attorney and mixed her own moneys with moneys of a resident of the Talbarra nursing home at Waterford. </Hansard-Body>

 (Maroochydore--LNP) (11.43 am): During the last election campaign the Bligh government promised Queenslanders a jobs plan but, 12 months on, no plan has been announced for the Sunshine Coast. With regard to jobs, this region has been ignored by this government. I ask the Premier: where are our jobs? Or has the Premier forgotten that it is small business that provides the majority of these jobs? Those small businesses now have record business costs imposed on them by her government: water, power, vehicle costs, registration, petrol, increasing council levies and other charges. In fact, most regions of Queensland have seen no economic strategy and jobs plan from this government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022247"></A>
The SEQ Regional Plan and accompanying investment time frames in SEQIPP do not cater for growth. But this is a doubly cruel hoax when we realise that there is no economic strategy accompanying the land use strategy. The same is true for the Sunshine Coast Regional Council’s current draft Maroochydore structure plan, which is anti investment and jobs. I table separately a number of documents relating to the commercial uptake of property, the transport department’s own projections as to where jobs will be generated versus where the population has grown, the business confidence survey and UDIA’s commercial analysis.</Hansard-Body>

We see now that the Sunshine Coast has double the population growth compared to the jobs growth. That means that, without a genuine, coordinated and focused jobs plan for the region, people will be commuting to Brisbane and elsewhere for a job. That is happening now. I am fighting for a sustainable Sunshine Coast--sustainable for the environment and the lifestyle and the businesses that supply the jobs in the local economy. Without this plan from the government we will continue to see people losing their jobs, leaving the region and facing increased costs. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(11.45 am): Six months ago, upon my request, the Minister for Sport, Phil Reeves, visited the Centenary Rowing Club during their early morning training on the river at Jindalee. Members of the club have been meeting at this spot, affectionately called the ‘mudhole’, for many years to undertake training and competitions. This area is on land that is leased from the council by the scouts and is directly behind the scout hut. The scouts have been generous in allowing the rowing club to share this area for the benefit of the young people who are involved in the sport until they establish their own facility at the end of Sumners Road. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022259"></A>
The minister announced on his visit that his department would be providing a major facilities grant of $390,000 to construct this new clubhouse. This funding is in addition to a previous Sport and Recreation grant to construct a state-of-the-art pontoon at the Sumners Road site in 2009. At their trophy presentation a number of weeks ago members advised me that there were extra unexpected expenses that appeared to have been overlooked by the council during the development application process, which took several years. They recently discovered building waste material on the western part of the site, which had been an illegal tip. The waste had to be removed and replaced with fill. There also have been extra expenses for the extension and expansion of water, sewerage and power facilities to the property boundary, requiring them to redesign and reprogram these works.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022261"></A>
These costs are unavoidable and are needed to complete stage 1 of the project. As a supporter of the hundreds of young people from both public and private schools who are passionate about rowing, I have spoken to the minister about the need for extra funds and I have formally written to him to detail the club’s current dilemma. It would be a tragedy if, after the years of work and achievements of the club, the facility could not be completed because of these unexpected costs. The club has built its reputation through its enthusiastic volunteers, its achievements, its fierce competition and successes in rowing and through providing opportunities for young people from public schools to partake in the sport. I again call on the Minister for Sport to give consideration to the club’s unexpected costs and to provide the extra funds to ensure that these young rowers continue to flourish. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Caloundra--LNP) (11.47 am): I rise to speak in relation to an important determination that will be made shortly by the Sunshine Coast Regional Council--that is, whether the airport at Caloundra, which includes surrounding businesses, will be sold. The airport and the surrounding businesses are located on land that is owned by the state government, of which the council is the trustee. This government has placed upon the council the obligation to decide whether this land is to go to the private market and the moneys used elsewhere. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022265"></A>
I point out to the House that three entities operate on that site. There is the airport itself and those businesses, there is the Queensland Air Museum and, adjacent to the Air Museum, the air cadets. The air cadets organisation is run by the RAAF. It mentors young people between the ages of 13 and 18 on leadership, being part of a team, understanding right from wrong, and developing into strong citizens. If this airport and its precinct are sold, these young men and women, who come from right across the Sunshine Coast to attend air cadet meetings every Monday night at this training facility, will be left without any home base whatsoever. If we believe in providing young people with strong initiative, strong direction and a strong understanding of their role in society, we should be ensuring that this organisation of young men and women stays exactly where it is. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022267"></A>
The air cadets site is located adjacent to the Queensland Air Museum, which is an organisation that holds one of the most important collections of aircraft and memorabilia from across this nation--going from the early flying days of the 1900s right through to the present. It would be an absolute crime for these two facilities to be sold in any way, shape or form. They must stay exactly where they are. I am told that the airport supports 225 people and their families. Every single day they pour school fees et cetera into our economy. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Yeerongpilly--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(11.49 am): Queensland Rail’s new rail welding facility at Yeerongpilly is at the cutting edge of rail technology and producing a world-class product that services public and private sector customers across the country. Construction of this new facility commenced in January 2008 with completion in March this year. Currently, finetuning of the operation is underway, with commissioning of this $35 million facility set for this month. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022307"></A>
Last week I inspected the plant, met with staff and observed the production process. What I saw was a rail welding workshop that is the most advanced of its kind in Queensland and with a capacity to supply all rail requirements of Queensland projects over the next 25 years. With dual gauge access rail can be transported in and out of the facility for customers across the country, with all types of rail product able to be welded at the factory. Whilst I was there I observed production of 110-metre lengths of rail which involves four pieces of rail unloaded, cleaned, welded, ground and reloaded for shipment. This complete production line of 110-metre lengths, with three welds and a weld standard within a half millimetre tolerance, takes 20 minutes in the current facility with future capacity to enable welded rail links of 330 metres. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022308"></A>
But the most impressive aspect of the facility is the welding technology which enables separation of staff and plant by incorporating computerised systems and world-leading plant and machinery. This provides a safe workplace, with workers able to monitor and control production from a work station separated from the welding activities. With a focus on zero harm, Queensland Rail has developed a facility and implemented procedures that deliver on this government’s commitment to zero harm at work. I commend Queensland Rail for its focus on safety in the facility. This contributes significantly to workers’ health and job satisfaction as well as production of a high standard product which is in demand across Australia. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(11.50 am): The government’s green paper <Hansard-Italic>
Flying Start</Hansard-Italic>
 proposes that grade 7 be moved into high school. Nowhere in that green paper does it ask people their opinion on middle schooling as a way of dealing with that dramatic change for young Queenslanders. The LNP is committed to quality education in Queensland. We note that if this change goes ahead children entering high school here will be much younger than they are in the other states. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022312"></A>
Middle schooling should be considered as an option. The private sector has extensively used middle schooling and students have been able to obtain that benefit. It is one of the reasons why we see a drift away to the private sector. This government is so disinterested that in its budget brought down yesterday it deleted all information about the middle years of schooling. There was not even the number of students in the middle years of schooling. No wonder it was not prepared to give Queenslanders the opportunity to discuss middle schooling in the context of moving grade 7. It has lost touch with the issues that are important in education. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022313"></A>
Middle schooling must be an option made available to the school communities in Queensland to consider. It should be included. The LNP will today release its discussion paper on middle schooling. The government did not ask Queensland parents and teachers to comment on middle schooling, but the LNP wants to know what parents, teachers and education stakeholders think about middle schooling as a way of dealing with the transition to high school.</Hansard-Body>

Ms O’NEILL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kallangur--ALP) (11.52 am): World Environment Day has just passed with the theme of Many Species, One Planet, One Future. The theme echoes the urgent call to conserve the diversity of life on our planet. Moreton Bay Marine Park is one of Queensland’s most important natural, recreational, cultural and economic resources, and the bay’s popularity for boating and fishing is rapidly increasing. While we all enjoy the bay, our enjoyment is having an impact on one of our at-risk species, the dugong. Years of research and observation of dugong in Moreton Bay has found that it is an important feeding area and the only place in the world where dugong still live on the doorstep of a major city. There are 600 to 800 dugong that live here.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022318"></A>
Dugong are prone to boat strike and Moreton Bay is a hot spot for boat strikes. Half of the incidents recorded along the Queensland coast occur in Moreton Bay. Our Department of Environment and Resource Management has the Nature Conservation (Dugong) Conservation Plan, which includes speed limits in designated areas. Unfortunately, as dugong are rarely seen from boats not everyone obeys the rules, resulting in boat strike. The member for Redcliffe invited me to the launch of the Hays Inlet Festival where I was fortunate to see a presentation by a regional manager of Parks and Wildlife which showed aerial vision of boats on the bay and clear vision of a herd of dugong underneath. It was easy to see why boat strike happens. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022319"></A>
Dugong are slow but move out of the way if the boat is going slow; they have no chance if the boat is going fast. The footage made it so clear that I am sure that if it were possible to include this vision or pictures in the accredited boat licence training we would see more boaties adhere to the speed limits. We are fortunate to have a fabulous recreation area on our doorstep and we can all do our bit. I urge all those lucky people who use Moreton Bay to think of the turtles and dugong underneath and obey the rules and slow down where requested.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr STEVENS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mermaid Beach--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(11.54 am): I rise to bring to the attention of the House the increasing problem and recent developments concerning the issue of short-term holiday rentals in residential areas. As this problem is quite clearly the operation of a tourism business in a normal residential zoned local authority area, I have focused my attention on the Gold Coast City Council. With constituent support we were able to influence the local council to create a task force in an attempt to tackle this worsening issue. The Task Force on Short-Term Holiday Accommodation in Residential Areas is comprised of representatives from the community and various stakeholders in a bid to tackle this major community issue. I thank the mayor of the Gold Coast, Ron Clarke, for his efforts in establishing this task force. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022323"></A>
People who have bought property in what was thought to be a quiet suburban community have been shocked to find their suburb riddled with holiday homes that see their neighbours changing every week and sometimes three times a week. These types of short-term rentals are often let to party groups hosting events such as rowdy bachelor parties, birthday celebrations and out-of-control parties that may go on all week. One couple, who have complained several times to police, have to now keep their grandchildren inside when they visit for fear of them viewing crude acts, such as nudity and foul language that continues night and day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022324"></A>
I am happy to say that these problems will hopefully become an issue of the past once the task force has had time to liaise with stakeholders and make recommendations on rectifying this problem. The task force aims to present a solution to the permanent residents of these problem areas and get a return to the quiet residential communities that they bought into. Mayor Clarke has invoked a sunset clause of four meetings only for this task force to meet to arrive at a remedy for the problem. I congratulate the Gold Coast City Council for taking the initiative to start tackling this issue and I look forward to complete support from the state government in implementing any legislative requirements necessary to eradicate this inappropriate and illegal business activity in otherwise normal residential suburban areas. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr KILBURN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Chatsworth--ALP) (11.56 am): The people of Chatsworth are strong supporters of public transport. Since the introduction of the go card many people throughout my electorate have purchased go cards to benefit from the lower costs of travel as well as the convenience of using the go card. From the time that I was elected I have lobbied hard to increase public transport throughout the electorate. I am pleased that this government has been listening. We have increased services to Camp Hill, Carina and Carindale and I have seen the development of the park-and-ride service at the Sleeman Centre which has improved access to bus services for people living in the Gumdale, Belmont and Wakerley areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022328"></A>
This government is also delivering on the South East Busway, a commitment of over $456 million. This busway is moving towards my electorate and will provide significant improvements in comfort and reliability to the many Chatsworth residents who travel to the city each day. Not only that, I am sure that it will be welcomed by the drivers who work in the Carina area. It is time that the federal government matched this government’s commitment to the busway. I have joined with the members for Bulimba, Greenslopes and Capalaba in lobbying our federal counterparts to commit to provide funding for this important job. The south-east suburbs of Brisbane are growing rapidly and we need to ensure that the public transport infrastructure matches this growth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022329"></A>
I have mentioned that the number of go card users is increasing and growing and we need to ensure that we make it easy for them to purchase and top up go cards. I understand that any new system will take time to fully implement. However, it is important that go card top-up facilities are available in areas that suit the user. In my electorate, Carina News at Carina and Burstall News in Belmont have been waiting for a number of months for TransLink to provide the equipment to allow them to top up go cards. I have recently written to the minister to ask her department to develop options for delivering the equipment needed to provide go card top-up facilities more quickly. Due to the significant number of public transport users in the Camp Hill-Carina-Carina Heights area, I ask that these top-up facilities be provided to Carina as a matter of priority. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr RICKUSS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lockyer--LNP) (11.58 am): I rise to highlight some issues in the Ebenezer-Willowbank area. It is encouraging to see the minister for DIP in the chamber. I am sure that the Minister for Transport, Minister Nolan, will be most interested in this as well. The state government has put up Ebenezer-Willowbank as a major industrial area. Some planning for that is in place. However, the minister must take note of the fact that there is a substantial urban population at Willowbank. Those people have lived there for a long time and it is important that their issues are taken into account, particularly the fact that an access road to Ebenezer Road will need to be built prior to the development of the industrial land, otherwise there will be too much disturbance to urbanisation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022372"></A>
Another issue relates to Mutdapilly South Ebenezer. I implore the minister’s department to refer to the area as Mutdapilly South Ebenezer because there is confusion about Ebenezer and South Ebenezer, especially in relation to the weasel words used about the difficult-to-locate, high-impact, large-footprint industries--in other words, the stinky, smelly, noxious industries. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022373"></A>
I have surveyed my electorate. I have written to about 50 or 60 residents of the area, which also covers parts of the electorate of Beaudesert. I have received an overwhelming response of negativity about the impacts from this issue. It is really important. It was highlighted again this morning when the environment minister spoke about the Ace Waste incinerator burning medical waste at Willowbank and the buffer that is required. Those sorts of issues will come up. I implore the minister to make sure that people’s private land is not used for a buffer. The buffer must be used by the people who have the facility. </Hansard-Body>

Ms FARMER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bulimba--ALP) (12.00 pm): The budget that was handed down yesterday by the Treasurer delivered on the Bligh government’s commitment to a strong economy for Queensland. I was very happy to see that the Bulimba electorate will continue to play a key part in that commitment, particularly with regard to attracting new investment to our state. I refer particularly to the funding that has been allocated in the budget towards the Aerospace Centre for Excellence. After a decade of unprecedented industry growth, the government’s vision for Queensland as an aviation and aerospace hub for the Asia-Pacific region is fast becoming a reality. This is strongly supported by initiatives such as the Aerospace Centre for Excellence.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022382"></A>
Through the government’s Queensland Investment Incentives Scheme, Raytheon Australia has been funded to establish the centre, incorporating an aerospace headquarters facility in Murarrie. Since July 1998 the incentives scheme has supported the creation and retention of 25,135 full-time jobs with companies that have invested capital expenditure of $1.736 billion in Queensland. Many more jobs have resulted from in-kind support from Invest Queensland. In the case of Raytheon, financial support was given to the company for the relocation of staff, training and payroll tax rebates. Among the top four defence contractors in the country, Raytheon employs some 1,100 people nationwide. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022384"></A>
The establishment of the centre in Murarrie will expand Queensland’s already impressive aerospace capabilities, with our state now regarded as the centre for Australia’s aerospace industry and with almost 30 per cent of Australia’s aviation firms now located here. Businesses in the Bulimba electorate have and will in the future, thanks to the initiatives announced in the budget, receive abundant support from the Queensland government. Our local partnerships only enhance this support, and I make special mention of the South East Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, headed by the redoubtable Penny Cutting, which recently celebrated membership of 100. This is a remarkable achievement that clearly reflects its determination to be relevant to small business in our area. Together with the members for Greenslopes and Chatsworth, I have been working with the chamber to help develop the potential of our local small and medium sized businesses, with the excellent support that is available from the Queensland government. With small business being the largest employer in our state, the government’s focus on building its potential is a key plank of our plan to build a stronger economy. I congratulate the chamber, Raytheon and the Treasurer. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr DICKSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Buderim--LNP) (12.02 pm): I rise to speak in order to offer support to the remaining 2.9 million consumers of nicotine based products in Australia. At the same time, I would like to ask you all to give up. I did. Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Australia. Each year more than 15,000 Australians die from smoking. The figure exceeds the combined total of deaths caused by motor vehicle accidents, homicide, suicide, breast cancer, AIDS and illicit drug use. Half of all long-term smokers are likely to die because of smoking. Long-term smokers lose an average 13 years of life compared to nonsmokers. Even when smoking is not fatal, smoking related disease and disability causes distress and leads to reduced quality of life for smokers, their families and their friends for many years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022389"></A>
I am a former smoker. Fortunately, I was able to beat the habit several years ago. The cost of smoking to the community in terms of loss of life and the financial cost to the health system is quite overwhelming. However, the smoking industry claims there is a benefit for the economy. An independent report released last year details an analysis of economic arguments put forward by the tobacco industry. The report, prepared by two health economists, assessed the economic impact of both the tobacco industry and public health measures aimed at reducing tobacco use. It put the economic contribution of the tobacco industry at about $1 billion a year but the estimated social costs of smoking at $31 billion per year--yes, $31 billion per year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022390"></A>
World No Smoking Day was 31 May. I encourage all remaining Australians who smoke to seriously consider giving up. You owe it to yourself! Something that the federal government may need to take on board is this: if it is serious about stopping smoking in this country there is only one course of action, and that is to ban the sale of cigarettes. The government continues to take the revenue on board, but it is putting people’s lives at risk every day. All people in politics need to take that on board. If we are serious about stopping smoking and saving money, kill the subject and not the people. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr WATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Everton--ALP) (12.04 pm): Let’s face it: a lot of Queensland men do not live a healthy lifestyle. Many of us would rather eat a meat pie and chips at the footy than do some exercise. The life expectancy of Australian men is up there with the best in the world, but Australian males die, on average, five years younger than women. Next week is International Men’s Health Week and there is no better time for men to think about how we can live longer and healthier lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022396"></A>
The Bligh government cares deeply about men’s health, and this year our government will take unprecedented action to emphasise the importance of men having regular health checks. Next week I will host a ceremony to recognise people who have made a contribution to boosting men’s health in Queensland. Those to be recognised will include doctors, nurses, public health experts and men’s health advocacy groups. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022397"></A>
However, the highlight of Men’s Health Week will be the Pit Stop free men’s health checks at five Bunnings stores in South-East Queensland. Men visiting those stores will be able to put their bodies through the pits, in a manner similar to taking their cars for a service. Men will be able to get free health checks for their chassis, or weight; their oil pressure, or blood pressure; their duco, or skin; fuel additives or exhaust, or alcohol and/or smoking; and--two that will provide a lot of interest--their extractor, to test for bowel cancer; and their spark plugs, to test for testicular cancer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022398"></A>
I can assure members that none of the tests is invasive! Men who pass through most of the health stations will get a roadworthy certificate. Those who do not will get advice on what they can do to improve their health. Further Pit Stops will be rolled out across Queensland later in the year, and I encourage all men to take up the offer of a free health check. I say to Queensland men: put yourselves in the driver’s seat this Men’s Health Week and take the time to have your ‘parts’ checked. It could save your life. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs PRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nanango--Ind) (12.05 pm): Recently a constituent came to see me, very concerned that a police raid has been conducted on her home. The raid occurred on Thursday while she was at work and, naturally, she felt violated, as any law-abiding citizen would. She also felt helpless because not only had she been unable to find the answers to the questions she had, because the local police station was closed until the following Tuesday, but also when she did manage to get to talk to someone she was informed that ‘they had received information from the public’. Being a resident of a very small town, the raid was witnessed by many and the ensuing gossip was devastating. If she were guilty of any offence I would be among the many to condemn her. However, for someone who is innocent this would have been an extraordinarily humiliating ordeal, regardless of the truth of the--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022406"></A>
The major concern is that the constituent is now on record for having her home raided by the police because they believed they had sufficient evidence to cast doubt about her activities and a record will be triggered every time the police get suspicious of drugs in the area. After talking with police, my constituent wrote--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1022409"></A>
I have taken home the impression that the evidence was my purchase of Chemists’ Own sinus and hayfever tablets. Apparently these can be used to manufacture the drug the police were looking for. Because I have to keep using this medication, I can probably expect to be searched regularly. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022410"></A>
I find it is somewhat worrying that the legal purchase of medication can trigger such serious police action. The fight against crime should not be as intolerable as the crime itself. This constituent abhors drugs and understands that drug proliferation must be fought at every turn. However, it is regrettable that people get swept along and caught up in the mess. Surely they are not guilty until they are proven to be guilty, and if she cannot be proven guilty my constituent needs an apology. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr HOBBS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Warrego--LNP) (12.09 pm): I rise today to speak on the City of Brisbane Bill 2010. This is an historical bill insofar as the current City of Brisbane Act is 86 years old. Brisbane City was proclaimed a municipality in September 1859, over 151 years ago. That is quite a long time ago.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022462"></A>
Brisbane is our capital city and we love it. Brisbane, I believe, is a very liveable city, and we have grown to like it, to love it and to understand the parts of it that are so important to us. Of course much has changed over the years in the development of this great city. I can recall coming in here in the seventies and the smog would be over the city from the burning of wood fires, wood stoves and suchlike, and that has all changed. The river itself has changed. It is a lot cleaner. Conditions in relation to stormwater run-off and that type of thing have certainly improved the quality of the environment around our city. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022465"></A>
The lack of infrastructure is an issue that dogs every city, some worse than others. I think here in this state, and certainly in Brisbane, the lack of infrastructure has caused a lot of heartache for a lot of people. We have recently been through a water shortage, with water restrictions and expensive pipelines put in place, and that has been an enormous burden on the public. It has also been an enormous cost when you consider the ramifications of that rushed infrastructure. It was certainly necessary but very, very costly to the end user. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022466"></A>
The state population policy is an issue that I will cover soon. I do not believe that we have managed that well. We have not understood the real implications of the population boom that we have had and the needs of the community and the importance of putting in place infrastructure to manage the increasing number of people and the changing lifestyles. I congratulate Campbell Newman and his LNP team--and in fact all of the councils over many, many years--that have put a big effort into improving Brisbane, improving the livability of this great city. I commend the foresight of the recent council with the building of tunnels--obviously we have to go underground now. It would have been far better if we had made the roads much wider and had a lot more foresight, but that is the way cities are built. There will certainly be improved traffic flow once the tunnels are all completed. The CityCat has also been a wonderful service provided to our commuters, our visitors, our tourists, and the general commerce of the city. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022469"></A>
Brisbane City is the largest provider of local government services in this state, with 26 councillors and the mayor. So it is a significant local government--I believe with its budget it is probably bigger than Tasmania. It certainly has a lot of differences in relation to other local governments across this state. The Queensland Constitution establishes a Queensland system of local government, and the local government system sustains the social fabric of our communities. As I mentioned, these communities are experiencing rapid change. The Constitution that we have recognises local government. I would like to see local government further recognised in our Constitution--and in fact entrenched in our Constitution so that governments in the future cannot change too much about local government without at least having a review by the people of Queensland. I think that is something we can reconsider down the track. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022470"></A>
With these rapid changes and the need for us to have the legislation that we are dealing with today, we need to understand the challenges that we have for the future. With our population studies, we need to understand where we are going. Over the past 40 years the population has grown at an average annual rate of 1.4 per cent per annum, taking the overall Australian population to 22 million in 2010. Over the next 40 years, the rate of population growth is expected to slow to 1.2 per cent on average per annum. In 2010, there will be an estimated five people of traditional working age for every person aged 65 and over. By 2050, only 2.7 people of traditional working age are projected for every person aged 65 years and over. There is going to be a significant change in the age of our people. We have an ageing population and we need to have the infrastructure to manage that change. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Challenges to population growth can be managed provided governments continue to plan well ahead of time for infrastructure, housing and service delivery needs. The important thing is that in Brisbane itself the population growth, by selected local government areas, is quite high. From 2003 to 2008, Brisbane had a percentage growth of 1.8 per cent. There are higher growth rates throughout the state, the likes of Mackay, Gladstone, Cairns and of course the Fraser Coast, which is screaming along at 3.9 per cent. So there are significant population increases throughout other parts of the state. But Brisbane itself is what we are dealing with today. Even that 1.8 per cent is still a significant increase that we need to be able to manage. </Hansard-Body>

Population forecasts for Queensland, taking into account likely job growth and demand for migration from elsewhere, suggest that by 2031 total state population will be in the order of 6.3 million and the South-East Queensland population will be in the order of 4.2 million. So we are likely to have 4.2 million here in the south-east corner. Such forecasts will lead to concerns, especially among parts of the population of South-East Queensland, that continued population growth in the state or at least in the south-east is not sustainable, and the quality of life of Queenslanders is reducing as the pressure of growth demands new and challenging growth management measures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022476"></A>
Clearly we have to have a good population policy. I know some work has been done in recent times. The LGAQ instigated a study. The government has talked about its growth summit and so forth. So it is on the agenda. But the reality is that we have to have a really good policy, not just words. We need to have something that really works. Effective monitoring of land and housing supply and demand is essential to identify where there is a need for government intervention or initiatives to enhance affordability. That is certainly an issue that we need to consider. There is also enormous industrial growth, particularly in other parts of the state, with minerals and petroleum. </Hansard-Body>

Government changes have caused a lot of concern to local governments across this state and the Brisbane City Council is no different. In a lot of ways I do not think we have been able to manage that change well. There certainly has not been a lot of consultation in the past with local governments about change. This bill before the House today is probably an exception where there has been considerable consultation and, believe it or not, pretty much universal agreement in relation to this bill. That is very welcome. It can be done. It is easy to do if you do it right. If governments want to go out there and try to bulldoze their way through, there are going to be repercussions down the track. Eventually it just will not work because if governments have not consulted correctly then they have not done the job right and that will result in bad legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025488"></A>
The amalgamations across the state were not handled well. The subsidy withdrawal was announced in the budget last year and it is certainly shown in this year’s budget, where this is the last year for a lot of those water and subsidy grants that were available to local governments. This will have an enormous impact on local governments and it will have other flow-on consequences. This bill itself talks about long-term planning, yet we have governments that keep on changing the rules. I think that is very hard. How can local governments possibly plan ahead when the major component of their funding is in fact changed? It was changed last year virtually overnight. Those are some very important issues that we need to acknowledge. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025491"></A>
The bill establishes and provides the powers, responsibilities, obligations and requirements for Brisbane’s system of local government. This bill again is principles based legislation. It focuses on outcomes and develops the local government’s own operational procedures and processes. Basically, we will have a smaller bill and we will have more regulations. It is very important that those regulations are tested. I understand they will all come into being on 1 July this year, which is not very far away, and I understand that those regulations are being tested. We need to ensure that the regulations work well. We have to trust that is happening, and I understand that it is. We hope there is a high level of compliance in relation to principles based legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025492"></A>
The bill before the House covers a wide range of local government activities and responsibilities, and I will try to touch on a few of those. The bill maintains the Brisbane City Council as a body corporate, which of course is good and that is how it should be. Other councils in Queensland have not got that status. It was taken away from them for a political reason and it certainly should not have been. They should have that corporation status returned to them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025493"></A>
The bill mentions the power to conduct joint local government activities. Of course we have our ROCs, our Council of Mayors, and other entities that are important for a city like Brisbane, and they need to be able to carry on that work. The bill covers the responsibilities of councillors, and that is important as well. Councillors make up a collection of elected members that constitute the council’s executive arm. The council appoints a CEO to implement the decisions of the executive arm by overseeing the work of officers of the council in the administrative arm.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025494"></A>
The mayor’s responsibilities include being the agent between the executive and officers of the council by directing the CEO and senior contract employees. This is a model that has been used across the state. To a certain degree, it is hard to change from that but there are some problems with this that I would like to quickly deal with in the House today. At the end of the day, councillors are elected and they need to be able to deliver the type of local government that their people want. It is often difficult if there is a bunch of bureaucrats, I suppose you could call them, in there who cannot shift from their certain views. I am not saying that councils are trying to go outside the law or whatever the case may be, but the reality is that at the end of the day the elected officials should be able to deliver a local government that the people in their area want, not necessarily what some people within the departments think they should have. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025495"></A>
There are some rumblings out there in Queensland that councillors are starting to believe that they are being snowed, that they are not being told the full facts. I think there will be ramifications of that down the track, so we need to watch this space to ensure that we fully understand where we are going with this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025496"></A>
The bill details the responsibilities of councillors, including the mayor, who must have a strategic approach, similar to a board of directors. That is okay in principle, but as I said before, I think there could be some issues with that which we need to watch. It is incumbent on the CEO to develop with the mayor a very good working relationship. That is often the secret in these situations. If there is a good working relationship between particularly the CEO and the councillors, then things can run a lot more smoothly. If there is conflict, there are often many problems. The bill also deals with wards. There are 26 wards and if there is any change to that, it has to come before the parliament. That seems to be quite a good way to deal with that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025497"></A>
There is some controversy in relation to the powers of the Establishment and Coordination Committee, and I will deal with that later. This bill actually recognises that committee. It gives statutory recognition to the committee that is presently a standing committee of council. In relation to the chairperson of the council, the bill recognises the parliamentary nature of council and recognises the appointment by resolution of a chairperson of the council to preside at all council meetings. It is different to what other councils have, so I think it is important we fully understand that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025498"></A>
The bill deals with the local law-making process, and that is particularly important. Councils need to ensure that their local laws reflect the opinions of their communities. The minister has the right to oversee those local laws and will advise if they can proceed. Those laws must satisfy any conditions imposed by the minister to ensure the overall state interest is dealt with satisfactorily. Also, councils have to ensure they do a regular review. I was a councillor and chairman for a long time, and these things can often slip by and councils do end up with some very old local laws that certainly get a bit behind. It is important that they are regularly updated.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025499"></A>
There are a number of other issues dealt with in the bill, including a councillor’s discretionary funds. This issue has made the news in recent times. These have to be clearly defined and must be used only as prescribed in a regulation. Councillors should recognise that it is important they make sure they do this right. Another matter is that the chief executive officer is not subject to direction. Again, the mayor must have a good working relationship with the chief executive officer. It is important that occurs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025500"></A>
The bill deals with the qualifications of councillors. A person who wants to stand for council must be a resident of and a registered elector in Brisbane and not be disqualified based on any other clause, which can be bankruptcy or other issues. It is particularly important that they are able to do that. One element which is wrong in the legislation--and this is a philosophical debate between both sides of the House--is that if you are applying to be a member of the Queensland parliament you cannot remain in local government. In fact, you can stand for the federal parliament and not lose your job as a councillor. We know the reason why that is the case--that is, the majority of councillors who come into parliament are conservative. Anyway, that is the way it is and we will change that one day. I think local government is a good grounding for parliamentarians because they know the process. We also get far better quality parliamentarians. It can be done.</Hansard-Body>

An issue that has caused a lot of controversy is giving direction to council staff. This is an issue that we need to be talk about a bit. I agree with the fact that you cannot have everybody giving directions. Directions have to come from the mayor and CEO and then go down the line. At the end of the day, we need to make sure that this works effectively. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025534"></A>
As I mentioned before, there is an issue that I want to cover that is particularly controversial. That is the amendments to the Right to Information Act. People need to be aware that councils like cabinets are able to put information aside for 10 years so it cannot be viewed. That provision has always been there in relation to committee work. It has been extended now to include the budgetary process and extended to all councils in this state. I do not think it necessarily needs to cover the whole state but it will. I am agreeing to this on the basis that the councils are now so big that they probably do need this provision. With smaller councils they do not need to restrict information. Once we have councils as big as the Brisbane City Council that are basically political they need to have a reasonable working structure that allows them to get on with their job without a sideshow going on and people trying to disrupt the process. That does happen. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025536"></A>
It is important that the information is still provided. I would encourage many of the councils throughout the state not to use this provision. They do not have to if they do not want to. It is up to them. If they need to use this provision then it is there for them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025537"></A>
There are a lot of provisions in this bill that we could talk about for a long time. However, the time for the consideration of this bill is restricted, which is disappointing. We should be able to allow all members of the parliament to debate the bill in detail. This is a major bill that will impact on a lot of ratepayers. A lot of members of this parliament represent people in this great city of Brisbane. It is important that they talk about the issues that are important to them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025538"></A>
This bill is basically an update of the existing legislation which uses modern terms. As I said, the consultation has been effective. I think this legislation will go all right, and I certainly hope it does. The Brisbane City Council is a good council. It is one that is progressing well. There is certainly a lot more work to do. I wish them all the best in that regard. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr NICHOLLS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Clayfield--LNP) (12.33 pm): I want to make a short contribution to the City of Brisbane Bill that is being debated here today. It has often been said, and I am sure will continue to be said, that local government is the layer of government that is closest to the people, is the most involved in the delivery of services to the people and affects people most in their day-to-day lives. I speak with a degree of knowledge of the Brisbane City Council having spent six years in that place--four of them under a Labor administration--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will deal with some of the history as well for the member for Stafford’s illumination. I had three years under Campbell Newman and the Liberal-Labor administration. The detail that we are dealing with here today is in relation to the administration and administrative principles that apply to the legislation about the constitution of the City of Brisbane. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025544"></A>
It is interesting when we look back at the history of the City of Brisbane to see the arguments that were put forward in the early part of the 20th century about why we should have a greater city of Brisbane and a City of Brisbane council. It was really a debate that was carried out in the newspapers of the time. The <Hansard-Italic>
Moreton Bay Courier</Hansard-Italic>
 and others were very strong advocates of creating a greater Brisbane city council. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025547"></A>
The bill before us today replaces the City of Brisbane Act 1924--the original piece of legislation. Those members who have had the necessity or the pleasure to plough through its pages would certainly have learnt a lot about the improvements in drafting of legislation over the last 90-odd years and a lot about how lawyers can charge so much money for making so little sense out of something that is so convoluted. This bill replaces that act and incorporates some regulations from 2004 which sought to update that act. This bill will bring the local law-making process up to speed and reflect modern drafting practices and modern terminology. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025549"></A>
This bill also deals with some aspects of the Local Government (Chinatown and Valley Malls) Act and the Local Government (Queen Street Mall) Act which were special parts of the legislation brought in to allow the council to do certain things, including building the Queen Street Mall--that great success which was started under a Labor administration. No-one would quibble with the outcomes of that. The Valley Mall and the Chinatown Mall might be subject to more contentious contemporary debate but anyone who has been to the Chinatown Mall would agree that the outcome is a big improvement over what was a tired and rundown mall. The process of getting there was perhaps a little longer than most people would have liked. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025552"></A>
The original City of Brisbane Act 1924 merged the cities of Brisbane and South Brisbane--the towns of Hamilton, Ithaca, Sandgate, Toowong, Windsor and Wynnum and the shires of Balmoral, Belmont, Coorparoo, Enoggera, Kedron, Moggill, Sherwood, Stephens, Taringa, Tingalpa, Toombul and Yeerongpilly--to form the current city of greater Brisbane. Can members imagine if we had all those shires and towns operating today? In the confined area of Brisbane, it would be a very different outcome to what we see today. </Hansard-Body>

 In fact it is not. It is completely different. The member for Stafford, who is also someone who has had some long-term experience with the Brisbane City Council in a prior life, can try to twist words as much he likes, but the reality is that we are talking about the history of the creation of the City of Brisbane in 1924, not the cold-hearted manipulation and destruction of communities that was undertaken by Labor in 2006 and 2007 without any consultation, without any public debate and without any public input. The City of Brisbane was the result of 20 years worth of debate, consideration and consultation. The amalgamation of local authorities under Labor in 2007 was the result of the storm troopers coming in in jackboots and saying, ‘We are going to do it this way and we are not going to give you a chance to say a word about it.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025556"></A>
There was a process in place, which people often forget, that we on this side supported in relation to the shape, size and sustainability of councils. That process was thrown out the window after October 2006 by the Labor government. That was a proper process that was leading to a rationalisation of councils and authorities throughout the state. It had buy-in by those local authorities and by the Local Government Association. It is quite a different set of circumstances. For the member for Stafford to say that there is any similarity between the creation of the City of Brisbane and the cold-hearted actions of the Labor Party in destroying communities under its amalgamation program four years ago is completely and utterly wrong. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025557"></A>
The other issue that is interesting is that when Brisbane was formed it was formed as a greater city. That in fact means that the mayor is not just a mayor but a lord mayor and is entitled to the use of the honorific, the right honourable, which puts it in line with cities like Manchester and London in the United Kingdom. This goes back to, I guess, the formation of cities and the creation of aldermen under the Danelaw dating back to 900 or so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025558"></A>
There is a great deal of history in some of the names that we use today and in some of the terminology that we use. I think it is good to keep some of that terminology so we understand that where we are today is as a direct result of many hundreds of years of the rights of cities to govern and control themselves. I think that is important, because certainly Brisbane’s right to govern and control itself is of vital importance and we know that the people of Brisbane want that to be the case.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028105"></A>
The new city council replaced the 20 local authorities and reduced the number of aldermen and councillors from 205 to 26. Brisbane was one of the first cities--in fact, it might have been the first local authority in Australia--to establish a town planning department to deal with issues relating to town planning. I suspect that, in terms of dealing with town planning matters, nothing has got any easier from 1926 through to 2010. In fact, there are a number of good books around about the history of Brisbane. In terms of north Brisbane, in my part of the world, there are some very good books about complaints when blocks of land were carved up from 10 acres down to one-acre blocks and then from one-acre blocks down to half-acre blocks and then half-acre blocks down to 32 perches and then down to 16 perches. It is a continual theme and we need to be big enough to understand the history of change and the difficulties that councils have in adapting to change. And of course, the strategies that councils have in terms of dealing with change have also improved and been made better so that people feel less like it is being imposed from on top and more like they are having a say in determining their own outcomes, as indeed they are.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028112"></A>
Unlike councils in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth, where the local councils are generally responsible only for a relatively small central business district, the City of Brisbane covers a large area and administers a larger part of the Brisbane metropolitan area and has a larger population than any other local government area in Australia. In fact, the population of the Brisbane City Council is roughly equivalent to the populations of Tasmania, the ACT and the Northern Territory combined and also has, commensurately, a budget to match. The council administers a budget of over $3 billion. On that note, we will be getting details of the Brisbane City Council budget delivered by Lord Mayor Campbell Newman this morning. In fact, if it follows prior history, it will no doubt be a ripsnorter of a budget that will deliver outcomes in spades for the people of Brisbane--as it has done in a way that up until 2004 they were unaccustomed to receiving.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028118"></A>
When I look at the history of this legislation and what this bill does, I think it is great that this bill recognises Brisbane as the capital city of the state of Queensland, and it makes that particular recognition in clause 3. It has a clear update of the language. Earlier I made mention of the tortuous language that was used in the legislation in 1924, which was subsequently really changed each time there was an amendment made to the legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028121"></A>
The bill clearly makes provision for what is called the Establishment and Coordination Committee. In this legislation it is called the ECC, but those of us who have been there know it as E&amp;C--that is, if you like, the civic cabinet of the Brisbane City Council made up of the chairs of each of the other committees which meet on a regular basis to conduct the business of the city under the guidance and supervision of the Lord Mayor. It is effectively an essential part of the City of Brisbane. If it had not been recognised, I am sure anyone who would have cared to seek some sort of judicial review would have found that implicit in the operation of the City of Brisbane is the operation of the Establishment and Coordination Committee. So this effectively, if you like, gives in writing recognition to what would have been recognised in all of the circumstances anyway--that is, the Establishment and Coordination Committee of city cabinet.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028130"></A>
The bill also makes provision for the position of chairman of the council. In much the same way as this parliament has a Speaker who controls--or tries to--the conduct of debate between both sides of the House--</Hansard-Body>

Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Like I have seen in this parliament, I have seen many chairs with whom I have had numerous debates and discussions, as it should be in any democracy. However, recognition of the formal chair of council is also an implicit recognition of the political nature of the Brisbane City Council. When the Brisbane City Council was originally set up, it was also of course the intention of the then Labor Party that was in power in Queensland that it would stroll into control of the Brisbane City Council. We see the thought process--that is, that it will establish the council and then its nominee will stroll in and take over the mayoralty and win the wards. In fact, that did not happen and we have a bridge named after Sir William Jolly, who in fact won, much to the chagrin and despair of the Labor Party, which thought it would be able to manipulate council and get its own man in. I guess there is a lesson about trying to manipulate the Brisbane City Council and I guess both sides of politics have learned that lesson. It was learned by this side of politics in the 1970s when it tried to change the way the council elected its mayor and its aldermen. However, I have to say that probably the best friend that the then mayor, Clem Jones, had in state parliament was the Liberal Party Treasurer at the time who made sure that funding was provided in spades for the establishment of green space and for the operation of that council and also the Powerhouse at New Farm.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028146"></A>
We have the implicit understanding of the political nature of the Brisbane City Council, and it is a political council. There are two sides of politics, each with a contest of ideas that goes on. One side wins and one side loses and one side has the control--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028150"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Even when it was the CMO, so we have had that nature of the council since its inception. The results of that, irrespective of whether you supported one side or the other, are in what we see in Brisbane today. That is, you have bridges that link up, you have roads that join up, you have decisions that have been able to be made collectively by a civic cabinet that are for the better interests of the whole of the city of Brisbane rather than individuals putting their hands up and screaming and fighting over some funds for their particular electorate. We are able to get that overarching type of application of the political overlay to deliver the efficiencies that are needed to run a city of the size of Brisbane with the population it has. The legislation does a good job in formally recognising the role of the City of Brisbane and the way it goes about doing that is clear. The bill uses clear language.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028153"></A>
The other issue is in relation to the power of the mayor. In this respect, clause 14 relates to the responsibilities of councillors. In terms of those responsibilities of councillors, the very clear extra responsibilities of the mayor have been set out, and there is some value in doing that. After the 2004 election we ended up with an unusual provision. That is, I think it was the first time in the history of the City of Brisbane where the mayor was from one political party with a large--</Hansard-Body>

 No, not quite.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028156"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It was in my memory, anyway. We ended up in the situation where we had a Liberal Lord Mayor with a minority Liberal team supporting him on the floor and being able to pass votes and a Labor majority. There was argument in the early stages about what the legislation meant and what legally it could do. I think it involved lawyers and barristers and all sorts of threats in the early days, from memory. The reality, of course, is that it was always going to be worked out as a political solution and not a legal solution, but this legislation goes some way to clearing up the rights and responsibilities of the mayor and making sure that the mayor has some primacy in terms of dealing with the offices of council and budget.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028157"></A>
What we have here is legislation that enshrines the strong mayor model. In terms of cities around the world which have a strong mayor model, the strong mayor model applies to Chicago which has the Daley inheritance and the Democrats who control a Labor town. Of course that is a strong model. There is Bloomberg in New York City, which has a strong mayoral model. You have a city council, but it is not as strong as the mayor and the executive power. You can contrast that to somewhere like Los Angeles, which has a mayor in name but who is someone without a lot of power. That is the weak mayor model where, if you like, the mayor’s executive action is fairly well constrained by his necessity to go back all of the time and seek approval from the council in order to do what he wants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028160"></A>
Here, quite clearly, the mayor’s powers are set out. When one looks at the history of Brisbane, certainly one sees that its history is of strong mayors. I do not think anyone would say that Clem Jones was anything but a strong mayor. I think he refused to give notices of meetings even to his own side on the basis that if you gave them notice of meetings and had them along it would only encourage them to ask more questions and he did not want to answer any from either side.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1030663"></A>
Certainly, I think Sallyanne Atkinson, a former Lord Mayor, was also a strong mayor and had a certain style about her. I do not think that anyone would ever dispute that Jim Soorley was someone who brooked too much opposition or too much argument in any way, shape or form and was certainly perceived to be a strong mayor. Those who have had dealings with Campbell--the current Lord Mayor--would say that he also has a very strong and firm vision for the city and knows in which direction he wants to take it. Those people are elected to do that. That is the whole point. So I think that the clarification of the rights, roles and responsibilities of the mayors and the councillors of the City of Brisbane is a worthwhile inclusion. </Hansard-Body>

The legislation makes some changes. I think one that is slightly mystifying relates to carrying out beneficial activities for the City of Brisbane where investments are being sought to be made or enterprises are being sought to be entered into by the City of Brisbane with private enterprise. The legislation contains a provision that requires the council to seek the approval of the director-general before proceeding down an investment path. I would have to say that it strikes me as very, very odd that a council such as the Brisbane City Council has to go to the state government to seek approval to enter into beneficial enterprises with private enterprise. That seems particularly odd when we consider the strength of the Brisbane City Council’s balance sheet and its finances. </Hansard-Body>

Between 2003-04 and 2009-10, the council’s budget capital spend has increased by 321 per cent and, unlike state Labor, that has been done by keeping debt under control. In 1993, under Labor, net debt peaked at $1.683 billion. Net debt will peak again in 2014 at $2.07 billion before the federal payment of $400 million. So before any funds or grants are received--</Hansard-Body>

Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Mr Deputy Speaker, my, they are sensitive, are they not? Before any federal funds are received, debt per person is 14.8 per cent less in 2014 than it was in 1993. After the federal money is received, debt per person will be 31.5 per cent less in 2015 than it was in 1993. In that time--and I heard mention of infrastructure and what was being done--what has the Brisbane City Council done? It has completed the Eleanor Schonell Bridge at the University of Queensland, it has implemented nine new bus zone routes, it has introduced 450 low-floor air-conditioned compressed natural gas buses, it has completed the Clem Jones Tunnel, it has upgraded the Chinatown Mall for $8 million, it has a $1.2 Road Action Program, it is purchasing 500 new rigid equivalent buses over four years, it has invested $100 million for walking and cycling, it has a rapid transit scheme, it has six new CityCats over four years and new ferry terminals, it has almost completed construction of the Go Between Bridge and it has begun construction on the Hale Street link. That has all been done without going into the red in the way in which state Labor has done. So we can see that the need for the council to ask the state government for approval about how to spend its money is completely and utterly redundant. If we took the state government’s word on it, we would be going into the red, we would be going into deficit and people would be paying more and more. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1030674"></A>
I would also like to raise for the minister’s consideration the issue of clause 37, which relates to election signs. It is always a contentious issue. But all in all, I think that the legislation meets the needs of making governance for the City of Brisbane more reliable, simpler and clearer. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind) (12.53 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on the City of Brisbane Bill 2010. I understand the need to modernise the legislation that deals with the City of Brisbane, but one area of the bill that I intend to touch on briefly before lunch is part 4 of the bill, which makes amendments in relation to the Right to Information Act 2009. I understand that, as a result of the proposed amendments contained in this bill, these amendments will flow through in due course to other councils in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1030678"></A>
We often hear calls for more open and transparent government. Sometimes when there are requests for information, unfortunately, the right to information is not able to be accessed because, in relation to the state government, the information might have been taken to cabinet. We are seeing adopted in this bill a similar proposal. Under these amendments, there will be similar opportunities for councils to say, ‘I am sorry, that information is restricted and it will not be available for 10 years.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1030679"></A>
Councils have operated very effectively under the committee system and I do not believe that we need to move down the road of legislating new restrictions on the opportunity to access information to better understand deliberations that some councillors are making on matters that come before the council. I refer to part 4 of the bill. Clause 333(4) states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1030681"></A>
Without limiting subsection (3), the Minister may make guidelines about a publication scheme of the Brisbane City Council requiring the scheme to set out that the council has available information of or about the council’s Establishment and Coordination Committee.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1030682"></A>
Those establishment and coordination committees will have the opportunity to exclude information so that it is not available to the public. This is a new direction for many councils. I think that, if the minister wants to go down this road, we need to set out very clearly better guidelines and better restrictions because I have a genuine concern that some councils and some councillors will realise that there is an opportunity to keep some important information out of the public arena by taking that information into this proposed new cabinet consideration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1030683"></A>
I refer to the wide ambit of material that can be protected under this proposal contained in part 4. Clause 334 inserts a new subsection 4A, which states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1030688"></A>
(1) 	Information is exempt information for 10 years after its relevant date if--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1030689"></A>
and there are whole range of options. The clause states further--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1030690"></A>
(a) 	it has been brought into existence for the consideration of the committee; or </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1030691"></A>
(b) 	its disclosure would reveal any consideration of the committee or would otherwise prejudice the confidentiality of committee considerations or operations. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1030692"></A>
Those provisions are very wide. I do not know how much wider the scope of those provisions could be extended. Then the clause lists a whole range of other matters that are excluded. I refer members to new subsection 3, which states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1030695"></A>
(3) 	Without limiting subsection (1), the following documents are taken to be documents comprised exclusively of exempt information under subsection (1)--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1030696"></A>
(a) 	committee submissions;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>

(f) 	committee decisions;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1030702"></A>
(g) 	a draft of a document mentioned in any of paragraphs (a) to (f). </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1030704"></A>
New subsection 4 then states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1030706"></A>
A report of factual or statistical information attached to a document mentioned in subsection (3) is exempt information under subsection (1) only if--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1030707"></A>
(a) 	its disclosure would have an effect mentioned in subsection (1)(b); or</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1030708"></A>
(b) 	it was brought into existence for the consideration of the committee. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1030709"></A>
By crikey, I think that is as wide a scope as possible for material. Then the proposed new section goes on to refer to the committees. The definition in the bill defines a committee as--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1030711"></A>
... the Establishment and Coordination Committee under the <Hansard-Italic>
City of Brisbane Act 2010 </Hansard-Italic>
and includes the Establishment and Coordination Committee, as constituted from time to time before the commencement of this section, under a local law of the council. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1030712"></A>
Before I resume my seat, I urge the minister to reconsider the necessity for this part 4. I believe that councils have operated in the past very effectively without needing this new protection from the release of information that might be sought by the public. It is important to ensure that we have the best open and transparent local government in Queensland. I believe that this proposed amendment is not necessary. Councils would operate better without the opportunities to take important or sensitive information into their proposed committee system simply so that it remains out of the public arena for up to 10 years. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms GRACE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Brisbane Central--ALP) (12.58 pm): I rise to speak in support of the City of Brisbane Bill 2010. This bill gives formal legislative acknowledgement to Brisbane as the capital city of Queensland. And what a beautiful and vibrant city it is! Eighty-six years is a long time, but that is how old the City of Brisbane Act is. I believe that it is clearly in need of modernisation. The current act is definitely out of date for a progressive and fast growing city in 2010, especially one that seeks to be Australia’s new-world city. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1030715"></A>
Although Brisbane was proclaimed a municipality on 6 September 1859, Brisbane owes its status as Queensland’s capital city to custom rather than status authority. Nevertheless, I believe that Queenslanders know that Brisbane is our capital and this bill gives the legislative acknowledgement to Brisbane as our Queensland capital. It is the largest local government in Australia and so warrants this standard-alone legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1030716"></A>
The bill recognises that, in comparison to other Queensland local governments, the Brisbane City Council--or the BCC--is unique because it is the largest provider of local government services in Queensland. There are 26 councillors, other than the Lord Mayor, who each represent the interests of residents of a ward. The mayor has a unique responsibility as the mayor of a capital city. The council has an establishment and coordination committee that coordinates its business. The chair of the council presides at all of its meetings and is responsible for ensuring that its rules of procedure are observed and enforced. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms GRACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
Mr Deputy Speaker Powell, it is great to be speaking during your first time sitting in the chair as Deputy Speaker. I congratulate you. Well done. The bill retains and updates provisions unique to the BCC such as the wonderful City Botanic Gardens and river crossings as well as our lovely malls here in Brisbane. The bill also ensures, and I welcome, best-practice measures in public administration standards with emphasis on transparency, effective processes, democratic representation, open good governance and ethical and legal behaviour of councillors and council employees. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035837"></A>
Brisbane ratepayers do expect and deserve a local council that is genuinely transparent, is responsive to public needs, practices social inclusion and whose processes are above reproach. I believe that this bill ensures this outcome. The BCC Establishment and Coordination Committee is recognised in the legislation because the committee is the peak body of the council and reflects the size and complexity of decision making made by the council. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035838"></A>
The Establishment and Coordination Committee is what the BCC terms its civic cabinet, with similarities to state cabinet. The committee consists of the mayor and BCC standing committee chairs, who each have specific portfolio responsibilities. The committee often addresses sensitive issues such as employees’ remuneration and working conditions, water restrictions and contracts. Consequently, council can choose to withhold committee documents, such as minutes, from public release if doing so is not in the public interest. Information that has been brought into existence for the consideration of the BCC Establishment and Coordination Committee is exempt under the Right to Information Act 2009. Information that would reveal any consideration of the committee or would otherwise prejudice the confidentiality of committee considerations or operations is also excluded from right to information. Committee meetings are not open to the public, although committee reports are presented to an ordinary meeting of council for approval. Details of committee activities can then be included in council minutes which are published on the council website. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035839"></A>
This bill also recognises the unique roles and responsibilities of the mayor. The City of Brisbane Act is largely based on the Local Government Act but with some differences. Similar to the principle of the separation of powers that operates at the Commonwealth and state levels of government, the bill makes clear the separate and distinct responsibilities of councillors, the mayor, the chief executive officer and council staff. It is the responsibility of all Queensland mayors to provide a visionary and strategic role in economic, social and environmental management. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035840"></A>
The Brisbane mayor has additional responsibilities. The differences for the Brisbane mayor reflect the size and complexity of council organisation and decision making. The Brisbane mayor alone has powers to appoint the CEO and senior contract employees who are council’s senior executive service--I think that is most appropriate; prepare the budget for presentation to the council; chair the Establishment and Coordination Committee; and develop and implement new policies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035841"></A>
Equally important in this legislation are the roles and responsibilities of the CEO. BCC CEO responsibilities are legislated for the first time in this bill. The role of the town clerk is no longer necessary and so is not part of this legislation. Under the bill the CEO is clearly responsible for the appointment and direction of all staff, other than senior contract employees. This supports the separation of responsibilities between the executive arm and the administration arm of council and is essential to reinforcing the line management authority of the CEO. The bottom line is that this separation is a key feature of effective democratic governments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035842"></A>
Under the bill, council is required to publish annually the remuneration of the CEO and senior contract employees. This can be done by publishing the number of these most senior of contract employees within each remuneration band. In order to provide a level of flexibility, council staff, including the CEO, may be concurrently employed by more than one local government. Obviously this would be dependent on the size of the local council, workloads and their ability to fulfil the requirements of the position. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035843"></A>
In closing, I also support new provisions in the bill that enable councillors from all sides of politics to better service their wards by providing them with rights to obtain and use information relevant to their wards. Obviously the bill includes provisions prohibiting misuse of such material and clarifies information that will not be available. I believe that this is a very important provision that will enable councillors to better service the wards they represent and not be unreasonably denied access to relevant and necessary information such as on a purely political basis. I commend the minister and staff and all stakeholders for their hard work and input in the development of this bill and I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Keppel--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(2.36 pm): In speaking to the City of Brisbane Bill, I thank the minister and her staff for the work that they have done both on the Local Government Act and the City of Brisbane Bill. It is something that has been near and dear to my heart after seeing the excesses that existed in my area under the former Livingstone shire council. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035846"></A>
Similarly to the Local Government Act, the bill sets out definitions of material personal interest, conflict of interest--and I will speak to that--and council employee discipline and appeals. In relation to material personal interest, the Local Government Act carries virtually the same provisions. Councillors are required to make decisions in the interests of the community. In many cases they are a lot closer to the community and can be involved in some of those local organisations that deal with the council. They are required to disclose personal interests which may influence their voting. This includes any interest which may result in a direct benefit or loss to the council or a close associate. Personal interest offences occur when councillors fail to make this disclosure. For example, it could be a councillor voting to award their own company, or a company they own shares in, a contract with the council or a councillor voting to award a major council information and technology contract to a company of which the councillor’s wife is the owner. That originally was one of the bases for extending that definition in the Local Government Act, which will start from 1 July, and it will also be included in this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035847"></A>
It is not that anyone in the Brisbane City Council has actually done that, but because, as I said, of the local contact they really need to be fully aware of what a material personal interest is. For instance, I mentioned the former council for my area. It does become a real problem when the local mayor owns a business that contracts with the council to provide entertainment. That has actually continued under the new Rockhampton Regional Council. I trust that it will not occur under the Brisbane City Council actions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038401"></A>
Regardless of circumstances, any failure to disclose a material personal interest is actually official misconduct and would be referred by the CEO to the Crime and Misconduct Commission for investigation and prosecution. If found guilty, there can be a jail term of up to two years or a fine of up to 200 penalty units, which now amounts to $2,000. There is an exemption from MPIs for ordinary business matters. The bill covers a number of other acts. It contains some amendments that align the Local Government Act with the City of Brisbane Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038406"></A>
I believe the biggest difficulty for material personal interest is the possibility of conflicts of interest arising. On the surface, conflicts of interest might not always appear to some people, although in some cases others have been well aware of it and they have always managed to arrange for it to benefit them. An example of that is if the council was making a decision about a grant to upgrade a football club building and a councillor was a member of that club. Another example would be if a councillor’s wife was the member of a netball team that had applied for a lease on a sporting field. If a councillor identifies a conflict of interest, then they are required to disclose the interest and leave the meeting. If there is uncertainty, they can notify the meeting and the remaining councillors have to decide whether or not a conflict of interest in fact exists. If they decide that it does, the councillor must then leave the meeting. A failure to disclose is an official misconduct and is required to be referred to the Crime and Misconduct Commission for investigation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038407"></A>
One thing that prevents this sort of thing occurring is the register of interests. As every one of us knows, we have to disclose our personal interests and those of our spouses. Certainly the extension of disclosure to include other members of the family, in both the Local Government Act and the City of Brisbane Act, takes it a little bit further than the imposition on us parliamentarians. However, as I said, the nature of a lot of dealings really requires that that be done. I do not know whether it is a conflict of interest if a councillor who makes decisions about rates has declared the value of their property wrongly. It might be worthwhile for the CEOs to look closely at the councillors who sit on those councils. I am aware of one who has made a declaration as to value and receives a rates adjustment. That sort of thing has to be stamped out in councils throughout the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038408"></A>
I note that the member for Clayfield mentioned the formation of the City of Brisbane and how that was different to the amalgamation of councils throughout the state. In actual fact, that was 90 years ago and it was fairly acrimonious at the time. I think the proof of the pie is in the eating. Ninety years down the track, it works well for the City of Brisbane and I believe that under the new Local Government Act the rest of the state will operate in a similar way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038409"></A>
Another area that I would like to cover is employee discipline and appeals. Apart from senior executives, the CEO of the council is responsible for appointing council staff and they are the ones who can direct and take disciplinary action. When the disciplinary action will be taken and what type will be prescribed by regulation. The bill also amends the Local Government Act to insert the same clause and bring the two together. This aligns the BCC employees’ discipline matters with other local government employees in the state Public Service and could offer considerable advantages to council staff compared to the current arrangement. The Department of Infrastructure and Planning will continue to work closely with stakeholders to develop a regulation that balances the rights of employees with the needs of the council and, obviously, the needs of the community. In all other respects, the bill actually updates the operations of the City of Brisbane. Additional regulation will be provided once the bill becomes an act of this parliament. Hopefully, the Brisbane City Council will continue to operate in the way it has for the past 90 years. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A ID="pgfId-1038416"></A>
I rise to speak to the City of Brisbane Bill 2010, which was introduced by the Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Partnerships on 15 April 2010. Local governments are an autonomous, efficient and accountable system of government. They respond to community needs to enhance the quality of life in metropolitan, regional and remote areas, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait island communities. I believe that relations between state, federal and local government should be conducted in a spirit of mutual respect with an emphasis on partnerships and cooperation. It is for this reason that I would like to recognise the degree of cooperative consultation between local government services and the Brisbane City Council in the drafting of the bill being debated today.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038417"></A>
I understand that Brisbane City Council had a few reservations regarding some aspects of the draft bill that was circulated in March 2010, but that following meetings between council officers and the department the provisions of the bill are generally supported by the current administration at City Hall. During this consultation, stakeholders asked that the bill facilitate efficient, accountable and effective governance and service delivery. Clear expectations and high standards about transparent decision making, inclusive community consultation practices and local government performance are addressed and the groundwork appears laid for a sensible but more adaptable approach to enterprises, partnerships of many secure kinds, and sustainable financial arrangements and accountability. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038418"></A>
This bill seeks to strengthen and support the largest local government area in Queensland and gives Brisbane City Council the capacity and flexibility to serve the people of Brisbane, including the residents in the Aspley electorate which falls wholly within the Brisbane City Council boundaries. Brisbane is a youthful and enthusiastic city, spanning city to bay and hills to bush. It is appreciated by residents and visitors for its friendliness and optimism, and respected for its leadership and achievements. In 1859 Brisbane was declared a municipality, a city with its own local government. Indeed, my husband’s great-great grandfather, William Pettigrew, was one of the people who signed the petition seeking the declaration of the municipality and was later a long-serving alderman and mayor. Therefore, the history of this city has a special resonance within our family. The first aldermen were men who had helped to establish Brisbane as a hub for development and the councillors who serve today are still building Brisbane as the commercial centre of Australia’s northern development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038419"></A>
In 1925, the Queensland state parliament passed the City of Brisbane Act, establishing a single government in Brisbane, replacing about 20 local authorities and joint boards. The current number of councillors, which is to be set firmly as the number of wards in this new bill, was established at 26, replacing some 200 aldermen for the same Brisbane area. That was an efficiency gain which appears to make recent local government amalgamations a simple political act. Today, Brisbane’s leadership in civic governance under Campbell Newman delivers active and healthy communities, drives a strong economy, sustains a clean and green environment, has created a city of cultural vibrancy and has provided an enduring legacy of liveability for future generations. Moreover, the current Brisbane administration has spurred this state government into long overdue action on resolving the transport gridlocks in the city.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041049"></A>
We have been generally well served in the past by lord mayors of all persuasions with their unique brands of leadership and governance styles. But as we progress it is important that Brisbane, as our state capital, moves with current best practices in governance. That is why I am pleased to see that the bill incorporates a principles based approach, a chief executive officer with defined responsibilities, and requirements for long-term financial planning and reporting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041050"></A>
This principles based approach will hopefully give Brisbane the flexibility to build on its current policies, operational procedures and processes, and also make the new legislation more user-friendly for council employees, residents and ratepayers. Guiding legislation needs to be user-friendly for council employees because our Brisbane is facing new pressures and challenges as we move into the future. Every year, more and more people call Brisbane home. We face the challenges of securing sustainable water supplies, managing for people movement and maintaining Brisbane as a highly desirable place to live. It is, however, a substantial task to manage our current and future challenges--and that is why it is important that councillors understand their roles and responsibilities as they strive to ensure better outcomes for our residents. </Hansard-Body>

Indeed, better outcomes for residents in the Aspley electorate are being delivered every day because in our part of the world we are represented by ‘can-do’ councillors. Councillor Amanda Cooper in Bracken Ridge ward, Councillor Norm Wyndham in McDowall ward, and Councillor Fiona King in Marchant ward are the councillors who every day are at the coalface of service delivery to our residents--delivering better outcomes through their unique brands of servant leadership. Each of them brings their own particular spark to our patch, and I want to put on the record my thanks to them and their office support staff for making themselves available at any opportunity to work together with me in tackling local issues. </Hansard-Body>

One of those local issues that we now face together, with a distinct lack of cooperation from the state government, is dealing with the local impacts of ULDA developments. Brisbane has already been tasked to find the planning space for another 150,000-plus people. Given its size and organisational capacity, Brisbane is well placed to respond to this challenge with development planning that provides integrated solutions worked up through local neighbourhood planning processes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041054"></A>
I will end my contribution by saying that this unfortunately contrasts with the ULDA development process implemented by the state government whereby development sites--of particular interest to Aspley residents is the proposed high-rise development of the QUT Carseldine campus playing fields--are chosen merely because vacant land exists within state ownership, rather than through any coordinated or integrated approach to urban planning. In these developments, Brisbane City has no effective input and is merely left to try to deal with all the boundary impacts of these developments, which include substantial traffic impacts, loss of suburban character, and loss of suburban green space. It is a shame that the state government could not take a leaf out of the Brisbane City Council book. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (2.52 pm): I would like to focus on the outcomes of the processes of the bill. Everything else has been well covered by other speakers. This is a bill that represents the wishes of the incumbent Brisbane City Council in part. There have been reports in the local press that possibly raise concerns about accountability of the councillors. It would seem that these issues raised may have been emotional and sensational rather than addressing practicality. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041058"></A>
Brisbane is the third largest city in Australia and will be the second largest within 10 years. The Brisbane City Council is the largest council in the world--certainly Australia’s largest--and its budget is currently larger than South Australia’s operating budget. This claim, as extraordinary as some may believe it to be, is true because of the size of the Brisbane City Council’s current road, bridge, busway and urban renewal program. Moreover, it is due to the growth of the city beyond its 2.5 million current inhabitants. With growth comes demand for infrastructure, major new city planning and major spending related to higher population densities where previously there were fewer people per square metre. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041060"></A>
Brisbane as a city is not just moving beyond splitting the old 32-perch block into 16 perches and building sixpacks on amalgamated blocks but also moving to become a city where the latest <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 report on 23 May is proposing unlimited height densities in the city, eight storeys at Wynnum, 30 storeys in the Valley including New Farm, 20 storeys on the south side, 10 storeys at Chermside and five storeys amazingly at Coopers Plains. We have gone beyond duplexes, semidetached and battleaxe developments. Brisbane is becoming a very diverse city that is going to test both the public and the governments in the next 20 years as Brisbane’s population more than doubles. I say ‘governments’ because all levels of government--local, state and federal--will need to be involved. The Brisbane City Council act was drafted initially in 1859 but then the amalgamations came in 1925. Uniquely, it is a local government with its own separate state legislation. On reflection, this was probably a very sensible decision by a forward-thinking government of the day. We have ended up with a very good result from that decision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1236706"></A>
Brisbane’s urban sprawl, as homeowners and prospective homeowners are in ever-growing numbers, is growing still. The South East Queensland Regional Plan does make amendments to cater for far higher inner-urban density, infill development, urban renewal and better land utilisation. What the plan really cannot do is completely limit further urban sprawl that really is former satellite communities in different councils growing by virtue of the increased flexibility of the regional councils and their proximity to Brisbane. Improved transport corridors, better passenger rail and bus links to Brisbane and some decentralisation out of the city drives that. Without doubt, we are almost at the point where Brisbane is SEQ central, with the Gold Coast, Ipswich, Jimboomba, Beaudesert, Caboolture, Redcliffe and Redlands all merging as outer Brisbane. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041069"></A>
The impact of this is that not much has changed in the wider perspective, but the act affecting Brisbane needs considerable adaptation because of these changes. It would seem that, in spite of many attempts at trying to drive change in Brisbane by town planning task forces, urban renewal groups and road construction, the end result has been that the mixed effects of market forces, opportunity, evolution and tribalism have driven those changes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041072"></A>
Overwhelmingly, cost has been the major driver of change. Decentralisation appears to have been only marginally successful due to the mixed effect of individuals unwilling to move them or their families from the communities where they grew up and those in middle management being influential within their organisations, driven by the perception of negative impacts on their careers to move to outer-lying areas. In Brisbane, housing that has been built primarily near these larger industrial areas has a very mixed history, and the bill addresses those points. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041073"></A>
Brisbane, like its railway system, is very much a city of determined provincial urban families. The metropolitan rail network has one western link to Ipswich through Indooroopilly and Chelmer, a northern line to Caboolture and the Sunshine Coast, a north-eastern line to Shorncliffe, a southern line to the coast and a south-eastern line to Cleveland. Only the eastern suburbs are not uniquely linked, but the river and Moreton Bay are their own critical links. The public in all of these communities are historically likely to wish to live near siblings, parents and friends. Policy of local government, particularly within the bill, needs to relate strongly to the considerable effects of these trends. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041077"></A>
Incoming residents to the city are diverse and may pursue the same great Australian dream of homeownership, and the bill addresses that. There is a trend of empty nesters moving into the city into high-rise buildings. Family size is decreasing and there are fewer relatives to lean on. There is a major reticence to go into dependent care for the elderly, who tend to stay on too long living in their homes. This then causes an overhang in the market. But there are changes linked to both divorce and intergenerational change which are also having a significant impact on inner-city living. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041079"></A>
The BCC act needs to be reflective of the changes that are occurring in the market. It would appear that the Labor state government is overly focused on its own needs rather than on the outcomes required by Brisbane residents. This is not only regrettable but may potentially be a serious error. The evidence for this statement is the two recent decisions of the incumbent state government and a further review of the SEQ plan itself. The first is the failure to correct the lack of links between the eastern suburbs, the bayside, the northern suburbs and the city with Teneriffe and New Farm. The second is the recent announcement of the conceptually flawed cross-river rail link, which merely moves the bottleneck to either side of the river from the Merivale Bridge for five years at best. This $8.5 billion plan opposes all other major international best practice metropolitan transport solutions. All other major cities of greater or comparable size and some of lesser size embrace circle lines which mirror ring-roads in the city. This is not radical thinking; this is the norm. The proposal here is clearly that the cross-river tunnel is in the wrong place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041080"></A>
The SEQ plan, which relates to this bill, and in significant part has been raised by the member for Aspley, was Labor’s grand statement on the future of SEQ. What has happened under Labor has been a consistent process of highly dubious approvals for developments that are exemptions to the SEQ plan. Much of this creep into both greenfield area and green zones is highly dubious at best and destructive at worst. In between, it has placed intolerable demands on the current infrastructure plan and spend by the BCC that should never have occurred. When one adds the failed council amalgamation strategies in surrounding areas, particularly with regard to the Scenic Rim, one sees that it then has an impact which has to be picked up within the BCC plan.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041118"></A>
The current proposal to promote the idea of proportional representation of councillors in regional councils outside Brisbane, rather than by a divisional election, will only compound the negatives of the amalgamation as it applies to Brisbane, particularly with regard to growth impediments and a focus on process over outcome. The flawed water grid is a clear example, particularly when it applies to the Brisbane solution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041120"></A>
The Brisbane City Council’s initiation of the original Airport Link was groundbreaking. The state then took it over and initiated BrisConnections, and I think the decision on that is out for the time being. If you compare the two plans, I think there is a significant difference. What I am saying is that there are two plans going on in South-East Queensland and the state is focusing on jingoistic name plans using the words ‘future proofing’ very frequently, whereas the BCC is focusing on needs and outcomes for everyday people. That is what the bill entrusts them to do. There can be no greater example of this than the cross-river tunnel at $8.5 billion for the state, and the comparison to the BCC’s Go Between Bridge and the Clem7 tunnel, particularly at a time when the Clem7 tunnel is receiving great criticism. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041126"></A>
At the moment, 50 per cent of all existing freight movements continue out of the Hamilton wharves. Also, cattle and coal haulage trucks come in mass convoys through Toowoomba into the city from the north-west. However, the cross-river tunnel plan continues to move the freight through the city. The BCC has massively focused itself on linking the inner south to mass transport and the inner city commercial transport to effectively bypass the city at reasonable peak hours for a $5 billion expense. This means that the state government planning is focusing on maintenance of the status quo, whereas the BCC is focusing on the future and keeping pace with it. Fortunately, the existing act has delivered this change for Brisbane. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041127"></A>
Honourable members may all falsely believe that none of these so-called distant, interrelated facts do tell the common story I have presented, but you all should reconsider, particularly those on government benches. The flaws in the theory that ‘if you build it, he will come’--which is from the famous movie <Hansard-Italic>
Field of Dreams</Hansard-Italic>
--are as follows: one, the building needs to be planned and be thought through with an economic and social impact assessment; two, the building needs to be real, not just hype talk advertising future projections or, worse still, a pack of lies; and, three, the building needs to be appropriate, whether this means energy efficient, comfortable, proportionate, affordable, et cetera.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041128"></A>
The BCC act, as big as the bill is now, may not be appropriate for a capital city of Brisbane’s current size in a tropical climate in a First World country so close to Asia. Is the bill too prescriptive? Is there far too much emphasis on trying to limit the BCC because of fear? This is the concept of a state government becoming more irrelevant as local governments become more relevant. Is the problem that the size of the Brisbane council--it being almost like a state--makes the current Labor government feel threatened by the BCC, especially with a progressive, forward-thinking LNP mayor in Campbell Newman who has been a very agreeable fellow? Is local government taken seriously enough by the Labor government here in Queensland? Is it time for the state government to start taking the idea of partnerships between itself and the BCC more seriously? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041129"></A>
Labor’s future--just like the incoming LNP government’s would be--is very much linked to the success or failure of Brisbane. So what do we need to see in the bill beyond those questions I have raised? We need maturity in relationships, and I think we need to look at Sydney and Melbourne. We need town planning, and this should be about thorough town planning because currently it is terrible, it is too slow and it is not progressive. We need to be creating families and we need to think about models of cohabitation. We need to reduce the idea of focusing on process over outcome. There needs to be easy transfer of title. There needs to be ease in sectioning off granny flats because of the intergenerational issues. We need to think about growing communities. We need to get those community feelings going again. We need to focus on community volunteering programs that lead to interconnection. The focus needs to be overwhelmingly on connections and not just on cars and transport, like with the current issue of tunnels. The other issue that could be reconsidered is the reinstating of trams. Light rail on the Gold Coast has been currently suggested and this may be an alternative for Brisbane.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041130"></A>
There are a considerable number of process issues in the bill. There is the issue of building high-rise if you have to--that is, we are going upwards. Communities are having greater densities whether they like it or not. We need space for 156,000 new dwellings by 2031 and we need to cater for the 40,000 new residents. I had heard that figure was 50,000, but these discussions are about 40,000. We need to make the idea of the quarter acre block a redundant concept.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041131"></A>
You might ask why this is of interest to the electorate of Gaven. The short answer is the micro-economics of globalism, economics, practicalities and commuters. Once the M1 was built, and in part the railway line to Robina initially on the Gold Coast, there was a direct link between Gaven via Nerang and Brisbane. It is indivisible. It exists for all the other areas I named earlier as well. There is a heavy emphasis on construction and there are people employed or contracting in my Gaven electorate, and there is also a high number of people currently employed in Brisbane but living a hinterland existence of bliss in my electorate. What occurs in Brisbane is of importance to my electors. This applies to many outer Brisbane regions, so what ticks in Brisbane has great significance beyond the city itself.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041132"></A>
To analyse the bill in another way, this bill addresses population numbers, density and vertical solutions. It does not address connections, understanding communities, innovative state solutions, horizontal growth and the connections of those. I agree with the statement of opposition councillor Milton Dick in the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 on 23 May, when he stated, ‘The plans had not lived up to their expectation of listening to residents’ concerns.’ He did not look to where the blockage was or was too afraid to state the obvious. The Labor government talks connections but delivers population and higher population density. This is short-term nonsense that only enriches the real estate speculative bank balances of Labor mates. It ultimately destroys communities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041133"></A>
Connections is about transport only in part, and cars are only a part of that. We need to link communities to one another. We need to build better links in communities. This bill is about Brisbane and talks about where it should start. The cross-river tunnel as proposed does not make sense. It is too deep at the Petrie Bight end of Edward Street to be cost effective and it replicates the transport connections we already have. There should be cross-river tunnels at Merivale Street under the existing Merivale Bridge and there should be a new tunnel between New Farm and Woolloongabba via Hawthorne. New Farm is all about urban renewal and high density and it has very limited transport options, as have the eastern suburbs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041138"></A>
An inner circle of trams should rotate around and link to the eastern suburbs at Park Road through South Bank and Merivale Street. There should be new tunnels through the city to take the load off the current existing network. The existing Ipswich, Gold Coast and Cleveland lines could then rotate around the loop, with the Gold Coast going straight through to the airport. The Cleveland line terminates at Ferny Grove currently and Ipswich terminates at Caboolture, but by utilising the loop configuration this would end. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041139"></A>
So this is what the state Labor government should be doing, and this is what should be done with integration within the bill. It behoves a forward-thinking state government to get it right. To be fair, the minister seems to have followed the script given to her. Our futures are all collective. It must be strongly emphasised that if we get it right for Brisbane it will synergistically work for the state as well. If changes in the bill are a mixture of agreement to the less contentious issues, general agreement to the bulk of procedural issues and not enough flexibility on necessary changes needed for the future, then the bill is a failure. Maybe there is far too much status quo, with too much suburb after suburb hub and spoke sprawl included. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041140"></A>
For those members who do wish for something greater for the state capital of Brisbane, it will not occur without some political pain for those on the government benches. Some of you are wondering what political pain that may be and fear the unknown. It is the very problem that confronts Labor and it is one that it alone created. It is that suburb after suburb blandness that drives the Labor machine, seat on seat constituency. It will be destroyed in part by the very things that are needed to resolve greater Brisbane’s problems. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041141"></A>
For those government members who are looking to the future, if you embrace those changes your party has an equal chance of claiming the future back as your own. Just how many amongst the factions have the courage to put the public interest ahead of their own--I suspect the answer is too few. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Anticipation Rule, Standing Order 231</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041177"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, this morning the Leader of the Opposition gave notice of a motion relating to various aspects of the health department’s new payroll system and calling for the establishment of a royal commission. Later during question time I ruled two questions out of order that clearly related to matters relating to the health department’s payroll system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041178"></A>
The member for Callide, both after the second question had been ruled out of order and later after question time, raised points of order about the rulings and also raised the wider application of the rule as regards debate on legislation where there are notices of motions on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 that deal with subjects that may be relevant to the legislation. Specific reference was made by the member to the possibility that current matters on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 may mean that discussion on those subject matters may be prevented during debate on the appropriation bills later in the week.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041179"></A>
Unfortunately, the rule of anticipation, although well known, is not well understood. The rule of anticipation is an ancient rule of procedure and its application in Westminster parliaments was once much wider and more strictly observed than in modern practice (see Erskine May 23<Hansard-Superscript>
rd</Hansard-Superscript>
 edition at 389 and Mareau and Montpetit 1<Hansard-Superscript>
st</Hansard-Superscript>
 edition at 476). According to the rule, proceedings could not anticipate a matter on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 that was a more superior form of proceeding. Over the years the rule has been mitigated in Westminster parliaments so as to give the Speaker the discretion in its application, as it is a rule that if too strictly applied can lead to absurd results or disadvantage minorities. If the rule was unfettered, the simple expediency of giving a notice of motion on a subject matter would preclude lesser or equal proceedings such as questions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041180"></A>
Standing Order 231 contains the modern expression of the rule in the Legislative Assembly. Standing Order 231(2) expressly recognises the role of the discretion of the Speaker and gives, according to previous Speaker’s rulings, ‘considerable discretion’ to the Speaker. Thus a Speaker has allowed a matter to be debated or a question asked if a matter on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
, or even a bill, has remained on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 too long without debate, thus allowing questions or other proceedings to continue because a bill has not been dealt with within a reasonable time (see Speaker McGrady 23 November 2000 PD p.4190). Similarly, Speakers have ruled questions out of order as they anticipate debate on notices of motion that would be dealt with later in the same day (see Speaker Fouras <Hansard-Italic>
(AS)</Hansard-Italic>
 11/5/2005 PD p.1324). </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041181"></A>
I think it important that I make the following points clear about the application of the rule in standing order 231, as it relates to our current practice. Firstly, the rule never applies so as to prevent a superior proceeding from being blocked by a more inferior proceeding. Thus consideration of a bill and debate within a bill will not be delayed or hampered because a notice of motion, adjourned motion or a question on notice about the subject matter is pending on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
. They are all inferior proceedings. A bill is a superior form of proceeding to an adjourned motion (Harris 4<Hansard-Superscript>
th</Hansard-Superscript>
 edition, p.308) which is superior to a notice of motion or a question with or without notice. Therefore, the notices of motion on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 cannot act to delay or hamper consideration and debate of the appropriation bills or any other bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041182"></A>
Secondly, as per standing order 231(2), I will always consider whether a matter should be allowed by considering the likelihood of matters on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 being debated within a reasonable time. All members can give at least one notice of motion each and every sitting day. Theoretically, there could be many dozens of notices of motion on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
, but the reality is that only one notice of motion is likely to be dealt with each sitting week. I exercise my discretion so as to ensure that questions are not impeded by notices of motions that are unlikely to be dealt with and will most likely lapse under standing order 74. My clear understanding was that the notice of motion given by the Leader of the Opposition regarding the health payroll system was the motion intended to be dealt with during debate of private members’ motions this evening, as per established practice, and thus that is why I applied the rule of anticipation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041183"></A>
Thirdly, in accordance with standing order 231(3), the anticipation rule does not apply to prevent questions or debate which anticipate debate of the annual appropriation bills and, additionally, for the reasons given above, the debate on these bills is conversely unaffected by the notices of motion on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper, </Hansard-Italic>
as they are inferior proceedings.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041184"></A>
Lastly, it will always be incumbent on the Speaker or whoever is in the chair to make a judgement call as to whether a matter anticipates another matter. Unfortunately, these decisions have to be made almost immediately and often where notices of motion are given and questions asked in immediate succession. I stand by the rulings I made this morning and note that it is within the control of the opposition as to what notices of motion they move for debate that evening and what questions they ask. If those on my left want to debate a matter on the Wednesday evening, perhaps they should avoid questions on the subject that morning. </Hansard-Body>

Mr FOLEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maryborough--Ind) (3.15 pm): To rise to participate in the debate on the City of Brisbane Bill. I particularly want to focus my attention on two separate aspects of the bill. Cabinet confidentiality is a contentious beast even on a good day. If it is used properly it may have a noble purpose but generally it has the potential to usher in some rather pernicious tendencies. It is widely recognised by the public in Queensland as a mechanism for wheeling truck-loads of documents that have the potential to be troublesome, especially in the future, into cabinet where they can be hidden behind the skirts of cabinet and not cause any embarrassment to people in the future. Whilst the practice sounds as though it has a somewhat noble purpose, there is the political reality of how it is used as opposed to how it is meant to be used. The reality is that the political process often uses cabinet confidentiality for a much more nefarious purpose. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041191"></A>
I think it is beholden on us as members of parliament to really ask the general public in Queensland what they think of the concept of using cabinet confidentiality to limit freedom of information access to certain documents. It is my understanding from the people I speak to that generally people would regard that as a mechanism to hide documents rather than a mechanism for good governance. As such, I am particularly concerned about that particular aspect of the City of Brisbane Bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041192"></A>
Secondly, I have concerns about the way the bill deals with exemptions for rate purposes. Most people in the House would know that as well as being a member of parliament I am also an ordained minister. This is an area that is pretty close to my heart. I think often the important voluntary work and social work done by churches in their role of providing social welfare as well as spiritual welfare and in their various community roles is often very much misunderstood or underrepresented. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041193"></A>
In this parliament we have particular days, weeks and, in fact, even years where we recognise all the tremendous voluntary work that is done in our communities. I might say that, when it comes to voluntary work, many churches provide a tremendous amount of social welfare for people in our community who have great needs. That is really done not only on a voluntary basis but out of the goodness of their heart. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041194"></A>
If we want a clear spiritual perspective on how it should be, the book of James chapter 1 verse 27 gives that. It says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1041195"></A>
Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041196"></A>
I understand that there are many religious people over the years who have made a shameful representation of what the teachings of Scripture are and have been absolutely terrible and scurrilous representatives and examples of the Christian faith. Indeed, we need not confine this particular debate just to the Christian faith but more generally to places of worship across-the-board. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044261"></A>
Often when places of worship are providing these important social welfare functions and counselling functions and many other functions, they do so in a quiet and unobtrusive manner that does not seek any particular glory for itself and also, largely speaking, does not seek any government funding. Again, these things are done out of the purest of motive. Certain aspects of this bill are very concerning to me and I have given that background to have this particular part of the debate. There are exemptions from council rates accorded to religious groups throughout Australia. This is not something that is unique to Queensland. For the most part, of course, the criteria that are applied for the granting of those exemptions are fairly similar all throughout Australia. There is a uniformity, as it were, pretty much across the nation. But in Brisbane, however, the criteria are entirely different from those applied to the rest of Queensland and, for that matter, Australia, and this is a concerning aspect of this bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044262"></A>
Property that would be exempt from general rates in every regional local government area may not be exempt in Brisbane. Furthermore, what is exempt in Brisbane one year may not be exempt in another year, and it is unlikely that the practices of the respective religious, charitable and educational institutions differ in any major respect from region to region in the state. Compared to other Western nations, Australia has one of the healthiest views of separation of church and state. It has not become some sort of a dogma or mantra that people get ridiculous about. We see the important role of educational institutions which are entirely church based, and they have provided some of the best value-for-money education in our state for many years.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1044263"></A>
Of course, there are differences between Brisbane and other parts of Queensland in terms of demographics, concentration of population and perhaps average land values, and there may be very good reasons Brisbane is treated differently from many local government areas in certain respects. Recently I have conducted a major research project looking at the different rates that are levied across all of the local government areas in Queensland post amalgamation, and clearly Brisbane is a different animal when it comes to that. There is no doubt about that. But that does not really provide any good reason rating exemptions accorded for places of worship in Brisbane should be treated any differently from those of the balance of Queensland, because they are not commercial in nature. They are providing that same community caring advocacy and function right across the state and across our country. It is clear and simple to me that to apply a rule that recognises the different nature of Brisbane and then to apply it across these charitable institutions could end up being inequitable at an absolute minimum.</Hansard-Body>

Section 957 of the Local Government Act 1993 provides for the power to exempt land by regulation, for example, for religious, charitable, educational or public purposes. Section 41 in schedule 4 of the Local Government Regulation 2005 provides that land owned by a religious entity is exempt from the payment of general rates if the land is less than 20 hectares and is used for one or more of the following purposes--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044274"></A>
They are exempt from rating. That is a rather broad college of exemptions. It is a rather broad brush and certainly gives the option as intended by that particular regulation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044276"></A>
The parts of the Local Government Act 2009 that relate to rates exemption have not yet been proclaimed and are not yet in force, but those parts provide that land is exempted from rates, including land that is exempted from rating under another act or regulation for religious, charitable, educational or other public purposes. It would appear that the position under the Local Government Act 2009 will be different from that under the Local Government Act 1993. But in Brisbane again the position is entirely different. Under the City of Brisbane Act 1924 and under the City of Brisbane Bill 2010, Brisbane City Council is accorded the power to make its own resolution for rates exemptions for religious, charitable, educational or other public purposes, and that resolution can clearly change from year to year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044281"></A>
What might be property that would be exempt from general rates in every regional local government area then may not be exempt in Brisbane. Furthermore, what might be exempt in Brisbane one year has no guarantee of being exempt in the following year. I would urge the minister to consider the generalised nature of charitable, religious and educational institutions of that ilk and the important social function they play right across-the-board. I would urge the minister to address that in this particular bill and make sure that places such as places of worship and charity are treated equally right across-the-board and there can be no exemption in this bill that would be fair and allow for that situation to change.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (3.25 pm): I rise to speak to the City of Brisbane Bill, and I acknowledge that we have to pass two bills today and have to try to contain our comments. The major part of the bill I want to speak about relates to amendments to right to information, but I acknowledge that this bill modernises, if you like, much of the City of Brisbane Act--the only local authority in Queensland to have its own act of parliament when the rest are governed by the Local Government Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044290"></A>
Many of the principles that are espoused in this bill are principles that the majority of councils try to adhere to anyway. It does, however, mandate them so that they now become an obligation. With regard to a pecuniary interest declaration, I do not believe that councillors in the main will have a problem with that. Councillors today understand the need for transparency. The ones I have spoken to understand that the community not only has to have confidence in them but also has to have the confidence that those councillors elected to represent them do not have any ulterior motive.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044292"></A>
That brings me to the amendments to the Right to Information Act. I understand that there have been people in the LNP who have defended the Lord Mayor’s request for this change to effectively give cabinet exemption to information taken into the Brisbane City Council chambers. There would be a number of councillors throughout the state, because this exemption will apply to all councils in the state, who would welcome this ability to claim information to be exempt. However, if you spoke to constituents I think their point of view would be diametrically opposed, particularly those who have had dealings with councils that perhaps have had not the result that they would have hoped for.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050079"></A>
The community in my electorate has been forced to accept an amalgamated council. That still for some is a rancour. They are concerned at some of the actions of council. That is to be expected when there is a new group of councillors in some way acting differently from the previous two councils. However, I would say that the vast majority of people, if not the entire community, would say that they do have the right to as much information as possible that is used as the basis for the setting of rates and charges not only so that they can understand the justification that council has used to set the rates and charges but also so that a council’s rationale is transparent and able to be questioned. I believe that that, with the passing of this bill--and it will pass--will be at risk, if not in reality then in perception. That is a great disappointment, because part of the basis of community is reality and part of the basis of community is perception.</Hansard-Body>

The member for Beaudesert photocopied and handed around to us here a <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 article that says very strongly some of what I believe people in the community would be saying. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1047203"></A>
This week State Parliament is scheduled to debate the City of Brisbane Act 2010, which, when passed, as it presumably will be, will extend State Cabinet secrecy provisions to the Brisbane City Council. In other words, the council will, for the first time, be able to refuse to publicly release information for no other reason than it has gone before its civic cabinet. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047204"></A>
Councils throughout Queensland have had a committee system. When I was a member of the Calliope shire council there were matters, particularly town planning matters, that were dealt with in committee. They were effectively in camera. But much of the debate was often carried out in the public domain and I do not believe that the structure of withholding information was anywhere near as firm as this legislation will create. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047205"></A>
The article states further--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1047207"></A>
What is at issue here is a principle, not a debate about what size an organisation needs to be before it can start hiding behind a cabinet exemption clause. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047208"></A>
That comment relates to Lord Mayor Campbell Newman’s reasonable argument that the scale, size and structure of the Brisbane City Council is unlike any other local government in Australia and is, in fact, more akin to the state government. The article states further--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1047210"></A>
...the new rules will also give the government ‘the power to publish guidelines for the council for the proactive release of civic cabinet material’ which will ‘mirror what the Queensland Government has already implemented for State Cabinet in the interests of improved transparency and accountability.’ </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047211"></A>
I think that, in the minds of many people in Queensland, if a government, irrespective of political persuasion, wanted to withhold information that was divisive, that was confrontational, that was provocative and it was close to an election, they would wheel it into cabinet--and I can remember having debates in here about the reasonableness of trolleys of files being taken into the cabinet room--so that the action of wheeling them in rendered them cabinet-in-confidence, and that unreasonableness and the lack of transparency would create suspicion in the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047212"></A>
The article goes on to say--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1047214"></A>
This is a nonsense and a strange way indeed to deal with council information. First you pass a law giving the council new weaponry for withholding information, then you issue guidelines on how this newly protected information might be made public in the future. Why not just leave things the way they are, for better or worse, rather than introducing new layers of rules, regulations, paperwork and, most importantly, secrecy. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047215"></A>
In his contribution, the member for Warrego said he would encourage councils not to use the provision. Can I say that those councils that wish to remain open and accessible to their communities probably will not. The ones that do not remain open and accessible are probably the councils that the community has the most concern about. They are the ones that will be given additional protection by this bill. I do not believe this provision is necessary and I believe that it will be a matter of great concern to the community. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr WENDT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich West--ALP) (3.33 pm): I would like to briefly provide my support for the City of Brisbane Bill 2010, which is currently before the House. Specifically, I will direct my comments to the principles behind the legislation and after that I will touch on matters surrounding the financial and infrastructure sustainability and accountability aspects of the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047218"></A>
The whole point of this bill is that it represents a new approach to the governance of local government in Brisbane, with the intention of removing prescriptive processes and thus allowing the council greater flexibility. As such, the principles based legislation aims to be high-level, outcomes focused, encourage innovation and is considered by stakeholders to be comprehensive and, in addition, also allows practitioners to focus on outcomes and develop their own operational procedures and processes. However, it is important to note that that does not mean that the legislation will be less enforceable. Finally, it is hoped that the legislation will achieve higher levels of compliance by requiring the council to comply with the spirit as well as the provisions of the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047220"></A>
As members would be aware, the Local Government Act 2009 is also principles based. Both the City of Brisbane Bill and the Local Government Act are based on the same five principles. Those local governments reflect best practice public administration standards and they include transparent and effective processes and decision making in the public interest; the sustainable development and management of assets and infrastructure and the delivery of effective services; democratic representation, social inclusion and meaningful community engagement; good governance of and by local government; and, of course, ethical and legal behaviour of councillors and council employees. As such, as members can see, within the parameters of these principles the council may exercise choice about processes as long as the processes are rational, justifiable and transparent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047221"></A>
These principles highlight the absolute essentials of responsible, inclusive and transparent governance that Brisbane ratepayers expect and certainly deserve. As such, anyone performing a responsibility under the legislation must consider the application of the local government principles. Of course, a breach of the principles would be a breach of the act and, accordingly, would be enforced. I should also clarify my comments by mentioning that I am also advised that for matters needing more detail and a certain level of prescription, regulations will be developed in consultation with stakeholders before the commencement of the new legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047222"></A>
I would now like to briefly comment on a couple of financial infrastructure sustainability matters and to assure everyone that the government believes that the future stability of the Brisbane community is not negotiable. That is why the bill clearly sets out requirements for financial sustainability and accountability. As we all know, the council faces challenges in financial governance and service delivery and it has competing priorities in terms of population changes, the ongoing sustainability of the council and the community and providing significant levels of infrastructure. In addition, the council carries a heavy load of community expectations about the management of public infrastructure and assets for the long-term benefit and viability of the Brisbane community as well as to deliver essential services and account for all public moneys in the short term. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047223"></A>
With that in mind, to help future councils of Brisbane city manage this load, the bill requires a focus on longer-term planning and higher levels of accountability to the community. These practices are not new to councils but they are now legislated for both the present and the future, as they are for all other Queensland councils. As we all know, councils are considered to be financially sustainable if they are able to maintain their financial capital and infrastructure capital over the longer term. As such, I am confident that this council will continue planning for future service delivery and infrastructure through the development of long-term financial, community and asset management plans. As such, I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs KIERNAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Isa--ALP) (3.37 pm): I rise to speak to the City of Brisbane Bill and, in particular, to a number of amendments identified by the LGAQ during the drafting of the regulations under the Local Government Act 2009 and the City of Brisbane Bill 2010. The Local Government Act 2009, which comes into effect on 1 July 2010, signals a new and exciting era for local government in Queensland. That act has a strong focus on building sustainable and inclusive communities and reflects contemporary community expectations of local government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047226"></A>
As we know, the world has changed--and quite significantly--since the Local Government Act 1993. The Local Government Act 2009, when it comes into effect, will deliver a new and innovative framework for local governments across Queensland. It has to be said that the drafting and preparation of the 2009 act was 2 years of hard work and collaboration between local and state governments. The community engagement process was exhaustive. Being a member who was involved in much of that process during the development of the 2009 act, I would say that it was one of the most consultative processes that I have ever been involved in. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047227"></A>
We know that more than 70-odd mayors, councillors, senior staff and other stakeholders took part in the development of that legislation. Many meetings were held across the state and many local issues were taken on board. Certainly, further extensive consultation has gone on in respect of the proposed amendments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050147"></A>
I also take this opportunity to congratulate Minister Boyle and her staff, and most particularly Michael Kinnane and his staff, who have done a tremendous job over the past couple of years. Where we are with local government today is a real credit to their commitment. There is no doubt that today’s local governments are required to deliver a more diverse range of services and infrastructure than ever before. They are required to operate in the complex business environment encompassing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and urban, rural and remote lands. It is also very clear that the environment surrounding public administration today has shifted quite markedly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050148"></A>
As a result, the act clarifies provisions relating to responsibilities of mayors and CEOs. Importantly, the act reflects Queenslanders’ expectations that their elected representatives will look after the interests of all residents. Ratepayers not only want to understand how local government processes work but also expect a high standard of delivery of services. Above all else, local residents today want transparency in decision making and expect councils to look past today and plan for future generations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050149"></A>
The act will deal more clearly with councillor conduct. The act provides clear principles, roles and responsibilities and more effective penalties. Apart from councillors, mayors and local residents phoning me across my 14 council areas, there are questions within the community that they want clarified or are seeking information about and a great many of those questions are about the conduct of councillors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050150"></A>
I think that the code-of-conduct approach that has been replaced with a new system for dealing with complaints about councillor misconduct and poor performance is appropriate. Inappropriate meeting conduct by councillors will be dealt with at a local level under new powers for mayors to warn and suspend a councillor, similar to the Speaker’s role in parliament. Those new powers will be well received. An independent regional conduct review will be put in place to investigate serious allegations against councillors and the state local government remuneration and discipline tribunal will be set up for more serious performance complaints. The panels and the tribunal will be able to use a range of penalties, from mediations and fines to issuing warnings or suspending allowances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050151"></A>
In serious cases of misconduct the Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships will be able to recommend to the Governor in Council the suspension or dismissal of an individual councillor. This new power is widely supported by stakeholders and is fairer than the status quo of dismissing an entire council because of the poor performance or misconduct of a few. The minister has also retained the power to recommend to the Governor in Council that a council be dissolved if a situation presents no other alternative. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050152"></A>
The act provides a structure to encourage local government decisions that are in the public interest. Councils will be responsible for their community’s involvement in the democratic process, social inclusion and meaningful community engagement. They must practice good governance and ensure the ethical and legal behaviour of councillors and their officers. The new act certainly ensures the continuation of the highest standard of transparency and accountability that ratepayers are demanding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050153"></A>
The act retains provisions and serious penalties relating to the misuse of information to cause detriment to council. Detriment here is not about political embarrassment or disagreements between councillors, nor is it about matters that are and should be in the public domain. It is appropriate that there is public debate about the positives and negatives of council projects, plans and policies. This is in the public interest and will not trigger the misuse of information provisions. To cause detriment to the council has now been clearly defined in the legislation and it includes to sabotage a lawful process of the council, including adopting a budget or conducting a tender process, for example, or to cause the council to suffer a loss in its lawful performance of a function or commercial activity, including the loss of future contracts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050154"></A>
Councils will be exempted from requirements under the Right to Information Act 2009. Council considers a range of options and possible projects as it works towards reaching a balance between income, with its impacts on ratepayers, and expenditure, capital works programs and employment generation. Although this issue was brought to the government’s attention by the Lord Mayor of Brisbane in relation to his council’s budgetary processes, the provision under right to information will also apply to all local governments right across Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050155"></A>
Further, following discussions with the LGAQ, an amendment today clarifies the parameters of the material personal interest provisions. This amendment makes it really clear in defining an ‘ordinary business matter’ that a person does not have a material personal interest merely because they are a member of a non-government, charitable or religious organisation involving no personal financial gain or loss to a person. If anyone has ever been on a small council, as I have been, they will know that half the room stands up. It is like a revolving door, or it used to be. Whether a person was on the local kindy or church committee, everyone thought that they had an interest. With smaller council numbers it makes it doubly difficult. This is an excellent amendment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050156"></A>
In response to concerns about what constitutes family or personal interest declarations, the legislation will now stipulate very clearly that this is a parent, child, sibling or partner and should therefore only very occasionally require the councillor to withdraw from participation in council business. As I said, there are 14 councils on my patch. We could be a one-third of a Queensland supercouncil. The new act will be supplemented with a concise set of regulations. Again, I compliment everyone involved. I think the extensive consultation that has been undertaken to get to this point is certainly to be commended and congratulated and on that note I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr EMERSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Indooroopilly--LNP) (3.46 pm): I rise to contribute to the debate on the City of Brisbane Bill 2010. I wish to focus particularly on that section that deals with the council’s responsibilities and powers. Today, we saw a remarkably dishonest attack on the Brisbane City Council by the transport minister. But, of course, that is not unexpected from this minister. Today, the minister got up and tried to compare the performance of the Brisbane City Council on public transport to that of the Queensland state government. Today, the Brisbane City Council released its budget. It is a remarkable contrast to see the performance of this council, dealing with the responsibilities under this act to look after the people of Brisbane, compared to this state government on the issue of public transport. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050159"></A>
Let us look at the outstanding record of achievement on public transport that has been achieved by the Brisbane City Council under Lord Mayor Campbell Newman and the LNP. If we look at today’s budget we see that it continues a 50 per cent growth in bus patronage and a 73 per cent growth in ferry patronage over the last five years. Again, an outstanding example of this council looking after the people of Brisbane as opposed to this state government, as is its responsibility under this bill, is that in 2010-11 the Brisbane City Council will spend more than $1.2 billion to improve public transport, fix congested roads and make it easier for people to walk and ride around the city. </Hansard-Body>

Mr EMERSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I was referring to the outstanding performance of the Brisbane City Council in terms of its budget as compared to that of the Queensland state government, particularly in terms of public transport. Let us continue to look at the council’s wonderful performance and what is in its budget, which was released today. Let us look at the responsibilities of the council. Council will continue to subsidise public transport in Brisbane by $173.71 million over the next 12 months. It will spend $56.26 million on new buses and $4.4 million on another two CityCats. Under the LNP and Lord Mayor Campbell Newman, the Brisbane City Council is continuing to deal with traffic congestion to make Brisbane an even better place to live. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050202"></A>
In contrast, the Bligh government is throwing up its hands on the key issue of congestion. I know this because I have asked the infrastructure minister about dealing with congestion on roads in Brisbane. When I have discussed it with him, he has said, ‘Don’t worry about that; that’s a matter for the Brisbane City Council.’ The city council is dealing with it, but don’t bother talking to the Queensland government. Anyone stuck on the Walter Taylor Bridge or stuck in gridlocked traffic elsewhere everyday--those people in Sherwood, in Corinda, in Graceville, in Chelmer, in Tennyson--should not bother talking to the Queensland Bligh government, because they do not care about congestion. Once again the Brisbane City Council is dealing with congestion, but the state government and the responsible minister--have a look at questions on notice--simply say, ‘Don’t bother me; go talk to the Brisbane City Council.’ That is why under this act--</Hansard-Body>

 Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I said, it is important that we see what the people of Brisbane want from their elected representatives, particularly on the issue of public transport. Clause 14 of the bill refers to the responsibilities of councillors. Clause 14(1) states--</Hansard-Body>

 It is important that the residents of Brisbane are looked after by the Brisbane City Council, because they are not being looked after by the state government. I urge the minister to come with me to my electorate and chat with my constituents. She can come to the Indooroopilly Railway Station and find out what the people who use that station say about public transport and whether they think the Brisbane City Council is doing a good job. I can tell members what people are saying about the state government, because I use public transport all the time. They ask, ‘Why are fares going up? Why aren’t the timetables reliable? Why aren’t the trains turning up?’ The Brisbane City Council is looking after the future interests of this--</Hansard-Body>

Mr EMERSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Certainly, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I said, this is about the future interests of the residents of Brisbane, as referred to in clause 14(1) of the bill. This is about the interests of Brisbane. I will conclude on that point. The Brisbane City Council is looking after the interests of the people of Queensland and the people of Brisbane, unlike this state government. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Moggill--LNP) (3.53 pm): Brisbane is a fabulous place to live. It is a city that is blessed with features such as Mount Coot-tha, the Brisbane Forest Park and the Brisbane River. Clearly, it is a place where people want to come to live. That has not happened by accident. To some extent, the City of Brisbane was created as something of an experiment, with one local authority covering a whole capital city with nearly 40 per cent of Queensland’s population. It is a party political council. It is a council that would have the potential to play a lot of games when it comes to state government legislation. Therefore, I am pleased--and I am sure that the Brisbane City Council is pleased--with the general direction that this bill has taken. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050218"></A>
The bill deals in particular with the financial viability of the council. The Brisbane City Council has achieved what a lot of other authorities have been unable to achieve. Brisbane City Council projects include the Inner City Bypass, the Coronation Drive reconstruction, the Waterworks Road upgrade, the completion of the Clem7 tunnel and, in particular, the upcoming Hale Street link and Northern Link. The Brisbane City Council has managed to achieve those major infrastructure projects without any of the blow-outs in debt that we have seen from the state government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050219"></A>
If we look at issues in Brisbane where we need to do a lot better, they are not the issues of the Brisbane City Council; they are the issues of the state government. They are issues such as the appalling congestion on Moggill Road, the complete lack of any commitment from this government to desperately needed projects like the Kenmore bypass or the upgrade of the Western Freeway, which again seem to have been omitted from this budget. The Brisbane City Council--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Order! Member for Moggill, I would remind you of my ruling in relation to the member for Indooroopilly. Perhaps you could come back to the bill, thank you. We are not dealing with the budget. We are dealing with the City of Brisbane Bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050221"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The budget of the Brisbane City Council shows $2.5 billion being spent on capital expenditure in the past two years alone. In the past three years that is 208 per cent more than Labor spent in its past three years in office. All of that has been done in a setting of below-average debt. In fact, the debt for the City of Brisbane peaked in 1993. In a number that the state government could well be jealous of, in 1993 the debt-to-revenue ratio in Brisbane was 131 per cent. In 2010-11 it is under 53 per cent. The Brisbane City Council has been able to deliver projects such as the Hale Street link and Northern Link in a setting where it can retain public ownership during, at the very least, the early years when the greatest value is created by the build-up in traffic on those links. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050222"></A>
Because of prudent financial management over recent years, the Brisbane City Council does not have a massive noose of interest payments around its neck, as we see with the state government. Rather than being able to deliver those sorts of projects and keep them in public ownership, the state government has been forced to sell projects, both new ones and old ones. Recently the member for Mount Ommaney raised a petition in relation to upgrading the Western Freeway. Once again, state government infrastructure has let the City of Brisbane down. It is extraordinary to see a member who has been here for the better part of a decade suddenly realise that there is a problem with the Western Freeway. Perhaps we ought to take a leaf out of the book of prudent management of the Brisbane City Council. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050223"></A>
Certainly, the western suburbs of Brisbane have a fabulous hardworking team of councillors. Margaret de Wit, Jane Prentice, Peter Matic, Matt Bourke and Geraldine Knapp have strongly represented that area. I think that is part of the reason, at the council level, we have managed to deliver on many of the things in western Brisbane. However, in reality, western Brisbane has been strangled by the failure of the state government to address its responsibility to its state controlled roads and public transport in that area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050229"></A>
In view of the limited time allocated to this bill, I will cut my remarks off there. I think Brisbane residents are very proud of their city. To a significant extent we have something that is unique in Brisbane City Council in terms of its size, in terms of having the whole city covered under one local authority, in terms of much of the responsibility that is handed to the council, particularly in areas like public transport and the like. Let us hope that we can build on that into the future. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr McLINDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Beaudesert--Ind) (3.59 pm): I am mindful of the time limitations, so I will be as brief as possible. At the outset, I acknowledge the enormous amount of work done by the staff, the minister’s department and the minister herself in putting this bill together. I would like to contribute to the debate on the City of Brisbane Bill 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056330"></A>
Clause 26 refers to the mayor being a member of the standing committees of the council. I think this is a good move because we have seen the role and powers of the mayor somewhat undermined in recent years. So I think it is good to strengthen those powers. I assume that where it says ‘take part’ in committees that the mayors can vote in those committees. In the five years I was on the Logan City Council, there was only one instance where the mayor had to cast a vote when it was six-all. Other than that, the mayor was largely a figurehead. So it is good to see that the involvement of the mayor on the standing committees is noted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056332"></A>
Clause 32 refers to the local law register, and I think it would be wise to have those local laws publicly available, as the clause suggests. I assume that would be on the internet or on the Brisbane City Council website. This would save a lot of unnecessary time for all parties involved who are trying to look at local laws, subordinate local laws and interim local laws for themselves. It would also save a lot of staff time if they were to be provided on the internet. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056335"></A>
Clause 37 refers to election advertising. This somewhat surprised me. It has always been a contentious issue for candidates and often council officers in ensuring that they police those local by-laws. To see that the Brisbane City Council is not able to ban how-to-vote material or election advertising is inconsistent with other councils across Queensland. I suggest that that power should be enshrined in this bill so that the Brisbane City Council can make those decisions in order to make it a level playing field. That was always a contentious issue that took up a lot of man hours in the Logan City Council. I am pretty sure that there are councillors on the Sunshine Coast who are moving to eradicate election signs. It is interesting to see that the Brisbane City Council itself does not have those powers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056340"></A>
Clause 40 refers to suspending or revoking particular local laws. The explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1056342"></A>
The Minister has the power to revoke or direct a change to a local law if he/she believes the law contravenes another local government related law ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056343"></A>
To me it should be a given, a prerequisite, that before a local law comes into effect it does not contravene another local law. I see unnecessary intervention by the minister instead of making sure that the council gets it right in the first instance. It should be a prerequisite rather than saying, ‘You can do it sloppily because we might catch up and have a look at it later on.’ I think that should be tightened up to ensure that the council gets it right in the first instance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056344"></A>
Clause 43 refers to the register of beneficial enterprises. Once again, I think it would be wise for the register to be available on the internet for the sake of efficiency and accountability. Chasing that information often wastes a lot of staff time. That would keep people in the loop from the outset. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056345"></A>
There are a series of clauses relating to the powers for entering property. But nowhere does it specify a minimum notice required. This is somewhat concerning. Even if you are renting a home, the RTA has to give a minimum of seven days notice to enter the property, whether that be for an inspection or whatever. There should certainly be a minimum requirement for the council to enter a property. A lot of residents have been up in arms after coming home to find a council officer on their property, inspecting whether a dog is registered or otherwise. It can be quite concerning when those powers are given somewhat flippantly to council officers. In some instances they have more powers than police officers. So there needs to be a requirement for a minimum notice to let residents know when council officers intend to enter their property. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056346"></A>
It is disappointing to see once again that there is a huge amount of discrimination in that councillors are not able to stand for state election without having to first give up their job. I think councillors are in the best position or in a better position than most in terms of understanding the machinations of government and understanding the provision of front-line services of government, having come from the grassroots level. It equips them to come into state parliament with the knowledge required. They certainly have a greater appreciation than someone coming straight into state government without that previous experience. Once again, I have to put on record my extreme disappointment that allowing a councillor to stand for a state government seat without first having to relinquish their job is not in the bill. I do not see it applying to any other job in Australian politics. I think it is something that would contravene the discrimination act as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056347"></A>
Finally, and most importantly, is the notion of ‘civic cabinets’. I understand the terminology would be used in that sense, given it has an annual budget of $3.4 billion. But what we have to understand is that there are mechanisms already in place for those sensitive issues of commercial-in-confidence and public tendering for contracts. It is very concerning to see that the right to information powers given to the council potentially shut down transparency, which the bill says numerous times is what it is trying to enable. What is also concerning is that it mentions stakeholders, being the CEO, council staff and officers in the department. That is great. But where--and this is key--are the members of the public? They are key stakeholders because they are who make up this public enterprise. I think it would be very remiss of this government not to ensure that the public were heavily involved in that consultation process. After all, without ratepayers, the residents, such a council would not exist. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056349"></A>
I think it is very concerning in that this will make it a private public enterprise, which goes against the whole notion of transparency, democracy and accountability as we know it. After 86 years the legislation does need to be changed in terms of wording and relevance because it was somewhat outdated, but the definitions of ‘transparency’ and ‘accountability’ always remain the same. So I think this is giving unnecessary powers, in my firm opinion, to councils regardless of whichever side of politics they are on. Having listened objectively to members from both sides of the House, it is very concerning that there was a lot of political underlining rather than raising the potential damage that this would create. In fact, an article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 states--</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1056354"></A>
Correct me if I am wrong, Mr Deputy Speaker, but we have seen large elements of the LNP over the years accusing the state government of the very same so-called offence. I think it is an absolute tragedy here today that there have been very few members of the House who have alerted us to this very notion of adopting potentially the same dangerous precedent to create a secret council. What this is now creating is another mini state government. As the opposition has highlighted over many years, the freedom of information and the right to information laws have had to be slowly implemented to the point when sometimes you have to wonder whether you are in communist Russia. Unfortunately, there has been very little debate on this today other than the politically motivated comments from either side of politics, depending on what side of the fence they declare themselves to bear allegiance to. </Hansard-Body>

Clause 92 refers to the power to levy rates and charges. The last line in the explanatory notes states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1056357"></A>
Given the level of community interest in this issue and the broad powers of the council, openness and accountability are essential.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Can you believe it? This is the same bill which promotes the potential secrecy at the will of the council when they so please, yet in relation to the power to levy rates and charges the explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>

Given the level of community interest in this issue and the broad powers of the council, openness and accountability are essential. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I cannot believe this is stated in the explanatory notes to this same bill. It is completely hypocritical of the intent of the bill. It says the direct opposite. It is diametrically opposite. It is a very sad day if we have an opposition that will support this bill when that same opposition has been knocking the state government for those very notions that this bill is laced with. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056361"></A>
I have lost count of the number of times ‘transparency’ and ‘accountability’ have been said throughout the debate on this bill. You have to wonder when something is repeated so many times whether or not it is actually the intent. When we look at the devil in the detail, what we see here is a very dangerous precedent. It is not a state government. I understand there may be political motivations to support this bill, but what it does highlight is that we have Shayne Sutton, the Brisbane City Council Leader of the Opposition, saying it is a bad thing; we have a Labor government saying it is a good thing; and we have an opposition that goes a bit quietly, quietly. What we are seeing here is that, once again, the major parties are two heads of the same creature. It is enough to make you want to start your own political party. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs PRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nanango--Ind) (4.10 pm): I rise to speak very briefly on the City of Brisbane Bill 2010. I would like to make a very quick comment first. When people in the House agree to go through a bill pretty quickly and have it debated by a certain time and the maths are done so that each person gets a set time in which to speak, it would be appreciated if members did not waffle on for a vast number of minutes so that other people miss out on their opportunity to speak. I know that the Leader of the House said she was not going to guillotine the bills tonight, and that is commendable, but I know that because people took more than their allotted time during the last sitting week I did miss out on having a chance to speak. I want it on the record that I do not like it happening and I do not think anybody else does, either. I will quickly get back to the bill. I am mindful of the time and I am not a person who raves on for a long time, so I am pretty sure I will be within the eight minutes that I have been allotted today.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056400"></A>
If you have to talk about any city in Australia, I think the city of Brisbane is the most liveable city--if you have to live in one, that is. In saying that, I do not know a lot about the machinations of the Brisbane council or anything else and I will not address any of that because many people already have. The part of the bill that I do want to address is the right to information from our councils.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056401"></A>
What I notice--and correct me if I am wrong--is that this government is giving the power to local governments to lock away information for 10 years. I assume that means it is locked away from the state government as well. A lot of issues arise in our communities that need investigation at times, but if this is the case and information is locked away, I want to know how you get around that. How are you going to circumvent the fact that you have given that right to lock away information for that period of time? I can foresee that troublesome documents and anything that might cause any hardship to the council of the day--</Hansard-Body>

Mrs PRATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Exactly. I take that interjection. Politically embarrassing documents may be wheeled away and locked away for a certain time if it is thought that they may have any effect on an upcoming council election, or whatever. I am not happy with this part of the bill. I would like to see it removed altogether. I know that the people in my electorate have enough trouble getting any information at all at the moment from the councils. They come to me in absolute frustration. They are led around by the nose, from department to department, and after weeks and months sometimes and a multitude of letters they do not get any information whatsoever. I am of the opinion that local governments should not be politically aligned, but that is a trend that seems to be coming in more and more. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056404"></A>
I am also aware that most councillors do recognise when a conflict of interest arises and most of them do play their part. The member for Mount Isa was right in saying that it can often be like a revolving door when people think they have some sort of conflict. Often there is not even one there, but just in case they head out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056405"></A>
I can see this freedom of information provision being abused in the future. I believe it has been abused by state governments in the past and I think it will be abused again in the future. I think most people want to know why it is in there. Why is that power being handed to local governments, which are supposed to be even more open and accountable? I think the first thing people are going to ask is why. Why do they want to cover something up? They are supposed to be open and accountable. Those words echo around this chamber more often than not, to the point that I do not think anyone understands anymore what open and accountable really stands for. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056406"></A>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind) (4.15 pm): By rising to consider the City of Brisbane Bill 2010 and briefly contribute to the debate, it gives me another opportunity to say, ‘Thank God for Independents in this chamber.’ Thank God for members of this chamber who are prepared to put their communities first and the interests of political party powerbrokers last. The only people who will benefit from the passage of this bill will be the millionaires, the billionaires, the union and bureaucratic elite, and the politically connected property developers--not the workers and ratepayers who have to operate by one set of rules while the well-connected political mates benefit from the backroom deals. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056413"></A>
By altering the RTI laws, the City of Brisbane Bill 2010 increases the chances that those backroom deals will remain in the back room, hidden from sight, and it increases the chances of corruption or the misuse of public funds. The City of Brisbane Bill 2010 introduces a layer of bureaucracy which enables elected decision makers to hide their actions and decision-making processes involving billions of dollars of public money from scrutiny. It decreases the level of public accountability for holders of public office, and it invites organisational dysfunction and corruption. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056415"></A>
It has also set a precedent for this sort of lessening of accountability and transparency to be shared throughout Queensland, not only Brisbane. My constituents of Burnett are not happy with many of the decisions that the newly amalgamated Bundaberg Regional Council has made. Some decisions are poor choice, and some decisions have been forced on the council because of the high cost of the forced amalgamation and the need to raise extra revenue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056417"></A>
If the legal principle contained in this legislation is allowed to be replicated in the Bundaberg Regional Council, for example, then important decisions--like approval for overseas owned companies who want to mine sand near the houses of local residents in Gooburrum and approval for another environmentally delinquent overseas company, Holcim, to establish a quarry near the growing coastal communities of Coral Cove and Elliott Heads and a marine park--will be covered up and shrouded in further secrecy. We have already seen the worrying development of pre council meetings being held behind closed doors. I thank the member for Beaudesert for his local government expertise and alerting us to the dangers of this legislation. I repeat the warning and question of the <Hansard-Italic>

 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships) (4.18 pm), in reply: I am very pleased to speak to the House in response to some of the questions and issues that have been raised by members. Some members who spoke fairly recently expressed a lot of concern about the right to information exemptions, but I am pleased to reassure them that they misunderstood the exemptions that are provided for in the City of Brisbane Bill.

The legislation formally acknowledges Brisbane as our state’s capital. It puts in place a contemporary governance framework that will help guide Brisbane on its journey to becoming Australia’s new world city. The bill is further evidence of the Bligh government completing the task we set out to do: to create a robust local government sector, second to none in the country. This commitment has been supported also by partnerships fostered in developing the legislation, including with the Brisbane City Council and the Local Government Association of Queensland, where our ongoing dialogue has resulted in amendments to the legislation as required. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059703"></A>
I reassure members of the House concerned about that that the revision of the bill and the creation of a new City of Brisbane Bill was publicly advertised and submissions were called for. I also reported on it in the newspapers and on radio wherever I could in order to encourage public comment, but there was, in fact, very little public comment. It has been primarily the key stakeholders--that is, the LGAQ, the Brisbane City Council led by CEO Jude Munro as well as the Lord Mayor and his team and the opposition led by Shayne Sutton and her team--who have made comment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059707"></A>
May I take a moment to recognise the good contribution of the CEO, Jude Munro, not only to this bill but in fact to local government over many years. It is with some dismay that we heard the news fairly recently that she will be stepping down from her position as CEO of the Brisbane City Council. This is a huge loss to the world of local government. She has indeed been an eminent leader of men as well as women. She has been a tremendous role model to those women aspiring to a career in local government. She will be missed. I place on the record not only my view about her tremendous contribution but that of the Department of Infrastructure and Planning, and in particular Local Government Services, and wish her well in her next positions. </Hansard-Body>

There are several amendments to the City of Brisbane Bill that are presented today to clarify, amongst other things, the local law-making process. The legislation gives council the power to develop its own process for doing this with the provisos being that local laws undergo a state interest check and are approved by the minister before gazettal. In essence, this means that the same rules will apply to local law-making in every council in Queensland. However, the process will be simple and timely. Model local laws and subordinate local laws will be excluded from requiring approval before gazettal.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059710"></A>
There is also an amendment to provisions dealing with roadworks and materials that are local government property. It now includes roads or works built by developers and donated to the council. An example has also been included in the legislation to give it further clarity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059711"></A>
As well as the amendments to the City of Brisbane Bill there are amendments to the Local Government Act. These include removing references to divisions when it comes to councillors requesting information from the chief executive so that consideration is given to the needs and interests of the wider community and provisions to prevent the release of confidential information by a councillor, including making the release of confidential information misconduct that would be required to go before the Local Government Remuneration and Discipline Tribunal. These amendments will ensure the smooth implementation from 1 July this year of the City of Brisbane Bill 2010, the Local Government Act 2009 and the regulations made under each of these important pieces of legislation. </Hansard-Body>

May I address some of the issues raised by honourable members, in particular, the most controversial, which is that of the right to information exemptions as they will apply to local government. There are two issues. The first applies to all local governments and is for papers prepared for their budgetary consideration. It provides an exemption for those papers and those papers alone. This is not the business of monthly meetings or the ordinary business of council but rather only those papers that are prepared for budgetary consideration by the council. They are exempted from being available through the right to information legislation for a period of 10 years. That applies to all 73 councils in Queensland. It is an option for councils, however, not a mandate. So it may be that those councils that wish to will still release their budgetary considerations and the papers associated with that when they announce their budgets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059715"></A>
We are, however, extending the right to information exemption provisions for the City of Brisbane to its Establishment and Coordination Committee. The Establishment and Coordination Committee is, in effect, a mini cabinet. It is the committee that is chaired by the Lord Mayor and on which sits the chairs of all the standing committees of the council. It is our view, in supporting the request of the Lord Mayor, that their deliberation should be exempt in the same way as some papers are exempt for the state cabinet. The Premier, as the minister responsible for the right to information legislation, will set some guidelines, as have been set for state cabinet, about the release of decisions of the E&amp;C and associated papers. These are limited exemptions and not well reflected in the balanced articles in newspapers that are the articles on which some members of the House have based their own views. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059719"></A>
I do, however, put on the record an eloquently expressed explanation for why these are appropriate exemptions. This is a quote from a judgement published by the joint majority in a High Court case of the Commonwealth v Northern Land Council in 1993. That judgement states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1059721"></A>
But it has never been doubted that it is in the public interest that the deliberations of Cabinet should remain confidential in order that the members of Cabinet may exchange differing views and at the same time maintain the principle of collective responsibility for any decision which may be made.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1059722"></A>
Further on in the decision the justices say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1059723"></A>
... the disclosure of the deliberations ... is liable to subject the members of that body to criticism of a premature, ill-informed or misdirected nature and to divert the process from its proper course. The mere threat of disclosure is likely to be sufficient to impede those deliberations by muting a free and vigorous exchange of views or by encouraging lengthy discourse engaged in with an eye to subsequent public scrutiny ... It is not so much a matter of encouraging candour or frankness as of ensuring that decision-making and policy development by Cabinet is uninhibited. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059725"></A>
That is why we agreed with the Lord Mayor and have applied a similar provision as applies to our state cabinet to the E&amp;C of the Brisbane City Council. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059726"></A>
Other members have raised other matters. The member for Clayfield asked why it should be so that the state has any interest in monitoring the debt of the Brisbane City Council and monitoring its intentions with regard to beneficial enterprises. It may be of interest to that honourable member to know that recently the council was debt free, and proudly claimed that, after the state took over the water assets. But that situation is no longer so and debt has increased in the Brisbane City Council. It is the Auditor-General’s view, as well as that of the QTC, that it is appropriate that we monitor debt in the Brisbane City Council as we do for all the other councils of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059727"></A>
There were some other matters raised. One in fact was raised by the member for Maryborough. I offer my congratulations to him. I wonder whether he has taken this bill so seriously that he has sat up in bed late at night reading the clauses in detail. I congratulate him on spotting, in the main bill, an error on our part. We had not included, as we should have, the provisions in relation to land on which rates are levied that gives the power to local governments to not charge rates particularly for church and other charitable organisations. The member will be pleased to hear, then, that we similarly had spotted that error on our part and that it is reflected in an amendment to the bill before the House and will be fixed this afternoon. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059728"></A>
I am pleased also to reassure the honourable member for Beaudesert, who was concerned about the power that council officers may have to simply enter a property in the Brisbane City Council area without any notice. I reassure him that that is not so. Reasonable written notice is required. This is defined as giving, at least seven days before a property is to be entered, information to the owner and the occupier of the council’s intention to enter the property, the reason for entering the property and the days and times when the property is to be entered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059759"></A>
However, there are some emergency provisions where there can be entry by a council worker for urgent action, but only for public health and safety reasons should emergent conditions warrant it. The power of entry other than to a home on the property is then available to carry out work which may be exercised without giving notice but only if it is justified on public safety grounds. They are the main matters that need attention this afternoon. There were some matters of detail that I would be pleased to address with individual members should they wish to further discuss these with me at a later time.</Hansard-Body>

I want to put on record my sincere congratulations to the departmental team who have worked so hard not only on the City of Brisbane Bill but also on the amendments to the Local Government Act last year and before that. Their good names should be read into the record, and so I will do that. My sincere thanks to Ross Alcorn, Rhyl Hurley, Sally McCone, Rosie Caulfied, Jo Chiu, Robyn Taylor, Kate McMahon, Sarah McPherson, Elizabeth Altoft, Kylie Barnes and the inimitable David Dobbs. I recognise the tremendous cooperation we have had from Jude Munro and the staff of the council. I recognise the vibrant debate that we have also had with Campbell Newman and his team and with Shayne Sutton, the opposition leader, and her team. It has been difficult to find a fair and balanced way forward between the majority party and the opposition on several occasions, although I think we have found that way forward now. It is really clear, and I put on the record, that the Lord Mayor and the opposition leader have demonstrated to me their very strong commitment to their responsibilities as elected members of the Brisbane City Council.</Hansard-Body>

In conclusion, local government is critical to the future of Queensland and in the spirit of the Queensland Constitution the state stands committed to working with this third sphere of government to deliver a stronger Queensland for this generation and the next. The City of Brisbane Bill has been purposefully designed to encourage practitioners to understand the spirit of the legislation, not just the letter of the law. The bill provides for a new, modernised statutory local government framework for the City of Brisbane in the face of a new era of growth and development. This is an important step forward for Australia’s premier capital city and for Queensland. I commend this bill to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066136"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (4.46 pm): In the minister’s reply she spoke about the reasons these significant amendments have been introduced--because of the size of the Brisbane City Council, the large budget that the Brisbane City Council has and the very detailed matters that the council has to consider. My question in relation to clause 332 is: is it proposed that this right to secrecy provision will be extended to other large councils, such as the Sunshine Coast Regional Council? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066137"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BOYLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. No, there is no proposal--no discussion at all--that that should be so. The difference with the Brisbane City Council is the existence--on the record and it has been so for many years and is continued in the City of Brisbane Bill--of the E&amp;C Committee, which is a cabinet-like structure and which is not the practice of other local governments. No discussions have taken place in regard to this provision applying to any other councils and it is not my intention to hold such discussions. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066146"></A>
Could the minister explain why she needs that discretion? Could the minister also give some advice about the types of matters that are considered in the council’s Establishment and Coordination Committee? I am looking to the boundaries of the matters that are considered under those committees. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066147"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BOYLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The relevant minister in this case is the state government minister responsible for the Right to Information Act, and that is the Premier. In terms of the exemptions for cabinet, the Premier has overseen the development of our publication guidelines, which are now printed in the ministerial handbook. So the intention with the Brisbane City Council is that the Premier, as the responsible minister, would similarly develop guidelines about the publication of decisions or matters that go before the E&amp;C Committee. That that has not been done before means that at this stage we cannot be too prescriptive about what will be in those guidelines, other than my understanding is that it is the Premier’s intention to follow the pattern of those requirements for state cabinet and the release of publications following cabinet, as outlined in the ministerial handbook. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WELLINGTON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Is it proposed that those guidelines will be available and completed prior to this bill becoming law? Could the minister clarify the boundaries of the matters that are considered by the council’s Establishment and Coordination Committee? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066150"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BOYLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 So far as the first question is concerned, no, it is highly unlikely that those publication guidelines will be decided prior to 1 July. They are a matter for the Premier to work on and no announcement has presently been made about when they will be complete.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066151"></A>
The E&amp;C Committee is the pre-eminent Brisbane City Council standing committee. Its membership comprises the mayor and the chairs of all other standing committees of the BCC. The bill recognises this administrative practice. The Establishment and Coordination Committee may consider any business of the council. It may consider future planning matters or future policy decisions. Its minutes have not been widely circulated or published. So it is the Lord Mayor’s view that that standing committee of the council will operate as it has after this bill progresses through the House today and becomes law. The right to information provisions will only be validating the practice that has been occurring with the E&amp;C Committee for many years. </Hansard-Body>

(4.52 pm): I take the minister to schedule 3 of the Right to Information Act 2009, subsection 2(3), which states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069986"></A>
Without limiting subsection (1), the following documents are taken to be documents comprised exclusively of exempt information under subsection (1)--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069987"></A>
My question is: why can we not remove and delete the opening words ‘Without limiting subsection (1)’ and limit, restrict, isolate the matters that are intended? When I read that section it seems it is as wide as it can be. I think we need to make it very clear what is deemed to be covered by this section. My request is that the minister remove the opening words ‘Without limiting subsection (1)’ and start that clause with ‘The following documents are taken to be documents’ to be covered in that section. </Hansard-Body>

 I accept the point of view of the member for Nicklin. These are words that have been drafted by those who are specialists in the drafting of legislation.

Again I ask: why is it not possible to have the following range of words included: ‘to specify’, ‘to limit’, ‘to restrict’ the range or matter that could be taken into the secret chamber? My suggestion is that we could have additional words ‘ranging from or including all or some of the following’. My preferred wording would be ‘it was brought into existence only for the consideration of the committee’, or ‘it was brought into existence solely for the consideration of the committee’, or ‘it was brought into existence specifically for the consideration of the committee’. </Hansard-Body>

I understand the point of view of the honourable member but I do not believe that we can satisfy it this afternoon. We are not trying to restrict the business of the Establishment and Coordination Committee. Through this and other clauses we are recognising its existence and attesting to its importance as a mini cabinet of the City of Brisbane which, as has been mentioned by several members, is arguably the largest council in the world, certainly in Australia. This is a major multibillion dollar corporation. It is reasonable that the chairs of the standing committees can meet, can have materials brought into being for their consideration and that have some exemption provisions under the Right to Information Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069996"></A>
Our objective today is not to limit those matters, not from the point of view of the government, but instead to prescribe some publication in relation to the decisions or the outcomes of those committee proceedings. As has been mentioned earlier, that will be a matter for the Premier as the responsible minister in the months ahead. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southern Downs--LNP) (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (5.06 pm): Labor’s TJ Ryan may have introduced Queensland’s first compulsory workers compensation scheme in 1916, but in 1995 and, indeed, in 2010 it has been his political offspring that has all but brought the scheme to its financial knees, to the verge of insolvency and decay. There has been an enormous journey, an extraordinary effluxion of time and a compromising of ideology in the nine decades since TJ Ryan introduced the scheme. The Labor Party led by Anna Bligh in 2010 is but a pale imitation of the party headed in 1916 by TJ Ryan, a man whose principles were honed and sharpened in the forge of 20th century class warfare--the battle over basic workers entitlements, wages and conditions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075733"></A>
TJ Ryan’s Labor Party is a far cry from the supercilious, smarmy, sugary spivs of the modern-day Labor Party, who mouth platitudes as they watch over the decay of the workers compensation scheme, as they sit back in the comfort of their offices in full knowledge of diligent and loyal health workers opening yet another very empty pay packet. TJ Ryan would never have tolerated such a fundamental breach of faith with those who are most loyal to him or he to them. He, in good conscience, could never have let his administration become so divorced, so detached, so cold, so removed, so disconnected from his roots and from those who had given his party its very lifeblood. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075734"></A>
It is said of politics that a day is a long time. In the context of Labor’s journey in the last century, it has been an indistinguishable millennium. Until two decades ago, in Queensland people largely took for granted competent public administration, administration built around prudent financial outcomes, value for tax dollars spent, timely service delivery, the best performing economy in Australia, lower taxes, a world-class public hospital system, educational outcomes amongst the best in Australia, timely construction of infrastructure such as bridges, dams and roads and, indeed, a well-balanced and fair workers compensation scheme with adequate reserves to meet the needs of employers and, more importantly, injured workers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075735"></A>
Two decades later, Queenslanders’ expectations of their government have been so lowered that they no longer have any such expectation of their government. Indeed, they dare not expect excellence from their government for fear that it be blunted by the likely revelation of disappointment. This basic expectation of government has been redefined by two decades of waste, political and administrative incompetence, imprudent financial outcomes, little value for tax dollars paid, untimely service delivery, the second worst performing economy in Australia, a failing public hospital system, the worst educational outcomes in the country, neglected infrastructure, and when it is built it is years late and billions of dollars over budget, and a workers compensation scheme on the very verge of collapse. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081391"></A>
The common denominator in this administrative and financial collapse of the basic fabric of public service administration in Queensland has been almost 20 unbroken years of Labor government. When the Queensland government changed in 1989, it was around the question of malfeasance and integrity of government and not around basic service delivery which people took for granted. Today the focus on the Labor government is not just on malfeasance and integrity of government but also on its ability to effectively administer the basic organs of government. Nowhere is this fundamental administrative incompetence more evident than its handling of the workers compensation scheme and nowhere is its supercilious, sugary, smarmy spin more evident than the WorkCover scheme--a largely fraudulent narrative of excuses based around the all too used scapegoat of the global financial crisis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081398"></A>
Labor would have us believe that the WorkCover scheme was going swimmingly before the GFC. But its largest investment losses occurred more than 12 months before the term ‘global financial crisis’, or GFC, had even been invented. Indeed, if one looks at the WorkCover’s annual reports one can see verification of that fact. In 2005-06, WorkCover had an underwriting profit result of $576 million. Their investment income in that year was a paltry $374,000. Yet in the following year they had an underwriting profit result of minus $323 million and an investment income of $411 million. Indeed, insofar as their underwriting profit was concerned, they had a $900 million turnaround in their underwriting position--that is, from the positive towards the negative in 2006-07. That was despite what were record investment incomes. The situation deteriorated year on year from there on in. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081402"></A>
The common denominator was not the global financial crisis; it was indeed something else. Mismanagement, a lack of financial prudence and a giveaway mentality have now been cloaked in the veil of the great GFC bogeyman. Queenslanders deserve far more than to have the custodians of their workplace injury insurance scheme insult their intelligence by blaming external forces for what is intrinsically and basically an internal management problem. The GFC had an effect, but its effect was minor. The Deloitte report indicated that unfunded liabilities of the scheme would be more than $8 billion in a few years, taking the problem beyond the realms of an investment earnings issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081404"></A>
What are the fundamental faults of the current scheme, the source of its malaise? For many years the scheme earned major returns on its investments. Did the government decide to properly manage these windfalls, to tuck them away for a rainy day? No. It decided to increase the payouts, to give it all away. The government coupled these windfall investment earnings, which mesmerised them to their very core, with a laissez faire giveaway attitude--an attitude which was akin to a sideshow where, as they say, every child player wins a prize. Indeed, almost every claimant did win and they won big time and they won some more. But, ultimately, there are always going to be losers. For all of this opulence, for this giveaway disposition, someone had to pay the piper. There had to be losers. The losers are the businesses of Queensland which are burdened with higher premiums and higher excesses. If you rang up and made a demand, you received.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081406"></A>
Proper common law case management was a concept as alien as icebergs in a desert--just ask and you will receive. Even plaintiff lawyers were embarrassed at the propensity for capitulation of the WorkCover common law division. They were not a pushover; they pre-emptively fell over. During precourt conferences it was not unusual for the common law division to offer amounts which were beyond the wildest dreams of not just the claimants but the most ambitious ambit claims of the plaintiff’s lawyer. This spectacle of mismanagement left more than one lawyer within the common law division in an attitude of disbelief. We have heard that being said publicly, and we have seen that from information which has recently come to the public fore. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081408"></A>
Indeed, a former lawyer for the common law division told me personally that he witnessed the inglorious spectacle of an argument between a claimant and their lawyer, but not for the reason that you would think, Madam Deputy Speaker--that is, the claimant not receiving what they considered to be a just payout. It arose because the claimant’s lawyer had told the client most optimistically to expect a little over $100,000 for their injury. Yet when they attended a precourt conference and asked the common law division what payment offer would be made, the division offered in excess of $200,000. The plaintiff’s lawyer was stunned and the claimant was furious in their assertion that their lawyer was selling them short. This was a gravy train of Labor’s making, a gravy train which would inevitably run dry but did not need to in such spectacular fashion. There was no hunger, no appetite, no energy to contest claims--applying equally to the most flimsy or speculative of claims. Hand it out and hand it out was WorkCover’s motto. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081409"></A>
Ninety-eight per cent of common law claims were settled outside of court--no contest, no questions asked, just shovel it out, with no reference to the fact that there was a tomorrow. </Hansard-Body>

Ms Grace:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Where’s your proof?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081412"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Indeed, as the member for Brisbane Central interjects, it is very, very clear that one of the fundamental problems which has been identified through what we know of the Deloitte report and what has been publicly ventilated is the fact that this division has not properly managed its common law claims, has not properly scrutinised them and has not properly contested them, and that is a matter of fact. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081413"></A>
Lawyers in the common law division were little more than office ornaments, subsumed in a culture of payout--do not contest and do not challenge--and many of them were dismayed by what seemed to be this direction. Queensland employers could but sit idly by and watch their advocate, apparently compromised, roll over time and time again, when their only expectation was that there would be just and proper scrutiny of the common law claim. Effectively there was no champion for Queensland employers, stunned by the realisation that there would soon be a day of reckoning--that day of reckoning taking the form of higher premiums and the day of reckoning for Queensland workers being the restrictions on the scope of their claims. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081414"></A>
Not one person--not one--would argue against an injured worker receiving just recompense--compensation, assistance, and rehabilitation to help them return gainfully to employment--or entitlements for life if they cannot return to work. All of these things were properly designed to protect workers and their families in the event of workplace injury or disease or death. No-one ever envisaged a scheme as badly mismanaged, as badly regulated, as open to abuse as what we have seen under the Bligh Labor government. This scheme needed tightening. It needed a refocusing to make sure that those most in need actually received. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081448"></A>
As we debate injuries in the workplace and the scheme designed to compensate legitimate claims for such injuries, we do so with the knowledge that, under this Labor government and its so-called mantra of protecting workers, Queensland has one of the highest death and injury rates in workplaces of any Australian state or territory. It is one of the most complicated, overregulated systems, with little or no focus on prevention and early intervention. This point was raised by the Queensland Law Society in its submission that identified the onerous duty imposed on employers in Queensland by the Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081452"></A>
Whilst the minister has crafted a narrative of diversion and deception to justify his actions, he has refused to justify his reform with associated openness. There has been no discovery or disclosure of the actuarial reports relied upon by the government as the basis for this legislation. Despite the integrity and active participation of interest groups, such as Commerce Queensland and the Queensland Law Society, there has been no release of that data. This has left not only the opposition but also many of the consultation groups smelling a rat. These reforms are veneered under a smear of suspicion and duplicity. We are asked to vote to support new laws simply on the say-so of a government which has established a new pinnacle of dishonesty and deception since the last state election. This is a step I and the LNP are reluctant to take. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081454"></A>
The opposition was stymied at every turn in its request for information. Our attempts to gain access to the actuarial reports under right to information were blocked. This was done on the basis that applications made to WorkCover fell outside the RTI Act for commercial-in-confidence reasons. This is strange indeed, as WorkCover is compulsory for all employees, with the scheme having a virtual monopoly on insurance, with the release of such information unlikely to compromise its position with the few self-insured. Confidence in his approach, confidence in his legislation, should bend the minister towards the release of the actuarial data relied upon to advance these reforms. The minister’s refusal to do so will see a perpetual question mark placed over his legislation and the foundations of the change which he champions in this place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081456"></A>
As history records, Queensland Labor and deliberate deception on WorkCover crises are not strange bedfellows. They have shared the pillow more than once--the last time in 1995, on the eve of the state election, when Matt Foley, then minister responsible for the scheme, told the parliamentary estimates committee that the scheme was actuarially sound. This was deception on the eve of a state election--something which Labor is most comfortable with. It worked then, so why would the 2009 state election be any different, when the government deceived on privatisation and fuel tax and, as we now know, even the state’s WorkCover finances? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081458"></A>
The sense of deja vu must now be obvious to all. Within weeks of the 1995 state poll, which Labor narrowly won--with 46.6 per cent of the two-party preferred vote, I might say--the Labor Party admitted that the workers compensation scheme was on the verge of insolvency and was $300 million in the red. It admitted just after the election that the WorkCover scheme in Queensland was on the verge of insolvency and was $300 million in the red. Does it sound familiar? It should. Oh, how things change that stay the same. It was left to the then coalition government, as is the lot of conservative governments, to fix the financial mess made by Labor of the once proud scheme. In the absence of openness or the disclosure of actuarial data to justify these changes, we are left to take this government and this minister at face value. A positive step to do so should be against one’s better judgement based on its record of deceit. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1081459"></A>
WorkCover Queensland, the entity responsible for the administration of the workers compensation and rehabilitation scheme, is a government owned statutory authority. In 2008-09 it insured more than 156,000 employers and registered over 92,390 statutory and 3,600 common law claims. The entity employs 840 people across Queensland. Its claimed philosophy is to provide the best possible benefits and rehabilitation programs for injured workers at the lowest possible premium for employers. Has this been delivered, when premiums are now to be raised, Queensland workplaces are amongst the most unsafe in the country and the scheme is reaching the point of collapse? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081461"></A>
Under WorkCover, there are two options available for injured workers. The first is the statutory scheme offering direct lodgement with WorkCover. It provides a worker who suffers an injury at work entitlement to statutory benefit under a no-fault system. A person is entitled to statutory benefits if their injury was caused by work, irrespective of whether the employer was at fault for the injury. Benefits may include hospital and medical expenses, lost wages or lump sum compensation payment for permanent impairment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081462"></A>
The second avenue is the common law scheme that can be settled through the courts. It is the common law claims and the associated cost to the scheme that have contributed to the present situation. The bill includes provision for WorkCover to impose higher premiums on an employer if their premium rate repeatedly exceeds the relevant industry rate. It also introduces a provision clarifying an issue of law that arose in the case of Bourk v Power Serve which resulted in an employer’s automatic presumption of negligence when an injury occurred under the Workplace Health and Safety Act. A plaintiff then had the established grounds for their common law claim, as negligence was presumed under the Workplace Health and Safety Act. A respondent was then placed at great difficulty in defending themselves against such an automatic presumption of negligence, when in fact there may not have been any negligence at all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081466"></A>
Significantly, this bill harmonises common law claims through the scheme with the Civil Liability Act 2003. Capping limits on claims in line with the Civil Liability Act should move a number of smaller claims out of the common law scheme to the statutory scheme. Superficially, the changes being put forward should assist in putting a sounder, financially secure base under the scheme. They should minimise speculative claims. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081469"></A>
The introduction of a contributory negligence discount that can be applied to payouts has merits. Why should someone who has tripped over their shoelaces after being reminded to tie them up over and over be entitled to as much as someone who has slipped in a dangerous situation? Clearly, they should not. Should someone who is intoxicated at work and who is injured be entitled to the same amount as someone who is not intoxicated and who is injured? Absolutely not. They are new provisions which are contained in the government’s legislation and on the surface we support. Introduction of the contributory negligence principle may lead to more personal responsibility in the workplace, a reduction in claims and maybe a reduction in the upward pressure on premiums. Speculative claims serve no-one, not worker nor employer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081472"></A>
The bill contains provisions that allow for the awarding of costs against a person whose common law claim is dismissed. In his summary, the minister should inform the House of how many common law claims have been dismissed in the last three years. Theoretically and most likely, in a practical sense, this should have the effect of deterring non-genuine common law claims. This bill uses the Civil Liability Act and its schedule as the basis of its statutory provisions, with the principle of no fault for its payments. By contrast, the common law scheme is based on established negligence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081475"></A>
Amendments contained in this legislation are as useless as window-dressing unless they are complemented with cultural change. Arguably, if WorkCover had contested more speculative claims, if they had argued more strongly, if they had pursued more fervently the merits of each case, then none of this may have been necessary. When these amendments pass, as they inevitably will on their own, nothing will change. Clear direction of intent must be conveyed to WorkCover that they must contest common law claims more aggressively. Their job, after all, is to sort the wheat from the chaff, to separate the genuine from the non-genuine claim, to sort merit from the lack of merit. If that is their modus operandi then a fundamental and necessary change has been achieved. If not then the legislation is as worthless as the paper on which it is written. <Hansard-Speech-End>

It is interesting on the day after the budget was brought down to have a look at what the Treasurer, the member for Mount Coot-tha, said yesterday about what state governments are about providing--that is, services. This year $42 billion will be expended for the 4 million people of Queensland. The Treasurer said in his budget speech at 2.30 pm yesterday--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1081516"></A>
In this State Budget we report back and recommit ourselves to this task, providing Queenslanders with a chance at the dignity of work--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1081517"></A>
But there is no mention of paying them. He continued--</Hansard-Body-Continued>

This is Labor’s first commitment and our calling. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1081519"></A>
But they will not necessarily pay them. He continued--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1081520"></A>
The fair go ... the advancement of all, regardless of where you line up at the start. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081521"></A>
It is a bit hard to be halfway through the race--and people find out that even though they are doing the work they are not being paid for it and the government cannot pay--and find out that this is acceptable for a Labor government when it claims that its interest is its workers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081522"></A>
What did we find under the heading ‘Helping Queensland households’? The Treasurer stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1081523"></A>
A helping hand to those who need it most--as is our calling. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081524"></A>
That is all very Churchillian, but it would be nice for those who work for Queensland Health, whether they be the doctors, nurses or allied health professionals or the orderlies, cleaners or the thousands of other workers, to be paid. Under the section of the budget speech headed ‘Investing in health and hospitals’, there is not one word about paying our workers on time. Instead of that we get a commitment in the budget papers of $4 million to supposedly fix this payroll scheme. Clearly, it is going to take a lot more than $4 million to fix it when we hear of the number of hours that people are doing to try to fix up the thousands of current payroll issues. Finally, the Treasurer said yesterday--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1081525"></A>
We are a proud government, determined to continue the legacy of Labor in building a modern Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1081526"></A>
One where we do not pay our health workers! He continued--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1081527"></A>
... proud of our commitment to jobs and to the workers of Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1081528"></A>
These are workers who obviously will not be paid. He again continued--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1081529"></A>
Through the tumult of the last two years, we have put the dignity of work as the guiding light for our policies. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081530"></A>
He made no point about the dignity of pay. That is the interesting thing about this government. It is big on the Churchillian statements, but when it comes to the things that state governments are supposed to provide--a decent day’s pay for a decent day’s work--it has been unable to do it for 12 weeks or six pay cycles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081531"></A>
That is why we have moved this motion. We have not done this lightly. The consequence of this motion that calls for the creation of a commission of inquiry does implicate a number of ministers. It implicates former health minister Gordon Nuttall, the former member for Sandgate; former health minister Stephen Robertson, the member for Stretton; the current health minister, Paul Lucas, the member for Lytton; and Robert Schwarten, the member for Rockhampton and Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081532"></A>
Under the Westminster tradition, ministers have responsibility for things that happen in their ministry. One of the most remarkable things that we heard about two or three sitting weeks ago was the Minister for Health, the member for Lytton, state that as a solicitor he had no knowledge of computer technology and nor did his colleague from Rockhampton, the Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology, who is a former teacher and a former chippie. In his words, there was no need for them to uphold the normal Westminster traditions. They would not take the Westminster view of responsibility. They denied responsibility for what has happened in Queensland Health and throughout this state for the last 12 weeks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081535"></A>
The former member for Sandgate, Gordon Nuttall, was responsible for signing the 10-year IT contract in 2005 without it going to tender. The member for Rockhampton, Robert Schwarten, is the minister responsible for whole-of-government ICT and is responsible for the agency CorpTech. CorpTech is directly responsible for delivering the new Queensland Health pay system. It was part of shared services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081540"></A>
The member for Currumbin, the member for Lockyer and I came into this House in 2004. We all remember going to our first estimates committee where we heard about the benefits of shared services and how it was going to save money across government. It has done so in other jurisdictions but not under Labor in Queensland. We cannot find out the true details of how much it is costing. That is what a commission of inquiry would investigate and report on. It would not report on the narrow terms of reference that the Auditor-General will have been given. We know that is the Labor way--that is, to send something away and get a report subsequently when the media are not necessarily interested in it anymore. A damning report, such as the one on the A1GP fiasco, would come down some weeks or some months later and the government would say, ‘That is all right. We have moved on.’ Why would it have moved on? Because there is another crisis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081541"></A>
That is the problem with this state Labor government. Since 1989 we have had, in portfolio after portfolio, services that are the responsibility of the state government to provide unable to be provided, crisis after crisis and minister after minister refusing to take responsibility. The people who suffer at the end of all of this are the workers of Queensland--the people who deserve to be paid. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081543"></A>
The former minister for health, Stephen Robertson, and the current Minister for Health, Paul Lucas, were responsible for the management, oversight and decision to go live with this system, to ensure a smooth transition to the new payroll system and to have contingency measures in place if something went wrong. I know that the member for Currumbin, the shadow minister, has put out numerous press releases about this very matter since September last year. But these warnings were ignored. Clearly, the information that the shadow minister was receiving was accurate. The government failed to act on the advice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081544"></A>
The health minister was personally and regularly briefed about this payroll system. He should be held responsible for what has happened in his department. There is very clear evidence that the minister should have known some time ago that the health department payroll project was a high-risk venture which was not ready for rollout. The health minister is yet to explain why the payroll system was allowed to go ahead without a contingency plan in place. The people who are suffering are the people whom we asked about in parliament this morning. Those questions were ruled out of order. But this government needs to answer those questions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081547"></A>
There are other issues involved here. There were prior warnings of potential failures. We know that an RTI request from 2008 shows that the Shared Service Initiative has not delivered any viable alternatives to Queensland Health in the past four years and it has cost burnt at least $400 million. As we have already said, with existing problems and incomplete testing the program still went live. Millions and millions of dollars have been poured into the system, yet the checks and balances were overlooked. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081550"></A>
As we have said, there has been a cost burn attributable to Health of approximately $100 million. The budget papers allocate just $4 million to fixing the payroll mess. That is a joke. There is no way that the opposition or the public could guess at the financial cost of fixing this mess. I think the Labor government has no idea, either. It has no idea how bad the mess is. It is totally out of its depth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081551"></A>
Beyond the direct financial cost there are many other costs involved with the payroll debacle. There are reputation costs. Who is going to want to work for Queensland Health after what has happened? We are already hearing anecdotal evidence about this. I met a nurse in Mapoon who had worked for Queensland Health in regional Queensland for a number of years. That is a very small community on the cape. She said to me about three weeks ago that after having her pay affected as it has been she has taken a contract in regional New South Wales. That is anecdotal evidence that we are getting from around the state. There are obviously other junior doctors, nurses and allied health professionals who feel the same. Other workers, especially casuals or those with unusual leave entitlements, have faced ramifications due to the fact that this government has not been able to pay its workers properly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081557"></A>
The final aspect of this motion asks about the anticipated time frame. When can Queensland Health workers expect to be paid by a fully operational payroll? This government has no idea. It cannot say when the system will become fully operational. Even the Nurses Union--that great friend of this Labor government--says that there is no idea, after its meetings with the government, when this payroll system will become operational. It has given this government supposedly to the end of the financial year, but there is no confidence that it will be fixed by the end of the financial year. Queensland Health workers and all other public servants throughout Queensland deserve to have these questions answered. That is why we have called for a commission of inquiry. Tonight I urge all members to vote in support of this motion.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Caloundra--LNP) (5.40 pm): I second the motion. Tonight we are talking of a process that commenced a number of years ago but in March this year went live and was let loose on the employees of Queensland Health with devastating consequences--devastating for the employees themselves and devastating for their family members. Doctors, nurses, cooks and many others have been abandoned by this government and the health minister. In fact, the health minister’s first response to this fiasco was to absolve himself of any liability and any responsibility. The doctors, the nurses, the cooks and the maintenance workers need a champion--someone who is able to ask the hard questions of the health minister and his executive team and ask how his department allowed the SAP system to go live and why so many lives have been torn apart by this negligence.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087703"></A>
A review under the Commissions of Inquiry Act 1950 allows for powers to compel witnesses, hold witnesses in contempt and commissions are not bound by rules as to procedure or evidence. The inquiry will guarantee the following: (1) it will be held in public; (2) it will call members of the government and other parties to give evidence and be cross-examined in public; (3) it will compel the production of documents; and (4) it will provide wide-ranging recommendations as a consequence of its findings. There is no doubt that there is significant public concern and real doubt about what took place leading up to the debacle in March of this year. This needs the full glare of an independent inquiry to make accountable those who are liable for what has taken place.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087706"></A>
Yesterday in this chamber I gave a speech about a number of matters that post event showed how ill-prepared the minister was and his executive was in relation to what has occurred. But that did not deal with why it happened. What the inquiry will establish is clearly who the officers were who determined the process was ready to go; the involvement, if any, of the director-general, the deputy director-general for corporate services and the project team officers; the process to acquire the system; whether testing was done and by whom; and, importantly, if any pressure was exerted to activate this system well and truly before it should have gone live, because we know the consequences of what happened in March of this year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087708"></A>
The fallout has been well reported, but it clearly includes employees not getting their pay in full or not getting it at all. People are missing mortgage repayments, thus placing at risk their homes, and people are terminating their employment with Queensland Health but not being able to obtain severance documents, to name but a few. If that is not bad enough, there is now a major impact upon the morale of nursing staff across this state. I was talking to a nurse last night who had been with Queensland Health for 40 years and she was telling me that nursing staff are stressed because they do not know if their pay will be in their account every second Wednesday. They do not know what to do and they do not know who to turn to.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087711"></A>
There has been a massive redirection of resources from Deputy Director-General Mike Walsh all the way down, and every time one person is moved it leaves a gap that has to be filled. Every time that occurs there is a domino impact. It is like trying to plug the holes in the dyke: at some point in time you run out of fingers, and in this case you run out of people. Payroll units are under incredible stress dealing with increasing amendments, putting other tasks on the backburner or handing them to junior staff who do not have the competence to deal with them, thus again increasing the risk of further mistakes occurring. But that is not bad enough. In April 2010 this appeared in a notice from QNU involving nurse unit managers--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1087715"></A>
This has led to an inability for many to adequately perform their nurse unit manager role and ultimately to ensure the safety of staff and themselves. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1087716"></A>
So it is now impacting across the whole nursing system and placing the lives and the care and the condition of patients at risk on a regular basis.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087717"></A>
This process will allow the full light of a public inquiry into a disreputable, a disgusting and a very sad situation that has rolled out across this state and will roll out for months to come. We are coming now to the end of the financial year. I can guarantee members that this will go on for months and months. To think that $4 million will fix it is simply a joke!</Hansard-Body>

I start by reaffirming the government’s commitment to fix the problems associated with the implementation of Queensland Health’s new payroll system. I have spoken in this place many times on this issue over the past months to apologise to our hardworking staff and to update the parliament and the public on developments to stabilise the new system. I have met with front-line Health staff and payroll staff across many facilities and districts, particularly nurse unit managers, operational staff who have high levels of casual staff and payroll hub staff. The Minister for Public Works and I sat down with them in Rockhampton as they showed us how they enter data. I have personally apologised to them for the difficulties this payroll implementation has caused. I have heard the issues that they have faced on the ground, sought their advice about how to address the immediate challenges and also discussed how we might improve the payroll business process into the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087728"></A>
What have those opposite done? What is their solution? What have been their constructive suggestions? On 13 April, in response to the payroll implementation, the Leader of the Opposition came into the House and attacked the victims. He had a go at the nurses through the Queensland Nurses Union as a base political move. The government is actually interested in finding solutions--getting the job done. It is clear that Queensland Health employees and the government have been let down by the new system, and it became evident that it would not be sufficient for this to be examined and dealt with on a purely internal basis. That is why we brought in KPMG to oversee the stabilisation of the new system to focus on getting people paid and to review business processes overall going forward.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087732"></A>
I do not need to spend much time talking about the independence of KPMG. It actually costed the Victorian Liberal Party election commitment in 2006 and the Liberal Party director is a former senior manager at KPMG. It has served governments with distinction. But that was not good enough for the member for Caloundra, because then he wanted a judicial inquiry for a short period time. On 13 April he said, ‘KPMG shouldn’t be the sole source of information. We’ll have a judicial inquiry.’ Then they forgot about that, because that was not the flavour of the month. On 20 April the member for Clayfield called on the Auditor-General to investigate the payroll implementation. He was quoted as saying--</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1087734"></A>
These are important matters of public interest. It is important that the independent Auditor-General report to parliament on all aspects of this fiasco.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087736"></A>
On 19 April he and the member for Currumbin wrote to the Auditor-General seeking the Auditor-General to deal with it. Of course, the Auditor-General, with the government’s support, is dealing with it. So we have two independent inquiries--KPMG and the Auditor-General--and that does not satisfy the opposition. What is worse is that those opposite have not even got the response to them. They actually have not even seen the answers to them. So they called in KPMG. They supported KPMG. They called in the Auditor-General and then they did not like how it went. So now of course what is their solution? Of all the people that you would want to put in charge of finding a solution, they are calling in the lawyers in calling for a royal commission. As if the tens of millions of dollars that a royal commission would spend and the time that it would take would do one thing about paying our nurses!</Hansard-Body>

 I heard the honourable members opposite in silence on this matter. It is a serious matter. What did they want to do? Call in the lawyers! Call in the lawyers! Lawyers are masters at hindsight. What we need is to stabilise this pay system and work out what needs to be done for the future. That is why we have those independent people there. What is the government doing? We are continuing to work hard in terms of putting in place emergency assistance processes with local contingencies with no net financial disadvantage to make sure our staff are not disadvantaged, in consultation with unions. We are committed to ensuring that no staff member is directly financially disadvantaged as a result of the pay issues. We are dealing with the Australian Taxation Office. We are also working with RemServ and the government’s service provider to assist staff who may have salary sacrifice payments, and similarly with superannuation. We are doing everything in our power to reduce incorrect pays. We are working further to increase the efficiency of the system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093657"></A>
I have to say this--and I will say it over and over again: it is not satisfactory. But let us stop playing the sleazy politics of the opposition. On 13 April they blamed the victims. On 20 April they called for the Auditor-General. On 30 April they criticised KPMG, which they previously supported, and called for a judicial inquiry. On 21 May they criticised KPMG’s cooperation with the Auditor-General. Now they refuse to support the independence of the Auditor-General and have called for a royal commission. They wanted an Auditor-General and they got it. They wanted KPMG and they got it. They wanted the changes in staff and they got it and now they do not want them. One thing is for sure: calling in the tens of millions of dollars for a royal commission when there has not been one iota of evidence to suggest official misconduct--and remember we also have a CMC--speaks volumes about what the opposition members have said. They have not produced one document to suggest it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093658"></A>
Although during the debate on this motion the member for Caloundra referred to a whole lot of senior public servants, he did not name one in a motion, because this is a politically motivated act and will do nothing to sort our nurses’ pay. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (5.50 pm): I rise to second the motion moved by the Deputy Premier. At the outset, I reiterate the words of the Deputy Premier. This opposition is simply on a political witch-hunt. It is not interested one iota in solving this problem. It is not interested in nurses’ pay. It is not interested in any shape or form in trying to get to the bottom of this matter. All it wants to do is to chuck millions and millions of dollars down the political lavatory.</Hansard-Body>

Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Millions and millions of dollars which could go into our health system would go into a royal commission. I will tell members what this is. It is an absolute slap in the face for the Auditor-General. The members opposite wanted to bring in the Auditor-General. ‘Bring in the Auditor-General,’ they said. ‘We are not happy with KPMG. We think they are biased.’ They were not game to say that outside, of course, but that is basically what they said. So they slurred the name of KPMG in this place. Then they went on to say that they wanted the Auditor-General. But were they happy with what the Auditor-General was doing? No. By the way, he reports to this parliament, where it can be debated, on the 29th of this month. That does not satisfy them. The Auditor-General has the right to go to the bottom of every single document, every single piece of paper that is around in the bureaucracy that he can get his hands on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093666"></A>
But they are not satisfied with that. They have these RTI documents over there, and out of all of those they cannot find one where I have said on any occasion that it is right to go or that I have been advised that it is not right to go--not one! Yet on that basis they want to have a royal commission that might cost--I don’t know; let the lawyers loose with the chequebook. I do not know how much it might cost--$20 million or $30 million. Before the Auditor-General has a chance to report to this parliament they say straightaway, ‘We do not trust the Auditor-General.’ I trust the Auditor-General. I do not know what he is going to say. I have not seen his report yet. But I am certain of one thing: his independence remains intact and his dignity to investigate this matter ought not be besmirched in this place, to which he has to report. That is exactly what this motion is. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093667"></A>
We have over a period of time heard an attack on SAP by all of those who have not been game to go outside to say it--that those systems are no good. That has been said in this parliament. All I can say is what I have continually said. I have never had advice that any of these problems may arise. Never have I had that and there is no document that I have ever seen that tells me that this would be a disaster. So, on that basis, what was I to do? Was I to say, ‘No, you can’t go on that date. Nobody has told me that there is anything wrong with it, but I am just going to second-guess and say, “No, there is something wrong with it,” and so you don’t do it,’ when four people, who are highly paid by the government to make this decision, have made that decision to do so? Did I have any evidence put before me by the opposition to say, ‘No, this is a problem’? No, I did not. Otherwise I would have done something about it. So on the basis of no complaint, on the basis of no evidence, I was suddenly going to intervene in a process that was being rolled out? As it turns out, it should not have happened. The Minister for Health has said that. I have said that. But the reality is that we were no more likely to intervene in the process than I would in building contracts that we have established all over Queensland on the basis of somebody walking past me in the street and saying, ‘I don’t think you should build that there.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093668"></A>
Where is the evidence for a royal commission? Where is this burning desire to say that we are a mob of crooks? I tell members where it is: it is with those opposite--the honourable members who sit over there, in a policy-free vacuum, incapable of making any contribution to this debate that is anything other than to besmirch the names of the people who are associated with it. Where is their forensic examination of what occurred here? Where is their attempt to understand the complexity of this system? The idea that you could roll out a system like this that has 140,000 amendments every fortnight, that pays 76,000 people--the most complex payroll system that has ever been implemented by IBM. Where is their forensic assessment of that? There is none, because they are too lazy. It is far easier to sit here and say, ‘Let’s waste a bit more of taxpayers’ money for our own political gratification.’ That is all this is about. I say: let the Auditor-General go on with his work. Let us not nobble the independence of the Auditor-General. I support the amendment moved by the Deputy Premier. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs STUCKEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Currumbin--LNP) (5.55 pm): I support the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition that condemns the government’s ongoing failure to properly pay Queensland Health workers their proper salary and entitlements and calls for the urgent creation of a commission of inquiry that will investigate and report on the failed payroll system. As the months pass since the ill-fated ‘go live’ of the IBM contracted SAP Workbrain computer system and the extent of the Health payroll fiasco unfolds, it is interesting to explore the history that led to this preventable cataclysm that is still wreaking havoc on so many workers’ lives.  </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093672"></A>
While the Premier beats her chest and says that she will punish those who are to blame and while the Minister for Health cops most of the flak, another of the key culprits has managed to hide under the radar. The Minister for Public Works--or should that be the ‘Minister for Public Waste’--who usually puts on a brash vaudeville performance in the parliament as the head court jester, has been noticeably silent while his own Labor government has allowed health workers’ wages to be robbed from them for six pay cycles and still counting. Normally one to jump vigorously into the fray to defend workers’ rights, the minister has been as quiet as a mouse while health department staff desperately try to pay their bills. The minister has been too busy hosting rooftop parties for bureaucrats and going on jaunts to Germany to pay attention to what is happening in his own department. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093673"></A>
In 2005, a 10-year contract for German software company SAP was renewed by Premier Beattie without going to tender, which outraged local IT vendors. As I was told during the estimates hearing last year, the target of whole-of-government consolidation has now changed to the retaining of multiple systems--four or five payroll systems and two or three finance systems. Changing the terms of the IBM contract would, one have thought, incurred more money. However, in September last year, when I asked the minister if these changes would cost more, he said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1093675"></A>
We have a budget that we were given at the start and we will keep to it. We were given the project and we were given a budget and that budget will stand. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093676"></A>
I wonder if the minister still stands by that comment. In January 2008, a four-year contract for SAP, and awarded to IBM, was signed. In July 2008, Public Works took over CorpTech and the SAP, HR and finance program from Treasury, supposedly to consolidate whole-of-government systems. Of course the minister is no technical expert. No-one who has met him would question that. But if you are inheriting an entity, that being CorpTech, that had spent $400 million over four years between 2004 and 2008 with no result, would you not be asking questions? Was the minister not in the loop? Where was Minister Schwarten, the honourable member for Rockhampton? Was he aware of this breach of contract? These questions would be thoroughly dealt with in a commission of inquiry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093677"></A>
But what about the minister’s chief adviser, Chris Cummins? He was probably too busy changing factions so that he could run for the federal seat of Fisher. Why is this minister not paying attention? If the minister is not responsible then who is? He seemed to know the answers in estimates--or did he? The director-general ended up having to answer most of my questions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093679"></A>
Labor’s scheme for a whole-of-government payroll and human resource system was bungled from the start. The minister has claimed that no planning was ever completed for the rollout of the program to new agencies and that all the future planning had been deferred since the Queensland Health payroll fiasco. This Labor government has overpromised and underdelivered. How much more money has been wasted on this minister’s watch and how many more workers will be robbed of their hard-earned pay? Queenslanders deserve a commission of inquiry to get some truth on this inexcusable and terrible situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099861"></A>
Bad administration by inexperienced employees was poorly overseen and allowed to continue under Minister Schwarten. He and the health minister are still in denial. Pretending to be clueless about workings in his department--a department he has headed for more than a decade--pretending to have no responsibility for projects he ultimately signs off on, will not wash this time. The Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology cannot avoid the truth for much longer, a truth that health workers who have been denied proper pay deserve. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099862"></A>
Decent people who have worked on this project tell me that this payroll system will never--that is, n-e-v-e-r--work. Other departments are on hold, being propped up by ageing Legacy systems because of lack of leadership. One person said that the only thing the new Health payroll will do is make a lot of people rich. This person said that a year ago. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099863"></A>
What is the real cost of this unforgivable bungling by two incompetent ministers and their deceitful Labor government--the personal cost and also the financial cost? We cannot begin to comprehend the stress, uncertainty, depression and anger felt by those caught up in this debacle. As a former nurse I wish to add my disgust at the way this government has handled this avoidable disaster. I support the motion of the LNP before the House and encourage others to do so.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms DARLING</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Sandgate--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(6.00 pm): I am pleased to contribute to this debate on the issues surrounding the new Queensland Health payroll system. Quite frankly, the continued problems with the payroll system are unacceptable and should never have happened. We are not talking about pay slips and processes; we are talking about people being properly rewarded for their hard work and people being able to pay their bills and support themselves and their families. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099866"></A>
This government is just as concerned as the members opposite about the distress that this has caused our many dedicated Health staff. That is why the Queensland government has a plan to get to the root of the problems and fix them as soon as possible. The government has commissioned KPMG to undertake an independent review of the implementation of the Workbrain and SAP 3 systems. The Queensland Auditor-General is currently preparing his report on the implementation of the new payroll system and he should be allowed to get on with his job. It is appropriate for the Auditor-General to investigate all those issues raised by members opposite. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099867"></A>
Emergency assistance for staff in hardship was set up as soon as the payroll problems came to light. Specific staff in each facility or district can approve funds by cash, cheque or overnight payroll adjustments. When the system stabilises, Queensland Health will contact staff and negotiate a repayment schedule for these cash advances and other salary overpayments resulting from incorrect pays. If any member of staff feels that repayments are being suggested before their pays have been sorted, they should contact their line managers immediately. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099868"></A>
In consultation with health unions, Queensland Health has committed to ensuring that no staff member is directly financially disadvantaged as a result of the current pay issues. In instances where staff have incurred late fees or other charges as a direct result of the introduction of the new payroll system, Queensland Health will reimburse the staff member for those costs. Queensland Health can also provide letters, if needed, to agencies such as Centrelink and the Department of Housing on behalf of individual staff members. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099869"></A>
Advice is currently being sought from the Australian Taxation Office regarding any steps that may be put in place to assist staff who may be affected by under or overpayments. To date, additional payroll staff of approximately 200 have been employed, taking the total payroll staff to approximately 830. A dedicated payroll assistance website has been published to provide staff with access to the latest updates and information about the payroll situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099870"></A>
I have been contacted by staff from Eventide Brighton, which is in my electorate, as well as staff who live in my electorate and work at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital about a range of inaccuracies in their pays. I want to reassure my constituents who have experienced problems with their pays that these mess-ups are not a reflection on their value to the health system, nor are they part of any strange new health policy. If they received an incorrect pay slip, it is a mistake and it will be fixed. The solution is taking longer than anyone would wish and I am concerned about the stress that this is causing staff. I want to make it clear to my constituents that the government has thrown all the resources it can into fixing this system and I will continue to fight for each and every big or little pay problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099871"></A>
I would like to acknowledge the extraordinary work of the staff of all Queensland Health facilities. The director of Eventide, Mary Slattery, and her staff have worked brilliantly to provide a quick response to pay issues of Eventide staff. I urge any employee who continues to experience mistakes in their pay to talk to Mary who can arrange immediate cash payments until the issues are rectified. A lot of federal and state funding has gone into Eventide to help with its new focus on transitional care beds, which are helping people get out of hospital sooner and helping them with their rehabilitation before they return home. There is a plan to provide even more rehabilitation beds at Eventide, as flagged in the 2010-11 budget. It is part of the Bligh government’s future focused plans to reform health care in Queensland and meet the needs of our growing and ageing population. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099873"></A>
The Bligh government’s record $9.99 billion Health budget for 2010-11 is delivering more front-line services sooner. The members opposite still have no plans for meeting the ongoing health needs of Queenslanders. They know how to harp and complain, and while I think these pay issues should never have occurred, I know that this government has the best plan to fix it. Government does not come without problems, but there needs to be a team with the intestinal fortitude to face the facts and get on with fixing things. The disjointed, disloyal, disharmonious mob opposite does not have the skills to see a problem and fix it. They are good at blaming each other and splitting into opposing groups, but as we have seen, this does not result in any decent plans for Queensland. Again, I thank the dedicated Queensland Health staff. I ask them to hang in there while we fix these problems. I support the amended motion.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Toowoomba South--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(6.05 pm): This motion by the Leader of the Opposition is firstly about getting this system technically right so that the human face of our health system can be paid and the unbelievable stress that they have been put under can be overcome; and, secondly, to get to the root cause of this situation. How did this happen? These contracts were let back in 2004-05. People made overseas visits, decisions were made and 10-year contracts were signed. I heard Minister Schwarten say that he did not have any advice as to how bad it was. I remind this House of when the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 said that a simple Google search of Dr Patel would have shown a full history. A simple Google search of ‘SAP failures’ and ‘USA’ or ‘SAP failures’ in other parts of the world will show some of the problems that occurred in the pay systems, good points, bad points and the complexity of mixing the system with other overarching systems. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099876"></A>
We have to get to the bottom of the pain and suffering caused unnecessarily to the good people of Queensland Health by incompetence, negligence, lack of experience, lack of knowledge and definitely a lack of interest. Surely the health minister would have sat with his director-general and said, ‘What can go wrong with this? Are we running a system in parallel with this or are we not?’ He knows that they have up to 70,000 employees on one of the most complex payrolls in this state. Surely they sat down and he asked again and again, ‘Is there a parallel system? We will not go live, will we, until everything has been done and everyone has their entitlements, their long service leave, and they have been paid for their shifts and their overtime?’ Surely any decent, reasonable, responsible health minister would have done that with the senior executives in the health department. Surely the same would have happened with the executives in the Department of Public Works who are also responsible.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099877"></A>
This is an indictment on a government that is tired, that has had its day, lost interest, has no competence and no leadership. The ministers are just saying, ‘I’m advised.’ We have lost the technique of ministers who actually care and know a little bit about their department and ask the questions so that there are no surprises. There could not have been any issue bigger than this issue that would have required digging and investigation by the minister with his senior executives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099878"></A>
I want to talk about some of the cases of hardship that have occurred as a result of this situation, bearing in mind that we are in the 12th week of this debacle. Consider a nurse who has a husband with leukaemia and three grown-up kids to look after. She is doing night shift and trying to manage with the stress of having $600 not in her pay one week and every other pay wrong. She is trying to get off night shift and go and find out from the payroll staff what is wrong. Consider casual workers who have done 10 shifts and got $19 or $20; student nurses who have done 15 or 16 shifts and were underpaid by $1,600. It goes on and on. I know of a nurse who had a bank account closed because the money was not there to pay the house payments. Fortunately the bank was told about it and they reopened the account.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099916"></A>
We had a case in Toowoomba of someone who went into the bank to check their account and became so frustrated that the money was not there that they kicked the door of the bank and ended up before the courts. Those are only some of the stories. People who do not have a loan with the health department and have given no authority for moneys to be taken out of their account have had moneys taken from their accounts. Staff are facing enormous stress about taxation, superannuation, long service leave, holiday pay and so on. All of those are good reasons to, firstly, fix the problem with pressure from us and, secondly, get to the cause of it so it never ever happens again--not for the railway workers, police, teachers or anybody else. There has been enough pain suffered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099917"></A>
Of course the government does not want to have a proper independent judicial inquiry that goes right back. Sure, let us have a look at all the technical issues to see why the technicalities have not worked and why the pay has not been correct, but we have to get back to how this started. That is what it is all about. The government should not be hiding behind it because the human faces of Queensland Health--the dedicated, hardworking and caring nurses, doctors, wards people, cooks and everybody else--are the ones who are suffering incredibly because of the incompetence, neglect and lack of responsibility of this government. </Hansard-Body>

 (Everton--ALP) (6.09 pm): I also wish to speak in support of the Deputy Premier’s amendment to the motion. At the outset, I want to acknowledge that this is a very serious issue. The Premier and Deputy Premier have already apologised to Queensland Health staff affected by the failures of the new Queensland Health payroll system and I join with them in apologising to those staff. Those failures have affected a number of Queensland Health staff living in the Everton electorate and my office has assisted them in having incorrect payments rectified. I also want to thank Queensland Health staff for their patience during this difficult time. I think the clinical staff who treat Queenslanders every day and the administrative staff who have bent over backwards to pay those clinical staff deserve a medal.</Hansard-Body>

The government has made no secret that there remains a lot to do to fix the problems, but we are making progress in the stabilisation of Queensland Health’s payroll system. Yesterday the Deputy Premier reported to parliament that the number of Queensland Health staff who were not automatically paid as of Friday, 4 June was 318 out of a payroll of 75,000. So we are making progress, but clearly we cannot stop until the payroll system is fixed. The payroll stabilisation team is aiming to reduce the backlog of adjustments to pays by 30 June 2010. To do this, Queensland Health has hired an additional 200 staff to assist with the processing, taking the total payroll staff to approximately 830. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099922"></A>
Currently there are two independent reviews of the payroll system underway. The first, by international accountants and consultants KPMG, was commissioned by the government as soon as it was clear the problems were not going to be fixed overnight. The second is a review by the Auditor-General, something which, as the Deputy Premier has already said, the member for Clayfield sought and then complained about as soon as it happened. Now the opposition wants a third investigation, a royal commission headed by a retired judge. I have been trying to seek some explanation for why the opposition wants a third simultaneous investigation. Of course, it is seeking to exploit rank political opportunism by throwing rocks without offering one single solution for the problems that exist in the payroll system. However, maybe there is another reason.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099923"></A>
We are all aware that the Leader of the Opposition’s days are numbered. I wonder if the shrill calls for a royal commission are connected to this. First, we had leadership aspirant No. 1, the member for Clayfield, calling for an investigation by the Auditor-General. Now we have the member for Caloundra calling for a royal commission headed by a retired judge. We have all heard the rumours this week that the member for Caloundra is the latest opposition frontbencher to be approached to challenge the opposition leader. Maybe this is his first salvo in jumping ahead of the member for Clayfield. He says to the member for Clayfield, ‘I’ll raise you; I’ll double your Auditor-General with my retired judge.’ Obviously to seek the leadership of the LNP you need to demand an investigation by higher and higher authorities. I can hardly wait to hear what the next speaker, the third leadership aspirant, the member for Southern Downs, has to offer. Maybe he will raise the member for Caloundra and demand an investigation by the FBI. Then we could have four investigations underway. We could have KPMG, the Auditor-General, the member for Caloundra’s retired judge and the member for Southern Downs’s FBI. Now we have the member for Noosa also expressing an interest in the leadership of the LNP, so it may be that he will have another plan for us as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099924"></A>
Let us not forget that this is an opposition with a terrible track record when it comes to staffing of Queensland Health. This is the same opposition that went to the last election wanting to staff mental health wards with volunteer labour. This is the same opposition that went to the last election wanting to ‘front end’ 12,000 public service jobs to fund their promises. Who would have been in the firing line? We can bet that the first to be ‘front ended’ would have been the administrative staff who process the Queensland Health payroll. How do we know this? Because this is the same opposition that wanted to cut administrative positions to fund more doctors and nurses. While the government is acting by bringing on more staff to clear the backlog of incorrect payments, the opposition would have staged a massive pay day for lawyers and would have sacked the very people who are needed to pay Queensland Health employees. The opposition fails to understand that if you cut administrative staff who support doctors and nurses, you not only leave doctors and nurses doing more paperwork rather than treating patients but you also guarantee that their situation would be worse than it is now as there would never be anyone to pay them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099925"></A>
The Deputy Premier has repeatedly taken responsibility for the payroll problems and for fixing them. I believe he is doing a good job of rectifying the system, with the assistance of the two independent reviews already underway. I see no benefit in commissioning a third review, other than to put more money in the pockets of lawyers. I support the amendment to the motion. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr SPRINGBORG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southern Downs--LNP) (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (6.14 pm): I have never seen a greater display from a government in absolute denial. What we have out there in the community are families. We have loyal workers who have supported this government over a long period. They have supported our hospital systems and those in need. In Queensland the nurses, the doctors and the allied health professionals have been left high and dry by a government that is in denial. In the last few minutes from honourable members opposite we have seen supercilious, smarmy spin from people seeking to sheet away the problems and sheet away the blame to someone else. We have heard grossly insincere apologies, which is what we hear week after week after week from members of parliament who are virtually smiling when they deliver them, because they think that this is a big political gain. This is not a political gain, because there are people, families and lives greatly and grossly affected by this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099928"></A>
I bet few members opposite have actually stared in the face of somebody who was suffered and been affected, week after week, payroll after payroll, by this Labor government’s incompetence. Those people keep being promised that the problem will be fixed, but that fix never comes. They are told that things will be fixed by the next pay cycle, but that fix never comes. This is not only about people who have not been paid; it is also about people who have been overpaid; it is about people who have been underpaid; it is about thousands of people who are waiting for corrections to their entitlements and who are concerned that they are going to be penalised by the tax department. Those people are concerned that their superannuation entitlements are not being paid on time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099931"></A>
We have a government that sinks deeper and deeper into the mire of mismanagement that is its own creation. This Labor Party is an absolute master of mismanagement in this state. This government is in denial. The term ‘ministerial responsibility’ no longer passes the lips of government ministers. The term ‘ministerial responsibility’ is not even in their thoughts or psyche, because as long as they are paid and can sit back in their ministerial leather chairs, that is all that matters to them. They can mouth a few smarmy platitudes and apologies, and that will do. However, it will not fix the problem for those people who have been hurt and those families that are worried week after week after week. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099932"></A>
What has been offered to health districts throughout Queensland? A risk assessment and a risk management matrix that allow them to deal with the problem. Look at that, honourable members. That is just page 1. If you are not a rocket scientist before you start, you certainly will be afterwards. At page 2 it gets even worse. There is more of the matrix of assessment as to the case of urgency that might be before you. If that has not got you completely and absolutely confused, you go to the next stage to try to work out this mess. Is it any wonder that we have experts in the field and employees within the department who say that the Workbrain system, the integration system, can never be fixed because it is so fundamentally flawed. This government knew about it. This minister knew about it 12 months ago. He had the briefing note sitting in his tray and he said that he would not even read it or he had not even read it. Is that any surprise for a minister who establishes a particular veil of believable deniability to put a level between himself and a briefing? He would not even sign his briefing notes, he would not even sign his letters, so he could pass responsibility off to someone. Who are the victims of this minister’s incompetence, denial, failure and lack of attention? They are the health workers who have been loyal to Queensland Health for so long!</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1099935"></A>
What is the Minister for Industrial Relations doing about this? Absolutely nothing. Can honourable members imagine what would happen if a private enterprise went four, five, six, seven, eight or possibly even 10 or 20 payrolls, as we are being told, without paying their staff, with continuous problems with the payroll, without paying entitlements and without addressing superannuation? Would this minister’s department let them slip idly through the system and not prosecute them? No way. There is one rule for Labor and one rule for private enterprise. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (6.20 pm): Tonight’s motion is yet another example in a very long list of examples that demonstrate why the Liberal National Party are unfit to govern this state, why they have no understanding of public governance and why they have even less credibility to form an alternative government in this state. As Queensland’s first law officer and the minister responsible for the Commissions of Inquiry Act 1950, I feel compelled to correct the wild and unsubstantiated allegations and assertions that have been flung about by the LNP here tonight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106157"></A>
Commissions of inquiry have a very important role to play in ensuring that the public has confidence in the integrity of our governance and administrative systems and institutions. In Queensland, Labor governments view this role so importantly that for almost two decades we have established, sustained and supported a standing commission of inquiry--the Crime and Misconduct Commission--contrary to the position taken consistently in this parliament by members of the Liberal National Party. The CMC is ready and able to investigate any misconduct or failings in our governance systems in this state. It is not, however, a political football to be tossed about at any issue that the opposition seek to take political mileage from. And we know they have form when it comes to setting up commissions of inquiry for political purposes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106159"></A>
Royal commissions have served jurisdictions across Australia well, most notably in circumstances where an issue exists that warrants such special investigation where no existing authority has the authority to investigate and where no authority exists with the capacity to make rulings. But is this the case in Queensland? Quite simply the answer is no. The threshold tests--those issues that I have raised that would even warrant discussion of the creation of a commission of inquiry--have not even been touched upon by those members opposite. What is the most damning criticism of them is that the shadow Attorney-General--the man who purports to be responsible for the Commissions of Inquiry Act--did not mention the words ‘commission of inquiry’ once in his address to the parliament today. This is all lost on those members opposite. They are a lazy, policy-free zone who masquerade as an opposition and an alternative government in this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106161"></A>
The payroll situation confronting health workers in Queensland is a very serious issue and one that the government has devoted very significant resources, dedication and commitment to resolving. As well as the immediate issues which the government is working hard to address, there are several other mechanisms in place to look at the systemic issues that may have contributed to this situation. What did we hear about the Auditor-General tonight? There was no support from members opposite. He is an officer of the parliament who reports to this body, this parliament, on issues that fall within his purview. But we heard no support for that process from those members opposite, as they do not support independent officers of this parliament, nor the CMC. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106162"></A>
As I have said before, the CMC has the capacity to take action if there are any allegations of official misconduct or corruption. The opposition’s motion tonight is typical of the policy contradictions and confusion which reign supreme on the opposition benches particularly at budget time. What do we hear at every budget? What will we hear in the future? ‘Government funding must be cut.’ Yet what do we hear now? We hear a call for millions of dollars to be spent on an unnecessary inquiry which they seek to establish for partisan political purposes, and it would cost tens of millions of dollars. </Hansard-Body>

What did the Australian Law Reform Commission say about royal commissions? They said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1106165"></A>
Royal Commissions usually prove to be very expensive. Precise figures are surprisingly difficult to pin down, but we estimate that, in today’s dollars, the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry cost taxpayers over $70M, the one into the collapse of insurer HIH cost over $47M, and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody cost over $50M. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106167"></A>
We know what their Liberal National Party colleagues in Canberra did with the Cole royal commission into the building industry. They spent $70 million on a partisan political attack on the trade union movement. They will do nothing less if they set up a political inquiry here. We have seen form from them. What about their disgraceful bill last year--the disgracefully titled Commissions of Inquiry (Corruption, Cronyism and Unethical Behaviour) Amendment Bill--that they put before this parliament? It was a bill that sought to direct me to create a commission of inquiry and, if I did not, they would go to the Bar Association of Queensland to set up a commission of inquiry. The Bar Association would have to nominate someone. Did they ever put on the record how they consulted with the Bar Association? Never, not once. Those members opposite seek to use commissions of inquiry for partisan political purposes. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southern Downs--LNP) (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (7.30 pm), continuing: By way of reinforcement, these comments are based on this bill as presented by this government, on face value. Under the proposed common law amendments, caps on general damages and loss of income are also established at fair levels. In the case of general damages, these are $300,000 and loss of income three times average Queensland earnings. As I was indicating before the break, it is very difficult to try to understand and do a direct comparison about what may have happened if the government had directed an appropriate management of the runaway common law claims with regard to the WorkCover scheme in Queensland. If the government had directed proper competition to those particular claims to get towards the more meritorious claims and try to sort the wheat from the chaff, it may be that none of these amendments before the parliament would have been necessary. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112403"></A>
It is very important to understand that I do not support a restriction in access to common law for workers in general. This bill does not seek to achieve that, nor does the philosophy which I bring into this place. What I do advocate is that there has to be a far more robust, interventionist and deliberate process in managing those common law claims to make sure that the solvency of the fund is properly protected and that it is the most meritorious cases which are being rewarded in the courts in Queensland. Certainly, there has been little evidence that that has been the case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112404"></A>
The Queensland workers compensation scheme allows certain large employers to self-insure. They provide an interesting contrast to those who rely on WorkCover for their protection. Evidence points to a far more active approach for the self-insured in establishing the merits of a common law claim, including through the courts. Effective practices of workplace injury rehabilitation and reintegration are essential. This is how workers are recovered and assisted back into the workplace. Experience suggests that large self-insured employers have better and more successful programs of rehabilitation and return to work. This is advanced by self-insured employers as one of the main, if not the main, advantage of the self-insured scheme. Enough anecdotal evidence exists at least to look more fulsomely at the success of their program vis-a-vis those that are directed under WorkCover. Social, economic and personal costs of poor workplace injury rehabilitation and return-to-work programs are significant. The pursuit of better outcomes must be our goal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112408"></A>
Ministerial responsibility is a principle missing from this government’s management of our compulsory WorkCover scheme. Selective choice of board members to manage the scheme associates with it full ministerial responsibility, a term absent from this government’s operating manual. In 1999 this government said in its review of WorkCover--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1112409"></A>
The Queensland government is fully committed to job creation and recognises that any increased cost for employers can essentially lead to job losses. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112410"></A>
That statement was made in relation to potential premium increases for the Queensland WorkCover scheme. Has Labor repudiated this belief in the ensuing 11 years? If increased premiums cause job losses in 1999, increased premiums cause job losses in 2010. Average WorkCover premiums are to increase from $1.15 to $1.30. The minister must give an indication in his summing-up of whether he believes that job losses are still a significant and substantive threat that comes from the increase in WorkCover premiums, particularly as the Labor government of the day indicated in its report on WorkCover in 1999 that premium increases were likely to lead to job losses. This government must also have done some modelling and must have some advice which would indicate the impact that these premium increases may have on jobs and the viability of businesses in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112411"></A>
In 1999 this Labor government supported the reduction in solvency requirements from 30 to 20 per cent. Labor said at the time that such a reduction would be sufficient to meet catastrophes and other unpredictable events which may arise. Well, how wrong Labor was! And that is no surprise to anyone because this party consistently scores straight Es for economic management. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112412"></A>
When parliament last passed substantive changes to WorkCover, the then minister refused to release his actuary’s advice. He told the House that a reduction in premiums was affordable. He assured us that the scheme’s underlying solvency would not be compromised. Clearly, that advice was wrong. Maybe its interpretation to the parliament was incorrect. Maybe the then minister misled the House. Maybe the advice did not exist at all. Today we are faced with a similar situation, slightly in reverse. We have a minister telling us that if we do not legislate his changes on spec the scheme will collapse. He says that if we do not put up premiums and if we do not restrict access to common law payouts we will be ruined, but he says that we cannot see the actuary’s advice to confirm his claims.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As the honourable member for Lockyer said, ‘Trust me. I’m from the Labor Party.’ A few years ago, the minister’s colleague told the House that we could afford to cut premiums. I repeat: his colleague told this House that we could afford to cut premiums. He said that the fund was overflowing with surplus but that we could not see the actuary’s advice to confirm his claims. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112416"></A>
Those of us who sat in this House at that time, about three years ago--when the then minister was being pursued by the then shadow minister for industrial relations, the member for Clayfield--would remember that the member for Clayfield asked the honourable minister whether he could confirm the actuary’s advice that these reductions in premiums were sustainable, that they would not affect the solvency of the scheme and that they would not affect the underlying profit and balance sheet of the scheme? The minister said that it would not affect the underlying position of the scheme. He went on to reinforce that point over and over again and he confirmed in this place that the actuary’s advice was that it was quite appropriate and fiscally responsible to cut premiums, despite the protestations and the concerns being advanced by the opposition through the shadow minister at that time. Isn’t it interesting that some few years down the track we are here today with a government that now says that we have to increase premiums, we have to put restrictions on common law payouts and we have to make a range of other changes with regard to costs and contributory negligence because the scheme is in difficulty? ‘Trust me. I’m the minister. I have actuary’s advice.’</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112418"></A>
We are very concerned, based on what we were told a couple of years ago. The opposition approaches this debate with an abundance of suspicion--an abundance of suspicion born out of lessons learned the hard way; an abundance of suspicion knowing that we have previously been misled by this government. There will be no blank cheque from the LNP for these reforms. There will be no praise from the LNP for legislation that fails to address the giveaway culture within WorkCover Queensland in the common law division which could have been addressed, in our opinion, in isolation and may have fixed a lot of these issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112419"></A>
The WorkCover shambles is of the Labor government’s own making. The fault lies with this government and its own dereliction of duty and oversight. There is no adulation from the LNP for legislation that cleans up the mess Labor made of its own affairs. There will be no blank cheque for legislation when the minister hides the supporting financial justification from not only the parliament but also those most affected by the laws--the employers and the workers of Queensland and their advocates. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(7.40 pm): I rise to make a brief contribution to the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. As the member for Southern Downs has quite rightly indicated, in October 2007--only 2 years ago--this legislation was before the House. I will read a quote that follows on from what the member for Southern Downs said in his contribution to this debate. It reads--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1118587"></A>
The package of benefits for injured workers has been actuarially costed at $24.4 million and is a flow on from the decision to reduce the average premium rate to $1.15 per $100 of wages paid. That saves employers $34 million. So there is $34 million on the employers’ side ... Employers who have paid their premium in full by 16 September ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1118588"></A>
WorkCover is a well managed scheme and its actuarial advice is that the benefit package is affordable within the current pricing structure of the scheme. A blow-out in common law payments was a significant factor in the deficit of the old Workers Compensation Board. In 1995 the Goss government introduced the irrevocable election to either proceed to common law or take a lump sum. It was this reform that reined in common law claims and payouts. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118589"></A>
Earlier in the day’s proceedings the member for Clayfield, Tim Nicholls, made a contribution to that debate. He stated that Jim Kennedy, who was pilloried in 1996 for his reforms which the Borbidge government brought in, was brought back to review the whole thing. He said that we had not seen the report by Kennedy to the minister. He asked whether the most recent Kennedy report to the minister actually took into account lower rates of return. The returns they were getting from the investment markets at that time were 14 per cent. That is why the fund was in credit in 2007. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr RICKUSS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will take the interjection from the member for Southern Downs. Some 2 years ago we stood in the House having this same debate and said that we could afford to cut the premiums. We are in the House today saying that we have to put the premiums up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118598"></A>
Jim Kennedy wrote a report and it was not shown to us. His report was not shown to us. The Deloitte report has not been shown to us. Workers compensation legislation is presented to us carte blanche--accept it as it is, take it for what it is. How can we accept this? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118599"></A>
I paid workers compensation premiums for 30 years. I felt like it was an impost but I knew I had to pay it. I wanted my workers to be covered. That is appropriate. No-one denies workers’ legitimate claims for work injuries. As has been highlighted by the shadow minister, what has actually happened is that claims that were not legitimate have been trumped up and paid. This really needs to be looked at. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118600"></A>
What cost savings will WorkCover incur due to costs being awarded against the plaintiff? I notice in this legislation that costs can be awarded against plaintiffs. Has the minister got a costing for that? I call on the minister to give us an answer to that. What will actually be saved by that measure? This act was poorly drafted by Goss in 1995 and fixed up by us later on. It has been hashed about ever since. It goes on and on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118601"></A>
The excess for any claim is going to increase by more than $400. Will this legislation have to be revisited next year? Will it have to be tidied up next year? What is Deloitte’s advice on what is going to happen next year and the year after? That is what we really need to know. Where is it going year after year? <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Gregory--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(7.46 pm): I wish to make a short contribution to the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill this evening. We witnessed today this government hiding when confronted with the critical issue of the nonpayment of employees and the disgraceful debacle that is raging out of control in Queensland Health. One can only imagine what the outcry would be if it were the conservatives who were sitting on the Treasury benches while this fiasco raged on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118605"></A>
Twice in less than two decades we have witnessed a workers compensation scheme with a question mark over it. I hope that the Attorney-General can verify whether there is a question mark over it. As a member of the Borbidge government in 1996 I saw firsthand the deceit about the management of strategies by the Goss government exposed. The then minister, Santo Santoro, had to find over $300 million to fill a black hole hidden by that government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118607"></A>
I ask: what is hidden here? We have to bear in mind that the truth always comes to the fore. This government preaches daily about its desire to increase job opportunities and to retain jobs but the real target should be employers. The government has to create an environment to encourage employers to employ, not discourage them from employing because of the moral policies of a government that has no conscience when it comes to telling the truth about what the real package is. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118609"></A>
We certainly do not need a re-run of the Goss government days. When this government finally changes, the truth will be told. Again, this government is precious when it comes to the spotlight being shone in its eyes. It has to find someone to blame. Yes, it is the global financial crisis, as the shadow Attorney-General alluded to this evening. We had a crisis in Queensland long before the global financial crisis. It was poor financial management.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118610"></A>
The platform of workplace practice is sacred to the Queensland economy and it is absolutely paramount that it is protected by an affordable, responsible and workable workers compensation scheme. Premiums can be, in most cases, increased but the fallout will be a further impost on employers. Whilst something has to give, it could be jobs. This vicious circle is a form of mismanagement and the fallout becomes that of the employees. Ambitious claims through fraudulent claims of corruption and dishonesty have not helped this very sacred right of the Queensland worker, but dishonesty can cause hurt to the decent and proper applicant and employer ultimately. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118642"></A>
Workplace safety measures are something that need a refocus, and I urge the Attorney to put into policy reward for good workplace practices because that will save many people a lot of money over a long period of time. The mining industry must be congratulated for its commitment to safe workplace environments. In an industry that is dangerous if not managed properly, unions, management and allied support have certainly demonstrated their quality management in the mining industry in this great state and have demonstrated that it is one of the safest work environments in a highly technical area where heavy machinery is used on a regular basis in terms of underground mining and above-ground mining. I have to congratulate the mining industry in Queensland for an environment that is comparable to nowhere else in the world in terms of safety. Other workplaces in Queensland should adopt this example that is overseen by responsible management of industrial relations with a parallel for employers and employees.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118645"></A>
One must question the scrutiny by Commerce Queensland and the Queensland Law Society when they did not get the answers they wanted and became suspicious. If full and proper consultation is done at the time of compiling legislation, these responsible bodies would give their blessing. The claims mounted by some claimants is criminal, as alluded to by the shadow Attorney this evening, and the protection of employers in these cases is void if they cannot defend their position. As the shadow Attorney stated, speculative claims serve no purpose. Again, the bill contains amendments that allow provision to award costs against a person whose common law claim is thrown out. These speculative claims with a nature of wrong intent do push up premiums and unfairly punish the legitimate claimant and the honest and decent employers. This is something that must be further canvassed in getting justice for the legitimate claims. We want our workers to be in the workplace because it is a productive cause for Queensland. We need to make sure that a proper rehabilitation program is afforded to genuine injured workers. The non-genuine will identify themselves in time, as always happens. They skite about it and always get caught out.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118647"></A>
A premium increase from $1.15 to $1.30 is a significant increase in these difficult times of job security. There are many people out there at this very moment looking at their bottom line and how they can trim some fat to ensure that their business operations are viable. I would have thought that if this process was managed as well as the government says it is there would be no need to increase premiums in these fragile economic times where many employers are at the very moment still coming to terms with the hidden government policies that have caused their businesses extra burden through, for example, higher fuel prices that they did not budget for and which in many cases pushed them over the edge. Those policies of deceit are certainly not advantageous to the ongoing productivity and viability of Queensland employers and ultimately, more importantly, Queensland employees.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118648"></A>
This legislation should be treated with the same contempt that this government has treated the people of Queensland in recent times if the Attorney cannot clarify some of the real facts that may be hidden in this agenda. I will be waiting to hear the Attorney’s response to some of these issues before I set my mind free in relation to this legislation. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr FINN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Yeerongpilly--ALP) (7.53 pm): Before I turn to the speech I have prepared I want to make a few comments about some of the information that has been related to the House so far. Firstly, let us be quite clear: the WorkCover scheme in Queensland is well managed. It is a well-managed scheme. It is the only scheme of any state in the country that operates at over 100 per cent solvency--the only of any state. It has the lowest employer premiums of any state in the country and it manages some 96,000 claims every year. What we hear from the opposition is that this is not management. How has it managed to maintain 100 per cent plus solvency? How has it managed to do that? It has done that through good management. The problem we have with members of the opposition is that they come in here over one year after the last election when they should have learned their lesson and still deny that the global financial crisis exists. That is what they said before the last election and they still come in here and deny that that occurred. It is a fairly weak argument to say that a scheme is poorly managed. They do not have the facts on that and their argument is completely wrong on that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118653"></A>
What we see is a board that manages an insurance scheme for injured workers in this state--a board that sets premiums for an insurance scheme and a board that manages a volatile mix of risk which means it has to be flexible, which means it has to evolve, which means it has to model its operations on the workforce of today and not deny global financial crises and not set a scheme that just goes on and on with no change. It has to be nimble at times and it has to reflect the needs of the workforce. It sets a premium. It works out what an appropriate premium is in the workplace but it also reports annually to government. In its annual report it reports on what amendments need to be made to address the needs of injured workers and the compensation scheme and insurance scheme that covers them while they are at work to suit today’s workforce. It is quite a normal and a good practice of management to annually review a scheme through the annual reporting process.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118658"></A>
In the amendments before us today we see three clear sets of decisions have been made as part of this review, and I will address them as I go on. The health and safety of workers is a priority of the Bligh Labor government. Ensuring that workers receive a fair and reasonable level of protection under Queensland’s workers compensation scheme is part of that priority, as is ensuring business has a competitive base in comparison with interstate rivals. That is why when the government moved to make changes to the country’s fairest and least expensive workers compensation scheme to ensure its continued viability in the face of world economic recession it consulted widely, and it consulted widely with key stakeholders including employers, workers, workers’ representatives, unions and the legal profession. I thank those people who were involved in that stakeholder process.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118661"></A>
It is fair to say that there was feedback across the spectrum about how government should resolve this issue and that direct stakeholder involvement meant that we came up with a proposed set of outcomes that have been very well road tested with the stakeholders and have reached an agreement in what can be a fairly volatile set of circumstances. There can be very strong views from all sides of stakeholder groups in the industrial relations arena. There can be a fairly broad scope in terms of what people’s views are, and there were people who said that we should have addressed the issues brought about by the global financial crisis solely through premiums. There were people who had that view, and that would have seen massive premiums over the $2 mark. We had people who said we should stop injured workers from having access to common law if they have an injury that is under 15 per cent of a whole person injury. That would have virtually knocked out just about every common law claim or the vast majority of common law claims.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1125081"></A>
What I was very pleased about in the consultation process was that those extremes were not very common and that people worked in a very proactive and consultative way to come up with an outcome which works out as a set of amendments that address the needs that face the workforce while also addressing the needs of spiralling common law claims and addressing the financial viability of the scheme into the future, with all parties realising that something had to be done if Queensland employers and workers were to continue to enjoy the best and fairest workers compensation scheme. For employers the WorkCover Queensland board has advised that with these changes the average premium rate will increase to $1.30 per $100 of wages paid, up from $1.15. Whilst this is a 13 per cent increase in the average premium rate, Queensland employers will still have the lowest average premium rate of any state in the country.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1125089"></A>
For example, Victoria and Western Australia have announced their average premium rates for the same period--2010-11. Victoria, the state with the second lowest average premium rate, has announced an average rate of $1.34 per $100 of wages, which is just over three per cent more than the Queensland rate. Western Australia has announced an average premium rate of $1.49--almost $1.50; it is actually $1.497--which is 15.2 per cent higher than the Queensland rate. If the members of the opposition want to talk about the management of the scheme, perhaps they could talk to their mates in Western Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118695"></A>
For workers, the bill harmonises the workers compensation common law arrangements with the Civil Liability Act 2003, which will see general damages assessed in accordance with a set scale. To determine general damages, an injury scale value will be used to assess a worker’s dominant injury, having regard to the scale set up in the CLA. The effect of the injury scale value is that it compresses claims at the lower end of the scale and benefits the more seriously injured. WorkCover’s actuary, PricewaterhouseCoopers, has projected that the harmonising with the CLA should result in common law claim frequency reducing by nine per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118698"></A>
As was mentioned previously, although it was clear that action needed to be taken to ensure the solvency of the scheme, the government was not prepared to consider significant changes without careful consultation with scheme stakeholders. A discussion paper was released on 23 February 2010, with public comment invited by 24 March 2010. The discussion paper outlined a number of proposals to ensure the continued future strong financial health of the scheme. A stakeholder reference group of employers, unions and the legal profession was established to consider the submissions and provide advice to the minister. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118699"></A>
I should say that the member for Lockyer incorrectly claimed that there was no access to the Deloitte report. The Deloitte report was released publicly and given to all stakeholders in that stakeholder reference group. It was the basis of a number of submissions that were prepared by stakeholders. It was a readily available, publicly released--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118702"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FINN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 A report from Deloitte was available to everybody who sought it. The reference group, which was chaired by the Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations, met on four occasions. Sixty written submissions were received in response to the discussion paper. They were received from employers, self-insurers, unions, workers, lawyers and health professionals. None of the submissions that were received suggested a change to the fundamental nature of the Queensland scheme, that is, a short-tail scheme with access to common law. Today we introduce amendments that maintain a short-tail scheme, maintain access to common law and continue the lowest premiums of any state in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118703"></A>
Three concerns were consistently raised by stakeholders, and the minister outlined those in his second reading speech. These were concern about the need for a much stronger focus on rehabilitation and return-to-work outcomes, concern that WorkCover accepts claims too easily and settles common law claims for sums that are too high, and concern regarding the transparency of the scheme. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118704"></A>
Earlier in my comments I said that there were three sets of decisions. The first set of decisions was those that we are introducing in this amending legislation that go to the immediate solvency and financial viability of the scheme and the way in which the scheme operates. The second set of decisions will be made towards the end of this year. That will come about after a review is conducted by Robin Stewart-Crompton, who is the former chief executive of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission and most recently the chair of the national review into model occupational health and safety laws. He has been appointed to conduct the structural review of institutional and working arrangements in Queensland’s workers compensation scheme. Mr Stewart-Crompton commenced scoping the review on 1 June and, as part of this exercise, he is meeting with key stakeholders in the compensation scheme. So this second set of decisions, if you like, will be based on the structural operations of the scheme and how they best need to be addressed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118707"></A>
The review that Mr Stewart-Crompton will undertake will advise the minister on, firstly, appropriate strategies and institutional arrangements to ensure the roles and the functions of Q-Comp, WorkCover and the Department of Justice and Attorney-General in Queensland workers compensation are clear and well understood by stakeholders and the broad community; secondly, arrangements that can be put into place to enhance transparency and ensure that information is readily available to stakeholders and the broader community on the workers compensation scheme performance; thirdly, strategies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the workers compensation claims management and common law settlement process; fourthly, the appropriateness of the current level of legal costs and management of the legal profession in workers compensation matters; and, fifthly, what actions can be taken by scheme stakeholders to improve rehabilitation and return to work. This is the structural review that will pick up on the matters raised by stakeholders in their written submissions and will lead to the government addressing the structural needs of the scheme in the short term. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118709"></A>
As I said earlier, any scheme, no matter how successful, needs monitoring and finetuning from time to time. I am pleased that the minister is assessing whether the amendments that are passed tonight or any of these concerns that were raised in the stakeholders group have any basis by ordering the structural review of the working arrangements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118710"></A>
Also, as the minister addressed in his second reading speech, an overall effectiveness review of WorkCover’s current and future financial position will be undertaken into two years time and completed by 31 December 2012. That review will assess the success of the amendments that we make to the scheme tonight to ensure the financial viability of the scheme into the future. By 2012 we will know the full impacts of the amendments that have been outlined. That will give some comfort to representatives of employers and unions, as the full impact of the amendments that are being debated today will be known then. I say to the opposition members that I completely reject any suggestion that the scheme should not be regularly reviewed and changed as needed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118711"></A>
The short story of this bill is that a scheme that operates successfully in Queensland compensating injured workers comes to the government with an annual report that says that it has taken a hit from the global financial crisis and that it needs to have some amendment. An extensive consultation process, which gathers all of the feedback that we can get from stakeholders, comes up with some recommendations that are about ensuring the financial viability of the scheme into the future. We come up with a set of amendments that maintains the lowest premiums in the country and ensures that there is no restriction on common law access for injured workers. This is good Labor Party amending legislation. It is good economic management legislation. It is legislation that builds on a well-managed insurance scheme and ensures its viability into the future. I commend the bill. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms GRACE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Brisbane Central--ALP) (8.06 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. Throughout my career of 27 years in the union movement, workers compensation was something that I had been involved in and I never considered for one minute giving up my role in policy formation and implementation. When it comes to providing benefits for workers injured in the workplace and providing entitlements to affected families, the union movement and Labor governments in Queensland have a proud history. In 1916, it was a TJ Ryan led Labor government that introduced Queensland’s first compulsory workers compensation scheme, which was based on no fault and access to common law rights and entitlements. It is interesting to note that, at the time, my understanding is that the opposition voted against such a bill being introduced into this House. Yet if you listened to the member for Southern Downs you would think that they had been for this legislation since 1916. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118714"></A>
But the members opposite have a legacy in workers compensation. We do not have to go back too far to know exactly what they intended to do with workers compensation entitlements. I remember being elected assistant general secretary of the QCU in 1995. One of the first things that hit my desk was the then Borbidge government’s draft changes to the workers compensation act. They were not about mucking around with common law; they were about knocking it out completely. At that time they went to an election promising to maintain common law. However, when they got into power, I give credit to the member for Gladstone because she held them to that promise they made during the election campaign and stopped them knocking out common law. I am sure she will remember that, because the then government had negotiations with the member for Gladstone. That is their legacy--not about trying to fix it up but about knocking common law out completely--and they were only stopped at that time because they did not have the majority. Yet they come in here crying about what we are doing here based upon their legacy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1125253"></A>
But that was not the only thing they tried to do. They changed the definition of worker, restricting the number of workers who had access to common law. They restricted the definition of injury where employment had to be the major significant factor. That absolutely smashed the number of workers who had entitlements to workers compensation. Unless a person was able to prove that work was the major contributing factor, it was such a hard test that not many workers went through. I see the member for Kawana smiling over there. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms GRACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 He is a legal person and maybe he understands exactly what it means. I take the interjection from the member for Kawana about looking to the future. We were given a history lesson by the member for Southern Downs, and I think it is about time that we gave a history lesson and gave the facts when it comes to the opposition’s intentions in relation to workers compensation. Not only did it change the definition of injury, it then reduced the income that workers get from 39 to 26 weeks. It introduced self-insurance to employers of 500 or more employees but without any sort of occupational health and safety management system whatsoever. The member for Southern Downs comes into this House and goes on about occupational health and safety. Those opposite allowed employers to self-insure without any record of their occupational health and safety systems. That is what those opposite introduced in 1996. It was a disgrace. We changed it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1125256"></A>
What the opposition then did was insidious. It tried to knock out journey claims altogether. Once again, because it did not have the majority, that was knocked out as well. What was put in was that they had to access journey claims from the most convenient, direct and shortest route. Its intention was to do two of the most hideous things to workers under workers compensation: knock out journey claims and knock out common law. That is the history lesson that we have in this House. That is what those opposite should be talking about, not giving us a history lesson on TJ Ryan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1125257"></A>
Let us talk about the future. I am pleased that this bill continues these principles of a no-fault statutory scheme together with maintaining the rights of injured workers to pursue common law claims and entitlements. We are the only state in Australia that still maintains common law rights. I am proud to have been part of ensuring that this has been maintained over the many years that changes have been made to the WorkCover legislation. If one looks at the history there have been many changes. I see some of the staff from the department on the fringes of the House. We have had many meetings in the past years over changes to workers compensation. However, I want to focus on the future of the Queensland workers compensation scheme and its sustainability in good times and, of course, in bad. When I say that, I acknowledge that the global financial crisis represents the very worst of times and hopefully we are putting that behind us at last. But the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 sets up the Queensland scheme for a strong future because it addresses issues associated not only with the economic woes of Wall Street and beyond but also increases in common law claims and the cost of those claims that require laws to be updated and improved from time to time. We know that we have had many instances where we have been in this House because of this situation occurring from time to time. The bill before us does just that and ensures the scheme remains sustainable well into the future. It offers protection for workers and their families, but it also offers a fair and balanced approach to compensation issues that, along with the global financial crisis, could threaten WorkCover Queensland’s bottom line to some extent if action had not been taken. It was not in the exaggerated dire strait as the member for Southern Downs pointed out. The Deloitte review found WorkCover was experiencing a rise in common law claims and payouts and that premiums were not keeping pace with this growth. These factors resulted in a loss of $381 million before tax in 2007-08, followed by a loss of $894 million in 2008-09. These are not small figures. However, sound board management over the last decade had built up a healthy reserve and that was used to absorb these losses. Obviously the situation could not be allowed to continue. I must stress that the scheme remained fully funded as at 30 June 2009 with a positive funding ratio of 127 per cent, the highest in the country; not the exaggerated position as outlined by the member for Southern Downs. </Hansard-Body>

The Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill harmonises damages arrangements with the Civil Liability Act 2003. This will see a capping of payout amounts and changes to common law damages, particularly liability and contributory negligence. General damages, pain and suffering will be capped at approximately $300,000 and damages for economic loss will be capped at three times Queensland ordinary time earnings or, currently, $176,607. This will be the maximum annual earnings a court will be able to take into account when calculating loss of future earnings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1125259"></A>
Although I accept that this is not the ideal situation, and I accept that no-one really likes caps, I believe that, in view of the need to improve the workers compensation WorkCover fund, these amendments present a fair and reasonable outcome. WorkCover’s actuary, PricewaterhouseCoopers, says that these measures should reduce the frequency of common law claims and reduce the size of settlements paid, particularly for minor or less severe injuries or lower end of the scale injuries, and benefit more seriously injured workers, which is really what we are all about. Injured workers continue to receive fair benefits through the unchanged statutory scheme. I also note quantum and liability restrictions will apply if a worker pursues a common law claim, with a court able to award costs against a worker where a claim is dismissed. My understanding is that this is actually correcting an anomaly which exists under the current bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1125260"></A>
Importantly, the bill before us addresses the issue which has arisen since the decision in the Queensland Court of Appeal in Bourk v Power Serve Pty Ltd &amp; Anor. This decision effectively meant that if a worker is injured at work and there is a casual connection between the injury and work the employer has breached its duty under the Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995. Common law claims increased after this decision based on the perception that strict liability attaches to an employer if a work injury has occurred regardless of fault, which was not the government’s policy intent. The amendments address this. Workers need to show that an employer breached a duty to take precautions against a risk of harm that was foreseeable, not insignificant, and in circumstances in which a reasonable person would have taken the precautions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1125262"></A>
Another sustainable change that should ensure the future financial strength of the fund is the fact that the bill also increases employer excesses from 65 per cent of Queensland ordinary time earnings to 100 per cent or one week of compensation. I believe that this is a win-win situation. I think that employers will take notice when they actually have to put their hand in their pocket for the first week of workers compensation, thus hopefully changing the culture to improve worker health outcomes because it is an incentive to employers to improve injury rates and cut their costs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1125263"></A>
A financially sound WorkCover Queensland is vital for all Queenslanders and our economy. Therefore, in conclusion, I wish to make three important points regarding this bill. Firstly, the bill maintains access to common law damages for all injured workers, a uniquely Queensland entitlement, whilst maintaining a no-fault, generous statutory scheme. Secondly, the bill balances good benefits for injured workers with affordable premiums for employers, which are currently the lowest premiums in Australia and which could not be sustained for the viability of the fund. We had to increase the premiums. Everyone was saying they were far too low. I must confess that when we brought them down to that level when I was QCU general secretary I said we had gone too far. I said that we would be here trying to amend it. It saddens me that my words actually came true. </Hansard-Body>

 I said that and I think the member for Southern Downs may have said the same. Thirdly, I welcome the proposal to further review the scheme in two years time to be completed by 31 December 2012 by which time the effects of the GFC should have diminished significantly and the impacts of implementation of amendments in line with the Civil Liability Act will be known. I really do welcome a review in two years time. </Hansard-Body>

I commend the minister and staff, together with all members of the stakeholder reference group, particularly union and employer organisations, who gave so generously of their time and commitment to find a solution and for participating in an open and cooperative approach to ensuring that this state maintains a strong, viable and fair workers compensation scheme, a WorkCover scheme in Queensland that leads Australia. I commend the bill to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr MOORHEAD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Waterford--ALP) (8.18 pm): I too rise to support the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. This legislation protects our strong and generous workplace compensation schemes from the effects of the global financial crisis. Last decade saw some very generous reductions in WorkCover premiums for employers, based on strong returns on WorkCover asset investments. The global financial crisis saw income from investments reduce while claims from workers increased. This is the time when employees are less able to find suitable alternative employment after injury and the likelihood of mitigating their loss is minimised, but Queensland is not alone. Significant losses of more than $1 billion were felt in the states of Victoria and South Australia. In Queensland, we are fortunate that we have had a very strong policy of fully funding liabilities. As at 30 June 2009 we fully funded this to the extent of 127 per cent of liabilities going forward. Compare that to South Australia with 56.7 per cent of funding, New South Wales with 89 per cent of funding and Victoria with 97 per cent of funding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131603"></A>
In 2009 the WorkCover board responsibly sought independent advice on the effects of the global financial crisis on the scheme. With the handing over of that report to the Attorney-General, the Attorney-General released a discussion paper and established a stakeholder reference group to consult with the stakeholders on this issue. There was never going to be an outcome on the issue where everybody was happy, but what was needed was an outcome that stakeholders could live with going forward, and this bill delivers that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131604"></A>
This bill protects the fundamental principle of our WorkCover scheme, a system that protects workers’ common law rights to seek compensation and to have finality of their claims. The best interests of employers and employees is to finalise claims quickly and let both parties move on with their lives. Long-tail schemes such as those in operation in other states might appear more attractive to some employers but end up being more costly and more cumbersome for employees. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131605"></A>
There are a number of aspects to the reform contained in this bill. The first is an increase in premiums for employers. When we discuss insurance premiums, we must remember that this is an insurance scheme. This is not a government tax or a government charge. This is insurance for liabilities that employers have incurred due to workers being injured at work. This meets the employers’ costs. Taxpayers and workers should not be subsidising the compensation that workers are entitled to from employers through the WorkCover scheme. Queensland still has the lowest premiums in the country, which are three per cent below our nearest competitor state of Victoria. This maintains a competitive business environment for Queensland. This $1.30 rate is still lower than the rate that existed in Queensland in 2006 and is significantly lower than the $1.85 rate that stood when Santo Santoro took an axe to workers compensation in 1997. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131606"></A>
The bill also introduces a cap on economic loss, but this cap applies to people earning more than $176,000 per annum. This will affect a small number of people. Those who need the compensation most will still receive it. The bill provides for a cap on general damages. That cap provides a clear statutory table for general damages, providing guidance and certainty, and a clear way to resolve claims without the need for expensive legal advice and litigation. This encourages claims to be settled early, meaning that money can be spent on paying workers’ claims rather than paying lawyers to fight them. The cap on general damages means that small claims that often have legal fees making up a higher percentage of that claim are discouraged and may be negatively affected, but large claims for general damages are often better off under a scheme of this nature. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131607"></A>
Importantly, this reform process includes a review in two years time of the strength of the reforms. There are some items that I think really need to be given great consideration--issues like voluntary services and their compensation in this scheme--but if the scheme has the ability to return benefits to workers, we should do that. If this bill delivers the strength that it plans to, there should be a position where the common law scheme is fully funded and workers can return to the benefits they get at the moment. Workers should not be forgoing their entitlements to subsidise employer premiums. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131608"></A>
I finish by reiterating the point that this is an insurance scheme to meet the costs that should be borne by employers; this is not a taxpayer funded program to fund compensation entitlements. This is an insurance scheme and workers, through either taxes or loss of rights, should not be subsidising those claims. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr BLEIJIE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kawana--LNP) (8.23 pm): Mr Deputy Speaker, at the outset may I congratulate you on your elevation to the panel of temporary speakers. This evening I rise to draw the attention of the House to a perfect example of how the Labor government has mismanaged the state’s finances. What better way to celebrate that than by debating this bill in budget week? In fact, in the first paragraph of his second reading speech, the honourable Attorney-General said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131612"></A>
The bill before the House implements important reforms to further strengthen the performance of the Queensland government’s workers compensation scheme. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1131614"></A>
It is not a matter of reforming the government’s workers compensation scheme. It is another example of whatever this government touches it cannot get it right. Further, in his second reading speech the Attorney-General stated--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131616"></A>
While WorkCover did not escape this crisis, its continued stable performance contrasted with that of other Australian workers compensation schemes that did not fare as well through the global financial crisis. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1131617"></A>
The Attorney-General then went on to compare Queensland with other states. The only comparison that should take place is between Queensland which lost its AAA credit rating in the GFC and all the other states which did not lose theirs. That is the comparison that the Attorney-General needs to make. This government never accepts responsibility for anything it does. No doubt the global financial crisis is behind the Premier’s worst approval ratings in Queensland history of 69 per cent. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131618"></A>
My contribution to the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 follows on from that of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow Attorney-General. The course before the House is set to amend the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2003, the Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995 and other relevant subordinate legislation to ensure a viable WorkCover scheme is in place for Queensland workers. The near collapse of the WorkCover scheme in Queensland is as a direct result of the changes implemented by Labor governments in this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1235834"></A>
In 1996 the Borbidge coalition government introduced the test to tighten injury claim provisions under the WorkCover legislation. Those provisions ensured that a rigid framework was applied to all WorkCover claims and that the scheme was a viable one to protect Queensland workers in the event that a workplace injury was sustained. Since the election of the Beattie government in 1998, the WorkCover scheme in Queensland has been weakened to a point where it has now run at a deficit of $1.3 billion over the past two years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131621"></A>
The viability of WorkCover Queensland and its demise over the past two years is intrinsically linked with mismanagement by successive Labor governments in this state. I refer to an article titled ‘Businesses call for WorkCover scrutiny’, which was published in the <Hansard-Italic>

The same article states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131634"></A>
Trilby Misso chief executive Graeme McFadyen said the public had been ‘hoodwinked’ and the picture being painted by the Government was a facade. He said sharemarket losses claimed by WorkCover of about $800 million last financial year would have recovered since the economy turned around and would be nowhere near that level now. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1131635"></A>
The article quotes Mr McFadyen as saying--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I think the background of the economic crisis is very convenient for them to introduce changes. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1131638"></A>
That is a scathing indictment of the WorkCover board and this government’s management of the scheme that is meant to protect Queensland workers. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131639"></A>
One can understand why business in general is by no means a friend of this government. Since 1998 consecutive Labor governments have mismanaged WorkCover almost into insolvency. Now, to recover from the mess it has created, the Attorney-General introduces this legislation in an attempt to regenerate the scheme and increase the premiums. Who will pay for this? Businesses that employ working Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131668"></A>
I have a great deal of empathy for Mr Terry White, deputy chairman of the WorkCover board. He serves on the board with the six Labor appointees and under the chairmanship of Mr Ian Brusasco, who, as I said, is also on the board of Labor Holdings. I am baffled that the Attorney-General maintains that WorkCover’s dire financial position is as a result of the GFC. In his second reading speech, the honourable the Attorney-General championed Labor’s record of ‘protecting workers from injury in the workplace and for providing compensation for those who find themselves in an unfortunate situation’.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr BLEIJIE: </Hansard-Member-Up>
They are the words of the Attorney--and I note the honourable member for Morayfield is in agreement. Well, of course he is because it is his Attorney-General. But I point out to the honourable gentleman that the Attorney-General failed to mention the fact that policy implemented by Labor governments since 1998 has failed to maintain a viable WorkCover scheme. This legislation is required to rescue the current WorkCover scheme. Two million Queensland workers rely on the WorkCover scheme for injury compensation cover, and these workers deserve a scheme that is viable and well managed. Clearly this government has demonstrated its inability to do so, and this legislative rescue package is a last-ditch effort to save face before the workers of this state are again let down by this government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131684"></A>
We need a WorkCover scheme in this state that balances the protection of Queensland workers should a workplace injury occur with the premium costs associated and paid for by business. The cap that this bill includes is finally a protective measure that will ensure the viability of the WorkCover scheme is maintained into the future. The $300,000 cap on claims ensures that the scheme is viable and that claims are at an appropriate level that recompenses workers if they are unable to work as a result of a workplace injury. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131688"></A>
I note that the bill also introduces contributory negligence factors. That of course should be supported because, as the honourable shadow Attorney-General highlighted in his representations to the parliament, it is necessary in that if someone is continually advised of safe practices and they neglect to follow those safe practices then they are indeed contributors to negligence. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131696"></A>
We do not deny that the GFC existed, but we do say that had the LNP been in power we would have retained our AAA credit rating. I yearn for the day of an LNP state government so that we are not continually dragged into this place to legislate against Labor Party stuff-ups--continual stuff-ups by the Labor Party. I yearn for the day that the LNP is in government, when we can come into this chamber looking to the future and not hear about review after review after review and continually review legislation because the Labor Party--it is a fact--cannot get it right the first time around. In summary, I wish to reiterate the points and support the statements made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow Attorney-General in relation to this bill before the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (8.34 pm): I rise to speak to the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill and place on the record my continuing concern and support for injured workers. We need to understand--and I am sure that we all do--that when men and women are injured at work, and their families are affected thereafter, they are in their greatest need of support at a time when they are least able to defend themselves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131704"></A>
There have been a number of comments about the history of workers compensation and a number of interjections by people who were not here at the time. From my perspective, some of the comments that have been made do not reflect the reality. We had a minister hell-bent on making quite significant changes to workers compensation. We also had a shadow minister who was either unwilling or unable to provide amendments in a timely fashion and to defend those amendments so that those of us in the chamber could properly understand the position that the Labor opposition felt it was in at the time. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, thank you. In relation to travel claims, a lot of comment was made in relation to football or other sports injuries which occurred on the weekend but were claimed on the Monday as a work injury. That was a background to the claims being from the person’s fence--the beginning of public property. I felt that at least there was some opportunity to be able to prove or disprove the reliability of that claim. It was the same with the definition of a worker. There have been people who thought they were workers under the workers compensation schedule but when they were injured found out that they were not included. That was people like young deckies who got paid a percentage of the catch and when they were injured on the boat, sometimes quite seriously, they found out after the fact that they were not actually workers under the workers compensation scheme. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is right. So it was important to get some clarity. Was it all right? Not at all. Is this all right? I do not believe so either, because it will have an impact on workers at a time when they are at their most vulnerable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131715"></A>
I will be interested in the Attorney-General’s clarification of a number of issues. One aspect that is being blamed for this financial shortfall is the global financial crisis. I have heard both sides of the chamber debating this. I wonder about the investments, particularly those in sensitive portfolios, if those investments are of a speculative nature. I wonder whether people in this state expect our governments to be speculative or to leave those investments in vulnerable areas. That is perhaps a moot point. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131717"></A>
I am concerned about the capping of common law claims. I will be interested in the minister’s comments in relation to this matter. I am particularly concerned about two aspects. One is with regard to people who are significantly injured--people who were providers for their families who are seriously injured in a workplace. How significant will be the capping on their ability to provide not only for their family but also for themselves if they become high-care people, if they become paraplegics or quadriplegics? It is easy to dismiss that comment or question by saying that it does not happen very often, but when it does happen it is a cataclysmic event and one that has to be addressed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131719"></A>
I would be interested in the minister’s comments in relation to the application of costs. I am very concerned as to whether this will be a significant disincentive for injured workers to rightly pursue a claim. So often we have people in our offices who have been injured--sometimes visibly, sometimes less visibly--and they are in a vulnerable position physically, emotionally and financially. If they are put in a position where to pursue claims they are at risk of having damages awarded against them, how big of a disincentive will that be? Will it mean that workers who should be receiving financial support will be so intimidated by that risk that they will not pursue their rights? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1138502"></A>
I would have to say that I do not fully understand how moving the common law damages in line with the Civil Liability Act will impact on people in terms of quantum, but perhaps the minister will clarify that in his summing-up. In the situation of contributory negligence, I think most reasonable Queenslanders believe that if a worker contributes to an incident then that contribution should be recognised in their eligibility for payment. I think if somebody has been drinking on a site or taking drugs on a site, irrespective of the zero tolerance requirements, then reasonable Queenslanders will say that, yes, they have to be held accountable for that. If equipment has been supplied to them but they have refused to use it--refused, not been unable to--then that has to be taken into account. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1138506"></A>
I would like another clarification. Again, I commend the member for Brisbane Central because I did go and have a chat with her yesterday in relation to this bill. I spoke about the capping of damages for pain and suffering at approximately $300,000 and damages for economic loss of future earnings being capped at three times the Queensland ordinary earnings. I wonder how many people that will catch and how many will be disadvantaged by that proposal. I note that there will be a review of this piece of legislation in two years. A lot of people can be negatively impacted in two years but it is a short time frame and I welcome that time frame. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1138509"></A>
I note that the minister said in his second reading speech that injured workers who elect to pursue a common law claim will be subject to quantum and liability restrictions. He also said that, in addition, a court will be able to award costs against a worker where the claim is not successful. I have already placed on the record my concern about that because I do believe it will be intimidatory. I think some workers will consider not pursuing their rights rather than pursuing them at the risk of awards being granted against them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1138510"></A>
I have one more clarification. The minister said that the amendment to the Workplace Health and Safety Act ‘will preclude retrospectively and prospectively only those claims where negligence under common law cannot be proved’. In a subsequent paragraph, he went on to say, ‘If the amendment only applied to injuries that occurred after the introduction of the bill into parliament, it will not address the growth in claims.’ That appears to be a retrospective application and I would seek the minister’s clarification.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1138512"></A>
The minister and others here have talked about the premium rate to employers being the lowest in Australia. I commend the minister for that. I commend governments in the past which have made changes to achieve that. I think it is easy for us to stand in this chamber and debate and discuss theories and theoretical situations. The fact is that workers compensation and rehabilitation affects people who are injured at work.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1138513"></A>
When I opposed some of the stuff with Santo Santoro, I had the media chasing me wanting to know why. I have had a number of people in my family affected by workers compensation quite profoundly. They are vulnerable at the time they need help the most. We need to the best of our ability to maintain that assistance and that safety net, not only for the injured worker but for the injured worker’s family. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr KNUTH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Dalrymple--LNP) (8.43 pm): The proposed changes in the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill are just another bandaid solution to an overloaded system and ignore the real issue, which is access to common law and the aggressive marketing by law firms to encourage speculative claims. The government has blamed the global financial crisis for every catastrophe arising from this government’s poor policy. Successive Labor governments have systematically dismantled the WorkCover scheme and, as a result, the number of common law claims has increased by 100 per cent in the past three years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1138516"></A>
This government was informed by key industry groups that the fundamental problem is access to common law and that to reduce the number of claims it needs to reduce the access to common law whole person impairment from zero per cent to 10 per cent or 15 per cent. While the ‘quantum and liability’ restrictions placed on common law claims put more onus on claimants to prove employers at fault, it is still just another example of this government’s whole approach of dealing with the process, not the problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1138517"></A>
The problem is claimant access to common law. This was the finding of the independent report. This was the basis of the recommendation by the WorkCover board. This is the recommendation that consistently appeared in the public response to the discussion paper. This is the advice that the government has repeatedly ignored. Once again, we see a government that is more interested in short-term popularity rather than long-term sustainability. These changes will not address the very real threat of insolvency and will definitely not produce a WorkCover scheme that benefits all Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1138518"></A>
These changes do nothing to address the aggressive no-win, no-fee marketing of law firms. If this government were serious about reducing the number of claims, which is a determining factor in the solvency of the WorkCover scheme, it would enforce the restrictions introduced by the Labor government in 2002 by the Personal Injuries Proceedings Act. This government is not interested in adhering to its own party policy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1138519"></A>
In my constituency, there are many small business owners who are hesitant to employ people because the cover is not employer friendly. The measure of capping the general damages at $300,000 is not the real issue. The minister really needs to address the aggressive marketing of law firms and reduce the high number of claims of access to common law. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr SHINE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (8.46 pm): I am aghast at the remarks on the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill by the honourable member for Dalrymple in terms of the ability for workers to access common law claims and his equally remarkable tirade against lawyers. In my career as a lawyer, I acted for many railway workers, fettlers and so on, with very, very bad back injuries who alleviated the misery they were suffering through obtaining justice through the courts through common law claims. The honourable member, as I understand, has a background in railway matters and I would suggest to him, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that he might like to acquaint himself with some of the tragedies that have occurred in that industry over the years and some of the benefits that have arisen as a result of people’s right to seek justice before the courts via, I might add, lawyers who are prepared to take on cases, many of which are extremely risky and many of which are lost at the lawyer’s expense. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1138522"></A>
I will just make a few comments in relation to this legislation, not because it is unimportant--it is very, very important--but because I think the arguments have been well advanced by the Attorney and by speakers from the government in this debate so far. I congratulate the Attorney sincerely for what he has been able to achieve here. It is quite a remarkable achievement, bearing in mind the rather drastic situation in which the WorkCover fund found itself earlier this year for the reasons that have been given. The first reason was the global financial crisis, but the expansion of common law claims that was occurring was also a reason. Whatever the reason, it was in a fairly dire strait and drastic action had to be taken.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1138523"></A>
Extremes of predictable advice were given to the Attorney from points of interest in the spectrum from people and organisations that are involved in the workers compensation field. The Attorney was able to get together all of the players and come up with this solution that we see in this legislation today, which I believe is extremely reasonable and just. Of course, a review will take place over the ensuing year or so and we will see what happens as a result of that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145043"></A>
My interest in this subject matter goes back a long time and in fact was the reason I became active in the Labor Party. I felt that moves within my party in the early 1990s to restrict the rights of workers to seek justice before the courts was wrong. I felt it was important to fight against that and to fight against it within the Labor Party. I am here today because of those actions at that time. It would be very remiss of me not to stand up for those workers and this subject matter in this debate tonight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145044"></A>
I think what has been proposed here is eminently fair and just. I again congratulate the Attorney for that. There are good, bad and indifferent lawyers as there are managers of common law claim files or CTP claim files. There is that myriad of human nature that comes into play. It would be a very game person to say that everyone on one side of the argument is pure. I do not say that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145045"></A>
I looked at the figures in the WorkCover report for 2009. It shows that settlements out of court rose from $294.8 million to $352.5 million between 2008 and 2009. That shows a very considerable increase in settlements of that nature. It does support what I have been told anecdotally that WorkCover was extremely accommodating in terms of settlement negotiations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145046"></A>
It was different 10 years ago or 12 years ago when I was practising. It was very difficult to ever get a settlement out of WorkCover other than at the door of the court. In those days I felt it was better to have a system which encouraged settlement to reduce legal cost and delay rather than ever imagining that settlements could be reached overly generously. The honourable member for Southern Downs gave an alleged example of an instance where a lawyer asked for $100,000 and his advice to his client was that he would get $100,000 and the opening offer from WorkCover was $200,000. I find that quite incredible and very unlikely to be correct even though the honourable member might believe it to be so. It would have been historic in legal history if that were the case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145047"></A>
Nevertheless, there does seem to have been an overenthusiasm to settle as a result of the authorities in the courts of recent times. What we are now seeing under this legislation is that the law that will apply is the law that applied up until recent years--that is, where contributory negligence has its place. We also see sensible caps on damages in line with the Civil Liability Act. All told, this legislation is, in my view, eminently sensible and just. I commend the Attorney for his efforts. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr WATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Everton--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(8.52 pm): I wish to make a short contribution in support of the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Premier, the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Parliamentary Secretary for Industrial Relations for their determination and patient work throughout the preparation of this bill and their preparation of the government’s response to WorkCover’s report to government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145053"></A>
There were many options open to government as to how to address the financial difficulties of WorkCover which were caused by the global financial crisis. Some in the community wanted workers compensation premiums to be massively increased, with a detrimental impact on jobs. Others wanted the rights of injured workers slashed, preventing them from taking legal action against negligent employers. However, despite these calls, the Premier, the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Parliamentary Secretary for Industrial Relations I believe have delivered a balanced solution which sees a modest increase to workers compensation premiums, which will still remain the lowest in the nation, and some appropriate changes to the workers compensation law as set out in this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145055"></A>
I was disappointed, if not surprised, by the comments of the member for Southern Downs which essentially summarised the position of the opposition on this bill. He made a number of outrageous claims that injured workers were getting unjustified payments from WorkCover due to the negligence, laziness or incompetence of WorkCover officials. We have come to expect the member for Southern Downs to make unfounded smears in support of his arguments. In this case, it is just another attempt to cloak the conservative side of politics’ opposition to fair redress for injured workers. Nothing has changed in conservative politics since the days of Santo Santoro back in 2006 when he used temporary financial difficulties in WorkCover to argue for cutting the rights of injured workers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145056"></A>
The member for Southern Downs also proved that he remains the great denier. Prior to the 2009 election campaign he denied the world was experiencing a financial catastrophe. He is still in denial. He puts up all sorts of reasons for the financial difficulties that WorkCover has found itself in other than the primary reason being the global financial crisis. </Hansard-Body>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (8.55 pm): There can be no-one else to blame for the current problems in the Queensland workers compensation scheme, known as Q-Comp, other than the incumbent Labor government. It exists as a party to support workers. Today, in this 2010 bill, to some extent changes are being implemented that mirror those that opposition speaker after speaker raised in the debate on the predecessor to this bill in 2003. At that time, the organisation was divided into two entities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145064"></A>
Historically, the problem with workers compensation faced by the Borbidge government 12 years ago was a failed scheme that was unable to survive let alone assist injured workers without an emergency government bailout. This was after eight years of Labor. This was a fund that had run for decades for the benefit of employed Queensland workers. If members need reminding, Premier Borbidge commissioned Jim Kennedy to review the scheme and give recommendations to enable the workers compensation scheme to go on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145066"></A>
For a Labor administration to drive this entity charged with providing a correctly funded scheme to assist those at work into the ground and at the transition of government to hand over a near dead carcass is not just hypocritical but financially incompetent and, more so, immoral. By 2003 Labor had done it again and Q-Comp had hit the wall again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145068"></A>
It gets worse. The malaise of this organisation runs parallel to the government’s stewardship of the scheme. In 2003 the then Labor Premier, on behalf of Labor, reached out and locked in all employees who were not organised enough to escape from its clutches. Those who escaped--major retailers, miners, large private companies and the BCC--have had a much different passage to Q-Comp people since 2003. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145070"></A>
What the examples from private industry have demonstrated is that when comparisons are made between those in Q-Comp, costs, outcomes, management and patient care are very different. In fact, there are clear examples and compelling evidence that amply demonstrate that for an equivalent injury, an equivalent situation and equivalent management the private system gets people back to work faster, rehabilitated and at a significant lower cost to the funds, employers and employees themselves. Sadly, there is a stark contrast between Q-Comp and private workers compensation in the areas of early return to work, rehabilitation, ease of payment, speed of claims processing and defence of defensible claims where appropriate and settlements from them. There is a strong approach to issues of contributory negligence and careful prudential management of funds allocated to claims present, past and future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145073"></A>
There appears to have been an assumption within Q-Comp or the WorkCover board of a higher knowledge of how best to do it and complacency about how difficult problems should be approached by excluding themselves from legitimate competition and the perception that if it all gets too hard the government will bail out Q-Comp again. Q-Comp became lazy and compliant. These are the reasons for comments about laziness. On the ground, this leads to overt hostility from some medical and allied health providers to workers compensation cases because the treatment of those providers by the WorkCover authority is appalling. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145107"></A>
I am uncertain whether this pliancy of WorkCover was due to the weakness of the board, the massive bloated bureaucracy or the demands of unions. However, when we end up with a system that is unsustainable and within seven years has the same problems which require a rewrite, we have to examine what the problems are. The weak claims of the government that the GFC has affected the fortunes of the statutory fund of workers compensation are hollow indeed because, firstly, the government has chosen not to allow access to full financial data, as is the norm, because this is not secret data; secondly, the investment of workers compensation appears at surface value to have lost significant value 18 months prior to the GFC; and, thirdly, it is accepted knowledge that settlements to the injured are running at 80 per cent over that of reasonable tort estimates. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145108"></A>
The current estimate of potential unfunded liabilities is said to be $8 billion. Therefore, in the absence of a significant increase in income and significant changes in settlements and disbursements, the scheme will be insolvent. The mere fact that things have been allowed to get so bad is an indictment on both the government and the workers compensation board and its senior management. For an organisation entrusted with securing the compensation rights of over two million Queensland workers, this is disgraceful and it brings great shame on all of those players.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145109"></A>
The problem had got so bad that the scheme was on the verge of collapse this year, with losses of $1.3 billion in the last two years. Every change since 1988 has weakened the scheme to the point where the changes as proposed today are to be given royal assent. It is no secret that many of these changes that I highlight are those that are LNP policy positions, and it is well known. No wonder Labor today is adopting them, because they are sensible and sound for employees and employers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145110"></A>
Firstly, it is capping general damage awards to $300,000 and restricting maximum disbursements at three times average wages, and this is combined with an injury value scale. Secondly, there is the introduction of contributory negligence. Thirdly, there is the capacity to reclaim costs against both vexatious claims and failed cases--that is, unsuccessful claims. Fourthly, Q-Comp is to undertake actuarial modelling and briefing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145113"></A>
Sadly, however, it is more what Q-Comp has failed to change that is most disconcerting. Firstly, it did not take immediate action to reduce the number of common law claims; secondly, it did not address internal issues of financial competence, with a far greater potential for rebates for no claims, limited claims, well-managed claims and those claims that are easily settled; thirdly, it did not have an increased focus and funds for rehabilitation and return-to-work initiatives. In fact, for those who are unaware, WorkCover is currently cancelling contracts with rehabilitation providers who have had a good history of successful return to work. In fact, 30 per cent of the money allocated for this is allegedly being cut out of the funds.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145114"></A>
So, really, is this bill only addressing the problems that Labor alone created in the last 13 years? Labor is not sensibly confronting those issues that workers compensation globally is facing into the future. Labor’s idea of best practice is to repeatedly state that the average premium for workers compensation will be the lowest in the nation. This does not mean that this is the best scheme; nor does this average mean anything at all, since many high-cost areas are basket cases for Q-Comp, employees and employers. Equally, jettisoning rehabilitation providers, as has been done, means losing all of the corporate knowledge, particularly on the most successful way to return these people to work.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145117"></A>
Q-Comp really has a great impact on the people in my electorate of Gaven because it is highly involved in the construction industry. It has a large pool of small business owners and both employers and employees. They are involved in tourism, construction and property business and there are times when employees need access and need maintenance from the system. The problem is that no-one really has the kind of discretionary income in the absence of a regular wage to sustain them when they are injured in the course of their work. Q-Comp is designed to smooth this in Gaven, where people really need to get back to work quickly, and Gaven is an area where people really want to work. I am not saying that in other areas they do not, but we have to ensure that these hardworking people get access to medical staff and allied health. It could be said that I am biased, but I have to say that as a doctor I have experienced this in the last 30 years--that is, when it works well it works well and when it works poorly it works very poorly, and we have to chase excellence in systems.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145120"></A>
I have been here with a group of doctors and as the guest of Mr Knuth, whose son is having surgery tomorrow, and it is interesting that all were saying that we are very lucky here in Australia to have such a pool of good allied health and medical staff. As I say, I am a GP. I have been on the Gold Coast for 22 years in general practice. As I said, when it works poorly it is really terrible. To make such an extraordinary decision to remove even one person from the workers compensation panel of providers--they could be doctors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, psychologists and all sorts of known health providers--is corporate suicide. I call on the minister today to urgently review this decision alone amongst many and counsel Q-Comp to change its policy. We need every provider we can get in order to get employees back to work so they can be earning a living and sustain their families.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145122"></A>
It requires professional skill. Politicians know nothing really of these skills, and apparently they have encouraged Q-Comp which has allowed it to go ahead and make these very irrational decisions. I think it is a financial rationing step. It makes no sense because Q-Comp only pays a set fee. It has the right to reject claims. It only does so with approved certificates signed by an approved panel appointee and it has the right to challenge any valid claim. To get it right, WorkCover and Q-Comp have to become a self-funding entity that does not see the employer as a bottomless pit of revenue to be lurched at every couple of years when government makes decisions that imperil funds for people who cannot represent themselves.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145125"></A>
The idea of raising the charge to $1.30 per $100 may not really be justified. It could be justified, but it looks very much like the idea that was applied to motor vehicle registration. In conclusion, Q-Comp--WorkCover--needs competition. It needs to be looking to the future. The government has to stop interfering as if it is Labor’s milking cow. Employees deserve better. Employers and health providers cannot deal properly with the needs of the staff and patients respectively when governments such as this Bligh Labor government get into trouble but remain half wet rather than working towards a proper and sensible resolution for injured workers. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind) (9.06 pm): I rise to make a very short contribution to the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. I have listened to the debate tonight and I have grave concerns about how well this bill is going to look after the workers who are applying for compensation. I have fears about what this legislation may do to victims of accidents, and I have been concerned mainly with many workers who have come to me who have been employed by this state government, mainly healthcare workers. When they come to me they normally are making whistleblowing public interest disclosures and are classified as whistleblowers and many of those people are undertaking workers compensation claims.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145131"></A>
I have to say that these people are very brave individuals and they are risking everything. They are risking their careers and they are risking their reputations to speak out about what they believe is the truth. Often healthcare workers speak out because they have a genuine love for their patients and a commitment to provide good service for the people of Queensland and to protect the people of Queensland. These people deserve to be protected, and they should always be protected by politicians as well. What I have found, though, unfortunately, is that many of these people are not being protected by the government, which is their employer. Often the government is out to crush these people--to destroy these people mentally and physically. That is why they then have to resort to launching legal action against the government and using workers compensation to get a fair deal for themselves and for their families.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145133"></A>
One lady who springs to mind who is going through a particular case now is Christine Cameron. She made some whistleblowing claims early last year, and this very brave nurse whistleblower has been severely impacted upon. She has been damaged in that as a nurse she cannot even bear to look at the site of the Bundaberg Base Hospital. She now has to walk away from a profession that she loves. She enjoyed caring for people and looking after people. She had given her whole life to nursing and now she has had to walk away from that profession because she cannot even go near the hospital. That is the damage that has been caused to her.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151890"></A>
I worry that, if this bill is passed by this place, as the minister says in his second reading speech, general damages, being damages for pain and suffering, will be capped at approximately $300,000. In the case of Christine Cameron, $300,000 is not enough. She deserves much, much more because she saved people’s lives and her legacy will continue to save people’s lives. It was because of Christine Cameron speaking out that the Bundaberg Hospital’s accident and emergency department had $6 million spent on it and administrative assistants were no longer triaging patients. There has been a bit of a shake-up there. There are seven independent reports going on at the moment now because of Christine Cameron’s bravery. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151892"></A>
We are still waiting for a final report to come back from this government. That report--surprise, surprise--is being written by the area manager. It is absolutely crazy that that sort of report can be written by the department which the complaint was made against. In that regard the CMC has abrogated its duty. We referred the allegations to the CMC. The CMC referred them to the ethical stands unit and then somehow the ethical standards unit gave the job of writing the report to the area manager. That is another matter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151893"></A>
But that is the sort of damage, that is the sort of hypocrisy that goes on within this government and the way in which it treats its employees. This government is not looking after its employees. I am not referring only to the health department. If members go to any department they will find people who have spoken out, but have been identified and crushed. When it comes to looking after its workers, this government has a sad legacy. That is why there are many claims on the workers compensation system. That is why the workers compensation system was being inundated with claims. </Hansard-Body>

Mr CRANDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Coomera--LNP) (9.11 pm): We are debating the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. I know that the bill is designed to address a range of shortfalls in the current legislation, but it can best be described as plugging the leaks that have been brought about by negligent management that gave the legal profession open slather on chasing big, often over-the-top payouts as compensation payout for workers. There is no doubt that many payments are warranted. But there are many that are not. </Hansard-Body>

Mr CRANDON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will take that interjection. I have been involved in the financial planning industry for the past 22 years and I have dealt with many people in the workers compensation area. I thank the member for the opportunity to explain that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151904"></A>
Mismanagement has seen this fund, this insurance policy, get deep into deficit--we are told $1.3 billion. That is what has been admitted. As a result of that mismanagement, we find ourselves having to increase premiums as well as increase the excess payable by employers in the event of certain claims. This is an incredible situation we find ourselves in. If an insurer in the marketplace was in this much trouble, ASIC would want to know and ASIC would most likely insist that they cease trading. The fund is effectively insolvent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151906"></A>
I return to the premium increase and the excess increase. This is standard practice in the marketplace. Rather than force up the premium to less acceptable levels, it is quite common to increase the excess as well. We have had a 13 per cent increase in premiums--from 1.15 per cent to 1.3 per cent of wages--and an increase in the excess from 65 per cent to 100 per cent of weekly wages, but capped at no more than Queensland ordinary time earnings. This increase is probably a relief to many employers who were perhaps concerned that premium rates would go even higher. In addition to these increases, there have been a number of other changes, all designed to bring the fund back into the black. Let us just hope they work. Let us hope that these changes are enough to stop the system failing completely--all as a result of this mismanagement. </Hansard-Body>

I would like to turn now to the human side of the issue. I see from the notes that two million workers rely on WorkCover for compensation cover. So we cannot afford for WorkCover to become insolvent. All sorts of reasons, no excuses, have been put forward for the problems, mainly the global financial crisis. There may be some truth to the GFC being a contributor but, just like the government mismanaged Queensland’s budget and overspent in the good times before the GST, so, too, is it the case with WorkCover--blatant mismanagement.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1151908"></A>
I will come back to the human side of the issue. I have received a complaint from a constituent who runs a small business. Small business is the lifeblood of this state and this country. This fellow employs eight truck drivers. His turnover is around $1 million per annum. His WorkCover bill is $32,000 a year, rising to $36,000 following this increase. He has had $10,000 in claims against WorkCover and this is his annual premium: $36,000. His complaint rings true with so many others. WorkCover seems to accept any claim by a worker. Not surprisingly, he considers the scheme a rort. He believes that there are a high number of false claims. On the evidence, you cannot blame this small businessman for his belief. Of course, the evidence is the changes being proposed in this bill. Let us remember, his premium is $36,000 per annum. In this business owner’s estimation, that is the equivalent of another employee’s wages. His premium is 3.6 per cent of his gross turnover. </Hansard-Body>

 A small business often struggles to make eight to 10 per cent profit on average over time. There would not be too many on that side of the House who know what it was like to run a small business. So I ask them to please not make any comments in that regard. This small business owner makes $80,000 to $100,000 in profit and his premium is equivalent to 3.6 per cent of his turnover, $36,000. You could say that WorkCover is the equivalent of a minority partner in this person’s business, but he takes all the risks in the business and carries all the worry. He is expected to manage the business prudently. It is only reasonable then that he expects his minority partner to manage its aspect of the business prudently--that WorkCover manages its business prudently. WorkCover is that small business’s backstop in case there is a claim. We can only hope and pray that, with these amendments, that will be the case. It is absolutely essential that WorkCover manages its own internal system appropriately. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1151911"></A>
The second human side of the issue relates to an employer who, at the time of writing to me in March this year, had an employee off work for an injury for five weeks. The injury was deemed by WorkCover as work related. This was the case because the employee was on the premises. While running late for work and rushing down a set of four steps to clock on, he slipped and broke his forearm. There was no option to deem part of the blame as the employee’s responsibility or argue that he was not yet at work. </Hansard-Body>

There was no option to deem part of the blame as the employee’s responsibility or argue that he was not yet at work. The result is a $740 excess paid by the employer and an increase to the employer’s annual premium. Once again, it is an impost on small business, the lifeblood of this country. </Hansard-Body>

 Just as an aside, this employer’s complaint was sent by me to the Attorney-General on 12 March. The policy adviser confirmed receipt on 18 March. We and the employer received a response from the Attorney-General on 8 June. It took 80 days for this employer to receive a reply from the date we know the adviser had the document in their hands. But then that is typical of the tardiness of this government. It took six months for the transport minister to agree to a meeting with me. She arrived 10 minutes late and left five minutes early.

Hon. DM WELLS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Murrumba--ALP) (9.20 pm): A society that treats its injured workers with decency and respect is a society that manifests at least one of the hallmarks of civilisation. Queensland remains the only state in which workers still have an unfettered access to common law to litigate an injury. To retain this in a time of economic adversity is a major achievement. I compliment the Attorney and his parliamentary secretary, the member for Yeerongpilly, not only for that achievement but also for the manner in which they conducted the consultation leading up to this bill and on the degree of consensus that they achieved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158674"></A>
My colleagues have dealt with many aspects of this bill and I will try to avoid covering the same territory. First I would like to make a legal point: this legislation changes the legal landscape for those who do bring cases before the courts. A number of decisions of the Court of Appeal will cease to apply as a result of amendments in this bill. There is no implication here that the decisions reversed were anything less than wise ones or logical consequences of the present terms of the act. The view that informs these changes is that the present terms of the legislation have provided unexpected opportunities for ambulance-chasing lawyers, and I am advised that this is agreed by representatives of both workers and unions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158675"></A>
The cases reversed by this case are Bourk’s case and Sheridan’s case. Bourk’s case stands for the proposition that where an injury occurs in a workplace and it is causally connected to the work being done the burden of proof is upon the employer to demonstrate that there was no breach of workplace health and safety. Clearly the removal of this rebuttable presumption is not going to remove the capacity of the courts to do justice in all the circumstances of a particular case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158676"></A>
Sheridan’s case stands for the proposition that the court cannot make an award of costs against a worker who brings an unsuccessful action. Clearly the parliament would not wish that vexatious and baseless actions could be brought before the courts with no consequences to flow against the person who started them. Equally, parliament would not wish that injured workers who simply failed to win a contestable case should have bankruptcy added to the list of their misfortunes. On this point, and I am sure I speak for colleagues on both sides of the House, the House has great confidence in the capacity of the courts to do justice in all the circumstances of the cases that come before them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158677"></A>
May I mention a point that I know the Attorney and the parliamentary secretary are very much alive to: for an injured worker the best possible outcome is, of course, a return to the workforce. The legislation does contain provisions that require employers to provide rehabilitation, retraining and a return to work. The rigorous enforcement of these provisions, and prosecution of those who do not abide by their obligations, will lead to the best outcome for workers and the best outcome for the workforce and the industries that it serves. I know that the department has initiated an independent review of the structures under the act and this will include consideration of these issues: rehabilitation and return to work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158678"></A>
May I conclude with a philosophical point: an injured worker who is on compensation nevertheless has a certain amount of dignity. To sustain an injury while in the workplace, to sustain an injury while serving the interests of the nation as a worker and to be compensated in respect of that is a position that has some dignity. Let us note, though, that when a worker who is injured and has not been able to return to work ceases to be on compensation, they have to go on social security. The worker, while on compensation, is perhaps better off than when he or she is receiving social security. But, of course, it is a different government that is making these two different payments. This could be the basis for a fruitful conversation between the federal government and the state government because it really does matter to a worker who has been injured in the workplace not only how much money they get but also what the money is nominated as being in respect of. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158679"></A>
With the state paying compensation and the Commonwealth paying social security, there is systemic motive for WorkCover to get somebody off its books as soon as possible. Now, here the division of responsibilities between state and federal government fails to lead to an optimum outcome, an outcome that is not always in the best interests of the worker. I think this may very well be a fruitful area for conversation between state and federal governments some time in the future. I conclude by noting the excellent work done by members of the executive who have had carriage of this matter and I commend the legislation to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Toowoomba South--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.25 pm): Workers compensation is a very important part of any employer-employee relationship. I have often said that one of the greatest assets of any business is talented, loyal employees. They should be valued and respected. Likewise, an employer or business owner who treats his employees well and values them is equally valuable. That is where WorkCover is important. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158682"></A>
There is nothing worse than to have an injured employee. It is a tragedy that can affect people greatly. I used to run the Toowoomba Showgrounds. We had to pay a high premium, from memory around eight per cent, because there was a lot of manual labour, dealing with horses and cattle, a rodeo, a speedway, rock and roll and the rest of it. The manual labour involved lifting woodchop blocks off trucks, putting up cattle barriers, handling horses and everything else. It was a difficult part of our expense to pay each year. I know how difficult it was to pay that bill when it came in each year. I relied heavily on many casual and full-time employees and never wanted to see them hurt. All in this House agree that we want to see people looked after and cared for. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158683"></A>
I liked the words of Dr Douglas when he spoke about rehabilitation and getting people back to work because that is very, very important. To make this scheme work, at the end of the day it comes back to the finances. There has to be a sound financial scheme that is stable and secure and has a war chest for good times and bad so that people who work can have the confidence that, provided they work safely and listen to and abide by the instructions and directions that are given and the employers provide that instruction and good working conditions, the scheme works and can be enduring. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158684"></A>
I was there in 1996 when we inherited the black hole of over $300 million. The tragedy of that whole period of time was that, at the estimates just before the election in August 1995, the indication given was that all was hunky-dory and all was right and, of course, a few months later in early 1996 when we came into government following a by-election we found this dreadful financial mess. I encountered the same situation in Health. Then health minister Beattie had left a massive deficit and budget overrun and had switched money from the capital works fund which was supposed to build a hospital over to the day-to-day running of the health system. Then minister Santo Santoro inherited this over $300 million black hole in the workers compensation scheme. As a result of the Kennedy report some very difficult measures had to be put in place. If a scheme is not properly funded, it cannot properly look after seriously injured workers. There was a lot of pain following that, particularly for employers who had to make substantial contributions. I think, from memory, there was some additional impost for two or three years to get the scheme back into the black. Now that we are under Labor again we see this scheme under financial threat.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158715"></A>
If we look at the figures that have been provided in the second reading speech, there was a loss of $380 million before tax in 2007-08, followed by a loss of $890 million in 2008-09. In the WorkCover report, we see the WorkCover financial performance figures. Under the heading ‘Underwriting profit result’ in 2004-05 they lost $206.8 million and the average premium per $100 of wages was $1.55. The next year they made a profit of $576 million and the premium came down to $1.43. The following year there was an underwriting loss of $323.9 million and the premium came down to $1.20 on average. In 2007-08, before the global financial crisis, there was another loss of $295.4 million and the premium came down to $1.15. In the following year of 2008-09 there was a loss of $623 million and again the premium was $1.15. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158716"></A>
The member for Brisbane Central, who previously held a union position in this industry, alluded to the fact that she had warned that the premium could not come down. I remember our side warning about the premium coming down and the possible risks if the scheme started to lose money. A couple of other members from the opposite side were involved in the industry. My friend the member for Toowoomba North and the member for Brisbane Central alluded constantly to the common law problems. We know that the problems are some of the common law issues that have been alluded to and spoken about in this particular debate. It has got out of control and the bill contains some measures to bring that back under control. I wonder what the board’s advice to the government was regarding premiums when it saw the underwriting profits dropping down. We should bear in mind that three of the substantial losses that I just read out occurred before the global financial crisis, which commenced in approximately August/September 2008. The 2007-08 figure related to a period well before that. It is not always the board that is at fault. The board provides advice and it is whether or not this government takes notice of the advice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158717"></A>
We do not have the figures for this year’s losses. In his second reading speech the minister talked about the two year losses before tax of $1.3 billion. We are debating this issue at a time when there could well have been another $600 million or $700 million loss, especially if we look at what happened last year and what has happened with share prices and the stock market this year, let alone what will happen if Rudd passes his super tax. At this time, when we are debating this bill, the situation could be far worse than the $1.3 billion accumulated operating deficit of the last two years. It could be far worse than we are told, but we do not have the figures for what has happened this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158718"></A>
Therefore, it has become a matter of urgency to get some balance back into the system. Members on this side of the House strongly believe in workers compensation. We strongly believe in a system that is financially sound, that has money set aside for the difficult times and that sets a premium that is constant and does not go up, down and all the over the place because of the loose and erratic financial management of the government. Members of the government come into this place and crow about a reduction in the premium, but within a year or two the premium can shoot up. It could well go up again and again, bearing in mind that we do not know the results for the current financial year and we do not know the effects some of the changes will have. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158719"></A>
There are really two sides to the argument. One relates to the amount of the premium. The premium has to be affordable for employers so that they can continue to provide a safe working environment for their staff and can also continue to employ staff to the maximum numbers. On the other hand, we have to ensure that we provide proper care for those who are hurt and injured, particularly those who have serious injuries and have difficulty getting back into the workplace. We can only do that if we have a bona fide system of payments so that those who need the care and need the money can get it. That help must not go to those who are rorting the system. We must get rid of those no-win, no-fee systems. We no longer want to see brochures being put under the windscreen wipers of cars parked in the abattoir car park, as used to occur and which cost this scheme so much. This scheme should be for the genuine people. I support all of the details put forward by our shadow minister. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind) (9.35 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. I echo the sentiments of the member for Toowoomba South in relation to making sure that this is a system and a scheme for genuine people and not people who rort the system by going to solicitors who know how the system works and how to abuse the opportunity for compensation. I take members to part 2 of the bill, which deals with amendments to the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2003, and in particular clause 4. The explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1158723"></A>
<Hansard-Italic>
Clause 4</Hansard-Italic>
 amends section 54 of the Act to confirm the ability of WorkCover Queensland to impose additional premium on an employer’s insurance policy due to sustained poor claims experience. The clause specifies the circumstances under which an additional premium may be imposed. The additional premium may take, for example, the form of a higher premium rate. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

A constituent of mine has an orchard and employs significant numbers of labourers to assist in the picking of his fruit. He has had a history of claims and, quite frankly, I believe some of those claims are fraudulent. However, we have not been able to gather the evidence to prove that. Unfortunately, as recently as this week I received a letter from my constituent. I will not reveal the particulars of it. I have shared a copy of my constituent’s letter with the other members of the crossbenches. That letter reflects very clearly the anger that this farmer feels at the way an employee has been able to abuse the opportunity to receive a significant payout when, quite clearly, the employee contributed to the injury he suffered. There is no doubt there was a significant contribution from the employee in the injury he suffered, but unfortunately the evidence was not able to be adduced to prove that. The matter went to the tribunal and the employee has now been offered a payment of $170,000 by WorkCover.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158725"></A>
The issue revolved around the fact that the employee was supposed to be on light duties but lifted a weight of approximately 150 kilograms. What makes my constituent very, very angry is that, after this employee was no longer employed but was on recuperation leave--if that is the appropriate term--the constituent was approached and almost directed to rehabilitate the person and re-employ him so that he could come back into the workforce. My constituent, being a very forcefully spoken farmer, said, ‘No way in the world will I have that person back on my farm doing this work when, as far as I am concerned, he deliberately contributed to the injury.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158726"></A>
That brings me to my next point. I believe the legislation needs to be changed in a significant way. I believe this case and a number of other cases that have been brought to my attention demonstrate that, when an employee applies for work, an employer should be able to ask the question, ‘What is your history of WorkCover claims?’ That should happen whether they are in Queensland, New South Wales or somewhere else in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165476"></A>
I realise people will say, ‘But there will be discrimination.’ We need to find a balance when employees who have abused the system in other states come to Queensland, get a job and make a claim and it is only after the event that the employer realises the history of their claims. The employer would say, ‘If I had known, I would never have employed that person.’ Because the employer was not able to ask the question, the person was employed, but their history shows that this person has a track record of rorting the system. Unfortunately, an offer of payment was made. I am not sure where it will end up. Originally the claimant was asking for half a million dollars. He had his barrister lined up. He knew how the system works. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165477"></A>
The minister and I discussed this matter quite some time ago. I met with senior representatives from WorkCover Queensland and the workers compensation board. I raised this issue about my belief that the legislation needs to be changed and that there needs to be some opportunity for employers to rightly ask the question of prospective employees: ‘What is your history of claims for compensation for injuries in work similar to that which you are applying to do?’ I understand the reason why the legislation was changed, but I do believe we need to find a middle road approach to allow these questions to be lawfully asked. It is now 20 minutes to 10 o’clock and the minister is keen to respond to the many submissions that have been made. I look forward to the minister’s response. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (9.41 pm), in reply: I thank all honourable members in the House who have contributed in a substantial and constructive way to the debate on this bill this evening, the debate on the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. This has been an historic week for our workers compensation scheme in Queensland. We have moved to further strengthen Queensland’s scheme and ensure workers and employers continue to get the best value and fairest scheme on offer of any Australian state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165484"></A>
I have previously indicated to members of the House that an independent review will be conducted of institutional and working arrangements. I indicate to all members of the House that that independent review of a range of matters--including claims management, settlement of legal costs and other associated issues--will be carried out by Robin Stewart-Crompton, the former chief executive of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission and most recently the chair of the National Review into Model Occupational Health and Safety Laws. That will be a very significant review. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165488"></A>
There are many matters that came out of the very detailed stakeholder engagement process that we went through as part of developing a response to the issues relating to the WorkCover scheme. A whole range of issues came out of that process through stakeholder engagement, through the almost 60 public submissions we received. We will now proceed to move through some of those matters. If we can perhaps start where we ended, one of the issues the member for Nicklin raised was the issue of asking for a claims history of an injured worker. That is something that can be considered as part of the review of institutional working arrangements. I have asked officers of the department to ensure that matter is considered as part of that review. Where we go with those matters remains to be seen. Mr Stewart-Crompton has very great experience in this area and will act as an independent arbiter of a range of issues that have come out, and it is very important for those to be pursued thoroughly as we move forward. </Hansard-Body>

As has been indicated by government members in the debate, this is a scheme that is constantly under review. The finish line is never reached. It is a matter of constant assessment and review to ensure and to guarantee that we have the most stable and secure workers compensation scheme in the nation. So we are doing that immediate review of institutional and working arrangements, and then we are going to do the effectiveness review in two years time to see how this particular tranche of reforms work. </Hansard-Body>

It cannot be denied that WorkCover Queensland was impacted by the global financial crisis. You cannot have an organisation that sustains an operating deficit of $1.3 billion over two years that has not been impacted. There are two streams of income for any insurance company, including a compulsory workers compensation scheme. One is income on investments; the other is premium income. They are the two streams of revenue. We have a scheme that historically has been financially sound--the most solvent scheme in the nation. At 30 June last year, the solvency ratio of the workers compensation scheme in Queensland was 127 per cent--that is assets over liabilities. It was the most solvent scheme in the nation, but it was severely impacted by the global financial crisis, along with the significant increase and ongoing increase in common law claims. They are the things that the WorkCover board initially had to deal with and then the government had to deal with in response to certain recommendations made by the board to government. </Hansard-Body>

There has been rewriting of history tonight by those members opposite who denied the global financial crisis when it was coming, denied it when it was here and still continue today to deny the impact of the most significant economic crisis in 75 years on our state. You only need to look to Europe today to see the ongoing problems in international financial markets and the risk that the world faces--the Queensland economy, the national economy and the international economy face--of a potential double dip.

 I take the interjection: ‘Was there a recession?’ For someone who is not a lawyer, he certainly knows the words. He is seeking to deny what he put on the record then. We know what he did. He knows he did it. He knows that it destroyed his economic credibility and that of the alternative government. But we will wait and see, because we know that he will run for the leadership again. We know that the polls this week indicated that he is the preferred leader of the opposition by the Queensland community. He outrates the leader. He outrates the member for Clayfield on 11 per cent. But he also outrates ‘unknown’ on 23 per cent. So we do know that a quarter of Queenslanders polled do not want any of them leading the opposition. We also know from that poll that 50 per cent of Queenslanders polled do not believe the LNP is fit to govern Queensland. All of those on this side of the House certainly know that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165510"></A>
The government had to act. We have acted decisively but we have acted reasonably and sensibly to balance the needs of business and injured workers in this state. I reiterate just how well the local scheme has performed over recent years. It has served employers and employees and injured workers well. Queensland businesses and workers continue to enjoy the most financially stable workers compensation scheme in Australia, and these reforms will ensure that that continues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165512"></A>
The Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill will ensure WorkCover Queensland’s ongoing financial viability and will also maintain as a consequence full access to common law remedies for all injured workers as well as seriously injured workers. That Queensland has Australia’s best performing centrally funded workers compensation scheme is not in question. As at 30 June last year, WorkCover Queensland controlled assets of nearly $3 billion, with liabilities of $2.3 billion. It is currently the only state or territory centrally funded scheme where assets exceed liabilities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172296"></A>
This is a government that is acting proactively to ensure that stability and certainty continue into the future. We have taken an enormous hit. We should look at what the board recommended to government. What did the board recommend? The board recommended a threshold for common law claims of 10 per cent or 15 per cent of whole-person impairment--a very significant and substantial claim. We know in their heart of hearts that members opposite wish to exclude injured workers from common law claims in Queensland. They have tried to do this in this parliament of Queensland previously, and men and women of political courage stood up against that tactic. That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to ensure stability in the scheme going forward. We had to protect that position.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172297"></A>
That is why the legislation before the parliament features many of the points raised by employers, by unions and by the legal profession who were consulted widely, openly, in a transparent fashion and at length on the nature and need of the changes. We have had a very open process from the day the government received the report from the WorkCover board. I have reported to the parliament. We set up a significant broad-ranging stakeholder group involving employer groups, trade unions, representatives of workers, lawyers, other interested parties and business groups, including the Queensland Resources Council, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland and the Australian Industry Group. All of these people had a seat at the table and then we opened the process to public submissions. All of that is on the department of justice website. All of those submissions can be accessed. It was very open and transparent. It was a very constructive way to develop public policy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172301"></A>
I should also say that not one of the 60 written submissions that the government received suggested a change to the fundamental nature of the Queensland scheme, which is a short-tail statutory scheme with access to common law. There is consensus in the Queensland community that the Queensland system works and delivers for Queensland. That is what we are trying to maintain. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172302"></A>
No-one can claim that we have not acted decisively. Less than six months after becoming aware of the issue, we have introduced legislation to allow new arrangements to be in place by 1 July this year. We have listened to all points of view and produced a package of reforms that has required, inevitably, some concessions from all stakeholders in the best interests of our state. The suite of changes represents a responsible, well-considered response to WorkCover’s financial situation while rejecting the call for injured impairment thresholds governing access to common law damages by workers. Instead, common law claims brought under the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation Act will be harmonised with arrangements under the Civil Liability Act 2003 with modifications to take into account the workplace context. I am advised that modelling by WorkCover’s actuary, PricewaterhouseCoopers, indicates that harmonisation with the Civil Liability Act 2003 will result in a compression of claims at the lower end of the injury scale. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172306"></A>
I would now like to turn to the legal cost provisions in the bill. I want to make it clear that the cost regime was not open for general review and amendment, apart from addressing an anomaly created by the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Sheridan v Warrina Community Co-operative Ltd &amp; Anor [2004] QCA 308. The government had two clear priorities with regard to claims costs. The first was to address the Court of Appeal case in Sheridan which held that no costs can be awarded against a plaintiff whose claim is dismissed. The second priority was to increase the pretrial obligations of third-party contributors to exchange relevant documents, certify readiness for conference and make mandatory offers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172307"></A>
An important feature of the bill before the House is that it harmonises damages arrangements with the Civil Liability Act 2003. This will see a capping of payout amounts and changes to common law damages, particularly liability and contributory negligence. It is fair in all the circumstances and reasonable, as is the new injury scale value outlined in the bill which will be used to determine general damages by judging injuries on a scale of zero to 100. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172309"></A>
I am advised that WorkCover’s actuary, PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that these measures should reduce the frequency of common law claims and reduce the size of settlements paid, with injured workers continuing to receive fair benefits through the unchanged statutory scheme. The liability and contributory negligence provisions in the Civil Liability Act 2003 that have been drafted into the bill include some modifications to take into account the workplace context and the employer-employee relationship. Included is the mandatory reduction in damages of at least 25 per cent for a person whose intoxication contributed to their injury. This is entirely appropriate and, as other honourable members have said during the second reading debate, broadly acceptable to the Queensland community. However, section 48--which is mandatory reductions in damages for anyone injured by someone they knew or should have known was drunk--will not be included. This, too, is entirely appropriate because injured workers could unfairly lose damages even if an employer was at fault in not managing alcohol or drug related issues at the workplace. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172314"></A>
The bill amends the Workplace Health and Safety Act to provide that nothing in the act creates a civil cause of action based on a contravention of a provision under the act. This amendment will apply to current claims and proceedings for damages if the proceedings commenced after 8 August 2008, the date of the judgement in Bourk v Power Serve Pty Ltd &amp; Anor [2008] QCA 225. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172316"></A>
The Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995 as enforced immediately before the commencement of the amendment will continue to apply to a proceeding for damages if the trial in the proceedings started before 1 July 2010. Where a claimant has already commenced proceedings but has not yet gone to trial, the amendments do not restrict the ability to make any necessary amendments to pleadings. The decision to make this amendment retrospectively was not taken lightly. WorkCover Queensland and Crown Law have advised that, in their view, as the ability to establish employer liability pursuant to common law negligence remains, only a very small number of existing claims will be affected by this change in the law. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172317"></A>
WorkCover Queensland has given an undertaking to treat affected litigants fairly and in accordance with the principles of natural justice. This undertaking includes concessions to workers who have already brought a claim and who may not be able to establish employer liability due to the amendment. So we will treat anyone who is adversely affected by the change in the law fairly. We will receive submissions from them on how their claim might then be managed within the statutory scheme or otherwise and we will deal with them very fairly. WorkCover knows that. WorkCover will ensure that occurs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172318"></A>
As well as the legislative changes set out in the bill, I would like to highlight other initiatives which will improve service delivery, achieve better rehabilitation and return-to-work outcomes, and provide more assistance to poor-performing employers in terms of injury prevention and claims management. That matter was raised by a number of members in the House. Honourable members will know from the budget in respect of the portfolio of Justice and Attorney-General that a new rehabilitation and return-to-work scheme will be established this year at a cost of $2 million. That is the first stage in dealing with rehabilitation and return to work. Obviously, it is important to get workers back to work as soon as possible to ensure that they have a productive life and that they have the fulfilment of employment. We want to ensure that occurs. We also want to work with employers in high-risk industries to ensure they provide safe workplaces. This will do two things: it will ensure workers are not injured and it will ensure their premiums over time are reduced. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172320"></A>
The Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill amends section 221 of the act to require the regulatory authority, Q-Comp, to refer a worker referred to it under section 220 to programs that may assist in the worker’s return to work with the worker’s consent. This is an important amendment that will ensure that those workers who do not have a job to return to will be provided with the necessary assistance to gain meaningful work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172321"></A>
I now turn to address the issues that were raised during the debate. The member for Southern Downs, as is his want, made a number of spurious allegations concerning the management of WorkCover in an obvious attempt to throw mud at WorkCover, at Q-Comp, at lawyers who represent injured workers, at injured workers themselves and at other stakeholders in a vain attempt to make mud stick. He claimed that WorkCover had an internal management issue and that the government’s response was to intentionally run down the surplus in some effort to cook the books. It is simply nonsense. He should be ashamed of the comments he made during his speech. WorkCover Queensland is the best performing centrally funded workers compensation scheme in Australia. It is fully solvent. It is the only state or territory centrally funded scheme whose assets exceed its liabilities, and we are aiming to keep it that way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172324"></A>
WorkCover is a well-managed organisation that is solvent. I pay tribute to the board, which has worked assiduously and hard, particularly the chairman, Ian Brusasco, and the deputy chairman, Terry White, for their work over a long period of time to ensure financial stability. This is, again, a government being proactive to ensure that stability continues into the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172328"></A>
It is recognised from comments of stakeholders, however, that WorkCover needs to do more. It needs to do more to keep stakeholders better informed of its performance and trends. I am advised that WorkCover is putting new arrangements in place to ensure stakeholders receive regular briefings on its operations. As was detailed by one of the government members in the debate, I also note for the honourable member for Southern Downs that, in response to concerns raised during the consultation process with stakeholders and the community, a structural review of institutional and working arrangements is currently being carried out by Robin Stewart-Crompton. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172334"></A>
The member for Southern Downs asked for the proportion of claims that were dismissed in the last three years. The proportion of claims that were finalised and paid zero damages over that period has remained steady at 11.8 per cent, increasing marginally by 1.5 percentage points in the last financial year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172372"></A>
The member for Southern Downs complained that no actuarial reports were released. As has been noted previously, the actuarial assessment is not able to be released due to it containing information that is commercial in confidence. However, I would remind the honourable member that during the extensive community consultation on the reforms--a process that I would note the LNP chose to ignore both in failing to completely engage in the process or to mention in any part of members’ addresses--an overview of the actuarial reports was provided to all interested parties while the actuaries presented their findings to the key stakeholders on a number of occasions. As the reform process continues to move forward and to build increased transparency into the scheme, actuarial information will be presented to scheme stakeholders every six months to provide updates on the scheme’s financial position. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172373"></A>
The member for Southern Downs has alleged that one of the problems with the financial position of the scheme was that too many common law claims were settled or uncontested. I would like to state at the outset that WorkCover has strongly denied this allegation. WorkCover seeks to follow model litigant principles in resolving common law claims, as it should--that is, that claims are resolved as quickly as possible using both the prelitigation processes in the legislation and litigation where it is necessary to do so. WorkCover also takes guidance from court precedents in determining employer liability and negotiating appropriate settlement amounts. This is something that has been raised and will be considered as part of the review of institutional working arrangements. In view of comments received during the public comment process, as I have said, we are going to continue to pursue that process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172374"></A>
It is very interesting to note that the mandatory precourt procedures were introduced when? They were introduced in 1996 by the then coalition government. They were introduced why? To resolve matters out of court to the mutual satisfaction of all parties. The parentage goes back to the coalition, goes back to the Borbidge government in 1996. That process of prelitigation negotiation now finds itself abandoned and orphaned by those opposite today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172375"></A>
I would like to address some of the issues raised by the member for Gladstone. The member for Gladstone and I do not agree on many issues, but she is a member of this place who brings some considerable integrity and credibility to the arguments in this House on workers compensation and the support for injured workers. I take her questions seriously and I will do my best to respond to the issues that she has raised. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172376"></A>
The member for Gladstone asked where and in what way WorkCover’s investments were speculative. I can inform the honourable member that WorkCover’s investments are managed by the Queensland Investment Corporation which operates a balanced fund. The balanced fund means that it is not generally involved in speculative investments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172377"></A>
The honourable member also asked whether significantly injured workers who require high levels of care would be disadvantaged. Under the proposals in the bill, workers who are severely injured are in fact likely to be treated more favourably due to the operation of the injury scale value which compresses generally at the lower end, particularly for general damages for pain and suffering. The compression is at the lower end under the injury scale value. But seriously injured workers should not be greatly disadvantaged because of the way the injury scale value is structured, reflecting the injury scale value in the Civil Liability Act. It is very important to ensure that the compression is at the lower marginal claims end and not in the case of seriously injured workers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172379"></A>
The member also asked about the application for costs to pursue a claim under the Sheridan principle and whether such costs would act as a disincentive. If an injured worker has a legitimate claim, this provision of the bill will not act as a deterrent to bring a claim because legal advice will likely dictate a more realistic assessment of the claim. So injured workers will continue to have their statutory entitlements under the scheme but they will be no more disadvantaged than anyone else who brings proceedings in any other court in Queensland for some tortious action to recover damages, be it from a motor vehicle accident, an injury in a public space, an injury in a shop or any other private premises. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172380"></A>
The general principles of negligence will apply. There will be an exposure to a costs order if the action is not successful, but the aim is to require plaintiffs to consider properly whether negligence has occurred in the workplace and whether the action should in fact be pursued. It will be a matter for the injured worker as a plaintiff to consider whether proceedings will be brought and they will take appropriate legal advice before any action is brought. But it is a necessary step that we need to take to try to plateau the increasing number of common law claims in the WorkCover scheme in Queensland. There are hard choices to be made to ensure that we continue to have stability and security in the system. These are the choices that had to be made as part of the amending bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172381"></A>
The honourable member asked whether the harmonisation of WorkCover legislation with the Civil Liability Act will have an impact on the quantum of damages. I can inform the honourable member that, on my advice, the amendments in the bill mean that in the case of a more serious injury general damages are likely to increase. However, the general damages proportion of minor injuries at the minor scale may decrease. So, again, the compression is in relation to the lower scale injuries. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172382"></A>
Further, the honourable member asked how many claimants will be disadvantaged by the capping of damages. Under the bill, it is the operation of injury scale value that will determine the impact on damages. The ISV, however, only affects general damages which is one component of common law entitlements. So there is the injury scale value which deals with general damages and there is the capping--three times average weekly earnings effectively--for economic loss. But most people, I am advised, do not reach the maximum amount of $176,000 a year approximately. Most workers in the workers compensation scheme do not reach that maximum anyway so there hopefully will not be a significant impact on them but we need this compression in the scheme again to try to plateau the common law claims. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172384"></A>
Finally, the member asked why it was that the Bourk amendments will be retrospective. Again, it was a difficult decision that the government had to make to ensure that we could continue with financial stability. It was deemed necessary to stem the increasing number of common law claims. The amendment will impact on a small number of claims where they cannot prove negligence against an employer. However small in number, they make up six per cent of the 20 per cent growth in claims. So it is important that that matter be addressed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172385"></A>
In conclusion, I want to thank everyone who was involved in the process of developing this bill. I want to thank all the stakeholders who were so very open in their views and expressed them frankly and in a very direct manner as part of the stakeholder engagement. I thank all honourable members for their involvement in the debate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172386"></A>
Something had to be done to protect the workers compensation scheme in our state and something has been done. It had to be done quickly because all parties realised that action was needed if Queensland employers and workers were to continue to enjoy the best and fairest workers compensation scheme in the country. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172387"></A>
As has been discussed earlier, for employers the WorkCover Queensland Board has advised that the average premium rate will increase on average to $1.30 per $100 of wages from $1.15. As has been said by other members in this debate, Queensland employers will continue to have the lowest average premium of any state or territory compensation scheme. It is a very significant achievement for the board because the board recommends and sets the premium. It is the board that sets the premium. That was lost in the debate. You would not want the argument to be clouded by facts when it is put by the opposition. It is the board that sets and recommends that premium. I thank them for their work. It is a significant increase. We acknowledge that. But it is again another step that has to be taken to ensure financial security in the scheme moving forward. Workers will of course have the peace of mind that they will continue to have unfettered access to common law claims. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172388"></A>
This has been a very significant project. I want to acknowledge officers from the department who have worked on this program. They include: Mr Paul Goldsbrough, Mr Simon Blackwood, Ms Jennifer Dunn, Ms Janene Hillhouse, Mr Richard Buchanan. From WorkCover Queensland I thank Ms Irene Violet, Mr Peter Worthy and Ms Sharon Stratford. From Q-Comp I thank the CEO, Elizabeth Woods, and Mr Rob Cordiner. I also thank Sebastian Bielew, Linda Buyers from the department and Janine Reid from WorkCover. They have worked very hard to deliver this important legislative reform for the state. I commend the bill to the parliament. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr SPRINGBORG</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.17 pm): This question actually relates to the issue of an employer who continually exceeds the relevant industry rate for claims based on a poor injury record.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.18 pm): I want to get clarification on this, because this amendment appeared novel at best. This amendment that workers under the age of 21 who die from a work related injury and leave a parent but no dependents means that those parents will only receive a payment in relation to the deceased son or daughter if the parents reside in Queensland. If the parents reside out of state they will get no payment. I am sure the minister will have a reason for this, but it appears anomalous to me because the loss to the parent is no less if a parent lives out of state. So I would be very interested in why this difference--this discretion--has been brought into the bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1172439"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No. In fact what we are doing is ensuring that that payment is made wherever the parents reside in Australia. We are changing the law so all parents will be eligible. The current law provides that only parents who are resident in Queensland are eligible, and that is not seen by the government as being fair. Section 202 permits a payment to the worker’s parents if they reside in Queensland but not if the parents reside outside Queensland. We are going to change that to allow payments to parents of a deceased worker if the parent resides anywhere in Australia. On the basis that the honourable member has put it, it is a fair amendment.</Hansard-Body>

I ask the Attorney: how many workers under existing arrangements accessed return-to-work support through WorkCover in the past three years? What percentage of workers accessed structured return-to-work programs offered by WorkCover? Again, if it places a particular burden on the minister, I would be happy to put those questions on notice.</Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.23 pm): This provision deals with written final offers if claims are not settled at compulsory conference. I have a couple of questions for the Attorney-General. Again, if he does not have the information at his fingertips I will be happy to place it on notice. How many claims are settled before compulsory conference and how many have been settled where there was no medical assessment done prior to an offer being made by WorkCover?</Hansard-Body>

Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I see a pattern forming. The member will be using this process to trawl for information and not, of course, speak to the substance of reform, the need for reform, the importance of change. In his inconsistent and incoherent contribution to the second reading debate the member wanted it every which way but, of course, presented no consistent position on behalf of the opposition. I am happy to provide those figures at a subsequent time subject to my examination of them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179771"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Frankly, I am just giving the Attorney-General the liberty of being able to seek that information, because I know that in briefings with the Attorney-General’s own staff from time to time this information needs to be sought, even when examining the Attorney-General during the estimates process. But if the Attorney-General wants to engage in a philosophical debate about why and how the WorkCover scheme in Queensland ended up in the malaise that it has, I am more than happy to engage him in the time that is available to us. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179772"></A>
We even had a concession from the Attorney-General earlier in his summary that a number of issues are associated with the malaise of WorkCover in Queensland. The Attorney-General continues to raise the old hoary chestnut of the global financial crisis, notwithstanding the fact that WorkCover’s own report for the 2005-06 year shows clearly a significant $900 million turnaround. That is not including the injection of a $400 million return on earnings that year. The issue is far more than just the global financial crisis, as that did not exist at that stage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179773"></A>
Again, one of the fundamental issues--and even the Attorney-General conceded this--was the mismanagement or the lack of prudence when it came to dealing with common law claims in Queensland. That was brought to the Attorney-General’s attention during the inquiry that he initiated. It was also pointed out during the public consultation phase. So there is no doubt that the lack of fundamental management of the common law scheme of WorkCover has compromised and placed the viability of the entire scheme as we know it at risk.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179774"></A>
If the scheme had been managed properly from the start through a combination of more prudent investment, making sure that the fund had an appropriate solvency ratio of 30 per cent--not 20 per cent--and making sure that common sense was used and the premium rates were not reduced from a high of $1.55 per $100 to $1.15 per $100 and the common law claims were managed properly, then maybe there would be no need to impose the restrictions that are being placed on common law in this parliament tonight. So the Attorney-General should not come into this place and say that there are not some alternatives when there are very, very clear alternatives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179775"></A>
It has also been extremely clear that, despite the Attorney-General’s protestations and assertions in this House tonight, we do not have access to the full actuarial advice that we need to be able to guide us in the final decision-making process. If the Attorney-General believes that the interest groups that were consulted throughout this process were comforted by the cut-down version of the actuary’s advice then he needs to think again. In my discussion with those groups, including the Law Society, they felt that there was a long way to go in terms of the advice that was given to them, the background information and the actuarial data that they required to be able to make a proper assessment of the likely success of the legislative reforms that are recommended to be passed in this place. So the Attorney-General should not come into this place suggesting that he has been fulsome. He should not come into this place suggesting that the government has been open on this issue when it has been anything but open with the information that is required not only by the opposition but also by the various interest groups that entered into good faith negotiations and which were denied information that they should have received in a more fulsome way.</Hansard-Body>

Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is always an error to give the Deputy Leader of the Opposition a platform. I apologise to all honourable members for raising that, because we got the wall of sound for five minutes. Why speak for one minute when you can speak for five minutes? But it was good; I am glad that I put out the invitation to him because we had the extraordinary suggestion by the party that supposedly represents business in this place that a prudent way to deal with the workers compensation scheme was not to reduce the premium for business from $1.55 to $1.15. So I will be very comfortable in telling every business in Queensland that that remains the opposition’s policy: high premiums--higher than the premiums in other states. At $1.55 that would put it at one of the highest levels in the country. I am very happy to put to industry and to business that the opposition is a high-taxing, high-premium party. I am very happy to do that. The member opposite has displayed his true colours. We know what his views are on business. Those opposite are no longer the party of business; they are the party of political expedience, as the Country Party has always been. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 For somebody who actually stands in this place and proffers a belief against verballing, that is the greatest verbal that I have ever heard in this House. For a person who is supposed to believe in the law and be able to engage in debate on merit, a person who stands in this place and says that somebody does not have a right to speak yet is in a profession that charges by the word, to dare say that we were advocating an unfettered reduction in premiums or an increase in premiums is absolutely, completely wrong. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186863"></A>
In my speech I referred to a debate that was held in this place 2 years ago when the honourable member for Clayfield properly asked the then minister for industrial relations whether it was actuarially sound to reduce premiums at that particular time, whether it was going to compromise the bottom line of the WorkCover scheme in Queensland. The then minister went on to say that, yes, it was actuarially sound, that it was safe to reduce premiums in Queensland, that it would in no way compromise the soundness of the workers compensation scheme in Queensland. We now know that that was not the case. Of course we laughed, and we would like to know that premiums are able to be reduced. No-one would argue against that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1236026"></A>
What we are saying is that there was improper actuarial advice, or the improper interpretation of that advice, in the parliament 2 years ago and no-one can actually argue against that. If that was the proper advice which was offered by the then minister then we would not have to be running back into this place some 2 years later to put up premiums again. We would not have to be running back into this place 2 years later to jack up premiums. Clearly the government got it wrong at that particular stage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186864"></A>
We will always advocate the reduction of the burden of government regulation and cost on business, but in order to be able to make all of those decisions one needs to be furnished properly with the facts. Clearly at that time, 2 years ago, there was not a proper furnishing of the facts, and I think the events since that time can verify that absolutely. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186871"></A>
The bill as it stands proposes that damages for loss of superannuation entitlements if awarded be limited to the nine per cent superannuation guarantee charge. The current provisions in the bill are copied from section 56 of the Civil Liability Act 2003. The Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2003 does not currently limit the manner in which a court can award damages for loss of future employer superannuation contributions. Some categories of employees receive more generous employer superannuation contributions in excess of the nine per cent superannuation guarantee. The government does not intend to penalise those workers receiving a higher contribution given that such contributions can form a significant proportion of damages. The amendment that I have introduced will maintain the court’s discretion to decide damages for loss of future superannuation contributions for workers. This amendment maintains the status quo in this area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186872"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I have a couple of questions to put to the minister in relation to clause 21. This is quite an extensive clause covering a whole range of issues to do with the matter of common law access, putting caps on general damages, putting caps on payment for loss of income et cetera, et cetera. One of the issues in relation to this is the introduction of the principle of contributory negligence. Is the minister able to provide a costing analysis undertaken by WorkCover that would show the expected cost saving to the scheme through the introduction of these provisions? If it has not been undertaken, why has it not been undertaken given that there may be an effect or otherwise of this particular provision in bringing down the payment? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186873"></A>
The minister indicated earlier on that he and the government rely upon the advice of WorkCover and its board. On the surface that sounds quite appropriate. If one has faith and confidence in the board then that certainly should be the case. The minister has been indicating tonight that he has absolute confidence in the board, its operations, its management of the fund, its guidance on the administration of the fund, its investment recommendations and the way it is dealing with a whole range of things. Is it a fact that the WorkCover board has provided advice to the government that there should be a reduction of 70 per cent in common law claims otherwise it is likely that there are going to be premium increases over the next four years which will see the premiums paid by employers in Queensland being amongst the highest, if not the highest, in all of Australia? Has a request been made by the WorkCover board that there should be moves to reduce common law claims by 70 per cent and, in the event of that not happening, has it expressed concern that premiums would increase to the highest level in Australia over the next four years? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186874"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In relation to contributory negligence, there is actuarial advice, I understand, that it should decrease the cost by about nine per cent. That is the advice we have, but this is imperfect because it relates to change of human behaviour. Changing how people engage with the common law system, whether they sue or not because they need to consider the consequences of proving negligence and the issue of being exposed to costs, will change behaviour. Modelling human behaviour is imperfect, as we all know. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186875"></A>
In relation to future premiums, again the honourable member displays his ignorance of how the premium is set. The premium is set by the board on recommendation to the government and the minister of the day can veto the proposal or recommendation. It is done on an annual basis. We need to bring stability to the increasing number of common law claims. The board will have to consider over time what the premium will be on a year-to-year basis. It has a better crystal ball than me if it knows what the impact of these legislative reforms will be over the next 12 months when they set the premium for the next financial year, and similarly for the next financial year after that. It is a matter for the board independent of government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1236056"></A>
I know there has been criticism over time of the board. I know that the members opposite have criticised the union representatives on the board in this House and outside. They have contributed significantly to the workers compensation scheme and it is appropriate that representatives of injured workers be on that board. I stand fully behind unions being represented on the workers compensation board and I, for one, will not criticise them as others have in this House and in other places. The premium will be subject to review over time but the critical issue is to ensure that the scheme remains solvent and the board will make appropriate recommendations going forward. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186876"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I do understand that the government reserves the prerogative through the recommendation of the minister to accept or reject the offerings of the board by way of its experience, by way of its recommendations. Unless I missed something, I am not sure that the minister completely or in part answered my question. Did the minister or the government receive advice from the WorkCover board that common law claims or payments needed to be reduced by 70 per cent otherwise over the next four years there was a risk that premiums for employers would have to increase by a significant amount, taking them to amongst the highest, if not the highest, in Australia? Did the minister or the government receive advice from the board that common law claims needed to be reduced by 70 per cent or we could see the scenario of Queensland employers facing the highest WorkCover premiums in Australia? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186906"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am sorry; I missed the question. The answer was so obvious that I mistook it. It is no state secret--it has been out there from the day we received the report--that the board recommended a threshold for common law claims of 10 per cent or 15 per cent of whole person impairment. If you take out those injured workers below 15 per cent whole person impairment, it is 70 per cent of people who bring common law claims. That is what the board recommended and that is what we have known all along, since it was recommended to government last year. As I hope all honourable members would acknowledge today, if you take out every one who is under a 15 per cent whole person impairment you take out 70 per cent of claimants for common law claims, which is a very significant cut, a very significant wall, a very significant threshold to put to people who are injured in the workplace. We know others seek to abolish common law claims altogether, which has happened in other states and led to the financial instability in those schemes in other states. We think that the balance is right. Short-tail scheme, open access to common law, and that is what we are trying to maintain in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186907"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I wanted to again raise the concern of many in the community with the capping of the common law claims. I heard what the minister just said, although it is very difficult because the minister speaks very quickly and if there is other noise in the background it is very difficult to follow what he is saying. I am assuming that he has agreed that the changes to the legislation that he has brought in will result in a significant reduction in common law claims. Can I say that the board’s recommendation of whole person impairment of 10 per cent to 50 per cent is a significant impairment? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186908"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Dick:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Ten per cent or 15 per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186909"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thought he said to 10 per cent to 50 per cent. I was thinking that that was a huge impairment, if that was what was being brought in. Again I am sorry, I could not hear. However, I did want to put on the record that I am concerned about the capping of claims. I do hope that the Attorney can give an undertaking that, in the review in two years’ time, if the impact on workers is more significant than anticipated, the government--and I note that it would be after the next election, so whoever was in government--would genuinely review that situation. If it impacts on workers much more significantly, even for workers whose impairment whilst slight has a significant impact on their ability to earn, these measures should be unravelled and unravelled quickly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186910"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Just to clarify for the member for Gladstone, the recommendation of the board was that we put a threshold in for common law claims, either a 10 per cent whole person impairment or a 15 per cent whole person impairment, to knock out most of the people effectively who would bring common law claims, thereby bringing down the costs of common law claims significantly. That was the recommendation the board made and, following the very detailed examination of that, the stakeholder process and having received public comments we decided not to go down that path. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186911"></A>
What the member says is right, and others have already made representations to government that we need to look at the impact on common law claims and, if they not only plateau but start to diminish, others have suggested we might need to permit the common law scheme to expand again. I think we need to be careful. We do need to see how these reforms take effect, but there are mechanisms, of course, that can be used. Reviewing injury scale values is one, and another is looking at the caps we have put on down the track to see whether there is some capacity to expand the eligibility and the damages that might be awarded. However, the key thing is to ensure financial stability, which is what we will do. Once we put a threshold in, of course, it is very difficult to ever go back. That is one of the challenges for any government that either abolishes common law or introduces a very significant threshold. That is the really significant issue that has been a great challenge to the government, to get the balance right of continuing to have open access to common law to protect the Queensland system and, at the same time, ensuring the burden on employers is kept reasonable and as limited as possible through appropriate and relevant premiums. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186912"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Further to my earlier question, the Attorney-General has indicated through mathematical concession that the board did indicate that there needed to be a 70 per cent reduction in the amount of common law payouts in Queensland. The other part of my question, which the Attorney-General did not properly answer, is this: was the Attorney-General made aware through this process that unless the reforms addressed this common law growth and reduced the numbers by 70 per cent we would be facing the highest premiums for employers in Queensland of all the Australian state and territory jurisdictions? Did he receive the advice that, if that does not work, if his reforms do not actually reduce it by 70 per cent, in four years Queensland will have amongst the highest premiums of any state or territory jurisdiction in Australia? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186913"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is no state secret that the WorkCover board has a very firm position about what has to happen. It is very firm in its view that there needs to be a threshold to common law claims. Again I affirm on the parliamentary record that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, speaking for the opposition, has today confirmed that they do not support a threshold to common law claims. I can assure the member that every trade unionist, every worker and every member of the Australian Labor Party will hold him to that commitment. We will hold him to that commitment. Before the dinner break, during an exchange following an interjection, I challenged the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and he was very quick to come back after the dinner break to put on record that he does not support thresholds. We will hold the Liberal National Party to that commitment. I hope he is not trying to back out of it now by his interjections. No, I did not think so. He is going to stick to that. I hope that represents the ongoing position of the Liberal National Party. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186914"></A>
The board has very strong views about what should happen. We are confident that premiums can be kept at reasonable levels. Frankly, four years time will be after the review of institutional working arrangements that we are going to do immediately, and it will be after the effectiveness review that we will do in two years time. There will be effectively two premium years that we will negotiate, that we will need to get through those years that the board will set premiums for. We will assess the financial situation then. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186915"></A>
As I said, I do not direct the board. I do not tell it what the premium will be. It will set its own premium. We are confident that these changes will be effective, but ultimately we are looking to changing human behaviour. If human behaviour does not change and common law claims are not stabilised within WorkCover, we will have to consider the matters afresh. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1194135"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.49 pm): Clauses 29 right through to clause 32, I believe, deal with costs. I do not really want to speak to each of the clauses and hold the House up, so my comments cover those clauses. I am very concerned about the awarding of costs in that I have not heard the minister say--and I cannot see it in the bill--that these amendments deal with vexatious or mischievous claims. It appears to go across that. In fact, the explanatory notes in relation to this bracket of clauses about costs, and again with the minister’s forbearance, states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1194137"></A>
Clause 32 inserts new sections 318A to 318E regarding the awarding of costs in particular circumstances. A court may make an order for costs other than the prescribed order if the party ordered to pay costs shows the other order is appropriate in the circumstances, or if an award of damages is affected by factors that were not reasonably foreseeable by a party at a time of making or failing to accept a written final offer. A failure to accept a written final offer or later offer includes a refusal to accept the offer. The clause also prescribes conditions for costs orders for interlocutory applications and orders where an entity was not a party at the compulsory conference. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1194138"></A>
Your eyes glaze over. I am thinking of people who are injured who do not feel that the offer is high enough. It will not compensate them for their loss of perhaps physical activity, and it may be a whole person impairment that is quite low. They seek advice from solicitors--and I know the member for Toowoomba North was defending solicitors earlier. My experience is that some solicitors are excellent and some solicitors really do need solicitors to defend them. If you are an injured worker, you do not know that. It might be the first time you have talked to a solicitor about anything. If they get a solicitor that is reasonable then they should get good advice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1194139"></A>
I am concerned that there does not appear to be any consideration of the nature of the claim. Is it vexatious, is it mischievous or is it a genuine claim that the worker thought they had good foundations for, perhaps were poorly advised and then at the end of the court case have costs awarded against them? They have not only lost time at work, they have not only lost some physical ability or intellectual or emotional ability, but then they get this bill. It would be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. I want to know how subjective the assessment of awarding of costs is and whether the vexatious or mischievous nature of a claim will be an overriding factor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1194140"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Gladstone for the question. Obviously the standard operation of the law in Queensland will be imported now into common law claims for work related injuries--that is, costs follow the event. So, if the plaintiff succeeds, their costs will be paid by the other side. If the plaintiff fails and cannot prove negligence then they will be subject potentially to a costs order made by the court. So the way that the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation Act and the Workplace Health and Safety Act had been interpreted was that it was effectively a strict liability rule. If you were injured in the workplace, you basically could succeed in your common law claim, regardless of having to prove negligence or otherwise. So what we are doing now is bringing workplace injuries in line with other injuries sustained, for example, in a motor vehicle accident or in some other, as I said earlier, public place or in a large retail shop. For example, if you slip over and the floor was slippery or there was something on the floor that had not been cleaned up and the occupier of the premises was liable for not doing what they should have done and owed you a duty of care, people will be brought into line with those causes of action. So you have to prove negligence by the employer. That is the long and the short of it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1194145"></A>
The aim is to try to ensure that people think carefully before they sue, before they bring proceedings. Now it is open slather effectively and people do not have to consider that, which is why the number of common law claims has gone up and the claims costs have increased because people are bringing these claims however they are injured in the workplace. It is, I suppose, a dampening. It is designed to change litigation culture, to change the behaviour of lawyers but also to make people think about bringing proceedings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1194147"></A>
The member talked about vexatious claims. Ultimately it is for the plaintiff to prove that the employer was negligent. An individual will have to take advice on that from a solicitor. Solicitors have a duty to provide frank advice to clients. They cannot mislead clients. They cannot induce them to bring proceedings. They have to discharge their obligation as an officer of the court. They have a fiduciary duty to their client to be open and frank and fair and honest. So every legal practitioner in Queensland has that duty. They will have to be frank with their client about whether they can succeed or not. So people will still be protected. They will still get compensation because they will be compensated through the statutory scheme. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1194148"></A>
If they want to bring a common law claim, they will have to think about it. It is up to the individual really. If the injured worker is bringing a vexatious claim where there is a very tenuous link or there is no link to liability, then they will need to be very careful about bringing those proceedings because if they are unsuccessful, because it was a bit of a try on frankly then they may be exposed to costs. Ultimately, there are decision points to be made about whether you sue, whether you bring proceedings--those sorts of things. That is the broad picture. Again, it is designed to change litigation behaviour to try to plateau the increasing number of common law claims, if that is of any assistance to the honourable member. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.56 pm): This again is an issue that the minister responded to in the second reading debate but I could not hear what he said and I could not follow what he said. The clause refers to no civil cause of action based on contravention of the act, the act being the Workplace Health and Safety Act. In the minister’s second reading speech, he says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1194156"></A>
The bill amends the Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995 to remove any private civil right of action arising under the act--that is, a worker will not be able to rely on a breach of the Workplace Health and Safety Act 1995 to support their claim of common law negligence. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1194157"></A>
I see that as a significant change. The minister goes on to say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1194159"></A>
This amendment will preclude retrospectively and prospectively only those claims where negligence under common law cannot be proved. The approach is justified on the basis that common law claims under the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2003 are generally lodged between one and three years after the injury. If the amendment only applied to injuries that occurred after the introduction of the bill into parliament, it will not address the growth in claims. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1194160"></A>
So it is a retrospective clause. I would like to better understand what sorts of people will be affected by that retrospectivity, what sorts of numbers will be affected and why, from my understanding--and it could be flawed--the minister is saying that if there is a breach of workplace health and safety an injured worker cannot use that as a defence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1194162"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I apologise to the honourable member for speaking too quickly or not loudly enough during the second reading debate if that has made it difficult for her. So I apologise for that. I will continue with where I left off before the member’s last question. The decision of the Court of Appeal in Bourk v Power Serve dealt with the interpretation of the Workplace Health and Safety Act. The Court of Appeal basically attached strict liability to an employer for any injury that occurred in a workplace. So where the relevant section of the Workplace Health and Safety Act was breached and there was an injury, then the court held the employer liable for the negligence. That is how it was determined. That is how the court interpreted the law, that part of that act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1201566"></A>
So the purpose of the amendment, if I can put it on the record, is to address a perception that strict liability attaches to an employer if a work injury has occurred regardless of fault. So you do not have to prove fault; you just have to prove that there was a breach of workplace health and safety in the workplace and you were injured. You do not have to prove anyone was at fault. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1201568"></A>
The decision in the Bourk case affirmed that, if a worker is injured at work and there is a causal connection between the injury and work, the employer has breached the duty under the Workplace Health and Safety Act and the injured worker could recover. What we are doing with this amendment is removing that right of action under the Workplace Health and Safety Act, but it does not affect any other cause of action the worker may have in relation to his or her injury, such as a breach of duty of care in negligence or in contract. So he or she can still sue for negligence but it is removing that right. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1201572"></A>
If you are suing to recover damages for a breach of the Workplace Health and Safety Act--if you are basically bringing a Bourk action, bringing an action under the Workplace Health and Safety Act--we are saying you are no longer permitted to do that. We are winding the law back to what it was before the Bourk decision was made. That is a significant decision, as I said. That is a retrospective decision, but it is designed to bring financial stability to the scheme because the cost of the Bourk actions is significant. I am advised it is in the tens of millions of dollars. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1201574"></A>
I said in my second reading speech that we do not think there are a large number of claims currently on foot. If your trial is running before a court in Queensland where you have pleaded Bourk, that can continue, but if you commenced proceedings or you have not commenced proceedings you will no longer be able to rely on it. We will be allowing people to amend their pleadings. We will not be challenging them. We will not be seeking a cost order if they need to bring an application to do that because they might not plead Bourk; they might plead general negligence in the workplace.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1201576"></A>
We have done this basically to take the significant cost burden for Bourk actions out of the workers compensation scheme for common law claims. It is a significant thing to do, but it is designed to save the scheme money. People can still sue for negligence; they just will not be able to rely on the strict liability that attaches to a breach of the Workplace Health and Safety Act. I hope that assists you and has not confused you more. </Hansard-Body>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (11.04 pm): Once in a while something truly remarkable occurs and, because it is happening at such a humble level, it often gets missed. In the Gaven electorate, a mixed group of volunteers led by Louise Jennings is feeding hundreds of those who, through no fault of their own, are largely unable to feed themselves, house themselves or build sustainable lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1201597"></A>
Six years ago, Michael Ware and Toni Demmey started this twice-weekly lunchtime meal service. Louise, a neighbour, who is a mother of seven children and on a pension, asked to help. Since that time, thousands have been fed week on week and nightly from Coomera to Coolangatta, have had bread or food delivered to their homes, have had meals prepared for free or have been given food parcels, money or food vouchers to local suppliers. Louise has helped largely through the local St Vincent de Paul Society, although she was not a member of it. She has voluntarily delivered so much to so many for nothing, other than a need to assist and a love of her fellow men and women. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1201598"></A>
Local bakeries, food suppliers, service station operators, fruit shops and butchers have helped. Each year, they contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock that might otherwise be disposed of. This group has spawned a neighbourhood barbecue group run by the parishioners of the local St Margaret’s Anglican Church. There is a list of volunteers distributing food, food parcels from a food bank and funds to enable the survival of some very needy people. Representatives of Blair Athol, the Department of Communities and Health routinely attend these meals because there are a high number of people who are drug affected and who have mental illnesses. No preaching or brainwashing occurs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1201600"></A>
Louise has widened the group meal to take in the needs of the young people in the local Nerang skate park. These Nerang and surrounding district locals have followed the teaching of Christ. Loaves and Fishes has made many whose lives have been challenged a little more tolerable and very happy, and there can be no greater gift to offer. Their actions have triggered actions from others. Another group of volunteers have spent three years, as I said, providing this barbecue at Bischoff Pioneer Park in Nerang. Rain, hail or shine, every Tuesday this group provides a meal with a second course to the very needy of our local Nerang community. All sorts of people come and go at that barbecue, from the genuinely needy to those seeking a friend to talk to. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1201603"></A>
With our electorate office assistance, they have applied for a Woolworths food rescue grant that will hopefully facilitate the recycling of fresh food that major food stores otherwise dispose of. This food is not past its use-by date. This may make the process sustainable. In a sometimes Godless world, we do not always notice how many are not just talking the talk but walking it too.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1201604"></A>
It is a great credit to our community that the efforts of volunteers are able to do so much for so many, and they want to do more. The Meals on Wheels group, the Red Cross, the CWA, the senior citizens group together with the Loaves and Fishes group are merely just anonymous people serving anonymous citizens. Without any fanfare, the Nerang Neighbourhood Centre has delivered the same sort of service. Every day of every year all these groups live by a motto--</Hansard-Body>

Ms NELSON-CARR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mundingburra--ALP) (11.07 pm): A couple of weeks ago, I spoke in this place about the perils of gambling and the toll this pastime can take on people who spend more and more time and money gambling than they would like to or that they can afford. Unfortunately, my message was lost with my aside about small men on horses. In fact, the aside became an instant attention piece for my local paper--and none too complimentary, I might add. I wish to raise my concerns again in the hope that my views reach some level of interest in the great outside. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1201610"></A>
Gambling can be an occasional fun exercise but unfortunately, like any addiction, the costs can be massive. It is not just the hip pocket that struggles either, because the problem can strain relationships, interfere with home and work responsibilities, as well as take families down the road to financial catastrophe. People often do things they would not normally do when they are in the grip of this horrible addiction, like steal, deprive family and regularly hurt loved ones. Thankfully, help is available in many forms, but the key is in admitting the problem and then sticking to it with treatment and support. It is like alcoholism: facing it and doing something about it with support. Maintaining that recovery takes commitment, but the key for any addiction is to stay away from the activity. You have to avoid tempting environments and find activities to replace the addictive behaviour. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216212"></A>
Fortunately for some killer addictions in this country we have legislative protections, smoking being an excellent example. We have the best outcomes in the world as a result. But while we have solutions and support for smokers and drinkers and, to a lesser extent, gamblers, what hopelessly addicted gamblers face in their own homes is much more frightening. Alcoholics and smokers have a circuit breaker. They have to make a conscious decision to leave the house, drive, cycle or walk to a bottle shop or corner store to get their supplies and they are not bombarded with TV encouragements to smoke and drink. It is not so for gamblers. The temptation for gamblers is in their faces in their own homes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216213"></A>
As a society, I ask: how can we sit by and accept that on free-to-air TV gambling is an accepted norm? Viewers are deluged with the betting odds, the picks, the favourites and the ease with which it can be done--right there in your lounge room. It is on all their most watched favourite sports events and it is every few minutes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216214"></A>
I believe that while ever there is an event on free-to-air TV, advertising to gamble should be banned. Just asking people to gamble responsibly is really not responsible. Alcoholics cannot drink responsibly. Drug addicts cannot inject responsibly and nor do we urge people to do so, either. Gambling advertising, on the other hand, is fed with the lie that keeps the addiction alive and well. It is guaranteed to bring pain, hardship, family breakdown and suffering into the home. We must act responsibly and stop the abuse. Ban gambling on free-to-air TV. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Dr ROBINSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cleveland--LNP) (11.10 pm): On several occasions I have brought the views of my electorate to this House about the government’s water reform agenda. Water supply and security have been a high priority for successive Redland councils. In the Redlands, the foresight of former councils ensured the Redlands has always had sufficient water to provide for its community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216219"></A>
Former Redland shire mayor Don Seccombe said that the state government taking control of dams, weirs, bulk water pipes and wastewater treatments plants in South-East Queensland while councils control the domestic distribution system and water retail businesses was ‘not good for the Redlands’. He further stated that the ‘Redlands has planned ahead and paid for its water security over the years and now we are being penalised.’ The former mayor’s comments were echoed loudly by many in the community and the unrest about the state government’s takeover continues today.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216220"></A>
1 July brings with it further changes in the delivery of water services for the Redlands. On 1 July, as a result of the state government’s failed water reform program, a new entity that is jointly owned by the Redland, Logan and Gold Coast city councils, Allconnex Water, will take over the local delivery of water, recycled water, trade waste and wastewater services from Redland Water. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216221"></A>
A new problem has developed with the state government’s solution, and that is the potential of remaining Redland Water assets to be significantly undervalued in the transfer to Allconnex Water. The water assets have been independently valued in excess of $700 million, but Allconnex has written them down to just over $400 million. This shortfall of more than $300 million will mean the Redlands will be ripped off again by the state government’s water management policy. This major write-down of assets means that Redlanders will have a much lower level of equity in the new business which, in the short term, would likely result in reduced annual revenue for the council which will ultimately drive rates up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216223"></A>
Again, the residents of my electorate of Cleveland, and the broader Redlands, appear to have been ripped off by this state Labor government when it comes to water management. The latest is that there may still be further negotiations about the value of the Redland Water assets and thus the equity of the Redlands in Allconnex and the resultant level of rate rises in the Redlands. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216224"></A>
Today I am calling on the government to take into account in its final deliberations the forward thinking of Redlands councils’ thinking and planning that built the necessary water infrastructure to provide a more-than-adequate water supply for this growing community in the first place. It is now up to the government to finally show some fairness towards the Redlands vis-a-vis the community’s water or it will put a nail in the coffin of cost-effective water delivery to the residents of the Redlands. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Woorim, Destruction of Vegetation</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs SULLIVAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Pumicestone--ALP) (11.13 pm): Yesterday I tabled a petition bringing the local council works on the destruction of vegetation on the dunes along Rickman Parade, Woorim, to the attention of the parliament. I wrote to the council requesting that it immediately cease all works and that a full investigation be conducted to see whether due process was followed. The planned works are extensive and expensive and are not normal maintenance. Such major works demand public consultation but none was undertaken. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216228"></A>
Principle 2.9.9B of the State Coastal Management Plan states that ‘all levels of government participate in coastal planning in an open and cooperative way’. Nothing about the council’s decision was open and cooperative if one considers that at the 17 March 2010 meeting of the council’s Woorim Erosion Reference Group, WERG--specifically formed by council; one of the terms of reference for the group is to ‘assist with consideration and input into the protection of the Woorim Beach environment’--the proposed major works were not even mentioned by the local councillor who was there. This is an extraordinary omission since I discovered last week that the plan had been developing for some time. His press release the next day said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1216230"></A>
There is now an understanding that everybody needs to work together to achieve our common goal of protecting Woorim Beach from the forces of Mother nature. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216231"></A>
What hollow words. There is an agreement between the council and the federal government’s Envirofund Woorim Beach Dune Stabilisation Project 2007 which includes the in-kind contribution by the council to construct and repair fencing along the Woorim foreshore on both the eastern and western sides of the dunes, but only in consultation with the Envirofund. Approximately 700 metres has now been removed along Rickman Parade by the council without any consultation with the Woorim Envirofund Natural Heritage Trust committee.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216232"></A>
Mayor Allan Sutherland, to his credit, visited the site. Unfortunately, he was told by a senior officer that WERG was not consulted because the work was being done only on the western side of the dune. He was misled. The plan lacks any formal detail and is useless in the hands of amateur supervisors who do not understand the important role of dunal vegetation. Even the department of resource management was concerned about the lack of detail in the proposal and asked the council for a list of actual trees to be removed and how, suggesting removal by hand instead of heavy equipment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216233"></A>
Unfortunately, these dunes are on the council’s road reserve so the state government does not have to tick it off. The council’s excuses to remove vegetation are pathetic. They contradict previous advice in 2008 to residents warning them to be vigilant and take note of anyone damaging vegetation because it is illegal. At a time when budgetary constraints are paramount, this work, if any is genuinely required, could be undertaken by a properly funded, environmentally sound landcare group. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216234"></A>
The council has done some excellent work at Woorim with state government funds but removing this vegetation is not good. It is underhanded and smacks of favouritism for those few who will benefit from hundreds of thousands of ratepayers’ dollars to get better water views. Those responsible should feel ashamed. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Aspley--LNP) (11.16 pm): As a mother of three young adults, I am very interested in the issues that matter to our young people, their hopes and aspirations and how they see Queensland now and in the future. I really enjoy engaging with young people in my local area, whether it is through their schools, their workplaces or community groups. Outside my electorate I have had the pleasure of participating in the Peace Parliament and attending YMCA Youth Parliaments, the next being held in this chamber in September. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216238"></A>
Tonight, however, I would like to speak about the Indigenous Youth Forum and Indigenous Youth Parliament that I had the great opportunity to be part of last week here in the precinct. As I learned, the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program aims to improve the leadership skills of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Through the program, young people learn about Queensland parliament’s democratic processes, develop their leadership skills and develop networks with peers and potential mentors.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216239"></A>
The forum is designed for Indigenous youth aged 18 to 25 years. This year there were 65 applicants from which 40 youth members were selected. The program supports and encourages the development of future Indigenous leaders, and these young people get inspiration and motivation through the sharing of stories and experiences. Most importantly, these young leaders are encouraged to apply the leadership skills learned from the program in their respective communities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216240"></A>
Forty youth members and four youth mentors from urban, regional and rural Queensland gathered to discuss matters with particular relevance to the Indigenous community but also discussed issues that face the broader community. It was terrific to see a gathering of articulate and confident young people who are poised to become our leaders of tomorrow. The majority of participants were employed full time, part time or were undertaking study. One youth member was a young mother who had her baby with her.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216241"></A>
I very much enjoyed the first day, when I shared with the group my own journey to this place. There was particular attention paid by those interested in seeking political office in the preselection process and election campaigning. Day 2 was the Youth Parliament, where I had the pleasure of taking on Deputy Speaker duties when the youth members debated the Indigenous Healthy Lifestyles Bill 2010. It was a lively debate, won by the opposition. I look forward to reading the <Hansard-Italic>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216242"></A>
There were many outstanding speeches, but I would like to mention one contribution that, although brief, was extremely powerful. It was delivered by the Youth Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade in the adjournment debate. The speech was in relation to the age of retirement for Indigenous men which is presently 67 years. The youth minister highlighted that the life expectancy differential between non-Indigenous and Indigenous Australians was 17 years. His speech focused on the current reality that until the Close the Gap campaign is successful most Indigenous males may never get to enjoy the benefits of retirement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1216243"></A>
I believe that overwhelmingly our young people, irrespective of their background, are solid community members who want to make a positive contribution. From where I stand, I believe that our state is in good hands for the future. </Hansard-Body>

Mr CHOI</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Capalaba--ALP) (11.19 pm): This evening I rise to render my support to school chaplains and commend the work they perform in our schools. Recently our state celebrated Chaplaincy Week, which was a great opportunity to recognise the important role our school chaplains play in the life of our schools and our wider communities. Across Queensland more than 500 chaplains support students and their families in more than 600 schools. School chaplains help students to handle issues they are confronted with and better ways to deal with challenges they face. This could range from a student’s loneliness in a new school or a new city through to substance abuse by the student or a member of their family and may even include at times very serious issues such as abuse, depression and self-harm. Scripture Union Queensland is officially endorsed by Education Queensland as an accredited employing authority for school chaplains. Each chaplain provides a personal point of contact with care and support for students, teachers and their families within the schools.</Hansard-Body>

During Chaplaincy Week each year communities are invited to help raise funds to support the work of each chaplain, or ‘chappy’ as they are known in schools. Breakfasts, dinners, sporting events and other projects are all dedicated to raise funds and the profile of chappies and the work they do. I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge the hard work of some of the chappies in my electorate: Joy Livingstone at Capalaba State College, Terry Keen at Alexandra Hills State School, Lyn Keen at Hilliard State School, Amy Dolling at Birkdale South State School and Anna-Claire Hoey and her colleague Peta Lloyd at Alexandra Hills State High School.</Hansard-Body>

The recent Redlands chaplaincy dinner was another opportunity to highlight the important work that our chappies do. It was a pleasure to have the company of Tim Mander, the CEO of Scripture Union, and Ken Mihill, our area organiser from SU, who together with the SU event team put on a fantastic evening with over 150 guests attending, including Olympic swimmer Duncan Armstrong as our emcee and Phil Smith as guest speaker. Phil spoke of the importance of setting an example for our young people by being dedicated to a purpose and that all of our actions have consequences, positively or negatively. In each of our schools which have chappies on board students can find a safe place to talk about problems they are facing and can sit down and find ways of easing the pain in their lives and help to pick up the pieces and work on new attitudes and learn new skills to deal with challenges. One outback student is quoted as saying--</Hansard-Body>

I think it would be naive for ... communities to believe that there is no need for someone like chappies. Stuff happens behind closed doors that most people don’t know about, big and small. Without the help I was given, I know I would be dead.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

(Redlands--LNP) (11.22 pm): Tonight I rise on behalf of the many residents of a small estate whose lives have been turned upside down at the hands of Main Roads, and I am pleased to see the minister in the chamber and I hope that he will intervene and help them. One family that have reached the end of their tether, their humour and their patience with Main Roads are the Brewsters, and I table for the information of members of the House a letter from Scott and Joy Brewster.</Hansard-Body>

 Letter, dated 7 June 2010, from Joy and Scott Brewster regarding resurfacing of the Cleveland-Redland Bay Road [<HypertextLink>

 Can members imagine the surprise of residents when a road surfacing job along Cleveland-Redland Bay Road at Victoria Point would result in a worse surface when the work was finished and a noisier surface when the work was finished? When all calls for help have gone unanswered or--worse than that--they are given completely wrong information, they are devastated. Scott and Joy are devastated by the way that they have been treated so far by the department.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1223827"></A>
I believe the department is actually conning the community by delivering on only half the project. The road in question had an asphalt surface which has been replaced by Main Roads, which has allowed a replacement with a spray tar and chip seal finish. So what does that mean? It means that you save a few thousand dollars upfront, but at what cost? You end up with a rough corrugated road surface where the life of the asset is reduced significantly. Then there is the added cost of time by engineers and others responding to complaints. There is the emotional cost to the community because of the noise dB rating going through the roof. Families have lost the use of their backyards. It means that Scott and Joy can no longer sleep in their own master bedroom. It means that Scott and Joy and families adjoining this road are sleep deprived. This couple believe that they have been lied to by representatives of this government, which I find unacceptable and I am sure all members do as well.</Hansard-Body>

Mr DOWLING:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I withdraw the comment. I call on the minister to heed the wishes of petitioners whose petition was tabled this morning and intervene in this instance. This Bligh Labor government has a history of overpromising and underdelivering, and here we have another prime example. Redland City Council tried this half-baked chip seal practice many years ago and found it to be unacceptable. It is short-sighted. It is a penny-pinching strategy that fails. Road construction is a simple process--you spray the tar down, you whack some gravel on it and then after it is bedded down you then do the cap in asphalt cement. In this case, that part has not happened. By not applying the final topcoat--the AC layer--the road life is reduced, and this road is already showing signs of failure. You save a dollar today, you skimp today, and you pay dearly for it tomorrow--yet another demonstration of this government’s mismanagement, a false economy, a lack of adhering to standards, and residents of Redlands are going to suffer with this until the road is fixed. The residents of Queensland will continue to suffer because of this type of systemic failure by the Bligh Labor government. The Brewsters and other families need your help, Minister, and I add my congratulations on your elevation, Mr Deputy Speaker Kilburn.</Hansard-Body>

Ms van LITSENBURG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Redcliffe--ALP) (11.25 pm): Last Friday morning I hosted a breakfast to kick off the week-long celebrations of the Hayes Inlet Festival. The Hayes Inlet Festival is designed to shine a spotlight on our beautiful Hayes Inlet waterways and to educate the community on the unique ecosystems. These waterways are the filter that keeps the waters of the bay pristine and many of the fish that are caught in the bay have their breeding grounds in those waterways. The week will be packed with activities including a family fun day, information events about the wading birds that migrate from the Northern Hemisphere, boat rides through the inlet and walks into the wetlands where koalas can still be spotted and the odd cheeky kangaroo can be sighted taking a short cut across the mudflats at low tide.</Hansard-Body>

Some 80 businesspeople, the members for Kallangur and Petrie, representatives from community groups and schools sat down to a delicious breakfast at the Redcliffe Leagues Club with guest speakers Channel 7 weatherman John Schluter and Miles Yeates, regional manager of Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service. Miles’s presentation impressed the gathering and reflected the cutting-edge role Parks and Wildlife has in implementing sustainable practices in our natural environments, including a spectacular PowerPoint demonstration showing why dugong are susceptible to propeller strike. John Schluter was excited by the festival and keen to promote it and the importance of the Hayes Inlet waterways in the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1223856"></A>
The Hayes Inlet Festival reflects the Bligh government’s Toward Q2 goals to protect the environment and manage it sustainably. I have been working with a committee of locals in conjunction with cross-departmental representatives towards a 10-year plan for the Hayes Inlet, Saltwater Creek and Pine River waterways to Kurwongbah. The Bligh government is committed to protecting our vital waterways and is acting not only here in Hayes Inlet or in the south-east but right across the state, including increased protections for the Great Barrier Reef and wild rivers, the koala strategy, new national parks, increased protections for Moreton Bay, the Green Army and many measures to protect Queensland’s biodiversity. Only this Bligh Labor government has the vision to protect Queensland’s natural heritage and the courage to turn that vision into reality to deliver the policy and action that will ensure not only pristine Hayes Inlet waterways and a clean, sustainable Moreton Bay but all of our vital natural environments across the state.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Burnett and Bundaberg Dental Patients, Compensation</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind) (11.27 pm): Tonight I renew my calls for this government to apologise and compensate the 268 Burnett and Bundaberg dental patients who were operated on by Queensland Health medical staff using unclean and non-sterile dental equipment. Some 268 Burnett and Bundaberg dental patients in mid-November 2009 were told by Queensland Health that they had been exposed to HIV and other blood-borne diseases because of a failure to properly sterilise dental equipment. Some 268 patients and their families suffered over Christmas, some fearing to kiss their children or cuddle their partners for more than three months while waiting for medical test results, and deserve to be compensated. Innocent women and children have been harmed and damaged by this government, and this health minister thinks that he can ignore these people’s legitimate claims for compensation. Each victim deserves an immediate payment of $5,000. They should not be forced to spend their own money on lawyers to achieve justice and fair compensation.</Hansard-Body>

Bradley O’Kane is a dangerous man. In 2005, he randomly stabbed a 42-year-old woman at Robina while allowed out of the mental unit to go shopping. He is currently held at The Park mental facility. He has a history of attacking staff and has repeatedly threatened to strangle them and slash their throats. We have all heard the assurances from the health minister about the locks that will not work. We have all heard that they were meant to be fixed by April. We have all heard, too, that the health minister is familiar with system failures and avoiding responsibility. But despite the ham-fisted promises, the locks still do not work. Just recently, a staff member was locked in a room with O’Kane because the locks failed again. That is a potentially lethal situation, because this health minister will not fix the problem. Incredibly, the failing lock was removed and replaced with a lock from the room of another dangerous patient. This then left another violent patient with a lock that did not function. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1223909"></A>
The risks at The Park are real. Staff are regularly attacked. I have been informed that one nurse was bashed so badly that she had to use a straw to eat. Another was stabbed. There was no warning and no reason. This person went to work one day and got stabbed. One day a nurse will go to work and not go home to his or her family. Someone will be killed if action is not taken immediately. We cannot wait for a minister who has proven by his actions that he does not care and he will not get his act together. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs SCOTT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Woodridge--ALP) (11.30 pm): During Education Week, I witnessed the mysterious power of a beautiful horse to calm the spirit of young students aged 10 to 12 with varying degrees of behavioural issues, learning difficulties, lack of confidence and interpersonal skills and problem-solving ability. The night before, inspired Marsden State School teacher Jill Strachan went forward to receive the South Coast region award for Excellence in Inclusive Education. Their program, Horsing Around, has been designed to facilitate social and emotional learning. Six to eight students were selected, some from the special education unit, to take part in an eight-week course of two hours per week where they would learn to identify the horse and calmly approach and read the mood of the horse. They would go on to learn to catch and greet the horse, calmly place a soft bridle on and lead the horse, work in a team to construct an obstacle course to lead the horse through, learn grooming and, finally, to ride the horse, which is quite an accomplishment for young students who come with their fears and apprehensions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1223918"></A>
My visit to the equestrian centre at Waterford West coincided with week 5 for this group of children and here I was to witness students who had already progressed significantly in this incredible transformation conducted by Equine Learning for Futures Inc. It was simply amazing. I watched in awe as one by one the students donned a helmet, quietly and calmly entered the enclosure, picked up the harness and confidently approached Lady. They held out the back of their hand to greet her and then quite proficiently placed the harness on her. Principal Kevin Leathwaite stood beside me, outlining the dramatic transformations that had taken place over these five short weeks, where once there was a child who may have been uncooperative in class, often distracted and lacking in concentration--and some children have anger issues--to now be quietly leading Lady around the enclosure. They then dropped the harness and moved close to the horse to gently but firmly push on her chest to force her to step back.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1223921"></A>
I have for many years known of the power of animals to effect a calming influence on human beings and to change lives, such as when at-risk young people are given the opportunity to spend time on a cattle station or at a horse stud. To see this powerful demonstration was a real privilege. The next exercise was equally remarkable. In the principal’s words, to see these children working in a team to construct an obstacle course would never have happened prior to this program. They communicated with each other, had smiles on their faces, placed items appropriately and led Lady through her paces. Then later on we saw them grooming, cleaning her hoofs and exhibiting a real sense of respect and care for her. </Hansard-Body>
