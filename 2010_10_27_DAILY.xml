 (Mermaid Beach--LNP) (9.31 am): I rise on a matter of privilege. Yesterday, in response to a question without notice, the minister responsible for racing, Minister Lawlor, gave this answer--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-998365"></A>
The first thing you have to remember is that Albion Park is owned by Racing Queensland, as are other places such as the Gold Coast Turf Club. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-998374"></A>
The minister is well aware that Racing Queensland does not own the Gold Coast Turf Club. In fact, he was a board member. He has deliberately misled the House.

<A ID="pgfId-998544"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yesterday the member for Burnett gave notice of a motion. As is a developing trend, that notice of motion is more akin to a long narration or an argument, rather than a concise proposition for determination by the House. There are few rules for notices of motion, probably because they have never caused much concern in the past. However, one long established rule is that members must be able to authenticate the facts stated in the notice of motion. Yesterday’s notice of motion by the member for Burnett contained alleged statements by the Minister for Communities which the minister disputes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998562"></A>
Yesterday the member was provided with an opportunity to authenticate the facts in the notice. The member subsequently provided me, through the Clerk, previous statements by the member and another individual as regards the alleged statements by the minister. However, no official statement by the minister or from any official source was provided. The member was provided with the opportunity to reword the notice of motion which he declined to accept. I am not prepared to let stand on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 a notice of motion that contains disputed statements of fact. Therefore, I have ruled the notice of motion out of order. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind) (9.35 am): I rise on a matter suddenly arising. Yesterday the Minister for Community Services rose under a point of order and implied that I had incorrectly claimed that to transport a young person under police escort to Brisbane from Wide Bay-Burnett costs approximately $8,000. She further stated that my notice of motion contained an incorrect assertion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998680"></A>
I table a statement from ex-SAS officer Bob Davis that supports my assertion and refutes the minister’s point of order, which implied that I was misleading this place regarding the minister’s comments during our meeting. If the minister does not apologise and unreservedly withdraw her comments, under standing order 269 I will be forced to write to you, Mr Speaker, and ask that this matter be referred to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee to consider whether the minister is in breach of standing order 266 and is deliberately misleading the House. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.38 am): Those on this side of the House are committed to real engagement with Queenslanders. That is why we have been walking a day in the shoes of everyday Queensland workers and it is why I hold regular community cabinet meetings. I am looking forward to the cabinet meeting in Mount Isa this weekend. People’s question time is another way of ensuring that no matter where people live they can access their government directly, using every available technology. To give the House an idea of the reach of this initiative so far, across the four sessions of people’s question time from February to August 2010, Queenslanders have submitted nearly 700 questions and have gone online to watch the live webcasts more than 4,500 times. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998898"></A>
I am very pleased to advise the House that the next people’s question time will be held on Wednesday, 10 November 2010. Joining me on the panel will be the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health, the Treasurer, the Minister for Education and Training, and the Minister for Community Services and Housing. This will provide a genuine opportunity for members of the public to submit questions on any issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998907"></A>
During people’s question time, I and other members of the panels have answered questions on the broadest possible range of issues such as education, population growth, asset sales, daylight saving, cost of living, health, law, heritage buildings, disability services and regional road upgrades. Anyone who is interested in finding out more about people’s question time can go to the Queensland government website and link to the area marked ‘people’s question time’. </Hansard-Body>

Building the Education Revolution, Auditor-General’s Report</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002580"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.39 am): Mr Speaker, as you have just advised the House, the Auditor-General has now released his report into Queensland’s delivery of the Nation Building--Economic Stimulus Plan. Through this initiative of a federal Labor government we are building new school buildings, new public housing and road upgrades right across Queensland. This report examines the Queensland government’s delivery of this $4.39 billion allocation under the federal plan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002584"></A>
I am very pleased to note the positive review from the Auditor-General, who has reported on value for money and efficient delivery by the state government. The report looks at our delivery of three programs under the stimulus plan--Building the Education Revolution, the Social Housing Initiative and the Roads and Safety Initiative. What did the Auditor-General find? He found that the departments of education and training, communities, public works and transport and main roads have done an excellent job in implementing these massive programs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002589"></A>
The Building the Education Revolution program is investing close to $2.1 billion on 4,500 projects in over 1,200 Queensland schools. The Auditor-General has found that the BER construction costs were lower than costs for pre-stimulus package construction. Equally, the report does identify that for some facilities the costs appear to be higher than the lower end of the industry benchmarks, but you would expect to see that in a large program with a large number of projects. That means we have built school halls and classrooms for nine per cent less than pre-stimulus program prices and libraries for five per cent less. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002592"></A>
The Auditor-General notes the department’s strategy of renegotiating or retendering where initial tenders were found not to achieve value for money. The Auditor-General’s report, which examined 36 schools in detail, backs up the two previous reports from PricewaterhouseCoopers indicating Queensland state schools really are getting bang for their buck. It also reinforces the previous report by the federal task force led by Brad Orgill. Thousands of Queensland students are now benefiting from these new facilities in their schools. The Queensland government has so far delivered 3,450 projects including libraries, halls, covered outdoor learning areas and a wide range of classroom upgrades. That means do not believe the nay-sayers. BER is a success in Queensland. It is a making a real difference. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002597"></A>
The Auditor-General also found that the Queensland government has delivered strong value for money under the Social Housing Initiative. Our government has delivered dwellings at costs of up to 36 per cent lower than pre-stimulus prices in Queensland. The average cost of the 506 dwellings that we have completed so far is $271,300--well below the $300,000 maximum expected by the Commonwealth government. We have also been given the tick for our work under the Roads and Safety Initiative, spending $123.3 million on black spot safe projects, boom gate installations and road maintenance since the program began.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002600"></A>
The Nation Building--Economic Stimulus Plan was conceived quickly in the face of a fast-moving economic crisis that threatened to engulf the nation. As you would expect with any large program, the Auditor-General has identified the risks associated with full completion and urges continued rigorous monitoring of these programs, and that is what we will deliver. What this report shows is that the Queensland government has effectively delivered this program. Our government has taken massive amounts of new funds invested by a federal Labor government on behalf of the people of Queensland. We have used the funds wisely and we have built the infrastructure efficiently. </Hansard-Body>

Tilt Trains</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.43 am): Travelling the Brisbane to Cairns rail route is one of the world’s top train journeys. It takes you past the magnificent Glass House Mountains, the cane country of North Queensland and the majestic tropics beyond Townsville. Travelling north on the Sunlander is an iconic Queensland experience. I am pleased to advise the House today that under this Labor government that experience is about to get a whole lot better. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002608"></A>
The state government will invest $189 million to buy another tilt train and upgrade the existing two tilt trains. That means the old Sunlander will be decommissioned after serving Queensland well for around 45 years--nearly half a century. This old lady has been a faithful servant to Queensland. Those who have fond memories of this epic train journey can be confident that the $189 million investment we announce today means that this service can continue for the next 50 years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002610"></A>
The new trains will feature the following: deluxe sleeper cars with personal ensuites; first-class cars with lay down flat seats, similar to airline sky beds; a restaurant car with a la carte dining; smart, flat screen TVs--</Hansard-Body>

 This is not only good news for train travellers but also great news for regional Queensland because the contract for this upgrade has been awarded to Maryborough’s Downer EDI facility. This is a $189 million contract. It is an investment in the Wide Bay region. It will provide support for 800 direct and indirect jobs. That is 500 direct jobs at the workshops in Maryborough and an additional 300 jobs supported in the region. I am pleased to see the member for Maryborough with a smile on his face. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002621"></A>
This is a $189 million investment in a government owned passenger railway and it will last for the next 50 years. It is because this government has embarked on our program of asset sales that we can make this promise to the people of Queensland--to put passengers first. It is because we have created a rail company that is completely dedicated to passengers that we are confident we can deliver these focused improvements. This investment in the future of regional rail travel allows us to continue to provide six return services between Brisbane and Cairns a week. It allows us to provide faster and more comfortable options for tourists and for regional Queenslanders for whom intercity train travel is essential. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002623"></A>
The tilt trains are the fastest trains in Australia. They travel at speeds of up to 160 kilometres an hour, and this new train will cut five hours off the travel time on the entire route than travelling on the old Sunlander. These three diesel tilt trains will service the next generation of rail passengers, carrying on a proud tradition begun with the Sunlander name. These new trains will symbolise our commitment to passenger rail here in our state and our dedication to improving rail services for all Queenslanders. Under Labor, Sunlander now has a new lease of life--a faster, smoother, better ride through the beautiful regions of our state. </Hansard-Body>

Wide Bay Burnett Regional Plan</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002628"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (9.48 am): The Bligh government has led the way in establishing long-term regional plans to guide the growth of this state. We are determined to see the growth of regional Queensland guided. Already we have the South East Queensland Regional Plan and the Far North Queensland Regional Plan. These plans act to guide the rapid population growth these areas have experienced and will continue to experience as people continue to vote with their feet and flock to Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002632"></A>
The Premier has tasked me with responsibility for the Wide Bay-Burnett region, a fast-growing region with challenges relating to employment and economic development. The government is introducing the next statutory regional plan in the Wide Bay-Burnett. Over the past 12 months I have conducted a series of meetings across the region with stakeholders and councils as we have sought to shape a plan for the future of the region. A draft regional plan is now out for public comment. It is not just a plan for where houses go; it is a plan for how the region’s economy will grow. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003835"></A>
Public consultation is now underway, and meetings have been held from Gympie to Bundaberg and almost everywhere in between where residents have been invited to have their say. I would encourage all local residents and stakeholders to make a formal submission to the plan by the closing date of 24 December this year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003838"></A>
We recognise that the Wide Bay-Burnett region is one of the fastest growing in the state and indeed one of the fastest growing in the nation. This is a region that for the past 10 years has seen above average population growth, with numbers expected to increase into the future from 287,000 now to more than 433,000 people in 2031. That is why the government decision to procure the new iconic Sunlander through Downer EDI in Maryborough is so important. This is vital for our state’s tourism industry but absolutely critical for the local Maryborough economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003839"></A>
When undertaking the government’s economic reforms, we said that we wanted to move away from investing in coal wagons and port facilities for mining companies and focus more on improving the passenger network and other social services and infrastructure. This is our priorities in action. This $189 million investment is a vote of confidence in Queensland Rail which remains in public ownership. It is a vote of confidence in Maryborough’s Downer EDI, a company with an historic relationship with Queensland Rail. These initiatives are about investment in industries and services that matter to the people of Queensland--investing in jobs, not cuts. We support local industry, we support regional development and we are stepping up our support through these initiatives to the Wide Bay-Burnett region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003840"></A>
Our commitment to local industry will be further enhanced today when we introduce legislation into the House to ensure local Queensland businesses have every opportunity to benefit from the massive government investment in infrastructure and services around the state. The Queensland Industry Participation Policy Bill will put into law this government’s longstanding policy to give local industry a fair go when it comes to government projects. While competition is healthy in any procurement process, we recognise that local businesses have a lot to offer and should be given full, fair and reasonable opportunities to tender for work on major government funded procurements. Already, our local industry policy has seen local companies win $5 billion worth of contestable contracts, stimulating local economies and creating jobs. We have a plan for the future: an investment in passenger trains, an investment in the regions, an investment in local industry and an investment in jobs. Jobs, not cuts--just like we said we would. </Hansard-Body>

Universal Children’s Day</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Hon. GJ WILSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (9.51 am): Today is Universal Children’s Day. Thousands of Queensland children will be taking part in today’s celebrations at events right across the state. Parliament House will be overrun with children at lunchtime, as the Speaker’s Green plays host to one of those many events. We wanted to help them make their day extra special, and what better way to do that than to invite them to this very special place, the parliament of Queensland. They will be taking part in a whole range of different activities to mark their special day, and I am sure the House will join me in wishing them a wonderful day.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003844"></A>
Children’s Day was originally started by the United Nations in 1954 as a day of worldwide friendship and understanding among children. It was also intended that Universal Children’s Day be a day of activity to promote the welfare of children around the world. It falls within Queensland Children’s Week, which has been celebrated around the state since 1971. The early focus of Queensland Children’s Week was on children in care but it is now also about recognising the need to protect and celebrate all children. It reminds us of our responsibility as individuals and as a community to provide a safe and caring environment for children’s growth and development, particularly in the early years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003845"></A>
I am pleased to say that our government is committed to this important goal and has supported Children’s Week since 1999. Over the past 12 months we have launched a number of initiatives that focus on the education and wellbeing of young Queenslanders. These include providing all Queensland children with access to a kindergarten program over the next few years, culminating in 2014. We are also rolling out up to 240 new kindergarten services around the state, with six new kindergartens opened already this year. In 2010, more than 300 long-day-care services have also been approved to offer kindergarten programs. The Kindy Counts! information campaign is putting the spotlight on the benefits of kindy for children and how it sets them up for success in learning and in life.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004976"></A>
Further, we are rolling out the Queensland Ready Readers program, which places reading volunteers in classrooms across the state. Ready Reader volunteers support children’s literacy in the early years and help to instill confidence in children and a lifelong love of reading. We have been running a state-wide reading awareness campaign to encourage parents and carers to read to their children from an early age for at least 20 minutes a day. We know that this has a positive impact on children’s learning and development; that is what the experts tell us. All of these initiatives are about the wellbeing of Queensland children, because we know that we have to start at the very beginning to give children the very best start in life. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (9.54 am): Whenever I visit a hospital, I am blown away by the dedication of our staff and their unwavering commitment to our public health system. Every day in Queensland Health, so many of our 80,000 staff demonstrate that they are committed to excellence in clinical outcomes. Whether they are working in a major metropolitan hospital or in a 10-bed health centre in regional Queensland, our hardworking staff continue to show that improvements in service are their core business. Today I would like to recognise some of the exceptional work being done in our state’s hospitals.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003850"></A>
Firstly, I would like to congratulate the Department of Emergency Medicine at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital which has been awarded the Australasian Emergency Department of the Year 2010 in recognition of their excellence in emergency care. This prestigious award was presented earlier this month at the College of Emergency Nursing Australasia conference in Canberra. The RBWH’s Department of Emergency Medicine was selected based on their demonstrated excellence in patient care and clinical outcomes, commitment to professional development of staff and commitment to quality management. This award highlights the RBWH’s strengths in leadership, multidisciplinary teamwork and innovation. It also means that the efforts of the hardworking staff have been recognised. The Department of Emergency Medicine at RBWH sees about 70,000 presentations each year and is the largest emergency care provider in Queensland. I last visited them on 13 October this year. The staff in the department are dedicated to providing outstanding care.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003853"></A>
I give great credit to its director, Dr Alan O’Connor; its nursing director, Tami Photinos; and its nursing director of patient flow, Tony Nesbit. I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the highly skilled and disciplined team behind them in the RBWH’s Department of Emergency Medicine for the wonderful job they do in providing patients with world-class care. This award is clear recognition that it is a wonderful role model and an example to other departments of emergency medicine, both in Queensland and in other parts of Australasia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003855"></A>
Secondly, I would like to congratulate Rilla Webb, the director of nursing and facility manager at Capricorn Coast Hospital and Health Service. Ms Webb has been recognised by the Association of Queensland Nurse Leaders with an outstanding achievement award. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1003856"></A>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003857"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection from the minister. Ms Webb has had a long and illustrious career that has spanned some four decades, and in this time she has demonstrated exceptional performance. She has spent the past six years in her role as director of nursing at Yeppoon. This outstanding nurse has dedicated her career to the rural and remote communities of Queensland. She is an advocate for her rural counterparts, ensuring they are represented and recognised for the challenges they face. Ms Webb has led the way for service reform and redevelopment in rural and remote communities and has demonstrated a passion for supporting the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community in collaboration with Indigenous elders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003858"></A>
Lastly, but by no means least, Whitsunday Health Service nurse unit manager Lisa Milne has been awarded the prestigious emerging nurse leader award by the Association of Queensland Nurse Leaders. Mrs Milne, who has worked at Proserpine Hospital since 1999, has been commended for her commitment to dynamic team leadership and her focus on providing a high standard of care for clients and patients. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for her commendation of Mrs Milne. Her commitment to team spirit and her efforts to encourage staff to develop areas of professional interest were commended. I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to Ms Webb and Mrs Milne for their excellence, commitment and achievements throughout their careers. They are proof of the high standard of health-care professionals working throughout our state. These awards clearly demonstrate that Queensland Health is committed to excellence. This can only be achieved through a highly skilled and committed workforce. I thank all Queensland Health staff who have contributed to our successes in the delivery of a first-rate, world-class health-care system. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. RG NOLAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport) (9.58 am): In September last year, I visited the Downer EDI manufacturing facility in the heart of Maryborough to see the work they do. I also met in Brisbane with a delegation of Fraser Coast workers--tradesmen and apprentices from the Downer EDI plant and small business owners and employees from the firm’s long component chain. The former Walkers plant is a mainstay of Queensland manufacturing. The first Queensland built locomotive was made there in 1873, and its first Queensland Rail contract was awarded 113 years ago, in 1897. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005055"></A>
Today it is one of the Fraser Coast’s key employers, directly and indirectly employing 800 people in the manufacture of world-class rolling stock. The government’s announcement today will keep that plant solidly working for four more years. The Downer EDI plant today has a full book, as it is more than halfway through building the Queensland government’s current order of 64 Citytrains for South-East Queensland. It has also been building rolling stock for Perth’s narrow-gauge railway--work which was set to continue if Labor had been re-elected in the west. Unfortunately, the Liberals came to power and did what they always do--cut investment and implement harsh austerity measures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005058"></A>
The Perth contract is set to deliver its last train to Perth at the end of next month. The Liberal government’s decision means no new trains and fewer manufacturing jobs for Queenslanders. The new trains which this government, in very stark contrast, is ordering are expected to be of a very high standard, offering sleepers on a faster tilt train for the first time, providing airline style flat beds as well as premium economy seating. The Queensland coast is a great tourism drawcard. This new rail service will provide a whole new and, I expect, very popular product for Queenslanders and tourists to appreciate. </Hansard-Body>

Building Industry, Unlicensed Contractors</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (10.01 am): Earlier this month I announced an audit of building sites around Queensland to help ensure all building workers are licensed. More than 100 officers from the Building Services Authority have been visiting randomly selected residential and commercial construction sites from Thursday Island to the Gold Coast. As I speak, BSA officers are interviewing contractors all over the state and will continue to do so until the end of this week. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005066"></A>
Results from the audit show that in Brisbane over 500 people have been interviewed and $2,000 fines have been issued to at least two people for unlicensed contracting. The Gold Coast audit is ongoing, with at least three unlicensed contractors detected so far and one of those already fined. Two suspected unlicensed contractors are under investigation in Toowoomba following interviews with 210 people. On the Sunshine Coast 306 people have been interviewed and no unlicensed contractors have been identified. Similarly, no unlicensed contractors were identified amongst 170 interviewees in the Maryborough region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005067"></A>
Contractors have been interviewed on work sites around Mackay and in the Whitsundays, Proserpine and Airlie Beach, with three suspected unlicensed contractors under investigation so far. Audits have begun in Townsville, and in Rockhampton 197 people have been interviewed, resulting in four suspected cases of unlicensed contracting. Fines have been issued in two of those cases, and investigations are continuing into the other two.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005068"></A>
In 2009-10 BSA staff interviewed 9,594 contractors at 2,604 building sites. I reckon that would be something of a record. As a result, fines totalling $88,000 were issued and 38 investigations are ongoing. So much for the labelling that people give the agency as a toothless tiger. I will say that again--$88,000 worth of fines. I think anybody who suggests that it is a toothless tiger ought to talk to those people who have been pinched as a result of their behaviour. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005069"></A>
These audits help to ensure contractors do the right thing, standards are maintained and consumers are always protected. I have said it before and I will say it again: I am extremely pleased that, as the number of compliance investigations by the BSA has increased, the number of unlicensed contractors detected has decreased.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005070"></A>
Further proof of the BSA’s help for consumers is evident in the case of Bundaberg couple Ray and June Logan. The Logans were meant to take up residence in a newly built house in Christmas 2008, but their builder became insolvent at the lockup stage after they had paid 85 per cent of the cost of completion. The BSA stepped in and under the Queensland Home Warranty Scheme $196,000 was approved in claims for non-complete and defective works, which guaranteed the Logans’ house was completed. If we did not have a BSA, the Logans would not be in their home. They are now in their home and anybody who suggests in the Bundaberg area that the BSA is a toothless tiger simply does not understand the realities of life. I invite them to talk to Mr and Mrs Logan about the service they have received. I look forward to the day that the <Hansard-Italic>

 publishes such a story. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (10.05 am): This morning I gave the opening address at the Mining 2010 Resources Convention, and I can report that there is enormous enthusiasm and optimism in this industry amidst speculation of a second resources boom. The government’s priority has always been to create jobs and build a strong economy, and we are delivering on that in the resources industry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005078"></A>
Last week’s environmental approval by the federal government of two Queensland CSG projects based on 300 conditions on top of the 600 Queensland government conditions has the potential to generate $30 billion in investment and more than 10,000 jobs. Our exports are booming, which is creating jobs across the state. We are the No. 1 global exporter of seaborne coal, with our coal exports growing by 131 per cent in value last financial year alone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005079"></A>
Trade drives our economy. One in five jobs is trade related, increasing to one in four in some of our regions. We promised 100,000 jobs and we are more than halfway there. We promised record investment and we are delivering on that. Most importantly, we have an economic plan for Queensland. Those opposite have no plan to boost trade. They have no plan to support those who live and work in our regional mining areas. They have no plan for the CSG industry. In fact, certain members from the LNP support a moratorium on the industry. All the LNP stands for is cuts--cuts to front-line services that will support another mining boom; cuts of up to 12,000 jobs from the public sector that supports our thriving resources industry; cuts to programs that help grow our trade footprint across the world; and cuts to investments in renewable energy investment because they are self-admitted climate change deniers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005081"></A>
The government is getting the fundamentals right. We are investing in clean energy alternatives like geothermal power. We already operate Australia’s only geothermal power station at Birdsville and are investing up to $4.3 million to upgrade the existing 80-kilowatt power station. We are investing $15 million in the Queensland Geothermal Energy Centre of Excellence at the University of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005084"></A>
This morning at the Mining 2010 Resources Convention I announced that the government has released a further 3,000 square kilometres of land covering 11 separate areas of Queensland for geothermal exploration. Today I announce that the government is investing $5 million through the Coastal Geothermal Energy Initiative to identify whether areas closer to the Queensland coast have potentially viable geothermal resources. This will be the first program of its kind undertaken in Australia. Analysis of data from test drill holes will enable heat flow to be calculated, with the higher values indicating the possible presence of a potentially viable geothermal resource. Geothermal energy has a bright future in Queensland because it has the potential to produce more baseload energy than any other renewable energy source. We are building a stronger Queensland. The resources industry in this state has a very bright future. It is an industry that we as a government continue to support. </Hansard-Body>

 (Thuringowa--ALP) (Minister for Main Roads) (10.07 am): The roads we are building around Queensland are helping young people carve out a career in road construction. We are building better roads and generating jobs for 30,000 roadworkers this year alone. Our trainees and apprentices are working on some of the biggest road projects across the nation. Take as an example Brisbane’s western corridor--six big projects, $5 billion and 11,000 jobs. Today I can announce another congestion-busting milestone: two new lanes of high-speed road are now open to traffic on the Centenary Highway between Richlands and Carole Park. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005095"></A>
On the Sunshine Coast 80 apprentices and trainees are working on the big Cooroy to Curra upgrade. In the heart of North Queensland, in Townsville 13 trainees and apprentices are hard at work on the Douglas Arterial duplication. The Cardwell Range project team is gearing up to take on more trainees as construction gets underway. On the Gold Coast, civil construction trainees, carpenters and graduate engineers are kick-starting their careers on the Pacific Motorway upgrade.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006431"></A>
Trainees have worked more than 2,000 hours on the Springwood-Daisy Hill section. We have got apprentices, cadets and trainees working in RoadTek offices right around the state. How have we been able to deliver 30,000 jobs for roadworkers? Because we had a plan--a plan to protect jobs. In tough economic times, we knew that the only way to turn the economy around was to build, build, build and protect those jobs. It was a hard decision to make, but we stuck to our guns. It is the right decision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006435"></A>
That is the real difference between Labor and the LNP. The LNP--the so-called party of free enterprise--is a party of hypocrites. Make no mistake: those opposite will reassess every road-building project in this state. They will reassess it. They will slash our roads programs. Talk about highway robbery! Jobs will go as quick as we can say ‘Captain Moonlight’. They have shown their true colours as a party of job blockers and job knockers. </Hansard-Body>

Air, Noise and Hazardous Materials</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. KJ JONES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ashgrove--ALP) (Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability) (10.10 am): Vital industrial development is occurring right across Queensland, as new industries get underway and existing ones continue to expand and contribute to our economy. This development is essential to our state’s prosperity and creating jobs for Queenslanders. But this industrial expansion must be done in an environmentally responsible way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006441"></A>
That is why today I am pleased to release a new state planning policy for air, noise and hazardous materials. This policy is about providing the necessary planning framework to ensure that industrial development is planned for and designed in a way that minimises the impacts on local communities. Up until now, the interface between industry and residential zones has been managed in a piecemeal way by individual councils. For the first time, this policy will provide a state-wide framework which will ensure consistency for councils, industries and local communities. It is about smart and sensible planning.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006442"></A>
Under the new policy, local governments will be required to consider the impacts of air, noise and odour emissions and the use of hazardous materials when they plan for industrial zones or residential areas in their local planning schemes. The policy advises, for example, that hazardous industry must not be developed within 1 kilometres of the nearest residential zone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006443"></A>
Only through planning investigations, such as hazard and risk assessments to identify an appropriate separation distance to suit local conditions, can these distances be altered. Once reflected in local planning schemes, this policy will provide developers with greater certainty about where industrial activities can be located, and will also ensure that residential developments do not encroach on industrial areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006444"></A>
We have worked closely with local government and industry to get this policy right. We released a draft policy last year and considered over 60 public submissions in determining the final framework. We will now be providing training for councils to ensure the application of this policy is properly understood before it takes effect in February next year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006445"></A>
Before this state planning policy there were no clear planning requirements about the compatibility of industrial and residential areas. This new policy delivers a clear and sensible direction to protect the health and wellbeing of Queenslanders, while allowing for continued economic prosperity through responsible industrial development. </Hansard-Body>

First place in the years 5-7 category goes to Madeleine Storace and Sabrene Barbera from St Hilda’s School in the electorate of Southport for their board game that encourages saving. First place in the years 8-9 category goes to Kaitlin McGoldrick, Sophie Davie and Delmae Van Manen from Citipointe Christian College in Carindale for their magazine and DVD that raises awareness about scams and the dangers they pose. First place in the years 10-12 category goes to Lily Pham, Vivien Nguyen, Priyanka Naik and Marilyn Truong from the Queensland Academy of Mathematics, Science and Technology in Toowong. These students created an interactive story where we see three different characters succumb to different scams--one to a mobile phone scam, one to a credit card scam and one whose computer is destroyed by a virus.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1007827"></A>
These reports track the hard work being done in the four Cape York welfare reform communities of Mossman Gorge, Coen, Hope Vale and Aurukun. The commission is very good at building community partnerships and responding to local issues. That is well demonstrated in these reports. For example, when young people were found to be sniffing petrol in Aurukun earlier this year, the Aurukun Shire Council and the local store negotiated with the supplier who had delivered regular unleaded instead of the usual Opal. The supplier did the right thing, replaced the regular with Opal and has made sure a back-up supply of 55,000 litres of Opal is in place in Weipa so this does not happen again. Through the commission the young people and families involved were given support and counselling. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006461"></A>
Regular reporting through the FRC is recognising problems earlier and getting solutions in place. A drop in school attendance in the April-June period, for example, drew a swift response. Changes were made to how rolls are marked to capture children coming in late but also school attendance case managers are now working with parents to make sure their young ones are going to school on time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006462"></A>
Annika is a primary school student who was not going to school. Through a family responsibilities commissioner it came to light that she was embarrassed because she had difficulty reading. The FRC referred Annika to multilit classes and now, with her reading improved, she goes to school happily and, different to the past, does not want her family to take her away from study. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006463"></A>
We know that there is no silver bullet to closing the gap, but developing targeted support and programs through this four-year trial is helping residents and families make the right changes. Residents say that income management is a solution, for example, to long histories of family pressure to hand over cash for items like grog and contraband. Unfortunately, alcohol abuse is a common factor in commission cases. The Family Responsibilities Commission is now in the third of the four-year trial. An independent assessment of the reforms will be conducted in 2011. </Hansard-Body>

 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland) (10.18 am): I table the Feral Deer Management Strategy 2010-2015 consultation draft and invite all Queenslanders to have their say on the plan.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1006468"></A>
Feral deer pose a serious threat to Queensland primary producers as they cause extensive damage to grazing lands each year. They also damage the environment, pose a disease threat to livestock and carry parasites and ticks. Deer are also a danger to people, causing traffic accidents in built-up areas. Feral deer are a state-wide problem, with an estimated 30,000 deer living in 20 populations across Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006470"></A>
Hot-spot areas include the western suburbs of Brisbane--and I know that the member for Mount Ommaney has raised this issue with me previously--the Sunshine Coast hinterland, the Southern Downs area, the Charters Towers area and the Barcaldine and Isaac regional council areas. They are a legacy of Queen Victoria.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006472"></A>
The idea of this strategy is to, firstly, make people aware of the feral deer and then work together to plan the best management options dealing with this issue. There are a range of options including shooting, trapping and fencing feral deer. The key is for all affected groups to work in a coordinated way, with a strong focus on landholder and community coordination. The draft strategy was developed with extensive stakeholder consultation including local government representatives, the LGAQ, conservation groups, hunting organisations and natural resource management groups. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006476"></A>
Our continuing aim is to protect Queensland’s sensitive environment and lucrative livestock industries while still allowing industries which profit from feral deer to continue to do so. This is the first deer strategy for Queensland and is a significant step forward in addressing the problems for landholders and primary producers. I encourage all interested parties to provide feedback on the strategy before 31 December. </Hansard-Body>

Cleveland Ambulance Station, Fire; Drug Driving</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (10.20 am): Members would be aware that earlier this morning incidents at Cleveland resulted in the destruction by fire of the Cleveland Ambulance Station and three ambulance vehicles. Thankfully there are no reports of injuries. I wish to thank the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service, police and local ambulance officers for the professional way in which they responded to these incidents and also the local member for his interest and support. The acting ambulance commissioner advises me that alternative service delivery arrangements are now in place to ensure continuity of ambulance services in the region.</Hansard-Body>

Driving under the influence of illicit drugs can seriously impair a driver’s judgement. During 2009 drugs and alcohol were a contributing factor in 102 deaths on Queensland roads or 30.8 per cent of the state’s road toll for that year. That is why in December 2007 the Labor government introduced roadside drug testing to detect motorists driving under the influence of drugs, thus endangering their life and the lives of other road users. I can report to the House this morning that in the past few weeks the Queensland Police Service’s drug-driving enforcement program has achieved two milestones--first, undertaking the 40,000th roadside drug test and, secondly, the 800th positive drug test. Roadside drug testing is undertaken in every police region across the state and tests are made for cannabis, methamphetamine and ecstasy by analysis of a saliva sample through targeted testing. Cannabis is the drug most often detected, followed by methamphetamine and ecstasy. A first offence carries a penalty of up to $1,400 and a disqualification period of nine months.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007992"></A>
Of concern, but at the same time being an indication of effective and targeted policing, is that the average rate of detection across the state is increasing. In 2008 the rate of positive detections was one in every 51 tests conducted, in 2009 the rate was one in every 49 tests and to date in 2010 the rate is one in every 47 tests. One factor, as I have indicated, in this increased rate is improved targeting of suspected drug drivers by police. The number of targeted tests undertaken also continues to rise. In 2008 just over 11,000 tests were undertaken state-wide while so far this year around 16,000 tests have already been conducted. Far too many Queenslanders are getting behind the wheel while under the influence of illegal substances. The message is clear: if you drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol there is now a greater chance that you will be caught and face the consequences. Police will continue to be vigilant to the dangers of drug driving and will continue to focus their efforts on catching those people engaged in this dangerous practice. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. SJ HINCHLIFFE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Infrastructure and Planning) (10.23 am): The Bligh government is planning for Queensland’s future. We are doing so by working with local governments to progress structure plans to provide additional housing in the face of growth. In September the Gold Coast City Council formally adopted the Coomera structure plan after successfully working with the state government, the community and stakeholders to plan for the region. This means that construction on new homes for the Gold Coast could begin in coming months. Similar processes are underway for Mount Peter south of Cairns and Maroochydore and Palmview on the Sunshine Coast. On 12 October I conditionally approved the Sunshine Coast Regional Council’s draft structure plan for Palmview which has the potential to deliver 8,000 much needed dwellings. Housing affordability is a real issue in the area. Bankwest data released in July indicated that Sunshine Coast homes were the most expensive in the state and the council’s own Sunshine Coast Affordable Living Strategy 2010-2020 has indicated that the region is in crisis. Planning for the future will ensure that people born on the coast and key workers like nurses and teachers can afford to live there.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008009"></A>
Good planning also safeguards sites unsuitable for development. That is why I have asked the council to rethink the draft public transport corridors included in its draft Palmview structure plan. My conditional approval included the redesign of the east-west Greenlink public transport corridor to avoid the Birtinya Wetlands, a sensitive ecosystem home to endangered species the Wallum rocket frog and the Wallum froglet. I have also asked that the council better consider the 1,600 public submissions on the draft route of the north-south Greenlink public transport corridor. I note the Sunshine Coast Regional Council yesterday resolved to expedite resolution of these issues, and I congratulate it on its prompt response. The final Palmview structure plan will include public transport corridors in suitable locations and provide a significant contribution towards addressing the housing shortage and low levels of housing affordability on the Sunshine Coast. The Bligh government is planning for tomorrow’s Queensland by boosting housing affordability and supporting construction jobs. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. PG REEVES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mansfield--ALP) (Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport) (10.25 am): The Bligh government is committed to delivering services to Queenslanders who need them most. The Bligh government is providing $52.72 million in funding over the next three years to 23 non-government organisations to provide assistance to these children and young people. Not only will this funding provide services but it will also sustain jobs for Queenslanders--more than 150 full-time equivalent jobs. That is the difference between this side of the House and the conservatives. We are for jobs; they are for cuts. This funding will assist NGOs to continue to provide support and services including recruiting and supporting foster and kinship-carers, residential facilities which provide safe places for children who cannot live safely at home, and enhanced family intervention services which provide practical support to families to prevent them from requiring ongoing intervention.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008026"></A>
We invest more than half our budget with our external partners--$374 million--to improve the lives of children and young people. That is what we do to help the people of Queensland who need it most. The conservative blueprint is out there for all to see in the UK--slash, slash and slash and a generation of workers dumped, half a million of them! We are about jobs. In 2010-11 the Department of Communities will also fund almost 3,000 jobs through grant allocations to its community partners working in the child safety arena. We had a plan to protect and create jobs, and we are delivering on that plan. Those opposite have a plan to cut, and if we give them a chance you watch the people suffer! What do we hear from the opposition about improved employment opportunities? Absolutely nothing! It has no policies on creating jobs, just as it has no policies on child safety. We are still waiting for anything of substance on child safety from the LNP. </Hansard-Body>

Cape York and Torres Strait, Foster Carers</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009626"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.30 am): My first question without notice is to the Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport. I refer to the opposition’s right to information request regarding child safety statistics. Given that it has been six years since Labor proclaimed that it wanted an early state election to protect children, will the minister explain why in Cape York and the Torres Strait the ratio of children to approved foster carers is getting worse? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009628"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. It is interesting that the opposition talks about statistics when it comes to child safety. When the opposition was last in office, what did it report? One thing. We on this side of the House report quarterly on 80 different datasets. They are there for the world to see. Annually we report nationally on 150 different datasets. So we on this side of the House are very proud of being open and accountable. Those on the other side of the House had one dataset. Just go and have a look at the annual report for 1997 and see what type of reporting occurred under those on that side of the House. We on this side are quite clear what we do.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009629"></A>
The member opposite is often tricky and misleading when it comes to figures in regard to foster carers. But that is not surprising for them. Obviously, in regard to foster carers, we would like many people to put up their hands, open their hearts and open their homes to those children and young people who are the most vulnerable. We would love to have more and it is up to all of us--both government and community members--to encourage people to become foster carers. We will continue to work with community groups and individuals to encourage them to become foster carers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009630"></A>
In regard to the cape and the gulf, we are very proud of what we have done in regard to safe houses. For the information of those opposite, safe houses have allowed children and young people who need to be removed from their homes to not be removed from their communities so that they can be close to their community. It is not their fault, because they have been abused and neglected, that they have to be removed from that community connection. We will continue to work with those communities to develop more safe houses so that that occurs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009631"></A>
On top of that, for the first time ever we have initiated Indigenous family support services and they are up and running. In fact, I was in Cairns last week when they were getting, for the very first time, a PPP program that is Indigenous specific--the world-renowned PPP program based at UQ. This is about working with Indigenous families so that they do not become part of the child protection system and families stay together. </Hansard-Body>

 My second question without notice is also to the Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport.

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009636"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for his question. The member is referring to an article that was in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 on Friday, if I remember rightly. In regard to that article, that amount includes water in the office for tea and coffee. If I remember rightly, water in the office previously cost--we have now replaced it with the chilled tap, I think they are called--about $80 per time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009637"></A>
In regard to the corporate facilities, as a government we have these facilities in place to host businesses, opposition MPs and the Leader of the Opposition to discuss opportunities for Queensland. That includes community groups. Just last weekend, as the member would know, I had the pleasure of hosting people from charities, people from the media, people from the opposition and people from business in regard to opportunities for Queensland. We have the world’s best stadiums and we are providing opportunities for business, as well as others, to be involved in those world-best stadiums.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009638"></A>
But let us look at the other side of the House. We do not even know whether they still support the Carrara stadium. We have never heard them come out and support the Carrara stadium, which is creating jobs both in construction and ongoing. It will also create tourism benefits right there on the Gold Coast. We will continue to support that and we will continue to meet with stakeholders from charities, communities and businesses. </Hansard-Body>

Queensland Investment Incentives Scheme</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009642"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs SMITH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Premier and Minister for the Arts. As a Gold Coast member I know that investment in projects means jobs for our locals. Can the Premier explain how important schemes like the Queensland Investment Incentives Scheme are in securing jobs and supporting the Queensland economy? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009645"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for her question. Coming from the Gold Coast, the honourable member would know just how critical tourism is to jobs in key locations like the Gold Coast and other regional centres in Queensland. Our government is working through schemes like QIIS to ensure that we are increasing tourism and increasing opportunities in this industry. For example, I am very pleased to advise the House that China Southern Airlines flights from Guangzhou to Brisbane will commence next month. This means that for the first time we will be having direct flights from China to Queensland. We hope that these will be very successful and we will be looking to increase the opportunities to bring those flights then directly into locations like Cairns and the Gold Coast, which both boast international airports. China Southern Airlines will fly three times a week between Guangzhou and Brisbane, adding 3,600 seats into Queensland every month. I have no doubt that tourism operators on the Gold Coast will be working hard to get their fair share of those people coming south. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009649"></A>
China Southern Airlines is coming here as a direct result of our Queensland Investment Incentives Scheme. It was established to support jobs and to grow a diverse and sustainable economy. We have brought other airlines here as a result of this scheme: Etihad, Emirates, AirAsia X and, of course, this is the scheme that brought Virgin Blue to Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009653"></A>
We now know that this scheme, along with many other government policies and programs, is at some risk should the LNP form government in Queensland. After yesterday, we know that there is a policy over on the other side of the chamber to cut government services and government programs. It is not entirely clear which, of course. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition had what the member for Gympie might call an unpredictable moment, where his political antenna was perhaps not wired as it should be. This is what he told journalists at a press conference yesterday--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1009655"></A>
I tell what you do: you give me something that you want to know if--if I’ll assure that, it’ll still stay there and I’ll give the answer about whether it will or not. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009656"></A>
So we know that under the leadership of John-Paul Langbroek every government policy and every government program is on the chopping block. How do we find out which ones will get the chop? We just ask and he will tell us. So today my challenge to the Leader of the Opposition is to answer just one: will the Queensland Investment Incentives Scheme stay for Queensland? Is that a policy that he will cut and slash or is this--</Hansard-Body>

The way that Queenslanders will find out how their programs will be cut under an LNP government is that there will be a daily press conference and the media will be able to ask, ‘Is it in or is it out?’ That is how we will find out. It will be a daily eking of it out. What a terrific performance we saw last night. Our government has a strategy. It is a clear, strong economic strategy that is delivering jobs for Queenslanders. We will continue it while the chaos and the farce that is the LNP in Queensland continues to disintegrate. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. He would know well, from the schools in his area and from his commitment to education, just how important it is to invest in schools. Investment in schools is an investment in the children of today and the future of our state. Our State Schools of Tomorrow program is an $850 million investment in the transformation of our state school facilities. Over $390 million is being invested in school renewals in round one projects: $120 million in maintenance works, $30 million over three years for employee housing and $90 million over the next two years. Round 2 will see even more money being spent on classroom renewal, focusing on internal renewal of facilities such as classrooms, libraries, computers rooms and science laboratories in more than 300 schools across the state. More than 1,800 general classrooms, libraries and computer and science rooms will benefit from these projects and they will create more than 2,200 jobs right across the regions of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the member for Ipswich. It means, for example, an entirely new high school for the people of Bremer. What we know is that those opposite went to the last election promising to cut this program. Given the revelation yesterday from the Leader of the Opposition that he plans to have a series of media conferences where he will rule in or rule out a government program or a government infrastructure, I think today is an opportunity for him. Will he confirm that the State Schools of Tomorrow program will be in or out? It is a pretty simple question: ‘Will you fund it or will you cut it?’ It is very straightforward. He went to the last election promising to cut QIIS, promising to cut State Schools of Tomorrow. Do you stand by that? Will you continue to cut those programs? I think that we can confidently predict that what we will not see today is a media conference from the Leader of the Opposition. I think what we will see today will be the back door exit. He will be scurrying off to the opposition office and hiding. He will not want a repeat of what we saw yesterday. We do not want two days of an unpredictable moment and we certainly do not want him talking about ruling things in and ruling things out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009724"></A>
What we need is some clear answers from the Leader of the Opposition. What will he cut, what will he keep? Will he announce it on a daily basis? There are two that I have identified today. There are plenty of opportunities. Under Labor, State Schools of Tomorrow will continue. We will continue to invest in infrastructure and new companies. Under those opposite, they cut. </Hansard-Body>

 And that the cost of that benefit which has flowed to multinational coal companies has been at the expense of social services for the people of Queensland. That is something that this Queensland government is doing the hard yards on to end. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009733"></A>
I went into politics, not to make enormous investment decisions about the haulage of grain or iron ore in Western Australia. I went into politics, not to sign off on big investments on the transport of coal in the New South Wales Hunter Valley. I went into politics, not even to sign off on agreements between BHP and Queensland Rail in the Goonyella system. I went into politics to make a difference to public services for Queenslanders. In this job, as part of this government, that is what I do every day. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1009734"></A>
Today the government has announced that it will provide $189 million for a brand-new tilting Sunlander to run between Brisbane and Cairns. That means that there will be a whole new product in Queensland’s tourism industry, offering sleepers on a fast modern train, built in Maryborough, sustaining 800 direct and indirect jobs. That is good for Queenslanders and it is the kind of decision that a responsible Queensland government makes. However, it is not a decision that could have been made if we were not doing the hard yards on economic policy. It is not a decision that the other side of the House could have made, because they do not have an economic strategy. After a year and a half of debate in this place, that remains the fundamental difference between them and us. </Hansard-Body>

 I thank the member for Waterford for his question and for his commitment to this government investing in jobs and investing in the opportunity for young people to get a go and to get a start in life. Our $57 million election commitment to give 3,000 young people a chance through the Green Army is rocketing along. It is just 16 months into the implementation of the program and nearly 2,000 young people have got a go, have got a start in life because of the Green Army. Now we have 102 projects on the books, including projects in the Logan area where currently 13 people are improving the tourist facilities at the Daisy Hill Koala Centre. That is the sort of project that the government is interested in investing in, giving young people a chance.</Hansard-Body>

What would be the fate of the program if it was ever the case that those opposite formed government in Queensland? Finally we know, because the pretence and the charade of the past 18 months is over. Yesterday the hot air balloon popped. When old ‘Mr Courage Under Fire’, the Leader of the Opposition, was put under the grill what happened? He fell apart in a way that was reminiscent of that great effort of the 2009 election campaign when his friend and mentor, the Deputy Leader and former Leader of the Opposition, was asked to explain his cuts and said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011485"></A>
I mean the amounts that are identified, amounts that of course you know we will be, we’ll be looking at. But we’re principally looking at amounts of money which we are going about finding.’ </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011486"></A>
I wonder if those opposite have the same sinking feeling? I wonder if they have a small sense of déjà vu, because of course we all know that he is just a puppet and someone else is pulling the strings. The déjà vu is rolling on. When he spat it, he finally admitted that cuts are on the agenda--deep, swinging cuts. Gleeful tories are never happier than when taking the axe to working men and women. So perversely excited is the Leader of the Opposition about the cuts that he is asking for suggestions. He is asking people to roll up to whether or not things should be cut. We know about the horror show in the UK where 500,000 jobs are on the line and $20 billion has been cut from capital works. This walking zombie of an opposition leader has revealed himself as the grim reaper of Queensland. He wants to go after working people and the jobs of construction workers on projects right around the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011487"></A>
Instead, this government is going to invest in jobs. We are going to invest in the building program. We are going to keep people in work. We are going to make sure the 100,000 people who rely on our program will have a job. The challenge for the opposition leader is not to run away from this place this afternoon and grab the teddy bear from under the desk. It is time to man up, to stand up and, finally, to tell the people of Queensland what is on the chopping block, whose jobs are at risk, what services are at risk and who he is going to take the axe to. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I was quoted, indeed. There is no real news there. It mentions the fact that we have gone through a global financial crisis, cyclones, swine flu and the high Australian dollar, which are all things that we have no control over. If you want figures, the ABS released figures that show that Queensland has increased its international arrivals since 1986 above the national average of 298 per cent. In that same period, New South Wales increased by 217 per cent and Victoria by 389 per cent. We have far exceeded New South Wales and Victoria. Evan Hall, the national policy director of the Tourism and Transport Forum, says he is concerned when ministers get involved in marketing but believes the Queensland government has not done that. He supports ‘where Australia shines’ as a good brand. Certainly, the article did not give one example of any interference whatsoever and no evidence to support the story itself. What do we hear from the LNP? What is your policy? I will tell you what your policy is.</Hansard-Body>

 They went to the last election campaign threatening to cut the QIIS program by $12 million. Without QIIS funding, airlines will not extend their operations to Queensland. Airlines will not come to Queensland and without airlines we will have no tourists whatsoever. That was your policy. What about Carrara stadium? They were against it. They advertised that they were against the Carrara stadium. We all know that they are against tourism. They talk down motor racing. They talked down the very successful motor race held on the weekend. As I have pointed out time and time again, if you go to their website to look at their policy, under the heading ‘How to get Kiwis to come to Queensland’ there is a blank page. </Hansard-Body>

 There we have it. The LNP is simply not interested in tourism. They never have been. The criticism associated with TQ is not valid. In fact, only a matter of weeks ago it was voted the best tourism office in Australia for the third year in a row. Those awards show that Tourism Queensland is acknowledged as a leader in its field and as one of the world’s leading creative tourism organisations. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. The Bligh government’s massive $7.33 billion health infrastructure program is the largest ever undertaken in the nation’s history. It is building and expanding hospitals and health services from the Torres to the Tweed and is securing Queensland jobs. Nearly 200 projects across the state will secure close to 40,000 construction jobs over the life of the project, not to mention the jobs in operating those facilities. Every one of those jobs is potentially under threat under the LNP’s weak, indecisive leadership. The member for Clayfield has said that every one of those projects will be reassessed, but yesterday we saw the lot with the Leader of the Opposition wanting to play a perverse game of 20 questions. It is so good it is worthwhile reading again. He said--</Hansard-Body>

Let us ask him the question: is that still the case? What about the Queensland Children’s Hospital? We know that we have a position on a world-class hospital informed by the best advice and research of an overwhelming number of paediatric clinicians in Queensland. The Leader of the Opposition is too weak to make a commitment. His health spokesperson in the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunshine Coast Daily</Hansard-Italic>
 on 10 July 2009 called for it to be scrapped. Here is another question for the Leader of the Opposition: will the LNP commit to building the new Queensland Children’s Hospital or will it commit to scrapping it? African or European swallow? </Hansard-Body>

We want a leader who will say what they stand up for. We do not want a leader who is there playing BP Pick a Box but does not know whether he wants the money or the box.

She knows that people have been doing it tough, particularly with the impact of the global financial crisis. What did this government, the Bligh government, do in those tough times? We increased concessions and rebates. We increased our spend on housing. In the last budget we introduced a new medical cooling and heating rebate of up to $216 a year--a new rebate in tough times. We are spending more money on concessions and rebates. We are rolling out more social housing than ever before and delivering jobs--more than 3,500 jobs this year alone in building social housing right across the state. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1011572"></A>
I, too, heard what the Leader of the Opposition had to say yesterday, but I am going to do him the liberty of translating it into English, doing a bit of editing like our good Hansard people do. I think what he was trying to say was that he was inviting the public to give him something they want to know and he will give the answer whether it will stay or not. That is the best I could do with that message yesterday, but I think we get what he means. Like me, thousands of Queenslanders want to know what he will do about those concessions. Will he keep the new medical rebate for people who are suffering MS and related conditions? Will he put that on the chopping block or not? People around Queensland want to know. Is he going to keep the unprecedented investment in social housing going? Is he going to keep that social housing investment going? Will he or will he not? Will it be on the chopping block? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011573"></A>
He has form on social housing. Let me tell the House in case members have forgotten. Do members know Skiff Street in Surfers Paradise? I am sure the Gold Coast members do. What did he say about our development on Skiff Street in Surfers Paradise? He had a go at the good, decent public housing tenants of Queensland by saying, ‘Not these people, not here.’ He said that message very plainly. That did not need any translation--‘Not these people, not here.’ So we can assume what will be on that chopping block. When he puts on his butcher’s apron and gets out the knife, what will be on the chopping block? Public housing, along with concessions. </Hansard-Body>

We know what the Western Australian government, which they model themselves on--they think the Western Australia Liberal model is pretty damn good--did. What did the Liberals do there? They cut $17 million straight out of the concessions budget. They have form in WA. Those opposite are modelling themselves on the WA government. The Leader of the Opposition wants to chop and cut; we want to create jobs--3,500 jobs right around this state with public housing alone. </Hansard-Body>

 The Queensland University of Technology is a separate legal entity to the Queensland government. That might be news to the member for Aspley.

 My question is to the Minister for Education and Training. Can the minister please outline to the House how the kindergarten building program, long-day-care subsidy and national curriculum is benefiting Queenslanders? Are there any risks to its continuation? </Hansard-Body>

Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That question gives me the opportunity to assist parents and members of the public of Queensland by getting some clarity from the opposition leader about the future of building programs and education programs in Queensland. We now know that the opposition leader’s secret is out: every program, every subsidy program, every building program is now on the chopping block. We know that every program is at risk because he said yesterday, in a modern version of Bjelke-Petersen language, ‘In relation to what we’re going to do in government, just ask me.’ Well, I am asking, plain and simple. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013845"></A>
The Queensland public and this parliament want to know whether the Leader of the Opposition is going to cut the $321 million building program that is going to build 240 extra kindergartens across Queensland. Has he told the member for Mirani that he is going to lose two kindergartens? Has he told the member for Toowoomba South that he is going to lose one? Has he told the member for Kawana that he is going to lose one? Has the member for Aspley been told that she is going to lose one? There are 2,000 jobs that are going to be cut by members of the Liberal National Party on that side of the House. There will be 900 teachers who will have their jobs cut. </Hansard-Body>

Has the opposition leader told anyone about his cuts? Has he told the Creche and Kindergarten Association? Has he told the child-care association of Queensland? Has he told the Queensland Teachers Union? More importantly, has he had the courage to tell Queensland parents that he is going to cut the educational opportunities for their young children by cutting the building programs and other programs that we are providing for children in Queensland? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>

In that article, it is reported that Stockland representatives, when speaking on housing affordability, criticised the former New South Wales government’s action on planning issues and said in part--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1013863"></A>
Queensland is heading down that route of ‘we’re full’, no more supply, no more planning and letting the local government take control of the agenda--and we’re not going to stand by this time and let it happen.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013865"></A>
Premier, has the state government received any specific request from Stockland or its lobbyist to declare the Caloundra South area an urban development area? Was the advice from the minister’s department to not declare the area an urban development area? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013867"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. This is a very important development not only for the Sunshine Coast area but for South-East Queensland. We have seen further reports this week about a decrease in the affordability of Queensland housing. Affordability is obviously a matter of a number of factors--including mortgage rates, which cannot be affected by a state government--but it also relates directly to the match or mismatch between supply of housing and demand for housing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013869"></A>
We are seeing a growing population, we are seeing increased demand for housing, and what we are seeing is a lessening of supply. Why? Partly because building companies are unable in many cases to get the finance they need to bring developments but, equally, there are a number of developments--including the one referenced by the member for Nicklin--where the company does have the finance but has been unable to get the housing to market because the project has been caught up in endless processes of approvals. Some of those approval processes are with local government agencies but, as I have acknowledged on a number of occasions, some of them are also with state government agencies. It is incumbent, in my view, upon all levels of government to do everything they can to make sure that these projects are not caught up in in-trays gathering dust. If the answer is ‘yes’, then let us get it going and let us get it moving and let us make it happen. If the answer is ‘no’, let us tell the company as soon as possible so that it can get on and make other investment decisions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013873"></A>
This government made a determination as part of our Housing Affordability Strategy in 2007 to set up the Urban Land Development Authority and it had a very specific purpose: to accelerate those projects that could and should be accelerated--and Caloundra South is one of those. Has the developer--in this case, Stockland--talked to the government about the project? Absolutely it has. Of course it has. Has the Sunshine Coast council spoken to the government about the project? Absolutely. Of course it has. There is nothing unusual about that. There is equally nothing unusual about a developer going into the public arena and saying that it wants something approved. That does not guarantee an approval, but in this case there was a very rigorous assessment. Nobody could say that Caloundra South has not been assessed. It has been assessed to within an inch of its life. It is a five-year planning process that has led us to this point to move it on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013876"></A>
Most recent data shows us that the Sunshine Coast has the least affordable housing in Queensland, the second least affordable in Australia and one of the least affordable in the world. I cannot do better than quote the member for Caloundra on this issue. When he supported the development of the ULDA, he said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1013878"></A>
In my opinion, the one thing that we do not want to see is the cost of housing getting beyond the reach of the young people of this nation ... But nowhere is that occurring more so than across the whole of the Sunshine Coast, including Caloundra. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013885"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms JONES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that the Rural Water Use Efficiency Initiative is something that the local member is very committed to, particularly for the farmers and the growers in his region. This program has been in place for several years. I am very pleased to say that under the climate change policy, ClimateQ, this government will invest $196 million over five years towards programs that really do help those on the front line combat the challenges of climate change. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013888"></A>
Through our ClimateQ program, we are providing $4.5 million to key organisations that help cane growers and other industries deal with the impacts of climate change. This is $4.5 million that is going to the front line to help farmers. After 18 months of asking, we finally have an answer in regards to the LNP’s alternative economic policy. I would like to take the quote from the Deputy Premier, who described it like ‘Pick a Box’, because that is exactly what it is.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1013897"></A>
I tell what you do, you give me something that you want to know if--if I’ll assure that, it’ll still stay there and I’ll give the answer about whether it will or not. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013899"></A>
As the Minister for Climate Change, I think that the people of Queensland deserve to know, particularly those in the constituencies they are meant to represent, whether or not the Rural Water Use Efficiency Initiative will continue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013902"></A>
What I also think Queenslanders should know is whether the ClimateSmart Home Service will continue. Over 230,000 Queenslanders have taken advantage of this program. Will that continue or is that on the chopping block? Alternatively, what about mining compliance? We have boosted compliance staff in recent years by over 100. How many extra compliance staff for mining will there be under the opposition?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013903"></A>
I think we need to bring back ‘Baby’ John Burgess and the <Hansard-Italic>

 policy where you spin the wheel and wherever it lands it is in or it is out. That is the economic strategy that those opposite have taken 18 months to develop. Queenslanders deserve to know whether important programs like the Rural Water Use Efficiency Initiative, the ClimateSmart Home Service, and our boost to compliance staff for mining companies are in or out under an LNP government. You can sit there and laugh and interject all you like, but the cat is out of the bag. After 18 months we have a policy which says it is in or it is out based on whether you ask me or not. So I am asking you today and I am asking the LNP to come clean to the people of Queensland and say whether these programs are in or out, or is it just a matter of spin the magic wheel? </Hansard-Body>

Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. Stage 3 of the new Acland Coal mine expansion is covered by mining lease application No. 50232 lodged by the new Acland Coal Pty Ltd on 25 May 2007. It was in May 2007 that this project was declared a project of state significance and therefore overseen by the Coordinator-General and my colleague the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning. It has also been deemed controlled action for the purposes of the federal government’s Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016020"></A>
I am informed that the environmental impact statement for the project has been completed and was released for public comment on 14 November 2009. Submissions on that draft EIS were closed on 3 February 2010. After considering those submissions, the Department of Infrastructure and Planning has asked new Acland Coal to prepare a supplementary EIS. I am informed that, as a result, to date no approvals have been given for the project. I suggest, however, that the honourable member may wish to direct further questions to my colleague the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning, who has direct ministerial responsibility given his role with the Coordinator-General. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016026"></A>
I would also highly recommend that the member access the Department of Infrastructure and Planning’s website, where regular updates on these projects are published. All local members can track where particular projects are at in their particular electorates. I state again that to date I am informed that no approvals have been granted until that supplementary EIS process has been completed. </Hansard-Body>

 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland) (11.31 am), by leave: During question time the member for Condamine sought an answer in relation to the papaya industry. I wish to advise the House that Biosecurity Queensland is continuing to investigate the possibility that papaya seedlings are being transferred to the South-East Queensland quarantine zone and then subsequently further dispatched to North Queensland. Such movements could constitute a regulatory breach, and are being thoroughly investigated by Biosecurity Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Information has been supplied to Biosecurity Queensland in relation to this matter.

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition) (11.32 am): Again today we see a desperate government using the misrepresentation of words to try to come up with alternatives to the fact that it is a toxic, long-term Labor government collapsing before our very eyes. We have union leaders at war with cabinet, cabinet ministers trying to expel union members, ordinary Labor members resigning in disgust, arrogance and conceit from the member for Mount Coot-tha--</Hansard-Body>

 He is looking forward to the next election. The people of Mount Coot-tha are looking forward to it too. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024552"></A>
We have seen example after example of the Labor Party imploding. The Minister for Public Works was extraordinary yesterday. We thank him for his performance. It informed us yet again that the Labor Party is a toxic mix of betrayal, disloyalty and outright treachery. The Treasurer is touted as the next leader of Labor’s shambolic political carcass. The Treasurer who has been the architect of the financial ruin of this state and the fire sale of assets has been anointed as the next leader. The Treasurer who has presided over the biggest increases in the cost of living ever experienced in this state will be promoted to the leadership once the current Premier walks forlornly from the smoking wreck of the Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024553"></A>
The Treasurer or ‘Captain Smug’, as his colleagues refer to him, will apparently take the job that nobody else wants. He will take charge of the Labor Party train wreck despite the objections of the majority of the ordinary membership. Queenslanders know nothing will change when the member for Mount Coot-tha takes over. The taxes and charges will continue to rise, services will continue to fall, Labor will continue to spend more than it earns and continue with its assets fire sale and debt will continue to rise--$85 billion worth soon. No matter who the leader is, it will be business as usual for this toxic, long-term Labor government. Only an LNP government can turn this state around. </Hansard-Body>

Remembrance Day</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034122"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Everton--ALP) (11.34 am): With Gallipoli Barracks based in Enoggera, there are many Defence Force families living throughout the Everton electorate. Remembrance Day, 11 November, is therefore one of the most significant days on the calendar in the Everton electorate. Remembrance Day recognises the end of hostilities on the Western Front in World War I. At 11 am on 11 November 1918 the guns fell silent on the Western Front, ending four years of tragic loss of life. More than 60,000 Australians were killed in World War I. More than 45,000 died on the Western Front in France and Belgium alone. Each year, Remembrance Day gives us an opportunity to remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of our country in World War I and all wars.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024560"></A>
There are a number of important ceremonies that will be held in the Everton electorate on or around that day. These ceremonies begin on 8 November with the Gaythorne RSL staging an essay-writing competition for school students. Students are invited to write about the significance of the poppy. I am looking forward to hearing students’ contributions on this important subject.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024561"></A>
On Remembrance Day itself, Eatons Hill State School will also stage a ceremony. This large school includes within its student body over 100 children of Defence Force families. It has recognised this significant group by forming a partnership with a school in France, which on Remembrance Day sees French schoolchildren in the town of Senlis Le Sec lay wreaths sent by Eatons Hill State School students on the graves of deceased servicemen. Later that morning, Gaythorne RSL will hold a Remembrance Day ceremony in Sid Loder Park at Mitchelton, which I will also attend. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024562"></A>
This year’s ceremonies will bear a special poignancy as we reflect on the deaths of a number of soldiers from the 6th battalion based at Gallipoli Barracks. As we observe a minute’s silence at the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month this year we should all pay tribute to those who have given so much in the service of our country, and the family members who support them. </Hansard-Body>

Queensland Children’s Hospital</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<A ID="pgfId-1024565"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Caloundra--LNP) (11.36 am): On 13 February 2009, AMA Queensland issued a media release in relation to the Queensland Children’s Hospital which stated in part--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024568"></A>
AMA Queensland is committed to ensuring that the decision making and planning underpinning the new hospital is transparent and credible, thus providing the best opportunity for delivering world class services, teaching and research. This will also represent best value for taxpayers, and assist us in retaining and attracting top health professionals for the benefit of patients and their carers. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024569"></A>
The Queensland Children’s Hospital has from its inception been shrouded in mystery--mystery as to why the site was chosen, why close the Royal Children’s Hospital and why the critical link between the Royal Children’s, the Royal Women’s and research on site is being ignored. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024571"></A>
In an article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Medical Journal of Australia</Hansard-Italic>
 published on 16 August, Dr Chris Davis and Dr Harry Smith wrote an article outlining the history of the hospital and made this comment--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024574"></A>
A culture of secrecy, professional protectionism, defensiveness and deference to authority is central to major failures. Preventing future failures depends on culture as much as structural change in health care systems and organisations. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024575"></A>
Nowhere is that statement more applicable than in the history of the development and determination of the placement of the Queensland Children’s Hospital. The history is well known. I have made many statements in this House about the lack of transparency in locating this hospital within the Premier’s electorate and taking apart, in fact dismantling, one of the Southern Hemisphere’s greatest children’s hospitals, the Royal Children’s Hospital. Critically, the Queensland Children’s Hospital will not have direct access to the Queensland Institute of Medical Research and the extensive research capacity that body has. Without doubt the critical research mass is located at the Herston complex and its research crosses the fields of child, adolescent and adult issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024576"></A>
In addition, the government has now announced the upgrade of the Prince Charles Hospital. The concern with the hospital is that it will not have the expertise and paediatric hospital backup required for rapid diagnosis and effective management of many life-threatening emergencies. The determination to close the Royal Children’s Hospital has been opposed by the LNP as a political move. It will consider closely its policy in relation to the Queensland Children’s Hospital but acknowledges contracts have been executed and commitments made that legally cannot be undone. </Hansard-Body>

Policelink</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024580"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr RYAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Morayfield--ALP) (11.38 am): I rise to inform the House about a new and dedicated telephone service for reporting non-urgent policing matters. The new telephone service is called Policelink. It is now operational. This new service is an initiative of this state Labor government. Queenslanders can contact Policelink by calling 131444. Policelink is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to people wanting to report non-urgent policing matters and for general policing inquiries. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024620"></A>
If the matter is not urgent, not life threatening or there is little likelihood that the suspected offenders are still in the area, then Policelink 131444 is one way for you to contact the police. If the matter is an emergency, urgent or life threatening then people should still call 000. In other words, please save 000 for emergencies and think Policelink 131444 for non-urgent policing matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024624"></A>
It is estimated that the Policelink contact centre will handle more than two million calls per year and free up to 260,000 policing hours, which is equivalent to over 130 full-time officers. This means that Queensland’s network of 000 call centres can focus on critical and life-threatening incidents. By centralising the call centre operations for the Queensland Police Service, Policelink 131444 also allows more local police resources to be deployed in our local community. Currently the Queensland Police Service receives approximately 450,000 000 calls a year but only around four per cent of these relate to a time-critical or life-threatening incident. Policelink will reduce pressure on the 000 call centres and allow our hardworking police officers to get on with the job of keeping our communities safe. </Hansard-Body>

Tilt Trains; Go Card</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024633"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms SIMPSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maroochydore--LNP) (11.40 am): I welcome the news about the new tilt train because that is positive for Queensland. I call on the government to go a step further, though, so that the tilt train can actually run at tilt train speeds. The government canned the rail upgrade north of Caboolture that was supposed to take out those steam train speeds where trains can go only about 50 kilometres an hour. The Beerburrum-Landsborough upgrade was due to be completed within two years, but after the election this government canned that. It did not put out a press release, but now that upgrade that would take out these steam train speeds has been canned and is not due in its program for another 10 years. The smart thing to do is ensure that those new tilt trains actually can do tilt train speeds and that Queensland gets a real rail service, not just lip-service from the government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024638"></A>
I want to address another issue. That is, it is 45 business days before the new go card light system is supposed to come into effect when this government wipes out paper tickets for commuters in Queensland. We are still waiting for the new system. Given the fact that earlier this year the government hiked up the price of fares to make it so expensive for paper ticket users--put fares up by 40 per cent over and above the previous fares--we are now worried about what is going to happen when the new system is supposed to roll out in only 45 business days. We do not want to see the same debacle that happened to commuters when they found that they could not even buy a go card in many parts of South-East Queensland if they wanted to use one, and still the government has not recognised the problems in that rollout and the forced crossover to go cards with a hike in the cost of paper tickets. There are only 45 business days to go before this government wipes out the paper ticket in Queensland. That will have an impact, and it is time we saw the detail about how commuters and those less regular users of public transport are going to be helped. Tourism in this state is very important and we need to make sure that tourists are not disadvantaged when it comes to our rail system and public transport.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs ATTWOOD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Ommaney--ALP) (11.42 am): On Sunday, 17 October I joined hundreds of Queenslanders in West End on Brisbane’s south side to take part in the Buddy Walk 2010. The Buddy Walk is part of Down Syndrome Awareness Week and is run by the Down Syndrome Association of Queensland. It is aimed at creating awareness and helping those affected. Buddy Week brings together people with Down syndrome and their invited buddies, which can include anyone from friends to family to teachers, celebrities and co-workers, to promote acceptance and inclusion of people with Down syndrome. The Buddy Walk also plays an important role in helping to raise funds for education, research and advocacy programs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024653"></A>
The Buddy Walk I took part in followed a one-kilometre course between West End Park and Orleigh Park. It was great to see so many families enjoying the walk and taking part in the activities and events which followed. My buddies were 17-year-old Nick and five-year-old Olivia, who taught me a lot that morning about Down syndrome. It was wonderful walking with them and getting to know their parents, Karen and Mike and Sonia and Jason. These families have been actively involved with the association for many years and they provide mentoring, support and advice to new parents of children affected by Down syndrome. The Buddy Walk aims to promote acceptance and inclusion of people with Down syndrome and to raise funds to help establish and develop innovative and effective programs to strengthen the Down syndrome community and help it to influence local and national policy and practice.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024663"></A>
Down syndrome is named after Dr John Langdon Down, who first described the specific features of the syndrome in 1866. A baby with Down syndrome is born approximately one in 700 births, with males and females equally affected. People with Down syndrome and their families face real challenges, but with the right supports they can rise to these challenges. If these children get appropriate early intervention and support, they can attend mainstream classes at school and acquire the skills they need to help them get jobs. This is a government that is committed to giving people with a disability the best start in life. That is why we are investing in early intervention services for children with disability right across the state. There is no better example of this than our Autism Early Intervention Initiative, which is giving Queensland kids right across the state the best start in life.</Hansard-Body>

North Stradbroke Island</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr ELMES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Noosa--LNP) (11.44 am): I rise this morning to add further weight to the lack of accountability and financial mismanagement by this tired Labor government. On 15 September I asked the Premier a question on notice following the delivery into my letterbox in Noosa of a glossy brochure, together with a letter signed by the Premier, concerning the future of North Stradbroke Island. No doubt the Premier will say that this letter and brochure is an information piece and cite that as the reason for the distribution. If government plans on the future of the island were being sent to the 2,500 island residents and perhaps the rest of Redland City I would probably have to agree. However, the 1,071,000 brochures, costing nearly $145,000 to produce, also went to residents in the areas of Brisbane City Council, the Gold Coast, Moreton Bay, Ipswich, Sunshine Coast and Logan. In addition, the government spent nearly $99,000 distributing the brochure throughout those local authority areas I have just mentioned.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024673"></A>
The future of North Stradbroke Island is far from settled. The debate is far from over. This is blatant political advertising, pure and simple. It is not about North Stradbroke Island. It is not about the residents of North Stradbroke Island and the fears that they hold for the future of their community. This is $244,000 worth of pre-election advertising directed at green preferences. It is a pity the government did not use some of the money to inform local residents about the future of their jobs, the future of the school and local businesses, and the frequency of ferry services. The rest of South-East Queensland would have been pleased to find out about the rapid decline in government spending on the environment and Labor’s inability to even manage its national parks. Heaven help North Stradbroke Island if the management practices on Fraser Island and other national parks are ever repeated on North Straddie! </Hansard-Body>

Ms O’NEILL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kallangur--ALP) (11.46 am): More Queensland children are getting a flying start to learning and life thanks to the Queensland government’s Kindergarten Funding Scheme, which helps long-day-care services deliver kindergarten programs. These services include community kindergartens, kindergartens operated by non-state schools and long-day-care services that provide an approved kindergarten program. This scheme is an important component of the Queensland government’s plan to provide all children with access to high-quality early education in their early years, with a further 201 long-day-care services receiving up to $6.5 million over three years to provide quality early education programs delivered by a qualified teacher. In Queensland around 29,000 children attended long day care in 2009 but only about seven per cent of children accessed an education program delivered by a qualified teacher. Under the Queensland Kindergarten Funding Scheme, each child participating in a kindergarten program is entitled to participate in one government funded 15-hour program of kindergarten each week.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024681"></A>
Two long-day-care centres in my electorate, Lead Childcare Willow Centre 1 in Burpengary and Tadpoles Early Learning Centre 2 in Narangba, are participating and I was proud to present their certificates. It was a pleasure to visit these centres and the directors, Kerry and Glenda respectively, proudly showed me around and introduced me to the staff and children. The children were welcoming and obviously happy in their environment. The dedication of the staff was transparent, and I congratulate them for the great job they do. I was treated to some songs and shown several good games. I was impressed by the number of great activities both underway and planned. The children learn at their own pace, are encouraged to participate and have respectful friendships. Congratulations to two great child-care organisations. I know that others in my electorate have applied to take part--North Pine Christian College Childcare and Early Learning Centre, Kallangur Community Early Childcare and Willows Childcare Centre 2--and I look forward to presenting their certificates and to the benefits for families in Kallangur. </Hansard-Body>

Personal Assistant Lighting System</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<A ID="pgfId-1024724"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs PRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nanango--Ind) (11.48 am): I rise to speak about the PAL system--that is, Personal Assistant Lighting System--which has been developed by the SES in the Burnett. The team that worked on this comes under the Barambah State Emergency Service comprised of the SES groups from Murgon, Wondai and Proston. They saw the need for a better and safer lighting system at a recent exercise.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024730"></A>
Recently, I attended the grand launch of this system, as did a few other people. I must say that I was quite disappointed that the minister did not actually get to see the lighting system. It is a brilliant system. Now that we have this system, I am hoping that it will be one that the government adopts, because it makes no sound--it runs on batteries--there is no danger from carting fuel and it is very light and portable. I can lift one unit myself and, believe me, I am not that strong. It is a brilliant system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024731"></A>
I can see in the future that, if the government does not pick up this lighting system--now that it exists--there is an opportunity for any SES worker, any police officer, or anybody who does anything for the government to sue the government because there are no cords, there is no danger from hot lights and there is no danger from fuel with this lighting system. The dangers that exist now for our people who do voluntary work with the State Emergency Services will be eliminated by this system. The government needs to adopt this kind of new technology to protect its workers. It makes the environment safe for our rescuers, our police officers et cetera. So I would advise the government and the minister to look very seriously at this new lighting system. </Hansard-Body>

Beenleigh Courthouse, Volunteers</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr MOORHEAD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Waterford--ALP) (11.50 am): While many might say that the wheels of justice turn slowly, my electorate is very lucky to have some great volunteers who make justice that little bit easier and who make those wheels of justice move that much quicker. On 13 September the Attorney-General, Cameron Dick, and I visited the Southern Districts courthouse at Beenleigh to say thank you to the justices of the peace, the court support volunteers and the hardworking staff of the court registry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024737"></A>
I want to make a special mention of the Catholic Prison Ministry and the court support volunteers who make the courthouse work so much easier. I was very pleased to see that these essential volunteers were recognised with certificates from the Attorney-General presented at my local courthouse. The Catholic Prison Ministry provides a supportive ear and some wise counsel to people who are being brought before the court. Some of those people find themselves at the lowest points in their lives and sometimes this support is enough to let them rebuild their lives for the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024738"></A>
The Attorney-General and I also had the great opportunity to recognise one of our local saints, June Gale, the Beenleigh court support group volunteer coordinator. In 1985 June was visiting a family member in prison and her Catholic Prison Ministry was starting a court support group at Beenleigh. Since 1987, June has been coordinating the court support volunteers. These volunteers start at 8.15 am each morning, get their file together and then greet people who come to the courthouse. If people are there on traffic matters, June and her team advises them to see the duty lawyer. If they need forms, June tells them whether they need to talk to the prosecutor, the duty lawyer, the JPs or the registry. People who come for domestic violence matters are sent to Caroline Fitzpatrick and the great team who work under the domestic violence assistance program. June runs a very tight ship with a team of willing volunteers working day in, day out. These volunteers take everyone who comes to the door, no matter the reason, and treats them with respect and dignity. June has told me what a difference volunteering has made to her life. After raising six children, the court support volunteer program has given her an opportunity to improve her self-esteem with people saying a simple, ‘Thank you, June’ on their way out of the court. June and the team make justice a reality for people and make our courts a little more welcoming for those who are seeking a fair go. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr MALONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mirani--LNP) (11.52 am): The Bligh government’s cost cutting has reached new lows, with the state’s Rural Fire Service now being downgraded to using soccer mums’ SUVs rather than genuine, robust four-wheel drives. Rural firefighters deserve better and the move could potentially put lives at risk.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024746"></A>
Rural firefighters do not operate on suburban streets or in shopping centre car parks. They need genuine four-wheel drives--a full chassis that can be fitted with long-range fuel tanks, heavy-duty suspension and bullbars that can operate successfully when fighting fires in difficult terrain. Rural firefighters do an outstanding job, protecting more than 90 per cent of Queensland’s landscape. But the Bligh government and the minister are so far out of touch with the reality of what happens on the ground that they are supplying equipment that is totally unsuitable for the rigours of dealing with major wildfires in tough country. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024747"></A>
The soccer mums’ SUVs being supplied are not fair dinkum four-wheel drives. They do not have the carrying capacity to provide officers with a platform to get them to distant fires and to carry the water, fuel, food and bedding that is necessary to be on station for a week or longer in the instance of a major wildfire. This is just an example of how this long-term Labor government does not have a clue. </Hansard-Body>

Crime Prevention Month</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024751"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms FARMER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bulimba--ALP) (11.54 am): This month is Crime Prevention Month and it is a good time to get the message out about what we are all able to do in our own right to protect ourselves from crime. I congratulate the minister for the excellent support that he and his department provide to facilitate this message. I know how impressed locals are with the new number for non-urgent police matters, the microdot system for identifying personal possessions and the rollout of events to raise awareness of the many ways in which people can protect themselves.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024753"></A>
In my area, this raising of awareness has included the drug and alcohol awareness sessions, the PCYC events for young people and the huge static information display at Morningside Railway Station. There is also Adopt-a-Cop, Task Force Argos, the schoolies program, the cybersafety awareness program--now with Dr Michael Carr-Gregg at the helm--and many other programs. This month has also been an opportunity to congratulate groups such as Neighbourhood Watch for what they do to promote crime prevention in their own areas. A number of my local Neighbourhood Watches have been operating almost since the inception of the program, like the Camp Hill 8, the Morningside 7 and the Morningside 1. In fact, the member for Chatsworth and I were delighted to help celebrate a very significant anniversary of the Morningside 1 Neighbourhood Watch only recently.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024762"></A>
The impact of these groups is immeasurable. That is due in no small part to the formidable people who are involved. In this context I acknowledge Eileen Mackay, who recently won the South-East Metropolitan Neighbourhood Watch member of the year 2010 award. This sort of grassroots support for crime prevention in conjunction with the outstanding work that is done by our police has led to a remarkable decrease in crime in Queensland over the past 10 years: 21.5 per cent in overall crime, 42.5 per cent in property offences and 18.7 per cent in offences against the person. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024764"></A>
I cannot talk about crime prevention without specifically mentioning the outstanding police who look after everyone in the Bulimba electorate. Under the leadership of Senior Sergeant Barry Bullion and the recently retired Inspector Ray Loader--both from the Morningside Police Station--and Senior Sergeant Darren Smith from the Camp Hill Police Station, my local police officers do exemplary work. I thank them on behalf of all the local residents for their dedication. </Hansard-Body>

 (Hinchinbrook--LNP) (11.56 am): The papaya industry in North and Central Queensland is very concerned about possible breaches of quarantine and the failure of Biosecurity Queensland and the Minister for Primary Industries to take any action to address this issue. On 3 June 2010, Papaya Australia, the peak body for the papaya industry, wrote to the minister regarding the alleged supply of papaya seedlings to Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024773"></A>
The papaya ring spot virus is a serious threat to the industry. To date, it has been restricted to South-East Queensland. In March this year, Papaya Australia was contacted by a nursery that indicated that another nursery in New South Wales was supplying papaya seedlings to Mitre 10 stores in Queensland, including potentially stores outside the papaya ring spot virus quarantine area in South-East Queensland. This presented a serious threat to the industry outside South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034197"></A>
Papaya Australia contacted Biosecurity Queensland and raised these concerns. A letter from Papaya Australia to the minister dated 3 June indicates that BQ advised that it was already aware of the problem. BQ advised that it could do nothing about the problem because the seedlings were coming in from New South Wales. Papaya Australia responded that that was totally unsatisfactory. BQ then had the audacity to question how big a threat an outbreak of papaya ring spot virus would be to the industry outside South-East Queensland. Papaya Australia then asked BQ to make an effort to contact New South Wales authorities to investigate the matter. I table a letter of 3 June from Papaya Australia to the Minister for Primary Industries.</Hansard-Body>

On 10 October 2010, Papaya Australia once again wrote to the minister about this issue, because more than four months after it had first advised the minister of this alleged breach of quarantine it had not received a response concerning this serious issue. This correspondence alleges a number of shocking failures on the part of BQ that need to be fully investigated immediately. I table the letter of 10 October from Papaya Australia to the Minister for Primary Industries. Papaya Australia is still waiting for a response.</Hansard-Body>

Mr WENDT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich West--ALP) (11.58 am): Since the last sitting of this parliament I have had the opportunity, along with a number of other members, including the members for Morayfield, Albert, Redcliffe and Bulimba, as well as the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning, Stirling Hinchliffe, and Mr Speaker himself, to visit and inspect the construction of the new $350 million Wyaralong Dam project, which is currently being constructed between Boonah and Beaudesert. I can report that this dam is now more than 50 per cent complete and has generated 685 jobs, which is well in excess of the original jobs target of 420. Best of all, I am told that 50 per cent of these jobs have, in fact, been sourced locally. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024781"></A>
As members can imagine, many of these workers were previously unemployed Queenslanders who are now taking part in the government’s $57 million Green Army initiative. Through this program, I can confirm, after meeting with many of the workers on the day, that they had learned practical trail building and environmental mitigation work skills while on the job. These Green Army recruits have been engaged in a variety of projects, including identifying and removing weeds, collecting seeds, building trails, protecting habitat and, of course, planting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024823"></A>
In addition, they have developed a range of new practical skills such as basic construction, landscaping and plant identification, all backed up by onsite accredited training delivered by, you guessed it, Bremer TAFE. I am also advised that 92 per cent of the participants involved in the project have, in fact, graduated and found work in the building and environment industries, and almost half of these have been Indigenous graduates. Wyaralong Dam is without doubt providing enormous opportunities for locals to break the unemployment cycle and help the environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027987"></A>
Before I finish, I think that it is important that members of the House be aware that the Wyaralong Dam, in conjunction with the nearby Cedar Grove Weir, will in fact supply water for 300,000 people. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the CEO of Queensland Water Infrastructure who gave us a tour on the day, Frankie Carroll, and his staff who are doing an absolutely fabulous job. </Hansard-Body>

(12.00 pm): Imagine a large educational site in suburban Brisbane comprising 45 hectares that was gifted for educational use and leased by the state government as a university campus. It has education buildings, playing fields, green space, even a child care centre. Would not members think that this would be a golden opportunity for a a great education site: for a college, a northside SkillsTech or a university campus? In fact, it is irreplaceable. I ask members to look for an education site of 100 acres somewhere in suburban Brisbane. Somebody in the future will deeply rue the appalling decision of this government to walk away from the use of this site for education. What is it going to do with it? Spend $50 million to house 1,000 bureaucrats relocated from Brisbane in 13,000 square metres. The government announcement does not say where they are evacuating 13,000 square metres in the Brisbane CBD or when that lease would expire. That $50 million is $50,000 for each bureaucrat being housed out there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024829"></A>
The member for Aspley, who has been deeply concerned about the future of this valuable site, held a community meeting last Sunday at 2 pm. There was a big turnout of people from the local community. There is no doubt about what the Aspley community want for this site. They want to save their green space. They want us to plan for the educational needs of the future and they want this to be used, as it was originally given, for education purposes. QUT Vice Chancellor Professor Coaldrake said that this site might one day be a viable university campus. Well, we will never know because it is to be carved up as office space for bureaucrats and housing on what was green space and ovals. This government has given up on education. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southern Downs--LNP) (Deputy Leader of the Opposition)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(12.03 pm): This bill is an admission that the basis on which the government has provided its law and order agenda has failed the people of Queensland appallingly. We have to ask ourselves: will these amendments to the Penalties and Sentences Act actually achieve the objectives that are claimed? On the one hand the amendments claim to set out a more prescriptive framework in which the courts must operate when it comes to sentencing particular types of offenders. Yet on the other hand they claim to maintain the court’s discretion. It is absolutely impossible to have it both ways. They cannot say that there will be judicial discretion and then say that there will be a more prescriptive framework. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024837"></A>
Indeed, it is time that this government stops hoodwinking the people of Queensland and concedes that it is coming more and more to the position that is advocated by the LNP that a greater prescriptive framework is required to meet community expectations. With this bill the government is intending to be more prescriptive whilst giving a get-out-of-jail-free card. It cannot do that to the people of Queensland because they want certainty and clarity when it comes to sentencing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024838"></A>
Under the existing sentencing framework laid down in the act, the courts are already directed to take into account the criminal history of an offender when it comes to deciding an appropriate sentence for the offence or offences for which they are being sentenced. Under existing sentencing principles, the court is already provided guidance to disregard the principle of imprisonment as a last resort when deciding a sentence for an offence of a sexual nature against a child under the age of 16. The Court of Appeal already sets guideline judgements for all other courts to follow when it comes to the sentencing of offenders for like offences. But we know for a fact that this does not happen all the time and we are left with inconsistent and sometimes questionable sentencing outcomes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024839"></A>
I return to my original question and ask: how will these amendments we are being asked to support today make any difference to the way that our courts sentence offenders? We know for a fact that in the past three years only 120 serious violent offender declarations have been made against offenders. This is less than one per cent of all offenders. Even the Court of Appeal has overturned a number of SVO declarations that have been made. Most notably was that in the case of Riseley where the offender was found guilty of manslaughter of a small baby by way of a brutal assault. Despite the sentencing court making a serious violent offence declaration, the Court of Appeal overturned the decision. That no doubt had significant influence on at least one amendment being proposed here today. The amendment makes no compulsion on any court to actually make the declaration. So whilst it would be supported by the parliament, in practice there will be no doubt that the court will continue to use its discretion to avoid making such declarations against those who kill children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024841"></A>
I think it is very important to concentrate on that point for a little while. Whilst I think we all believe that it is up to this parliament to actually set down the laws and guidelines that the courts follow, we understand that the role of the sentencing court is in the interpretation of those laws and guidelines, and that is as it should be. If we are dissatisfied with consistency or the way those sentences are handed down based on community concern and expectation then it should be the role of this parliament to pass laws or bring in amendments that provide direction for our sentencing courts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024842"></A>
As I have said in the past, since the introduction of the Criminal Code in Queensland in the late 1800s--which as I understand was one of the first, if not the first, Criminal Codes developed in the world--we have sought to direct and limit the discretion of our sentencing judges when it comes to the issue of dealing with offenders. Prior to that time we had a common law system which was based on precedent. There was nothing wrong with this parliament moving to codify in the Criminal Code in Queensland what was common law insofar as the sanction of criminal activity and to prescribe certain offences and the way they should be dealt with in line with community expectation as expressed by members elected to this parliament from time to time and those who provide expert advice to those who draft the law of the land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024843"></A>
It is complete and absolute humbug to say that courts should always have absolute judicial discretion. If courts were to have absolute judicial discretion then indeed we would allow them to exact the capital punishment option or the corporal punishment option. We would allow them complete and absolute discretion when it came to maximum penalties which could be imposed for a whole range of what we have defined as criminal offences in Queensland. But we do not because this parliament has felt the need over the last 100-odd years to legislate to provide direction to our courts with regard to the sentencing of criminals. Indeed, it lays down those offences for which a person can be charged.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024868"></A>
Let us look at what has happened since the introduction of the serious violent offender category. There is little doubt that our sentencing courts look at that when sentencing an offender. If an offender is sentenced to 10 years or more, automatically they are subject to a serious violent offender declaration which means that they must spend at least 80 per cent of that time in custody. If they have been sentenced to a 10-year term, it means that they must serve at least eight years in custody. However, the court retains the discretion with sentences under 10 years. At the time of the introduction of that provision it was felt that it was necessary to do that. Therefore, we have seen circumstances arise where the sentencing court imposes a serious violent offender declaration, but the Court of Appeal reviews and, from time to time, overturns it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024871"></A>
It is fair to say that sentencing courts are very cognisant of the fact and may be offended by the notion that they do not have the discretion when sentencing a violent offender to a term over 10 years. They take that into consideration when imposing a sentence on a person, cognisant of the fact that if they apply a sentence of more than 10 years that person will be automatically declared a serious violent offender. From any reasonable perusal of recent cases, one would have to conclude that sentencing judges have been cognisant of that fact when sentencing offenders and probably have sentenced those offenders to less than 10 years imprisonment so that they can maintain their discretion over the application for a serious violent offender declaration. No matter what we do, there will be a way that the courts can deal with the matter. The more that is left open and the more that is left to discretion, the less clear becomes the parliament’s intent in terms of its practical application in Queensland’s sentencing courts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024872"></A>
With regard to these amendments, the Attorney and the government are not able to provide guarantees. These amendments will provide no guarantee whatsoever. If looked at on the surface, they may appear to be a step in the right direction, but of course the reality will be seen in their implementation or application. In recent times and not so recent times across Queensland we have seen this government promising a lot when it comes to dealing with offenders, be they adult offenders or juvenile offenders, yet when it comes to the application of the law through the courts they will always find the sneaky little get-of-jail-free cards that are left in place by this Labor government. There is no clearer and better example than juvenile sentencing and the declaration of serious juvenile offenders who can be named. Even the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has said that there may need to be some further amendments in that particular area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024873"></A>
Surely the deliberate actions of an adult that result in the death of a child, such as a fatal assault, must automatically attract a serious violent offender declaration, which is not what this amendment suggests should happen. It is clear that this Labor government is afraid of the word ‘must’ in legislation, unless it guarantees the provision of additional revenue to plug its ever-growing debt. We have seen that in recent times. It is clear that the victims of crime are an afterthought in this government’s agenda, which will continue to see violent offenders back on our streets after short-term stints in prison where they receive little or no rehabilitation while the victim is left with a lifetime of suffering. We need to be very concerned about the issue of rehabilitation in Queensland. In Queensland less than 90 per cent of sex offenders start, let alone complete, a sex offender rehabilitation course. Surely that should be mandatory in those cases. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024874"></A>
During a recent debate in this House I said that the problem with our justice system is that many of the original sentences for violent and repeat offences are letting Queensland down, which is why the parliament is forced to bring in legislation to keep people locked up beyond their original imprisonment terms. A classic example of that--and I think it is necessary to put it on the record of this parliament again--is Mr Robert John Fardon. I think it is fair to say that he was the catalyst for the introduction of the serious dangerous sex offenders declaration in Queensland. Whilst it is true that that bill was not brought in to deal with and did not name a particular individual, any person who has any sense of history in Queensland will understand the outrage at the impending release of that particular person and realise it was his impending release that finally pushed this government to some action. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024876"></A>
Let us look at this person. Robert John Fardon was born on 6 October 1948. He has an extensive criminal history, principally for stealing, disorderly behaviour and weapons offences. Of some relevance to the application that was taken to the court in Queensland was his plea of guilty in 1967 in New South Wales to attempted carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 10 years. On 8 October 1980, this person pleaded guilty to raping a 12-year-old girl, indecently dealing with her and unlawfully wounding her 15-year-old sister. He was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment for the rape and lesser concurrent terms of imprisonment for the other offences. The respondent was released on parole after serving eight years of that sentence. Within 20 days he had committed the offences for which he was sentenced in June 1989. The person was convicted of rape, sodomy and assault occasioning bodily harm on 30 June 1989 at Townsville and sentenced to 14 years imprisonment. In 2003 the Attorney-General applied for an interim detention order in respect of that person, following the introduction in Queensland of the serious violent sexual offender laws. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024877"></A>
It is important to reflect on the fact that in that particular case the person had served all his time in jail. He could be held no longer. I understand and concede that fact. We are talking about a person who was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment and was kept in jail for 14 years. I think the subsequent sentencing decisions by the courts, under this government’s weak laws, would beg the question: how was it that somebody who continued to commit serious offences against people, supposedly whilst being watched under this government’s program, can be given a lesser sentence than he received in 1989? In 2003 the Attorney-General applied to the court for an order pursuant to division 3 of the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act that Robert John Fardon be detained in custody for an indefinite term for controlled care and treatment. The finding was handed down.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024879"></A>
That person was freed again in November 2007. A Brisbane judge ruled that Fardon, age 59, should be released under tighter supervision, despite breaching an earlier order by lending his car to his rapist neighbour and visiting children at a Brisbane Catholic school. That was happening under the Queensland government’s serious sexual prisoner laws. Queensland authorities also did a backflip by informing residents when a sex offender--the person I am talking about--was housed in their street, after the government said that they could not do it. Clearly, they had bungled the release and housing of the offender Fardon. Fardon was released from Brisbane jail, under strict conditions, a day earlier and was taken to what was meant to be an undisclosed location. That resulted in an enormous public outcry and a rethink. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024881"></A>
At that time, the Minister for Police made an extraordinary statement in parliament saying that this person, who everyone knew was a very dangerous recidivist sex offender, would be watched like a hawk. But what happened in the next year? In April 2008, he was charged with the rape of an intellectually handicapped woman and in 2010 Mr Fardon was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, to be released after eight years. The government talks tough about its laws and on the surface one might be prepared to congratulate it for those laws. You might say, ‘It sounds really good that you can keep these people in jail.’ But what happens? They let them out and although they watch them like a hawk, they do it again. They go back before the courts and guess what? A person with a history of serious violent sex offences who reoffends is sentenced to 10 years and may be released after eight years--that is the minimum period he must serve--yet in 1989 that person was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment and served all of that time under the then coalition government’s laws. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024915"></A>
I concede that we did not have the capacity then to keep these people in jail because we did not have the serious sexual prisoner laws in Queensland, but guess what? They are being released into the community now. But guess what? Mr Fardon was supposed to have been watched under the brand-new laws of this government and he was not. He raped an intellectually handicapped girl. I think it is fair to say that under the previous laws, without the Penalties and Sentences Act--which has rewritten case law in Queensland--this person would have been sentenced to much more than 14 years. Possibly he would have been sentenced to life imprisonment--an indefinite sentence indeed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024920"></A>
No-one could explain, particularly the Attorney-General or the former Attorney-General, the logic behind sentencing someone who had been given another chance and another chance and another chance out in the community to a much lesser period of incarceration for the later offence he committed which was of a similar nature to the one he committed in 1989. Again, this government talks tough, but if we look at the reality of the situation in Queensland we see that it is not keeping up with what the government actually says.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024921"></A>
We have a prosecution service in Queensland that is underresourced, understaffed and overloaded with cases that lead to a settle-quick, settle-easy mentality that is not delivering real outcomes for victims. If the Attorney actually talked to prosecutors, as I do, he would understand the lack of morale. He would understand the lack of resources. He would understand the fact that these people are working under an extraordinary case load--twice as great as that in New South Wales--and they are being forced into entering plea bargains and downgrading particular charges in order to assist them to do their job. I think there is no greater example than what we saw with regard to the sentencing of Gabriel Watson some time ago in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024923"></A>
We have judges who are operating in a system that has set limited boundaries or guidelines as to the expectations of the community when it comes to sentencing. We have even had judges freely admitting that they do not even take community standards into account when sentencing offenders in the higher courts in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection. One would imagine that if you had that time over again then that person might have been caught up under this government’s laws. But based on the case of Fardon, it is highly likely that he would have been let out again only to go and do it again. We have seen a classic example of that happening with regard to Fardon. I think it also fair to say that under previous government laws if he did do it again he would not have been sentenced to a lesser period than the penalty he had served prior to his release. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024927"></A>
One thing is clear: not only do sentencing laws surrounding child sex offenders need to be overhauled but the Penalties and Sentences Act needs to be rewritten. Labor’s social experiment in soft sentencing that has hung heavy over this state for 11 years must come to an end. The LNP remains unconvinced that exceptional circumstances exist to keep paedophiles out of jail. Labor’s proposed sentencing laws for serial and violent paedophiles failed to address community expectations that paedophiles should spend time in jail. This is a typical Clayton’s proposal from this long-term Bligh Labor government.</Hansard-Body>

 I am very happy to come to that particular point, because once these laws are implemented I am not sure the Council for Civil Liberties will have too much to be concerned about because there is this exceptional circumstances clause. We have seen in Victoria that, when it comes to the issue of trying to restrict suspended sentences except in the most exceptional circumstances, the courts are always using exceptional circumstances. Whilst the Council for Civil Liberties might have a concern at the moment--as they do and as they have done consistently with regard to any moves towards the reduction of judicial discretion--I think we will find that, by and large, down the track there will be little for them to be concerned about with regard to this government’s laws. </Hansard-Body>

What Queenslanders continually get from Bligh and Labor is tough talk which never really translates into tough action. It is a great pity that the Attorney did not bother to read his own legislation that he brought into this parliament a few months ago--the embarrassment of rushing legislation into this parliament which was about supervising serious sex offenders. He was going to say to the courts in Queensland, ‘No, you can’t impose a period of supervision longer than five years.’ It is pity that he does not read and prepare his own legislation. What did we have then? Oh, my goodness--embarrassment, embarrassment, embarrassment. There was then the need to rush these laws through. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024940"></A>
One year down the track, in September this year, we rushed into this House and legislated for this. We passed the legislation a year after it was so important that it was supposed to come into this place. But guess what? We had a little typo in there--a little, tiny typo. What he meant to say about the supervision was that it was not going to be for a maximum of five years but it was going to be for a minimum of five years. It was not going to be a maximum; it was going to be a minimum. So the legislation took away the potential lifetime of supervision, which existed in the courts in Queensland, and made it a maximum of five years supervision and the Attorney dressed it up in a narrative about community safety. Oh my goodness, he got it wrong. It should have been for a minimum of five years. So let us not hear this humbug from the Attorney about how he is running around genuinely protecting the most vulnerable in our society. </Hansard-Body>

The community expects that paedophiles will be sent to jail to reflect the seriousness of their crimes, but this legislation is cunningly crafted to give this government an easy out. </Hansard-Body>

 An 18-year-old who has a relationship with a 16-year-old should go to jail? Is that what you are saying? Or a 17-year-old having a relationship with a 15-year-old--they should go to jail? Put that on the record. </Hansard-Body>

 There are no exceptional circumstances, I believe, when it comes to paedophiles. But when this Bligh government says, ‘Go directly to jail,’ it means only maybe. Once again, this lazy, arrogant, long-term Labor government tries to hoodwink Queenslanders with weasel words. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1024951"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Why doesn’t the Attorney define that? Why doesn’t he define that in this legislation? We know that this affects a whole range of people in the community. We hear it all the time. I have had parents come to me whose under-age daughter has been in a relationship with somebody who is well over 20 and there has been a child born and no action has been taken against the person in that relationship. So we have a situation where our law enforcement authorities exercise a degree of discretion in pursuing those particular matters. A lot of people have been in that situation. I am going to come to this issue again because this government is about dressing this up and trying to craft it to say that it relates to those who are in a relationship with those particular age differences. But it does not necessarily mean that it stops there. Once you have an exceptional circumstance provision for the court, it actually starts there and goes on from there to other places. My issue is that if this government believes in this then the government will support the LNP’s amendment and will legislate to ensure that that is what it is all about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024987"></A>
Once again, this lazy, arrogant, long-term Labor government tries to hoodwink Queenslanders with weasel words. Under an LNP government, an actual term of imprisonment will mean exactly that and nothing less. I read recently somewhere that ‘sentencing is as much about politics as it is about law or criminology’ and that ‘sentencing has a cathartic as well as a utilitarian function and it is a process that is played out not only in the courts but in the broader arena of public opinion.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024988"></A>
I want to touch on this issue of exceptional circumstances in excluding some sex offenders from being subject to imprisonment. The bill the government has presented seeks to exclude certain scenarios, which are not properly defined, which opens the way for the same old sentencing that we have seen to date--a great big get-out-of-jail-free card, as I have mentioned. The Victorian Sentencing Advisory Council reviewed the use of suspended sentencing and found that changes to the law which imposed an exceptional circumstance rule on the use of suspended sentences for serious crimes meant that sentencing judges were applying a broader approach to the definition of exceptional circumstances. This is what the Sentencing Advisory Council found in Victoria, and by the end of next week we will probably have one of those in Queensland: that once it was put in, as the government sought to tighten up the use of suspended sentences and by saying it can only happen in exceptional circumstances, the courts more broadly interpreted what an exceptional circumstance would be. Overall, the attempts to limit the use of suspended sentences in that case to exceptional circumstances had failed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024989"></A>
I have no doubt that these laws here will fail in the same way. That is why during the consideration in detail stage I will be moving two amendments to the legislation that will remove the reference to exceptional circumstances for adult sex offenders and only allow it for juvenile sex offenders. It has been hinted that the age of the offender should in some way be seen as an exceptional circumstance to avoid jail. The LNP’s amendment will make sure that that is where the discretion will stop--juvenile offenders only, and then only in exceptional circumstances, not ‘an exceptional circumstances for everyone card’ as Labor is proposing. </Hansard-Body>

I want to refer to comments in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 in 2008 by Queensland University of Technology criminologist Tricia Fox, who said in response to a youth rapist attacking a victim in a public place that this attack reflected a worrying jump in the number of juveniles involved in aggressive sex crimes. The article stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Dr Fox said children were becoming sexually active earlier than ever before.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

“In our society today younger people have significant access to sexual information,” she said.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024995"></A>
“(In previous years) we’ve got information and statistics that the X Generation engage in sexual activity around an average age of 17.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

“Now we deal with statistics where children are engaging in sexual activity or sexual intercourse around 13 years of age.”</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1024997"></A>
Of course, that is just a broad figure and there will always be exceptions to it, but I think she is saying that generally there is a downward trend in the average age at which children become involved in sexual activity. The article continued--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024999"></A>
Dr Fox said the brazenness of the attack had the hallmarks of Generation Y, whom she said had an “I’m untouchable, I’m invincible” attitude.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

In conclusion on this point, I refer to an article from Bravehearts’ <Hansard-Italic>
Break the Silence</Hansard-Italic>
 magazine in which Carol Ronken, a research and policy development manager, said that the 1997 Wood royal commission ‘concluded that all sex offenders constitute a real risk to children and that this risk is lifelong’. I urge the Attorney to not be fooled by some soft left thinkers who would have us believe that youth sex offenders are in some way not as dangerous. I think we have seen commentary and examples in recent times of how serious violent youth offenders can be just as violent as any adult offender. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025004"></A>
In regard to the Sentencing Advisory Council, this bill amends the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992 to introduce a Sentencing Advisory Council as part of an approach to engage and inform the community on issues of criminal sentencing. In Queensland, we are facing a crisis of confidence in criminal sentencing laws under this long-term and toxic Labor government. It is a widely held community view that sentencing laws are out of touch with popular opinion and lack consistency and accountability. When the Premier made this great Clayton’s announcement on Monday, she even said that the community had issues and concerns with sentences not reflecting community expectations, but the one thing she failed to do was look in the mirror to find the reason for that. That is where the answer is and that is where the problem is--the fact that this long-term Labor government talks about issues and does not really fix them. I think they are shallow words from this government indeed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025007"></A>
Evidence shows that to involve the public in sentencing policy there needs to be a well-constructed approach. This bill’s establishment of a Sentencing Advisory Council promises to integrate the expertise and public input necessary to provide effective public engagement and input into the criminal sentencing process. The Sentencing Advisory Council that will be established under this bill has defined objectives. These functions include: writing to the Court of Appeal on its views in relation to sentencing guidelines and principles; providing statistical information on sentencing to members of the judiciary and other interested persons; conducting research and gauging public opinion on sentencing matters; and consulting with government departments, other interested persons and bodies as well as the general public. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025008"></A>
The sentences and penalties imposed on convicted criminals have been a cause of concern for the community for some time. Several cases have caused public outrage over the leniency and inappropriateness of the sentence imposed. Within the guidelines outlined in the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992, the sentencing decisions made by the judiciary are supposed to reflect the community’s expectation of an appropriate punishment for the crimes committed. The wider community is becoming increasingly exasperated by sentences that do seem to be too soft for the crimes committed. The community is sick and tired of being treated with contempt when it comes to sentencing laws, and this bill is an important step forward in restoring community confidence and trust in the operation of our state’s sentencing laws. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025010"></A>
The bill’s stated intent is to create a body that will engage, consult and report community opinion and views on the operation of sentencing laws. Not for one moment does this government deserve any praise whatsoever for bringing the principle of a Sentencing Advisory Council to this parliament. If it was not for its overt, partisan, political approach to dealing with this issue, we would have had a Sentencing Advisory Council along these lines introduced into this parliament five years ago. This government actually voted down a bill to establish a Sentencing Advisory Council which was introduced into this place by the Liberal National Party. If government members had some particular concerns about the make-up of that legislation, they could have dealt with that by way of amendments but, no, they voted against the principle. They voted against the whole concept. They thought it was a silly idea. They did not want to have anything to do with it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025011"></A>
Once again, as is typical of this government, they voted it down, churlishly played politics, talked about bipartisanship--which they expect from the opposition and receive 80 per cent of the time, but very rarely offer in reverse--and then left enough time to lapse before they brought it back as their own legislation. Now they want to pass it through this parliament and they expect adulation from the community at large for something which they have denied them for the previous five years. No-one deserves credit for doing that sort of thing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025012"></A>
When we first heard the announcement from the Attorney and the Premier, it sounded as though we were going to have minimum standard non-parole periods, which basically was minimum sentences dressed up in that particular way. So we were going to have it and it all sounded a bit okay. The government was slowly getting around to it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025013"></A>
Then we started to read the fine print. Queenslanders should know the reality--that the government is going to give the job to the Sentencing Advisory Council to actually look at coming up with some minimum standard non-parole periods for certain offences which it can actually recommend and which may then actually be implemented. So we are going to give this concept to what in effect is a body which has not been established yet. It is going to bring in what are in effect minimum mandatory sentences in Queensland with a ‘get out of jail’ clause. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025014"></A>
One would think that if you were serious about having a Sentencing Advisory Council--and the government has said it truly believes this is the best research, that it is taking all the hysteria out of it and that it is making sure there is an appropriate amount of judicial discretion--you would simply provide the Sentencing Advisory Council with a reference to look at this issue and then let it go away and collect all the data, because it may actually look at this and think it is a stupid idea, it is an insane idea. After looking at it, the council may actually conclude that it can find no evidence that this approach actually works, that it puts more people in jail and that it does not cut down the recidivism rate--all of those sorts of things.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028099"></A>
This government wants a Sentencing Advisory Council, but the Sentencing Advisory Council that it wants is going to give it this sort of rider so they go away and do this. If it is true to form, then maybe it should have let it go away and research it to find out if it was the best thing to start with. But it did not take that approach, either. I think it will be very interesting to see the make-up of the Sentencing Advisory Council, the appointments to the Sentencing Advisory Council, whether it is going to have any teeth, whether the government is going to take notice of the Sentencing Advisory Council, and how much it will affect the public concern and the public thirst that exists in many cases for information surrounding these very difficult, controversial issues which strike at the heart of public safety in Queensland. I think that will be a very important role for the Sentencing Advisory Council in Queensland and one which the LNP will be watching with a great degree of interest.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028109"></A>
I turn to some figures which were released in answer to question on notice No. 912 of 2010 with regard to sentences for serious sex offences in Queensland. Those offences covered rape, indecent treatment of a child under 16, possessing child exploitation material and using the internet to procure a child under 16. In the period 2007-10 there were 1,752 sentences. There were 677, or 38.6 per cent, who served no jail time; 278, or 15.8 per cent, who served less than one year in prison; 501, or 28.6 per cent, who served one to three years in prison; 169, or 9.6 per cent, who served three to six years in prison; and 127, or 7.2 per cent, who served more than six years in prison.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028111"></A>
I think they are interesting and very startling figures. It will be fascinating to review the operation of these new laws and the operation of the Sentencing Advisory Council in five years time to see whether there is any shift in the sentencing of offenders--for example, the percentage of offenders receiving no jail time increasing or decreasing, the percentage of offenders receiving less than one year in prison increasing or decreasing, and so on from there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028113"></A>
Whilst on the surface there are things in this bill which appear to be a step in the right direction, the LNP has some serious concerns about the way that exceptional circumstances can and will be interpreted based on the experience in other jurisdictions. Not only that, if the government is serious about dealing with the issue of so-called statutory rape and the circumstances of very young people maintaining a relationship who could inadvertently be caught up in this then the government should be very clear about quantifying that. It should be prepared to support the LNP’s amendment which prescribes it to juvenile offenders. If they do not like that and they want to make it 19 or 20 years of age, then let them do that. But if that is what they are saying then let us actually do it and not leave in place this broad get-out-of-jail-free card which will be extrapolated and interpreted more broadly than that. I think it will create greater community concern and distrust when what the government has promised to do starts to fail because of a broad exception which has been provided to our courts in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DICKSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Buderim--LNP) (12.43 pm): I rise to speak to the government’s proposal to establish the Sentencing Advisory Council within the Queensland legal system. I refer to the current system of dealing with criminals in Queensland as a ‘legal’ system, not a ‘justice’ system, because almost every day in Queensland we see criminals who should be in jail walk free from the courts with only a fine and no penalty awarded against them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028117"></A>
This bill does one thing for certain: it highlights the inadequacies of the current regime of sentencing guidelines in Queensland. We only have to look a few lines into the bill to read this--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028119"></A>
In determining the appropriate sentence for an offender who has 1 or more previous convictions, the court must treat each previous conviction as an aggravating factor if the court considers that it can reasonably be treated as such having regard to--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1028120"></A>
(a)	the nature of the previous conviction and its relevance to the current offence; and </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1028121"></A>
(b)	the time that has elapsed since the conviction. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028122"></A>
I am sure that the people of Queensland will be very interested to learn that the courts do not already have to take into account the nature of any previous convictions and their relevance to the current offence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028123"></A>
By way of introduction, I would like to canvass a piece of very recent history. On Friday, 17 September the Attorney-General in the Bligh Labor government released a ministerial media statement. The attention-grabbing headline of the media release read ‘Queensland’s rate of suspended sentences lowest in the country’. It was a real eye-catcher, designed to get the media salivating for sure. That press release states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028127"></A>
The Bligh Government’s tough approach to law and order has been highlighted by data that shows Queensland has the lowest rate of suspended prison sentences in the nation.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028128"></A>
Attorney-General Cameron Dick told Parliament today that the most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data comparing criminal courts across Australia showed that Queensland courts were tough on crime. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028129"></A>
Responding to a Question on Notice, Mr Dick said: “The latest ABS figures comparing criminal courts across Australia show that the Queensland Magistrates Court impose fully suspended sentences at the lowest rate in the country. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028130"></A>
“These types of sentences are imposed in only 2 per cent of Magistrates Court cases in Queensland, compared with 3.9 per cent in New South Wales, 6.5 per cent in Victoria and 2.6 per cent in Western Australia,” Mr Dick said. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028131"></A>
Indeed, that single solitary statistic is correct, but the Attorney-General has been cherry-picking his way through the ABS data from 2008-09. The Attorney failed to mention some other figures contained in that very same data. Overall, Queensland magistrates courts jailed fewer criminals than New South Wales, Victoria, Northern Territory and the ACT. In fact, the 3.3 per cent of Queensland offenders who are actually sentenced to custody in a correctional institution is well below the Australia-wide percentage of 4.3 per cent. But wait; there is more. The Attorney-General’s media release goes on--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028133"></A>
“Ensuring that Queensland’s communities remain safe is a priority ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028134"></A>
“Queensland courts also send criminal offenders to jail. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028135"></A>
“This is demonstrated by the fact that while approximately one million more people live in the State of Victoria than Queensland, there are approximately 1300 more prisoners in Queensland jails than Victorian jails.” </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028136"></A>
This is a bit of good, old-fashioned smoke and mirrors from the Attorney-General. It is nothing to do with population numbers; it is to do with convicted criminal numbers. Another statistic from the Attorney-General’s ABS spreadsheet is that only 82,000 Victorians were guilty of offences compared to 148,000 Queenslanders for the same period. That is the reason there are greater numbers of criminals in custody in Queensland than Victoria: we have twice as many crooks. Here is the smoking gun which shoots a hole through the Attorney-General’s media stunt. Of the total percentage of custodial orders handed out in magistrates courts right across Australia, Queensland had the lowest percentage except for Western Australia. That is the second lowest percentage of criminals being given custodial orders and way below the percentages of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, Northern Territory and the ACT. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028138"></A>
The Attorney also forgot to mention that Queensland magistrates courts handed out a greater percentage of non-custodial orders than the courts of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and the ACT. When we talk about ‘non-custodial’ we are talking about things like fines, good behaviour bonds and community orders. Queensland magistrates courts serve up a greater percentage of non-custodial orders than the Australia-wide percentage of 91.3 per cent. Spreadsheets of statistics are a wonderful thing. You can shake them up and down, you can bend them from side to side, you can take bits from here and bits from there, you can interpret them this way and that way, but when you choose to pull the wool over Queenslanders’ eyes with a Friday afternoon press release you are on very tenuous ground. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028141"></A>
The figures speak for themselves. In percentage terms here in Queensland fewer crooks leave the magistrates courts and go into custody than just about anywhere else, and in Queensland more crooks have non-custodial sentences than just about anywhere else in this country. But it gets even worse for the Attorney-General. I note that the Attorney’s media release mentioned nothing about sentences emanating from the higher courts here in Queensland. No wonder the Attorney-General did not mention the higher courts! Queensland has the lowest percentage across Australia for crooks getting custodial orders from our higher courts. As far as non-custodial orders are concerned, however, the higher courts in Queensland hand out nearly twice as many as most other states. That is an appalling set of numbers in this state. No wonder the government thinks the courts need a Sentencing Advisory Council to set them on a course in line with the community’s expectations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031337"></A>
There is one aspect of this bill which I find very disturbing. There is nothing within this bill that seeks to amend or give powers to the Sentencing Advisory Council regarding a particular section within the Penalties and Sentences Act. Part 2 of the act states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1031340"></A>
In sentencing an offender, a court must have regard to principles that a sentence of imprisonment should only be imposed as a last resort--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1031341"></A>
I want to say that again--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1031343"></A>
... a sentence of imprisonment should only be imposed as a last resort--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1031344"></A>
It continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1031346"></A>
and a sentence that allows the offender to stay in the community is preferable. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1031347"></A>
We need to a listen to that one more time--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1031349"></A>
and a sentence that allows the offender to stay in the community is preferable. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031350"></A>
If the Attorney-General and the rest of the government are fair dinkum about ensuring that the courts are going to hand out appropriate sentences they should stop directing the judges and magistrates to consider jail time as a last resort and join the real world. People want to see paedophiles like Robert John Fardon--the guy who was sentenced to jail on three different occasions and let out on three occasions and raped women in our society and raped children in our society--in jail. It is about time this government got tough on law and order and decided to put criminals where they belong, instead of being do-gooders and putting paedophiles and rapists out on the streets. </Hansard-Body>

The objectives of the bill are set out in the explanatory notes. The objectives are: to establish the Sentencing Advisory Council for Queensland; to give the Queensland Court of Appeal the powers to issue guideline judgements; and to strengthen the penalties imposed upon repeat offenders, child sex offenders and offenders who commit violence upon a young child and/or those who cause the death of a young child. </Hansard-Body>

The introduction of this bill is a sign that the Labor government recognises that it has had a poor record on sentencing over the past 12 years. It could be said--and one could potentially hold the view--that there is a glimmer of hope that the Labor Party is starting to listen to the LNP on justice issues and sentencing principles in Queensland. But, knowing the Labor Party as I have for the last 1 years, I would highly doubt that that would be the case. </Hansard-Body>

We are debating similar legislation today as was debated in this House in 2004. In fact, this bill is very similar to the bill that was introduced by the coalition in 2005. It was a bill that was subsequently rejected by the Labor state government. At that time the bill was introduced by the then shadow Attorney-General, the member for Caloundra.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 What has changed in a few years, I say. That is exactly right. I take the interjection from the honourable shadow Attorney-General. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Dick:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 You wait for it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031367"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will wait with anticipation for the response from the Attorney-General. At least the current Attorney-General recognises the value of what the LNP has previously proposed and continues to support. I just say to the Attorney-General that I guess it is better late than never. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031368"></A>
The Penalties and Sentences Act 1992 includes guidelines for sentencing that are supposed to reflect general community expectations of what is deemed an appropriate punishment that fits the crime committed. Quite clearly, there is evidence that this has not been the case in many high-profile cases of recent years. I recognise the current Attorney-General’s record on appealing weak sentences that have caused outrage in the community for being far too lenient. Clearly, though, there is an issue with what is prescribed in the legal obligations that are provided for our judges to impose. The bill before the House refers to crimes committed that are particularly heinous in nature. Given this, I must record my strong objection to the exceptional circumstances provision that is included in this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031369"></A>
This clause has been tried in other jurisdictions in Australia and has failed. It relates to the imprisonment terms for offences of a sexual nature against a child under 16 years unless exceptional circumstances exist in each case. In Victoria the inclusion of this exception has led to an increase in the proportion of sex criminals on suspended sentences. The same criticism has been made in New South Wales where the exceptional circumstance provision has been in place for a number of years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031370"></A>
The Attorney-General and the government should be sending the message that there are no exceptional circumstances for crimes of a sexual nature that are committed against a child. Children are the most vulnerable, impressionable and fragile people in our society and the government should have the strongest policy to ensure that these heinous acts will not be tolerated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031371"></A>
On the other hand, the LNP and the shadow minister has been a strong advocate for the most adequate protection of Queensland children. Current statistics indicate that one-third of all convicted sex offenders were avoiding any prison time under this Labor government’s weak sentencing laws. These weak sentences certainly do nothing to dispel any fears that sex predators who prey on the most weak and vulnerable in our society are appropriately punished. Short sentences are clearly no deterrent and convictions which offer no opportunity to attend rehabilitation programs simply increase the risk to the community from reoffenders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031372"></A>
Between 2007 and June 2010 there were 1,752 convictions for serious sex offences recorded in Queensland. These offences covered rape, indecent treatment, possessing child abuse material and using the internet to procure a child. Of those 1,752 convictions, 677 received no jail time and only 127 or 7.2 per cent received a sentence of more than six years imprisonment. Clearly, the current system is not working as an adequate deterrent. The community is right to be outraged by these statistics, which are a damning indictment on the record of this Labor government’s attitude towards these vile sex crimes. Certainly this issue is very topical at present on the Sunshine Coast as the coronial inquest continues into the disappearance of Daniel Morcombe from a bus stop in broad daylight on a main road on 7 December 2003. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031375"></A>
The Day for Daniel is coming up. It is a vision of the Daniel Morcombe Foundation and it has strengthened a community resolve to ensure that this type of tragedy never occurs again. The foundation focuses on harm prevention initiatives and teaches personal safety to young people across Queensland. In the week leading up to the Day for Daniel this Friday, I am sure that all honourable members will join me in offering our thoughts and best wishes to Bruce and Denise Morcombe. I have seen press releases from the member for Glass House with respect to that this week. They continue to show strength in relentless pursuit of what happened to Daniel in the face of tremendous adversity and the media circus surrounding the situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031377"></A>
I am pleased to see that there is at least recognition of Labor’s weak sentencing record. The introduction of this bill is an attempt to create a quick headline. A sustained policy approach to appropriate sentencing is what will slowly eradicate the community’s general distrust in some of the current sentences that are being handed down by our courts. The community wants real action from a justice system that recognises the impact of a crime on the victims and their families. These laws will not ensure that serious sex offenders are locked up for substantial periods of time, but they are at least a step in the right direction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031378"></A>
As I noted earlier, a bill like this was introduced some time in 2004 by the then shadow Attorney-General, the member for Caloundra. I look forward to later in the day when I can go through some of the contributions made by members opposite to the bill introduced at that time. Then it will give the Attorney-General certainly an opportunity to let us know what has changed substantially in that short time. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>

The Queensland government committed in its response to the parliamentary Economic Development Committee report <Hansard-Italic>
Inquiry into identifying world’s best practice by governments to effectively stimulate employment opportunities in Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
 to review the local industry policy with a view to increasing its transparency and accountability to drive better outcomes for Queensland business. The bill I move today is the response to this commitment to review the local industry policy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036543"></A>
Feedback from stakeholders about the policy was clear. The objectives of the policy--to ensure local Queensland business and workers have access to government procurement--were strongly supported. This is not surprising. Since the introduction of the local industry policy, the state’s manufacturers have won 3,145 contestable contracts totalling some $4.928 billion, with $1.402 billion going to regional Queensland companies. These outcomes since the policy’s introduction are impressive, but the time has come for government to formalise the policy into legislation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036545"></A>
The Queensland Industry Participation Policy Bill 2010 provides a legislative basis for the Queensland government to maximise the benefits for our local economy and community from state government funded procurement. This is about local industry getting a fair go for local jobs. In recognition of the economic and social benefits that flow from local participation, the bill seeks to ensure that the principles of local supplier involvement in Queensland government funded procurement are put into practice by governments of this state into the future. Codifying the objectives of the local industry policy has also provided the opportunity for the inclusion of further transparency and accountability with the reporting of local industry policy outcomes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036546"></A>
The bill provides that the responsible minister must have an industry participation policy, to be known as the local industry policy. It requires that the minister report annually to the parliament on the policy’s performance and outcomes. It codifies an increased level of accessibility for all stakeholders about how the local industry policy is applied. Local industry participation not only helps create and maintain jobs; it supports regional economic activity and development and drives technology diffusion and innovation through our own supply chains. It focuses Queensland industry on providing highly competitive goods and services whilst ensuring that the Queensland taxpayer receives value for money. Alongside value for money, the principles of ensuring probity and accountability in procurement are central tenets in government expenditure, and the bill provides that local industry policy must be consistent with them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036547"></A>
The bill requires consultation in future alterations to the local industry policy with the government agencies and government owned corporations that are implementing the policy but more importantly with stakeholders like employer and employee representatives such as unions. It ensures that future changes to the policy are collaborative and increase the efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of the policy, because, ultimately, this policy is about Queensland business and Queensland jobs. It is a policy about providing benefits for Queensland communities. The bill recognises that we live in a global economy and that developing the local industry’s long-term international competitiveness is vital in responding to changing global markets. The bill requires that this specific objective be considered by the relevant minister in developing a local industry policy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036548"></A>
The bill recognises that the state and Commonwealth governments have international obligations in relation to government procurement that also need to be taken into account by the minister. Local industry policy, as provided for in the bill, will apply to all government agencies, including those special-purpose companies established to deliver some of our larger or unique infrastructure projects. It will also apply to GOCs and their subsidiaries while recognising their special circumstances and the role shareholding ministers have as the intermediaries between the state government and GOCs on policy matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036549"></A>
The proposed legislation will not affect the principles or substance of the Queensland government’s current local industry policy. It codifies the requirements of maintaining the policy and increases the transparency of application within government. The bill will improve the ability of all stakeholders to monitor the operation of the policy, confirm that it is being applied appropriately and that its operation is effective and efficient. We expect compliance and public reporting by government on this policy to provide more opportunities for local companies to access state government funded procurement projects. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr BLEIJIE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kawana--LNP) (2.35 pm), continuing: Before the lunch interval I was referring to comments made by those members opposite who rejected the opposition’s bill in 2005 which sought the establishment of a sentencing advisory council but who now in 2010 have seen the light and are happy to support government legislation on the same topic. It is important to recognise the Labor government’s hypocrisy on this matter, and there is no better way to illustrate that than to take a look back in the history books of 2005 to see what was stated at the time, and I remind the House that these comments were made in the same context as this debate today. For instance, members opposite would be interested to hear what the member for Toowoomba North had to say at the time. The member for Toowoomba North had some interesting comments on the bill moved by the opposition and the then shadow Attorney, the member for Caloundra. In 2005 the member for Toowoomba North said, and I quote from <Hansard-Italic>

<A ID="pgfId-1036561"></A>
It is a concern to hear the Liberal Party putting up this bill tonight. It is, in all respects, trying to out-National the National Party in terms of this type of proposed legislation.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1036562"></A>
He goes on to say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036564"></A>
I see great worries in the trend that the Liberal Party is adopting here. One would expect it from the National Party, but one would expect something better from the Liberal Party--particularly from the shadow Attorney-General, who is a member of the legal profession.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036565"></A>
That was said by the member for Toowoomba North in 2005. Member for Toowoomba North, how times have changed! While the Liberal and National parties have emerged to form the LNP, it is great to once again see that the Labor Party is trying to out-LNP the LNP and I look forward to the member’s contribution in this debate. I note that the member for Toowoomba North is on the speaking list today, so I particularly look forward to his contribution to hear how over the past few years his position has changed somewhat from the statements that I just referred to that were recorded in this place in 2005 by the member for Toowoomba North. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036567"></A>
Another contribution to that debate in 2005 which should be noted was from the member for Ferny Grove, the current Minister for Education and Training. I quote from <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
 where the member for Ferny Grove said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036570"></A>
In my view, the bill is based upon the same type of sentiments that underline the opposition’s frequent calls for mandatory sentences. Queensland has a well-balanced sentencing system made up of many very important parts.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036571"></A>
Well, it seems that in the last five years the balance has changed and the government has finally endorsed what the opposition has been calling for for quite some time, and I look forward to the minister’s contribution to this debate and whether or not he has also seen the light.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036610"></A>
In fact, I look forward to any contribution by those members of the government who were in this place in 2005 and who voted against this proposal. As the <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
 record indicates, the members of this House representing the following electorates voted against this very proposal in 2005: Mount Ommaney, South Brisbane, Cairns, Broadwater, Yeerongpilly, Mount Coot-tha, Keppel, Whitsunday, Albert, Southport, Lytton, Bundamba, Mackay, Mundingburra, Cook, Nudgee, Stretton, Rockhampton, Woodridge, Toowoomba North, Burleigh, Sunnybank, Springwood, Algester, Thuringowa, Murrumba, Mansfield and Ferny Grove. Longevity certainly does provide an opportunity to ensure that the policy is correct. This situation is a perfect example--</Hansard-Body>

 They can call it arrogant but they cannot take it. They can throw the accusations but when you throw it back at them, they get offended. They act like children in this place because they cannot handle it. They can dish it out but they cannot take it back. This situation is a perfect example of why people complain about a partisan approach to party politics and government credibility just for the sake of being adversarial. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036615"></A>
As I am reflecting on previous comments made by members opposite, I am drawn to <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
 of the same day, 29 September 2005, and the contribution from the Hon. Dean Wells, the member for Murrumba, who at 8.35 pm said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036617"></A>
According to the mover’s notes, the purpose of this bill is to amend the Penalties and Sentences Act to allow the Queensland community an input into the sentences and penalties imposed on convicted criminals through the creation of a sentencing advisory council. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1036618"></A>
Then I pick up the explanatory notes of this bill from the Attorney-General and I read where it says under the heading ‘Sentencing Advisory Council’--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036621"></A>
The creation of a Sentencing Advisory Council will help bridge any gap between community expectations, the courts and government on the complex issue of sentencing criminal offenders. The Council will: encourage balanced public debate about sentencing issues; inject community opinion into the sentencing process; and foster confidence in the sentencing system. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the member for Pumicestone. She told me to keep up to it. It was the opposition’s bill in 2005. So I say to the member for Pumicestone that it is not the LNP that ought to keep up with it; it is the Labor Party that ought to keep up with it. We are here years later debating legislation that was effectively debated in 2005 and they have the audacity to tell us to keep up with it. Come on! The member for Pumicestone should be the one keeping up with it, because obviously Labor has not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036627"></A>
In summation, I want to thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Attorney-General for his tireless commitment and leadership on these issues and the illustration that the LNP is certainly listening to the concerns of the community. The feedback that I continually receive from constituents in my electorate is that there are far too many examples of weak sentencing and the angst that that causes in the general community is increasing. Only last week I hosted a morning tea and presentation in my electorate office as part of Crime Prevention Month.</Hansard-Body>

Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes. I take the interjection by the member for Pumicestone. I am talking about a community meeting during Crime Prevention Month. Yes, there were people there. Can I tell the member who was there? Local Neighbourhood Watch groups and local community groups. The person making the presentation was a good local hardworking police officer. So I take that interjection as an insult to all of those hardworking Neighbourhood Watch and community members and the local police force who come out and support members of parliament and support their community in terms of bringing these issues to light.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036631"></A>
Some residents took particular interest in terms such as joy-riding and affray being bandied around, particularly by the media. These terms represent grant theft auto and a brawl. The term ‘joy-riding’ actually sounds like fun until you realise what it is. I do not see much joy in having your car stolen and then trashed. These terms highlight a concerning trend in the trivialisation of these crimes and a lack of recognition of the suffering of the victim. As I have said in this place before, the ordeal that a victim has gone through needs to be taken into full consideration when sentencing is handed down by a court. For sex predators who prey on your young children, this issue is paramount. When we debate these sentencing laws my thoughts certainly turn to my own children and the natural protective tendencies that parents have for their own children. General society should place the protection of our children foremost as opposed to the rehabilitation of the convicted offender. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036632"></A>
I reiterate a few comments that I made for the purpose of the Attorney-General when he is making his summation later this afternoon. I remind him that in 2005 the member for Toowoomba North--who I note was the first law officer of this state, a former Attorney-General--said in this place on sentencing advisory councils--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036638"></A>
The hypocrisy on this issue could not be greater. As I have said, it is the Labor Party that is trying to out-LNP the LNP in terms of sentencing laws and taking good, wise counsel from the shadow Attorney-General and certainly not from the Attorney-General we have at the moment. With that in mind, I would seek feedback from the Attorney-General in his summation. I want particularly from the Attorney-General in his summation answers as to how come times have changed in such a short period. They can attack the LNP opposition on the one hand for introducing sentencing advisory councils in 2005 and in 2010 turn around and do it all again. So I say again to the member for Pumicestone: you get with the times because the LNP has far exceeded the expectations of community input into sentencing in terms of bringing bills into this place well and truly before the Labor Party. </Hansard-Body>

It is a pleasure to be able to speak to this bill, the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill 2010, because I consider it to be a very significant and important step in ensuring that our community is able to have input into our sentencing regime. Over a period of several years I have had the opportunity to sit in on court hearings in a number of different jurisdictions. I recall a morning spent in the Brisbane Children’s Court which I found extremely interesting. I remember a number of young people--one young man in particular with his father in attendance and who obviously had a great deal of family support. He was clearly very upset about what he had done and embarrassed to be in court with his father there. I cannot remember his crime or his misdemeanour, but I do remember the lecture that he was given by the presiding magistrate, who clearly set out his expectations of the path that this young man should take in the future. He was told by the magistrate that if he were to appear again in his court there would be penalties. The magistrate took into account the young man’s family support, which was assured. In contrast, another youngster clearly had attitude. There was a youth worker with him and possibly he had no family support. He had been there before and had a set of directives that he needed to follow, including returning for another hearing. I found a very individual approach and very detailed attention to what was happening in each young persons’ life. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036643"></A>
Then there was the Beenleigh Drug Court, where I witnessed the intensive services that were available to wrap around those who really wanted to carry out the program to be free of their habit. In the court was a Salvation Army officer, representatives from Queensland Health and someone from Logan House, a drug rehabilitation centre where they do fantastic work. I found this court very personalised and liked that fact that many of those on the program were in court together to witness the deliberation of the magistrate and they were able to applaud each other when they graduated from one level to the next. </Hansard-Body>

For one young woman, it was clear to see her imperative. She had a young baby and was determined to beat her habit. Another young man, who had thumbed his nose at the direction given to him by the magistrate, went straight back into custody. Then there was the short time I spent in the District Court in Brisbane and several hours in the court at Paramatta, New South Wales--and even a morning in a court in Port Moresby which I found most interesting. However, I must admit that my most engaging experience in a court was a visit to the neighbourhood justice centre in Collingwood, Victoria with the then Attorney-General, Kerry Shine, and my colleague the member for Springwood. This style of community justice is a superb example of how a justice system can both educate and work with the community to deal with crime in a specific area to effect change. I have appreciated the time our current Attorney-General has spent in my community investigating such a possibility here. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039587"></A>
The one thing I gained from those various experiences was the knowledge that to understand the deliberations of a judge or magistrate you need to be aware of all of the facts of a case. There is a balance to be struck. It may be the case that a young person has made a bad error of judgement and with the right admonition may go on to never offend and probably live an upright life or it may be that there are serious offenders who need severe penalties and who hopefully during their time inside take the opportunities offered them to gain skills, improve their education and rehabilitate. </Hansard-Body>

It is clear that there is a divide at times between community expectations in sentencing and our judiciary. There are times when a crime receives much public reporting and even evokes a level of public outrage. These are often crimes against children and sometimes multiple crimes by a sexual predator. While judges and magistrates, when considering the sentence they will impose, take into consideration other similar cases, the offender’s previous history, community safety, as well as the severity of the crime, it is true that at times there can be public outcry if the sentence is perceived as inadequate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039589"></A>
This bill provides for the establishment of a Sentencing Advisory Council which will fulfil many roles. With members selected from such groups as victims of crime as well as from the general community, they will be expected to gain a thorough understanding of many areas relating to our justice system--such as domestic and family violence, crime prevention, our corrective services system, juvenile justice, criminal law, our courts and the process of sentencing--to then be able to educate and inform our community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039590"></A>
Consistency in sentencing is often an issue with the public, and it is important that we all have confidence in our justice system. The role of the council in consulting with the judiciary will be an important component of the sentencing regime--that of public expectation, particularly in the case of those who commit serious and violent crimes against children and those who continue to repeat their crimes without any sign of remorse or rehabilitation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039591"></A>
The first rule of our justice system must be to maintain public safety and to be transparently strong yet fair. There is also a requirement to gain an understanding of the impact of incarceration on our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. We have all heard the terrible statistics of the high incidence of imprisonment of Aboriginal people, particularly males. It is sad to think of it almost being a rite of passage. I had the great privilege of a close friendship with Uncle Paddy Jerome, who sadly is no longer with us. His history is deeply moving. Similar to many of his mob, his early years were spent consuming alcohol and coming in contact with the law. He was rescued by a wonderful priest in Redfern and became one of their greatest advocates against alcohol. He wrote scholarly papers about the harmful effects of alcohol and mentored so many of their young people and inspired not only his Aboriginal community but also many others. He was a long-time member of the Australian Labor Party--in fact, I understand that he was the first member of an Indigenous community to join the party--and contributed so much to our Indigenous policy over the years. His longing was to develop his significant parcel of land up on the Darling Downs to help initiate his young people into a greater understanding of their culture. Sadly, his dream was never realised. But his legacy lives on in the hearts of many of his kin. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039593"></A>
The second component of this bill is the requirement that any offender convicted of a sex offence against a child must serve time in prison unless there are exceptional circumstances to be considered, such as two young people in a consenting relationship. I have spoken before in this place about my own nephew in Victoria who was groomed by a teacher in a private school and sexually abused for five years. The impact on a young person, on their family and on their friends is immeasurable. To steal a person’s childhood in such a way is a despicable crime. Under threat, it instills in a young person secrecy. Lack of trust and difficulty in forming personal relationships can be a lifelong legacy. Previous convictions must also be given strong consideration, as well as the age of a young child. This may result in a declaration being made of a serious violent offender. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039594"></A>
At the present time, serious violent offenders must serve 80 per cent of their sentence before they may be considered for parole. The Sentencing Advisory Council will have a very onerous responsibility, but the opportunities to be a conduit between what can be a very complex judicial system and our community are great. Those who put their names forward will undoubtedly have a real passion and an interest in seeing greater transparency and greater understanding within our community of sentencing matters. These measures will strengthen our judicial system and, with greater community involvement and transparency, will lead to far greater public confidence in the strength and fairness of our judicial system. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(2.57 pm): I rise to speak on this pertinent debate on the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill. The House needs little reminder of the importance of this debate with reference to the community’s concerns for child protection and welfare. It is also important to consider the relevant legal principles of treating like cases alike, and the adjustment of judicial discretion in the terms of the cases mentioned in the bill as well as in relation to repeat offending and recidivism. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039597"></A>
There is certainly a need for a Sentencing Advisory Council, as outlined by the Attorney-General, to not only bring Queensland into line with other states such as New South Wales and Victoria but, most importantly, to work towards a more consistent, unified and community based sentencing regime. The problem is that the Attorney-General seems to think this is something new for Queensland and that the Bligh Labor government is at the vanguard of responding to community calls for strengthening criminal sentencing--that they are the innovators. Well, if the Attorney-General was writing a university paper he would be up on charges of plagiarism. What we are debating now is not new. The LNP previously introduced this bill in 2005 and the Labor government defeated it, claiming that the member for Caloundra’s proposal would create a new and expensive body to do the job of the courts and parliament. So what we have here is a pathetic state version of Kevin Rudd’s ‘me too-ism’--Labor playing ‘follow the leader’ because it does not want to go into an election having to admit that the LNP has policies let alone better policies than they do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039598"></A>
Turning to the legislation, there is little debate that at present there seems to be a lack of a single principle regarding criminal sentencing in general. There are many factors, in relation to both the victim and the offender as well as others, that a single trial judge has to consider when delivering a sentence. Having a wide variety of factors to consider, which more often than not compete with one another, will invariably lead to the occurrence of more errors in sentencing such as errors regarding proportion. So by sharing the burden with the community it would follow that the probability of errors would decrease, allowing sentencing to be more accurate and allowing judges more time and more resources to allocate to other factors in providing justice to both the victim and the offender in the case before them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042559"></A>
With the implementation of the Sentencing Advisory Council will come, over time, as sentencing guidelines are made, the development of a large body of guidelines that will reflect community standards and supplement current practices in criminal sentencing. From the explanatory notes it was made clear that the intention was not to erode judicial discretion but to incorporate community involvement. This cannot be stressed enough to those who are concerned that this is done to curtail the discretionary powers of the trial judge. Community involvement in the sentencing process can only be a positive, as it extends the forum of criminal sentencing from being almost exclusively the courts to relevant extra legal fields, because after all crime is not only a legal issue; it is a social one as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042562"></A>
Turning to the issue regarding the exceptional circumstances provision, I echo the calls of the shadow Attorney-General, the member for Kawana and others on this side that as it stands it needs to be removed from the bill. Presumably this provision was inserted to narrow the circumstances in which a lenient sentence would be given. However, this gives the judiciary the discretion to decide what exceptional circumstances can be considered, which defeats the mandatory nature of the rest of the amendments that are designed specifically to protect the most vulnerable demographic in the community. The experience in New South Wales has indicated that the narrow caveat created by the exceptional circumstances provision has failed to delineate the boundaries of sentencing practice and, therefore, has failed to extend the net to cover a wider situation in which lenient sentences would be excluded. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042563"></A>
Also in the first reading the Attorney-General mentioned that while it is difficult, if not impossible, to envisage circumstances in which a violent sexual offender might satisfy such a provision and in doing so not be sentenced to an actual term of imprisonment, some offences may be caught by this provision which involve circumstances that warrant further careful consideration. If this is, in fact, the case why include the provision? It is unnecessary. The example given by the Attorney-General can be better remedied by inserting a provision in the Criminal Code dealing with such behaviour as it relates to a criminal act, not a sentence. Also, it would be extremely inefficient if such conduct were prosecuted only to have it excluded by the exceptional circumstances provision. Therefore, in this sense the government has two alternatives: either that situations comparable to the ones in the example given by Attorney-General be dealt with in terms of being offences in the Criminal Code or that such conduct will not be made exempt under the new penalties legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042564"></A>
I now address the issue of repeat offenders in the bill. In the first reading, the Attorney-General spoke of how relevant priors must be an aggravating factor in determining a sentence. Section 11(a) of the current Penalties and Sentences Act already outlines that relevant priors are a consideration in sentencing and that they may form a basis for the aggravation of a sentence. How would these new provisions treating relevant priors as considerations differ or improve what is already outlined in section 11(a)? Surely relevant priors are already treated as aggravating factors. It is difficult to formulate a circumstance where a trial judge would form the view that relevant priors would not be an aggravating factor. In the explanatory notes it was said that the purpose of the provisions regarding repeat offenders was to bring Queensland in line with the decision in Veen (No. 2). However, from a reading of section 11 of the current Penalties and Sentences Act, that it is already the case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042568"></A>
Furthermore, the provisions regarding repeat offenders seem to have not only punishment but also deterrence at the forefront, both specific deterrence in relation to the repeat offender or recidivist in particular and general deterrence to the community at large. However, the concept of deterrence relies on the assumption that the repeat offender or recidivist and the broader community make rational choices in relation to why they should or should not offend in terms of the sentence that they have previously received. I submit that this premise may be somewhat misleading, because motivation and deterrence do not necessarily depend on the previous sentences. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042569"></A>
I turn to a paper published in 2007 by the Australian Institute of Criminology, titled <Hansard-Italic>
Recidivism in Australia: findings and future research, </Hansard-Italic>
by Jason Payne. At page 86 of the paper, Payne and others outline factors that are relevant to reoffending, which are unemployment, education and schooling, residential location, family attachment, mental health and drug use. Therefore, it would be more accurate to say that the main motivations of most repeat offenders have their origins in those factors regarding social disadvantage and mental health, rather than previous sentencing. Therefore, I submit and remind the government that the goal in terms of recidivism should not be solely confined to treating recidivists with heavier sentences that achieve the goal of punishment, but also to more directly address the circumstances that put offenders at risk of repeating an offence by allocating resources and the work of this House accordingly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042572"></A>
Finally, I bring the attention of the House to issues raised by Mr Terry O’Gorman, the vice-president of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, in an article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Brisbane Times</Hansard-Italic>
 dated 8 February 2010. Mr O’Gorman made relevant points regarding the composition of the council, especially the inclusion of certain advocacy groups. From the article it was clear that the concern was based on the notion that such an advisory council will be infiltrated by advocacy groups that would colour the relevant considerations in guideline judgement with their bias and agenda, and thus lead to unprincipled reasoning and expose the sentencing process to errors in proportion. This unease is alarming given that, if Mr O’Gorman’s concerns do become a reality, it would undermine the legitimacy of the sentencing process. That would be contrary to the actual goal of such a sentencing advisory committee, which Chief Justice Spigelman of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in R v Jurisic said was to restore public confidence in criminal sentencing. Furthermore, at the very core of a civil society lies the existence of an objective and independent court system, and we cannot afford to undermine that cornerstone of democracy. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr JOHNSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gregory--LNP) (3.05 pm): In rising to the speak to the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill 2010, I note with interest the comments made by the shadow Attorney-General in relation to the opposition’s position. This afternoon, I want to reflect on certain aspects of the legislation. Any issue at all that deals with crime in this state must be viewed with very close precision. In his first reading speech the Attorney-General said, ‘This bill seeks to enhance public knowledge and understanding of sentencing matters; to fortify community confidence in the sentencing process...’ From the outset I would say that this constitutes many different arguments involving the justice system in our state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042578"></A>
Before lunch today I heard what the shadow Attorney-General said in relation to the sentencing of violent offenders to over 10 years imprisonment and the sneaky little deals that seem to be written into some clauses which allow those people a get-out-of-jail-early card. Today I reiterate that anyone convicted of killing or seriously assaulting a minor must receive automatically a lifetime penalty, just as their victim will carry their suffering and scars for the term of their lives. Those victims serve life sentences for being violated by horrible and despicable people, who deserve to rot in the bowels of a Queensland maximum security prison. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042579"></A>
I respect the Attorney-General, who plays a very important role as the chief law officer of this state. However, in this state we cannot and must not condone any victimisation of or blatant attack upon innocent children, who lose that innocence because of predators. The former minister for police and corrective services, the Hon. Judy Spence, is in the House today. I know that when she was a minister in this government she reflected on recidivism on very many occasions. My point is that those people somehow think it is their God-given right to be predators and to target children. I agree with Bravehearts’ Hetty Johnston, who has called for a two-strikes-and-you’re-out approach. This legislation establishes the new Sentencing Advisory Council and we have to ensure that it does not water down or weaken the court system. I know that recently, as the chief law officer, the Attorney-General has questioned the sentencing of certain criminals in this state. I think that is good. However, the real problem is that some of those people were not given the right sentences in the first place and that concerns me. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045464"></A>
Some research work has been done by Bravehearts over a period of time, and that research states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1045469"></A>
In addition to previous convictions, self-report data from convicted sex offenders shows that the number of victims per offender is incredibly high. Smallbone and Wortley’s comprehensive study on child sex offenders in Queensland prisons found: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1045470"></A>
“169 child sex offenders who admitted having committed at least one sexual offence against a child later disclosed offences concerning 1010 children (748 boys and 262 girls) of which only 393 (38.9%) were reported to have been associated with official convictions.” </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045471"></A>
These are serious allegations and they are not going away. I know that the justice system and the police on a daily basis are confronted with these damning figures, these damning records and the data that is made available constantly. I appeal to the Attorney today that the sentencing for these types of crimes has to be made tougher. I hope that this legislation, in whatever way, is going to make certain that the justice system will stand up for the rights of these young people and the rights of all people in this state for this matter. The important factor again is the courts. Again I quote Bravehearts--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1045474"></A>
... the court <Hansard-Bold>
must </Hansard-Bold>
err on the side of community safety and protection therefore detaining the offender until such time that recommendations to release are unanimous. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045475"></A>
I feel that there are a lot of hidden agendas here that make us think that some of us know what is going on but not everybody knows what is going on. Children, as far as I am concerned--and I have said it here before--are sacred. Their safety is not negotiable. They are the most important possessions and the most important natural resource that we have in Queensland and in Australia for that matter. We must play a role not only as legislators but as custodians of the law in this state to make absolutely certain that these innocent people are protected in every way possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045476"></A>
I heard the shadow Attorney make reference to Robert John Fardon and the fact that he was to serve a 13-year term and was released after serving only eight years. He is again back on the streets doing what he perceives as his God-given right to do. That is why I support Bravehearts’ concept of ‘two strikes and you’re out’. There is no room for those people on the streets of Queensland and in our society as there is for law-abiding citizens. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045477"></A>
Yesterday in this parliament we passed legislation to allow police to issue tickets for public nuisance offences to try to keep some of those people out of the courts, to make streets safer, to make our communities safer and to give people the right to go about their business in a proper and correct way. It is all about upholding the law, and breaches of the law must be dealt with in a very tough and very strict way. In this legislation, the first part of the amendments creates a Sentencing Advisory Council, and I hope that this is not going to be contradictory to the independence of the justice system in making a decisive, responsible and calculated decision on delivering proper sentencing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045478"></A>
As I said earlier, the Attorney has made certain references to some of the decisions that have been made by the courts in recent times and to the leniency of some of those sentences, and I applaud him for that. The real issue here is that, in performing its functions, it is anticipated, as the Attorney said, that the Queensland council will consult widely, including with the judiciary, the legal profession, government agencies and the community. When we talk about government agencies, I hope that the Queensland Police Service and Queensland Corrective Services are going to be a very integral part of that consultation process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045480"></A>
The members of this advisory council, as the Attorney says, will have experience in the areas, for example, of victims of crime, justice matters relating to Indigenous people and vulnerable persons facing the criminal justice system, justice matters relating to domestic and family violence, law enforcement, crime prevention, criminal prosecution and criminal defence representation, civil liberties, corrective services, juvenile justice matters, and criminology and criminal law, including sentencing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045482"></A>
I know that there are some very vulnerable people out there--and I have said it in this House before. As I see it, the real issue here is that, whilst many of our Indigenous brothers and sisters are very vulnerable, they will continue to be vulnerable while we have policies that are not working in some of those communities in question. That concerns me greatly. At the end of the day, it does not matter whether you are in government or opposition: we have to come up with policies that will be advantageous to these people, taking the denial away from these people, making absolutely certain that we give them purpose to progress forward through an education system, through a health system and through a system of worth in the long term. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045484"></A>
In reality, there are a lot of disenfranchised people in our communities in this state. Unfortunately, a lot of them have not had the same opportunities to have an education or have not had access to the good things in life that many of us here in this place and people in other parts of Queensland have. They then fall prey to the criminal element in this state and find themselves in the justice system, brought before the courts by the police. I have always believed that discipline starts at home. We have seen the breakdown of discipline in our schools. I heard the Premier here yesterday talking about bullying in schools and about Dr Carr-Gregg conducting seminars around the state. I applaud this, because the fact of the matter is that these bullies are cowards. When you confront them, they are gutless and they run. I have never been able to tolerate bullies, regardless of where they are or who they may be. I have never tolerated them, and I hope that nobody in this place tolerates them. But the people they intimidate carry those scars indefinitely, in a similar way as those children who have been violated do. Under this legislation that we have before the House today, we need to make certain that the courts and the Sentencing Advisory Council are going to administer right and proper justice to the culprits who are brought before them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045486"></A>
I have always thought about how we can correct some of the anomalies in our society. We are not the federal government, but I have always been a supporter of military service, which I know is used for this purpose in other countries around the world. What comes with military service is discipline. Whether we have military service for the sake of training people in trades or what have you, I think it has its merits in teaching some of these people how to go about their business in a disciplined way and to become upstanding figures in our community and to be proud of being men in our communities. For some of these people who want to go on in life abusing children and abusing women and think it is their God-given right to do so, if they cannot find the right way and if they did not have discipline in the early stages of their life then I think military service is certainly a way for some of these people to right their wrongs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045487"></A>
All of us were brought up in a system of discipline and respect and a system in which other people have to be respected. If you do not respect yourself, you are not going to respect others. That is where we have the breakdown in our community today. In the 20 years I have been in this parliament, on a yearly basis--it has been a common occurrence--we have seen the law strengthened against some elements of society who want to continue to breach the justice system or violate the rules and regulations set down by this government, or any other government for that matter. The difficulty is that the police are subjected to this on a daily basis, and we are seeing the breakdown of society in terms of people not upholding the law. I feel that we have to be tougher on this element of the community who want to continue to breach the laws of this state. The laws are there to provide safety to the greater majority of the community. I just hope that this legislation, along with any other legislation that comes before the parliament to protect people who do uphold the law, will ensure that Queensland will be a better place as a result. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045488"></A>
I trust that this piece of legislation that we are witness and party to today will deliver that. I trust that this bill will make absolutely certain that the justice system will not err on the side of those people who are brought before the courts because they have violated the law in this state--especially violated the rights of the women and children in this state. Until we get that respect and that protection for our children back into this community, we cannot go forward as a progressive democratic state that has rights and that values the needs of its people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045489"></A>
The most important natural resource we have is our children. For God’s sake, let us give those children the right to be children, the right to be adolescents and the right to grow into young adults and be a productive part of our community without their rights being violated by some predator who should be in the bowels of a prison because they do not want to uphold the laws that this state sets in granite. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051183"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (3.20 pm): Rather than ask why in 2010 it is now appropriate to introduce a Sentencing Advisory Council, as was originally proposed by the LNP in 2005 and rejected by Labor, the rational question might now be this: what has Labor done to our judicial system that even it realised its own ideological and policy failures? The answer to that question can be found in the legislation in the last 10 months, ending with the virtual admission of judicial failure in lesser courts with the appointment of judicial registrars, and in higher courts with the Attorney-General appealing manifestly inappropriate sentences from judicial officers whose appointment and skills base are questionable. The second part of the bill completes that admission of failure and I will go into close detail to explain those reasons. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051185"></A>
Labor knows that it is not only seen as being weak on law and order in policy terms, but it is actually seeing the consequences of poor appointments to the judiciary, soft laws and a lack of commitment to punish offenders. This decision to embrace a modified version of sentencing councils obviously was thought by Labor to be the thing to do when you want to look as though you are tough on crime but do not really intend to deliver on anything. Certainly, if the most recent decision made in the case of a serious sex offender is to be taken as some kind of guide, then this sentencing council will have its work cut out for it. If Labor’s poor record is to be considered any guide, then not much is really going to happen. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051186"></A>
With regard to the sentencing council section of the bill, like all members I am very confused by what the Labor Attorney-General in Queensland is doing. If this is not a double backflip with pike, then I missed something. There are two former Attorneys-General in the current parliament who both spoke on the prior bill, as did the current Minister for Education, who is also a man who holds his legal qualifications close to his heart. In September 2005, the member for Murrumba said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051191"></A>
This parliament actually determines the sentences that are to be imposed for different categories of offences. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1051192"></A>
And--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051194"></A>
It would not serve the interests of justice.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051196"></A>
The member for Toowoomba North, who at the time was the Attorney-General, said that the establishment of ‘a sentencing advisory council could seriously compromise the discretionary powers of the judiciary’ and that, critically, since this bill is directed at the Court of Appeal being given direction and its proposed function to give those courts of appeal its views in relation to sentencing guidelines and principles--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051198"></A>
This could be interpreted as an attempt to instruct the courts on what the council considers to be the public’s expectations of sentencing, placing the courts under moral pressure to at least partly assimilate the council’s views into their practice.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051199"></A>
But his final words seem in total contradiction to the bill today. He criticised the member for Surfers Paradise, now the Leader of the Opposition, and I have the speech here. He was stating that in all instances judges should follow the community views in regard to these serious offences. The member for Toowoomba North, who was then the Attorney-General, said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051202"></A>
... judges are sworn to do justice according to law, and that is not necessarily always in line with the views of the community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051203"></A>
At this point, I would like to take the former Attorney-General back to his speech on 29 September 2005. I refer to his speech and his quoting of Sir Anthony Mason, where he alluded to the fact that the views of a statutory body--such as a sentencing council--could undermine the process of courts using their discretionary powers to measure an offence taking into account the circumstances in which it was committed. He quoted Sir Anthony Mason as saying--</Hansard-Body>

Legislatures, in generally leaving courts with that discretion, have recognised that like offences, by reason of differing circumstances in which they are or may be committed, may merit differential treatment by the courts simply because the different circumstances may reveal varying degrees of moral responsibility or blameworthiness.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051206"></A>
Interestingly, what the Attorney-General did not include after that was the words that were included in every piece of literature subsequently published by Sir Anthony Mason. He said in his book <Hansard-Italic>
The courts and public opinion</Hansard-Italic>
, which was republished in 2007, that ‘judges cannot dismiss public opinion as having no relevance in the work of the courts’. To paraphrase his detailed argument, to do less than this is to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051207"></A>
Interestingly enough, the current education minister also spoke on this sentencing principle. He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051209"></A>
The sentencing principles reflect and respect the fundamental constitutional principle of the separation of powers--the executive from the legislature and the judiciary. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051210"></A>
Honourable members like me might look to see what is the difference between the bill introduced by Mr McArdle, the member for Caloundra, in 2005 and the bill we are debating today regarding sentencing councils. We have had five years of delay and five years of embracing this principle alone because then Premier Beattie stated it to be ‘unnecessary and fundamentally flawed’. The current Attorney-General, the member for Greenslopes, said that the Sentencing Advisory Council will help bridge any gap between the community expectation, the courts and the government on the issue of sentencing in the criminal justice question. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051212"></A>
Who is right? The former Premier or the current Attorney-General? The answer is neither because the former killed it off, despite the Labor government in New South Wales and Victoria introducing the same sentencing councils in 2003 and 2004 respectively, but in Queensland--because the Premier was either too slow or just too embarrassed that the opposition showed such determination, imagination and initiative in putting the private member’s bill forward--Labor killed it off. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051213"></A>
Now the Attorney-General has introduced it again five years too late after the horse has bolted and we have all sorts of crazy sentencing going on. We have near community revolt over largely hopelessly inadequate sentences for major sex crimes mainly committed on children. The Attorney-General says that his stewardship of the criminal justice system ‘plays an important role in creating a safe community for all Queenslanders’. Furthermore, the Attorney-General seems completely oblivious to the utter mess going on, because he concluded his second reading speech with these words--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051215"></A>
This bill continues the Bligh government’s commitment to the ongoing modernisation and reform of Queensland’s legal system. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051216"></A>
Someone needs to turn the lights on here for these reasons: one, all of the former Attorneys-General and the former Premier do not think that it is reform; two, the education minister thinks it breaches the separation of powers; three, New South Wales and Victoria did it seven years ago, so does that mean Queensland is seven years behind the southern states in a kind of fixed time warp; and, critically, four, why did Queenslanders have to be treated less safely than any of those Australian citizens for five years? Does one person’s ego and a state border mean so much? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051217"></A>
This is an embarrassment to Labor here in Queensland. The Attorney-General should have just walked in and said, ‘We got it wrong.’ Bob Debus, the former Attorney-General in New South Wales--a Labor man to his bootstraps--said on introducing the sentencing council legislation in New South Wales that it would be ‘an invaluable opportunity for the wider community to make a major contribution to the development of sentencing law and practice in New South Wales’. He was not wrong then. Suddenly, because the Attorney-General and Queensland Labor found it too hot in the kitchen in regard to this issue of law and order or they found a spine, voila we have a sentencing council and the public will have some input into the process.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054274"></A>
What they have subsequently done is to be politically correct and have possibly made it totally unworkable. We have a situation where they involve absolutely everyone including victims of crime--who are certainly major parts of this--Indigenous and vulnerable people, civil liberties councils, juvenile jurists, criminologists, prosecutors, defenders, family and domestic violence experts, and a variety of other people. It will allegedly advise, inform, research and educate on sentencing issues. These, too, are fine aspirational goals. Trying to reach a consensus with all these people certainly tries to reach out to them all, but remember that we have to try to get a result on a very difficult problem.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054277"></A>
I look back and think Premier Beattie spent a good deal of his political life apologising constantly for his ability to make errors and pleading to the community for forgiveness. The public, who are generally very charitable, constantly did so until it reached what was basically a use-by date. This current Labor left-wing government does not bother with any apologies. As all true socialists do, Labor says, ‘Comrades, this is year zero. Everything that went before did not really happen. We are the centre of the universe, aka the Smart State. The Premier is God,’ but she’s an atheist, ‘and all recorded history of the past is wrong because Bligh Labor says so.’ Please, Mr Attorney-General, if you truly aspire to be Premier, get rid of this nonsense, and get out and say it like it is. A sentencing council is sensible. It was sensible in 2005. Labor must apologise for putting mainly our children in harm’s way. At the time Labor were basically too busy trying to win elections and work out who was going to get the best job and the pay rise to go with it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054282"></A>
This response of Labor is really all about backflipping in the face of community--read ‘public’--anger, and the evidence is all too clear from key former government members and now a key cabinet minister in the Bligh Labor government. Either they do not have the heart now or they were too loose with the truth in their beliefs in 2005. If this bill is about Labor gaining redemption via a kind of collective salvation, it is very much mistaken. Salvation is not something that is always recognised immediately. For some, it is the end. For others, the end is the beginning. For most, it is somewhere along life’s path. Life is lived through both discovery and chance. For very few, it is by meticulous design. Sure, there are choices that can lead nowhere and some to a very nasty place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054283"></A>
Labor in Queensland just cannot find salvation. Nearly everything goes wrong and the will seems to be failing, too. Do you know why? Because they cut loose with the truth and they will not confront it when they find it staring them in their face. I would have thought the Attorney-General might see this bill as a seminal moment where he drew a line in the sand that separates him from the former mob and many of the current bunch of losers, but humility was not something he wanted to demonstrate on this bill. </Hansard-Body>

The second part of the bill has an aim of strengthening the penalties imposed upon repeat offenders who commit sex offences against children and offenders who are violent to young children or who cause the death of a young child. The Attorney-General has gone to some lengths to explain the government’s intention by adopting existing common law sentencing principles in statute law. He details that it provides a clear meaning and a message to courts and offenders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054289"></A>
His stated intentions are to give the community greater certainty and confidence in the principles courts must apply in sentencing offenders. Like the Attorney-General, I will discuss both points but from a slightly different point of view. I have been greatly concerned by ongoing statements by government members, the Attorney-General and ministers using confusing terms when the LNP legitimately raises these matters. I have raised the issue of Sir Anthony Mason’s statements. Garfield Barwick has also stated that he has reinforced the view that the Commonwealth, when reviewing criminal matters in the state, must only in extreme circumstances override those product judgements of state legislation placed into law. Mr Justice Michael McHugh in the case of Markarian v The Queen in the High Court of Australia noted that judges who might consistently impose sentences that are too lenient or severe ‘risk undermining public confidence in the administration of justice and invite legislative interference in the exercise of judicial discretion’. What the LNP has been raising is exactly that from our highest courts of Australia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054295"></A>
Sir Gerard Brennan goes further. He stated that the Attorney-General is the guardian of the administration of justice. He is not the guardian of public interest. There is a difference and it is stated very clearly. What he must do when challenged is go to the tribunal. That is the point to which he may refer by clearly stating that he is not the guardian of the parliamentary interest or the public interest in the parliament. What that means is that the parliament is directed to respond to community concerns by providing such careful directions to our courts to assist our citizens. Courts do not exist in a vacuum away from communities, and our highest courts support that view.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054296"></A>
In specific terms, the first principle is about truth in sentencing, Labor style. I say this because this is about ensuring that a child sex offender does serve a prison term in a corrective services facility. The minister has retained the right of the judiciary to have discretionary sentencing. This debate is not about that right. What the minister has gone to great lengths to discuss is the issue of exceptional--and what he described as extraordinary--circumstances that either mitigate prison sentences or vary them in some way. This is ill defined. Certainly the exceptional circumstances rule has failed in other jurisdictions. In Victoria the proportion of serious criminals on suspended sentences has increased from 21.4 per cent in 2005 to 25.8 per cent over the subsequent four years. In New South Wales the same result has occurred. I must ask: why are we allowing ourselves to fall into the trap of repeating a failed strategy of other states without building upon it? These Queensland changes are no different from other states’ jurisdictions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054297"></A>
The Attorney-General has given a very rare example of a matter that rarely comes to court. He is possibly correct when he says that young people do engage in consensual relationships where the female, whilst compliant, is under the age of consent. This has occurred in the past, and I can speak about a case on the Gold Coast of a couple who are now married and are grandparents who 40 years ago were taken through the court process. It would seem entirely reasonable, for this is a reasonable area for the exceptional circumstances rule. It is hard to believe that there are any other applicable circumstances. In my 30 years as a doctor--22 years as a GP and 20 years in Corrective Services as a medical officer--I cannot honestly find any other applicable examples. If the minister honestly believes that he knows of other examples, could he please list them, discuss them and explain why they must be included to allow for the significant diminution in the capacity of this legal change to have teeth? Do not confuse the arguments, Minister. The question I am asking you directly is not about New South Wales, Victorian or Queensland sentencing councils; it is about exceptional circumstances--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054298"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Order! Member for Gaven, you cannot ask the minister a direct question. I have already asked you to refer your comments through the chair. I now ask you to do so a second time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054299"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr DOUGLAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Through the chair, I would ask the minister to address the issue of the exceptional circumstances and to list what those examples might be and why we need to have this included in the bill. I would be very keen to hear a response on it. I am asking you critically about this part of the bill because I believe the bill will pass. I say so because the second principle of this part of the bill is really a path towards the parallel path of truth in sentencing. This is what both the community and offenders want to know. Primarily beyond the 80 per cent serving time of a custodial sentence, the court under this change takes into account the age of the child as an aggravating factor when determining whether a serious violent offender declaration must be made. What worries me and many members here is that currently only 44 per cent of serious sex offenders spend less than three years in prison. Like everything in life, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057389"></A>
This is not an area that has any joy for anyone. A prison sentence for an offender can for the families involved and the children offended upon never really be enough to redress the harm to the victim. Irrespective of any opposing argument from the current Bligh Labor government, we have to have a situation where the rightfulness of community interests is represented in the courts and the judgements of them. This is only sensible in a democracy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057390"></A>
The Sentencing Advisory Council reflects this and should have been put in place five years ago, but a vacillating, incompetent government dithered. Do not think we were fooled then and we certainly will not be fooled again. A large number of these offenders are recidivists. Sex offences against children are heinous crimes that members must not see as a challenge but as a threat to us all. We are all responsible to take serious action. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SHINE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba North--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.40 pm): I am delighted to make a brief contribution to this debate on the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill and the important subject matter before the House. As I understand it, the honourable member for Kawana made some comments with respect to me during my absence at a meeting of the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee in another part of the building. I am yet to read what he said. From what I can gather, he referred to actions or inactions with respect to a sentencing advisory council during the period that I served as Attorney. The member for Kawana apparently quoted my speech in the debate on a private member’s bill in 2005. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057395"></A>
What he misunderstands is my objection to that bill which was not necessarily in opposition to the establishment of a sentencing advisory council but opposition to the model of a sentencing advisory council that was proposed on that occasion. That model sought to remove the discretion of the court by allowing a sentencing advisory council to direct the Court of Appeal. To say that members on this side of the House voted against this very proposal shows a grave lack of understanding of both this bill and the previous bill. Coming from the member for Kawana, I am not surprised by that misunderstanding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057399"></A>
I do enthusiastically support this bill. I support the setting up of this type of Sentencing Advisory Council. As I understand it, that support is widespread within the legal profession--the judiciary, the bar and solicitors as well. Why is it supported? The Attorney in his second reading speech sets out what is envisaged with the creation of this council. He said that it will help to bridge any gap between community expectation, the courts and the government on the issue of sentencing in the criminal justice system. He further indicated that it would promote consistency in sentencing, stimulate balanced public debate on sentencing issues and incorporate informed community opinion into the sentencing process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057401"></A>
The other major part of the proposal is the composition of the council. It is extremely important. As has been pointed out by the Attorney, the composition of the body will be a broad based membership including community representation, as it should. The members will have expertise or experience in the areas of: victims of crime, justice matters relating to Indigenous people and vulnerable persons facing the criminal justice system, experience in domestic and family violence, law enforcement, crime prevention, criminal prosecution, criminal defence representation, civil liberties, corrective services, juvenile justices matters, criminology and criminal law, including sentencing. I think the whole spectrum of community and professional interests will be adequately represented on this body. It will contribute greatly to the enhancement of the criminal justice system generally in this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057402"></A>
Just prior to the last election I led an investigation committee of backbench members, including the members for Woodridge and Springwood amongst others, to Victoria. We were given a very good insight into the sentencing council that operates in that state. It was one of the reforms introduced by Mr Rob Hulls, the current Attorney in Victoria. He is a very reforming Attorney-General as Australian Attorneys-General go. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057404"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Wettenhall:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Hear, hear! </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057405"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SHINE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will take the interjection from the honourable member for Barron River who I know knows him well. It is not surprising. I am sure he got most of his reforming zeal and impetus from the time that he was a resident of Mount Isa and the member for Kennedy in the federal parliament. Nevertheless, we found that a very rewarding visit. It was certainly the resolve of those who went that we should proceed down the path of setting up an advisory council of the nature that the Attorney has proposed to the House today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057406"></A>
In my community of recent times we have had some instances of dissatisfaction about the sentences that a magistrate and a District Court judge have determined were appropriate. It indicates that in the community there is a gulf between the understanding of what happens in the legal process and the community’s acceptance of it. The reason for that is that people simply do not understand why judges come to the decision that they do in many instances. That is partly perhaps because the reasons for the judgement or the reason for the penalty that is imposed may not be sufficiently articulated by the judges or the magistrates involved or it may be, and more likely is the case, that the media do not give a fulsome and fair report of all of the facts of the case which, of course, the judicial officer has to take into account. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057408"></A>
It appears to me, looking at the scheme that the Attorney has suggested in his second reading speech, that what this council will be required to do is assist the community in its understanding of why decisions are made, why penalties are imposed to a certain degree and why they are not imposed to the degree that many in the community would perhaps like to see. It will be an educative function which I think will do a great deal to enhance confidence in the judicial system and the justice system that we have in this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063667"></A>
At the beginning of today’s debate I heard the speech from the member for Southern Downs. It was a repeat of speeches that he has made many times in this place in relation to matters of law and order. It did not really specifically relate to the bill, in my view, and it was repetitive in its essence. I refer him and the House to comments reported on page 1 of the <Hansard-Italic>
Sydney Morning Herald</Hansard-Italic>
 on Friday, 19 June this year under the heading ‘Top judge targets tough jail sentences’ by Joel Gibson, the legal affairs writer for the <Hansard-Italic>

ONE of the state’s most senior sitting judges has made an extraordinary call for a rethink on law and order policy in NSW, saying excessive sentences and imprisonment rates have created a billion-dollar-plus prisons budget without a corresponding increase in public safety.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1060492"></A>
Justice Reg Blanch oversees most of the serious criminal trials in NSW as the Chief Judge of the District Court and spent six years prosecuting them as the director of public prosecutions.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1060493"></A>
He called for a ‘calm review’ of bail laws, standard non-parole periods, mandatory disqualification for some driving offences and the definition of some sexual assaults, which had all contributed to a record prison population of more than 10,000.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1060504"></A>
While Victoria spent half as much on jailing people, he said, ‘I venture to suggest that there is no greater level of safety in NSW and that the level of crime is no less as a result of the increase in sentences.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

A quarter of the state’s prisoners had not yet been convicted of an offence, he said. ‘On the whole it has to be said almost all persons on bail answer their bail and, although there are instances of offences committed on bail, it cannot be said to be a common occurrence.’</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1060508"></A>
Sentencing had also become disproportionate to many crimes, with the result that offenders were held in jail for longer, meaning many had ‘extreme difficulty’ re-integrating into society, he said.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

It is important that we do take notice of the views of eminent jurists throughout the various jurisdictions in Australia, and obviously His Honour Justice Blanch’s views need to be taken into account. I would hope that the Sentencing Advisory Council--one of its functions is to research trends and what is effective punishment--will take into account views similar to those expressed by Judge Blanch in that article in the <Hansard-Italic>

Ms CROFT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Broadwater--ALP) (3.53 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill 2010. This bill forms the next instalment in a raft of legislative reforms this government has passed this year and last year which radically enhance the transparency and accountability of governance in Queensland. In September this year this House in a cognate debate passed the Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill 2010, the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2010 and the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2010. This followed the passage of the Integrity Bill late last year. These are groundbreaking reforms which place Queensland at the forefront of open, accountable and transparent government. There is no other jurisdiction in this country, whether at a state or federal level, that can claim such a broad commitment to open governance and the Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh, should be commended for her vision and leadership in driving these reforms.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060523"></A>
The Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill 2010 continues this journey towards greater participatory democracy through improving the clarity and transparency of Queensland’s sentencing processes. As a proud member of this parliament, it gives me great concern to see our courts and our dedicated and hardworking judges derided in the media. It seems as if every radio shock jock or intrepid foot-in-the-door tabloid journalist is lining up to castigate the courts for what is purported to be lax and lenient sentencing practices. In this hailstorm of opinion and innuendo, the culture of fear drowns out the cold, hard facts. This is unfortunate, because the media has enormous responsibility in informing the public and generating a robust representative democracy, and more often than not they do a sterling job.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060527"></A>
The fact of the matter is that the Queensland government and the court system are tough on crime--tough but fair. Do the crime and, depending on the gravity of the offence, you will do the time you deserve. In the 2008-09 period, nearly 160,000 defendants were convicted in Queensland’s criminal courts. Of these, only 14 per cent were sentenced to a fully suspended term of imprisonment in the higher courts--this is the second lowest rate in the nation--while only two per cent were sentenced to a fully suspended term of imprisonment in the magistrates courts, and this is the lowest rate in the nation. In the Children’s Court, 0.2 per cent were sentenced to a fully suspended term of imprisonment--once again, the lowest reported rate in the nation. These figures demonstrate that persons who commit a serious offence in Queensland are likely to do serious jail time.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060530"></A>
Queensland sends offenders to prison at a rate of 168 per 100,000 persons, which is indeed higher than the national average of 165.6 per 100,000 persons and the world average of 145 per 100,000 persons. Queensland currently has more than 5,600 people in jail which is roughly 1,300 more than the number of inmates recorded in Victoria, despite Victoria having a million more people than Queensland. The Bligh government is proud of its record of keeping the Queensland public safe, but the government of course is always looking for innovative ways of enabling the public to be better involved in developing policy and participating proactively in the decisions that determine how Queensland is governed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060533"></A>
In providing for the Queensland Sentencing Advisory Council, this bill does that. The Sentencing Advisory Council, which is modelled on similar entities in Victoria, New South Wales and the United Kingdom, will be an independent body charged with bridging the gap between community expectations, the courts and the government on complex issues of sentencing criminal offenders. The council will consist of 12 members boasting a wide array of experience and expertise, ranging from Indigenous culture and civil liberties to victims of crime advocacy and criminal prosecution and defence. </Hansard-Body>

As the functions outlined in the bill make it clear, the council will be responsible for providing information to the community to enhance knowledge and understanding of matters relating to sentencing; publishing information relating to sentencing; researching matters relating to sentencing and publishing the results of the research; obtaining community views on sentencing and particular matters relating to sentencing; stating in writing to the Court of Appeal its views on the issue or review of guideline judgements; and, if the Attorney-General requests, advising the Attorney-General on matters relating to sentencing. I note that the reference to guideline judgements has been made towards the bottom of the list. A guideline judgement is a means by which the Court of Appeal can give guidance to sentencing judges. They aim to enhance public confidence in the integrity of the sentencing process and to promote consistency of approach.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063687"></A>
The bill requires the court, when considering whether to issue or review a guideline judgement, to notify the Queensland council and consider its written views unless the court considers that the delay caused in doing so would result in an injustice to a particular appellant in relation to whose sentence appeal the guideline judgement is being sought. Importantly, however, the Court of Appeal retains its discretion to decide whether to issue or to review a guideline judgement.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063689"></A>
While the Sentencing Advisory Council will provide important community input into how the courts sentence criminal offenders, judicial independence will not be compromised. As outlined in detail by the Attorney-General in his second reading speech, the bill also contains important amendments that strengthen the penalty regimes in relation to offences against children and recidivist behaviour. These are to be applauded and, once again, confirm the Bligh government’s commitment to cracking down on serious criminals.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1063690"></A>
I know that in my electorate many residents talk to me about sentencing and about what they read in the media. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations for recently visiting the Broadwater electorate and talking to a group of residents about his role, about the legislation that he has introduced since becoming Attorney-General and what the Bligh government is committed to doing in this area. I commend this bill to the House and I commend the exhaustive work of the Attorney-General and his department in making this legislation a reality. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. MM KEECH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Albert--ALP) (4.00 pm): I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill 2010. This is another example of this Labor government’s commitment to ensuring that our criminal justice system keeps apace with the fast growing Queensland population. One of the important aspects contained in the bill is the principle to be considered by sentencing courts that child sex offenders should spend time in jail except in exceptional circumstances. I do not think there would be many Queenslanders who would disagree with this principle and the courts have been very committed to it in sending child sex offenders to jail. This principle was enunciated by the Court of Appeal in 1996 and has been applied on numerous occasions and reinforced as an important sentencing principle. It is only right that we as a parliament should support our courts in ensuring that this principle becomes part of the legislative framework of our state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063693"></A>
Another sentencing principle that has been stated by the courts is that, when sentencing repeat offenders, the court should take into account the relevant previous convictions as an aggravating factor. This is not to impose a penalty that is disproportionate to the offence that the court is imposing a sentence for, but it would take the penalty into the higher end of the range for that offence. As the explanatory notes state, as at 30 June 2009, of the prisoners under sentence, 60.9 per cent of the males and 48 per cent of the females had previously served an actual term of imprisonment. Queenslanders are then rightly very concerned when an offender comes back before the court on similar charges for similar conduct in a very short space of time. Those offenders have shown a disregard for the law and for the social norms of our society. The High Court has made it clear in Veen v The Queen 1988 that it is the attitude of the court that repeat offenders should be treated as showing a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063695"></A>
As a former minister for child safety, I welcome the fact that another sentencing principle contained in the bill relates to those who commit violence against a child or who kill a child. The Australian Institute of Criminology report titled <Hansard-Italic>
Violence against children</Hansard-Italic>
 concludes the following--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1063698"></A>
Child abuse needs to be tackled on all fronts and if we want to prevent it, we need to provide ... a community which refuses to condone violence against its most vulnerable members.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1063699"></A>
Together with the Attorney-General and this government, I am absolutely committed to ensuring that our community refuses to condone violence against children. When sentencing a person who commits an act of violence against a child, or who kills a child, the court will often look at whether the offender should be declared a serious violent offender. Under the Penalties and Sentences Act, anyone sentenced to 10 years or more jail is automatically declared a serious violent offender. The court also has the power to make such a declaration for those sentenced to lesser terms of imprisonment. The effect of a serious violent offender declaration is that the offender must serve 80 per cent of their sentence before being considered eligible for parole.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063701"></A>
Like other members on this side of the House, I am pleased to support the Sentencing Advisory Council being established by this bill. This is a 12-member council whose role has been outlined already. It is an important council and I certainly support its establishment. It will provide advice to the Attorney-General and it will assist the government in the formulation of policy based on sound research and statistics. The role of providing information to the public and in ascertaining the public’s view on sentencing will build public confidence in the criminal justice system. Research has shown that public misperceptions are rife in relation to every stage of the criminal justice system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063703"></A>
The Victorian Sentencing Advisory Council’s report titled <Hansard-Italic>
Myths and misconceptions: public opinion versus public judgment about sentencing</Hansard-Italic>
 found that, upon looking at large scale surveys of public opinion about crime and punishment in the US, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the public has very little accurate knowledge about the criminal justice system. This Sentencing Advisory Council will then assist in providing members of the public with accurate information on sentencing and sentencing practices.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063705"></A>
Last year the New South Wales council published a report titled <Hansard-Italic>
Public confidence in the NSW criminal justice system</Hansard-Italic>
. This report found that a vast majority--over 89 per cent--of New South Wales residents overestimate the proportion of crime that involves violence or the threat of violence, that 89 per cent of residents underestimate the imprisonment rates for home burglary, that 87 per cent underestimate the conviction rates for assault, that 86 per cent underestimate the conviction rates for home burglary and that a majority of residents--around 81 per cent--mistakenly believe that rates of property crime have increased over the past five years. Although this is a report from New South Wales, I would expect a survey of Queenslanders would reveal similar misperceptions. Therefore, one of the roles of the Sentencing Advisory Council would be to conduct research into sentencing and to gauge public perceptions of sentencing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063706"></A>
Another of the council’s roles will be to provide advice to the Court of Appeal on guideline judgements. The court will be empowered to write guideline judgements and can decide the circumstances in which it will do so. The council will provide advice to the court, which must be considered, although not necessarily followed. Guideline judgements have been used very successfully in New South Wales, with guidance being given on such matters as high-range blood alcohol concentration offences; assaulting police; drug importation; armed robbery; dangerous driving; break, enter and steal; and the effect on a sentence of an early plea of guilty. These judgements provide judges in the lower courts with guidance on how to address certain issues in relation to the sentencing of offenders and lead to greater consistency in sentencing which instils greater public confidence in the process.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063707"></A>
This bill is important legislation for the reasons that I have outlined. I congratulate the Attorney-General, the Hon. Cameron Dick, on his diligent work and I have great pleasure in commending the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.09 pm): I rise today to make a contribution to the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill 2010. The primary objectives of the bill are to establish a Sentencing Advisory Council for Queensland, to give the Queensland Court of Appeal power to issue guideline judgements and to strengthen the penalties imposed upon repeat offenders, child sex offenders and offenders who commit violence upon a young child and/or who cause the death of a young child. In short, the bill seeks to provide sentencing guidelines for adult sex offenders to ensure they serve a jail time that enables them to complete an appropriate rehabilitation program before they can be released. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067100"></A>
The bill is just a continuation of this Labor government’s attempt to show Queenslanders that they have a tough stance on crime. But unfortunately history in this House shows Labor is as soft as a marshmallow when it comes to criminal sentencing. In principle, the Liberal National Party supports the creation of a Sentencing Advisory Council that will help bridge any gap between community expectations, the courts and government on the issue of sentencing criminal offenders. In acknowledging this, the Liberal National Party will be supporting the bill with some amendments. The Sentencing Advisory Council will be an important tool in reviewing decisions of the court to ensure that the sentencing is in line with community concerns and expectations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067101"></A>
An interesting fact to note though is that the Labor government introduces these sorts of bills to try to convince the Queensland public that they are taking a tough stance on crime. Labor is not serious about strengthening criminal sentencing; it only wants a quick headline. For 12 years Labor has resisted mandatory sentencing and this exceptional circumstances rule is not going to deliver real change. Labor’s record of sentencing rapists and child sex offenders is pathetic with more than 38 per cent never serving a day in jail. This law will not ensure that serious sex offenders are locked up for substantial periods of time. A recent <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 article on 3 October 2010 entitled ‘Prison time farce’ stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067102"></A>
Queensland prison systems have been embarrassed by revelations offenders are routinely freed too early or too late as the prisoners do the crime but fail to do the correct time. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067103"></A>
Some of the cases exposed in that article demonstrate the appalling record of this Labor government not only when it comes to dealing with punishment of criminals but also when it comes to ensuring that when sentences are handed down by our court systems those criminals actually complete their full sentence. The list goes on and on, pointing out numerous instances of inmates being released early. This Bligh government cannot even get its sentence days right now, so it is beyond me how it will get it right when it introduces this new advisory council. The majority of Queenslanders have long held the view that this Labor government does nothing to rehabilitate offenders before they re-enter our society. This can be easily converted from viewpoint to fact as the statistics clearly show in the explanatory notes for the bill--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067104"></A>
Queensland Corrective Services confirm that of the prisoners under sentence as at 30 June 2009, 60.92% of the males and 47.8% of the females had previously served an actual term of imprisonment. Strengthening the penalties imposed upon repeat offenders will signal community expectation with regards to recidivism and reinforce the Government’s position regarding offenders who continue to demonstrate an attitude of disobedience of the law. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067105"></A>
Unfortunately, the statistics again point out the Labor government’s stance on crime. If that 61 per cent of males and nearly 48 per cent of females who had already served a term of imprisonment had first served a sentence that was proportional to the crime and also undertaken a rehabilitation program from start to finish regardless of the time spent in jail, then I am sure these statistics would be much lower. The government once again misses the point. Not only do you have to hand down tough sentences to deter offenders; you have to back it up with significant programs to stop them reoffending. Furthermore, you must make sure they complete the programs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067106"></A>
In 2005 the then Shadow Attorney-General, Mark McArdle, sought to introduce this legislation into the parliament of the time. The Labor government voted it down at the time, claiming--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067107"></A>
The member for Caloundra’s proposal would create a new and expensive body to do the job of the courts and the parliament. The government opposes the bill as it is unnecessary and fundamentally flawed.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067108"></A>
The sentences and penalties imposed on convicted criminals have been a cause for concern in the community for some time. Several cases have caused public outrage over the leniency and inappropriateness of the sentence imposed. Within the guidelines outlined in the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992, the sentencing decisions made by the judiciary are supposed to reflect the community’s expectations of an appropriate punishment for the crimes committed. Increasingly this does not seem to be the case, with the wider community becoming increasingly exasperated by sentences that they deem to be too soft for the crimes committed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067109"></A>
The insertion of actual imprisonment for offences of a sexual nature against a child under 16 unless in exceptional circumstances is the only real contentious issue in the bill. The government’s proposal will not overcome the fact 44 per cent of serious sex offenders spend less than three years in prison. The exceptional circumstance rule has failed in other jurisdictions. In Victoria, despite the Labor government stating that wholly suspended sentences should not be used for serious crimes unless exceptional circumstances existed, shadow Attorney-General Robert Clark said that the proportion of serious criminals on suspended sentences had increased from 21.4 per cent to 25.8 per cent since 2006-07. It is clear that the insertion of the exceptional circumstance rule in Victoria failed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067110"></A>
The New South Wales Labor government has had the exceptional circumstance rule in sentencing law for some years and this has done nothing to address the issue of sentencing offenders to weak or questionable terms of imprisonment. In 2003 the New South Wales government enacted legislation that made three significant changes to the Bail Act. As a result of the amendments a court is not to grant bail to a person in respect of an offence of murder unless exceptional circumstances justify the granting of bail; a court is not to grant bail to a person in respect of a serious personal violence offence if the person is a repeat offender unless exceptional circumstances justify the granting of bail; and a magistrate’s decision to grant bail to a person accused of a serious offence can be stayed for up to three days pending a review of that decision by the Supreme Court. In a prior press release my colleague the member for Southern Downs was reported as stating--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067111"></A>
Mr Springborg said an LNP government would ensure sentencing laws reflected community sentiments and provided sentences which would act both as a deterrent and an opportunity for realistic rehabilitation. Short sentences which are no deterrent and convictions which offer no opportunity to attend rehabilitation programs simply increase the risk to the community from re-offenders. An LNP government will reverse Bligh and Labor’s weak sentencing laws and introduce legislation to send a strong message that violent sex offenders will pay an appropriate penalty for their crimes.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1067112"></A>
This is Labor doing what Labor does best: voting down opposition policy that is good for all of Queensland when introduced by the LNP, then waiting a little while and rebadging it as its own. The problem is the members opposite forget that <Hansard-Italic>

Let us look at the bills that this government has voted down since 2007-08: the Criminal Code (Truth in Parliament) Bill 2008--voted down; the Criminal Code (Protecting School Students and Members of Staff from Assaults) Amendment Bill 2007--voted down; the Criminal Code (Assault Against Police and Others) Amendment Bill 2007--voted down; the Criminal Code and Other Acts (Graffiti Clean-up) Bill 2008--voted down; the Criminal Code (Assault Causing Death) Amendment Bill 2007--voted down; the Criminal Code (Gate Crashing) Amendment Bill 2007--voted down; the Criminal Code (Organised Criminal Groups) Amendment Bill 2007--voted down; the Civil Liability (Good Samaritan) Amendment Bill 2007--voted down. Each and every one of the members on the other side of this House voted against these bills. They voted to be soft on crime, to put criminals ahead of victims, and yet they have the audacity to attempt to dupe Queenslanders into thinking that they are the caped crusaders of crime in this place.</Hansard-Body>

 I will ensure, as I did in the 2009 state campaign, that every resident in my electorate is aware of just how soft on crime this Labor government is. Queenslanders, as much as those opposite want to believe it, are not stupid and will not be fooled by meagre attempts to cover up the cold hard truth that Labor is soft on crime, and no grandstanding or adopting LNP policy will change that fact.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067120"></A>
Furthermore, once Labor does put criminals behind bars it has no idea how to properly rehabilitate them and give them the tools to reintegrate into society. Then again, Labor has a bigger problem keeping offenders behind bars for the time frames proposed by the courts. Not only is Labor soft on crime; this attitude permeates deep into the abyss known as Queensland Health which appears to also condone crimes of a sexual nature against its own staff. I raise this issue as there has already been a precedent for the opposition to raise concerns about how Queensland Health handles rape complaints against its own nurses.</Hansard-Body>

Ms BATES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. As I was saying, this issue involved an investigation of an alleged rape, and it does go to exceptional circumstances. We had the same issue pertaining to the safety of Queensland Health workers on the Gold Coast. While I will not comment on the case of an alleged rape of a nurse from the Gold Coast by a doctor on the Gold Coast as it is currently sub judice, what I will draw to the attention of the Attorney-General and the Minister for Health is that this case and the Torres Strait island rape case are not dissimilar. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067160"></A>
As both the Minister and the Attorney-General are aware, I referred this case to the Crime and Misconduct Commission as I believe there has been and continues to be gross misconduct on the part of Queensland Health in relation to the manner in which it handled this case. Unfortunately, the CMC has since referred the case back to Queensland Health so that Caesar can judge Caesar. The bill seeks to provide sentencing guidelines for adult sex offenders to ensure they serve a jail term that enables them to complete an appropriate rehabilitation program before they can be released. Where is the justice for staff who have made allegations of a serious sexual nature and what safeguards will the Attorney-General and the Minister for Health instigate to ensure their own staff are safe? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067163"></A>
Whilst I am well aware that the legal process needs to occur and I am very aware not to prejudice any current cases, I will say that I am appalled that Queensland Health has washed its hands of this incident, when clearly the incident involved only Queensland Health employees at an unauthorised gathering of Queensland Health staff, not unlike the unauthorised gathering of Minister Wallace’s staff at the casino. This issue of Queensland Health’s attitude of not caring for its staff and, worse still, in relation to an alleged rape--</Hansard-Body>

Ms BATES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I will do so. This alleged incident is very like Pontius Pilate washing his hands of all responsibility. The case has already received media attention, yet neither the Minister for Health nor the Attorney-General have investigated claims of how the nurse was treated by her superiors. That is similar to the situation that arose when the Minister for Health commented on the rape of a nurse in the Torres Strait Islands. Last Sunday, the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 printed an article that stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067168"></A>
Queensland Health has responded by strongly denying the claims and defended its handling of the incident by arguing it occurred outside the workplace and was subject to a police investigation “with an unresolved outcome”. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067169"></A>
As I said, that is no different from comments made by the Minister for Health following the rape of a nurse in the Torres Strait Islands. Where is Queensland Health’s responsibility for the safety of its own employees? The nurse was performance managed and the alleged rapist continued to work unsanctioned. It was only when charges were laid that the doctor was stood down. If Queensland Health is providing a supportive workplace for an alleged victim of a rape, how is the management of this case providing ‘a supportive workplace for staff’? How can this government seriously think it can convince Queenslanders that it is tough on crime and serious about protecting the innocent from serious sex offenders when it has clearly shown, in both this case and the case involving the rape of the nurse in the Torres Strait, that it cannot protect its own employees? </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1067171"></A>
Only last sitting in this House we debated the Justice and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, which changed the Bail Act to supposedly deal with the 22,106 offenders who were charged with breaches of the Bail Act. The sentences and penalties imposed on convicted criminals have been a cause for concern for the community for some time. Several cases have caused public outrage over the leniency and inappropriateness of the sentences imposed. As late as the last sitting of parliament, we discussed an alleged sex offender against children in Toowoomba who was given a ridiculously lenient sentence. What will the Attorney-General do about alleged sex offenders who are currently out on bail and in relation to whom it was argued by the prosecution that they would be a flight risk? What protections will be put in place for victims of alleged crimes before they actually go to court? What is the government doing about a serious allegation of a sexual nature alleged against a public servant other than to tell them, ‘Hurry up and get over it’? </Hansard-Body>

Mrs PRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nanango--Ind) (4.25 pm): I rise to speak to the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill 2010. I do so with pleasure because I will be supporting this bill. I do not think anyone in the House would be unaware that I have always believed that often the penalties that are issued by the judiciary are questionable and do not reflect public sentiment. I note that the explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067180"></A>
It is vital that the community has confidence in the sentencing process. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067181"></A>
I am really pleased that in 2010 the parliament recognises that people do not have any confidence whatsoever in the sentencing process. It does not matter whether we are talking about sex crimes, child predators, incidents involving the RSPCA, high-speed pursuits, knife threats, new drivers committing offences, fake election flyers, liquor licensing breaches--whatever it is--people say that the sentences are not hard enough. When it comes to child sex offences or violence against children, I do not think you can be too harsh. I have expressed that opinion in the past. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067182"></A>
I do not believe that anyone who has suffered child abuse in any way, shape or form should be able to use that as an excuse when they do it themselves. People who have been sexually abused protect their children more than anybody else. Parents who were abused, bashed or whatever as children will die before they let their children be abused. I get quite angry when I hear the courts say that an offender was abused as a child. In my book, that is no excuse. It does not make the crime any less horrific for the victims. The truth is that these are heinous crimes and people should be made to pay severely for them. When it comes to child abuse, I have always taken a one-strike-and-you’re-out approach. Who will protect children from the most horrendous things unless we do? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067183"></A>
I recognise that there are difficult cases that the law counts as sexual abuse. For example, if 15- and 17-year-olds are engaging in sex, it can be very difficult to judge a young boy of 17 who may not have been aware that the person he was with was only 15 or 16 years old. Perhaps the girl lied about her age. However, I find it really horrific when the courts do nothing about, for example, a 14-year-old girl living with a 28-year-old man. I speak from experience of this particular example, because it occurred twice in my own electorate. One young girl had a flutter of the heart, so to speak, for a man in his 20s. She decided to leave home and live with the man. In one instance the man was 28 years old, but I cannot remember how old the man involved in the second instance was. The mother was frantic and tried to get assistance from all manner of government departments but could get no help. She tried to get help from the police but was told that, in a nutshell, unless the child--who was infatuated with a 20-plus gentleman--made a complaint, which was not likely, the police could not do anything about it. I find that horrendous. We are talking about a child. If a parent is responsible for their child until adulthood, surely they have the right to protect that child when they are only 13, 14 or 15 years of age. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070568"></A>
I believe that there needs to be some discretion for children aged 15, 16 or 17 who do engage in some sort of sexual act. I do not condone it but, in saying that, there needs to be some sort of discretion for children of those ages. I also support the part of the bill that states that a recidivist offender must serve time in jail. I have no problem with that. I was just discussing that with the member for Gladstone and I said that, if it were up to me--and anyone who perpetrates these acts would be grateful that it is not--I would have them building their own prison in the middle of the desert. There would be 100 miles of desert all the way around. I would make them feed themselves, grow their own food et cetera. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070571"></A>
I know that offenders wear monitoring devices so that the authorities can keep an eye on them once they are released from prison. One thing I would like to see--and I saw this in a movie and I thought it was excellent--is where an offender wore a neck collar and they were partnered with another offender and if they moved more than a few feet from that offender their heads blew up. Quite frankly, for people who offend against children, as far as I am concerned, I do not find that too unacceptable. They have blown up other people’s lives, not just the child’s life but the families’ lives as well. The truth is that they would not reoffend if that occurred. As I said, they would be grateful that I am not in charge and I am not a judge. So we will leave it at that. I have often said in the past that they should at least be chemically castrated. I know that horrifies a lot of people, but that is the way I feel. To perpetrate a crime against a child is the worst possible thing you can do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070572"></A>
Getting back to the bill, I remember some years ago when I first entered parliament that I was quite horrified at the sentencing that went on. I honestly did not believe then that it reflected public sentiment, and I know it does not today to a degree. I spoke with a group of people in New Zealand who had formed what they called the Sensible Sentencing Trust, because they, too, felt that the sentencing in New Zealand did not reflect the sentiment of the community. It is quite a strong group of people. It was formed by parents and partners of victims and victims of crime. They understood the true pain that victims went through and that families went through having lost a child. I know we have Red Ribbon Day coming up for Daniel Morcombe. We must keep in mind the long-term effect these crimes have on families, not just on the victim but also on the families--the brothers and sisters, the mothers and fathers, and the grandparents. It is ongoing for a long time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070575"></A>
I believe there is a lack of respect in our communities and it is starting from childhood. How you overcome it I do not know. You only have to look at the way over the last few years we have said to our children, ‘You must turn the other cheek.’ I know that is possibly a sentiment a lot of people believe in, but there comes a time when children have to stand up for themselves and bullying is one of those times. Children should stand up for themselves and others if they see another child being bullied and go to their assistance. If all else fails, our children need to know how to defend themselves. I advocate that some sort of self-defence knowledge be offered to our children because being bullied is not a good thing. It affects people all through their lives and it can be very hard for them to overcome it. Most times a bully will back down if two or three people say, ‘Go to blazes.’ Other than telling our kids to turn the other cheek, we need to be telling our kids, ‘You need to stand up for yourself.’ Some solutions such as going and telling the teacher are not necessarily the best way to go. The incident needs to be sorted out there and then in the playground. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070576"></A>
I know that criminals serve only a fraction of their time and I know that a lot of cases are not prosecuted. Again, I can refer to something that occurred in my own electorate. An issue was raised with the police, and after some investigation I asked: ‘Why won’t he be prosecuted?’ I was basically told, ‘Just because we are not prosecuting doesn’t mean there wasn’t a crime. It just means that we haven’t got enough evidence to make sure we get a conviction.’ I know that occurs all the time. We only have to refer to the public sentiment that surrounded Gabe Watson. I think that was one of those cases where there was perhaps not enough evidence to ensure that that gentleman got what he may have deserved. The sentiment surrounding that particular case was one of outrage not only here but in America as well. The one sentence that says, ‘It is vital that the community has confidence in the sentencing process,’ is one that has to be addressed because that confidence in the system is just simply not there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070578"></A>
It has been acknowledged here in the parliament on a number of occasions that a similar bill was brought forward by the member for Caloundra five years ago. We see this happen quite often. Bills are brought into the House by non-government members only to be defeated and brought back into parliament months or years later by the government so that the government can claim the legislation for itself. I do not particularly care who introduces the legislation--and I have always stated this. If it is a good idea, it should be adopted immediately. We make amendments in this House all the time. If the opposition or an Independent or whatever party comes into this House in the future brings forward a good idea, no matter how minor, and brings forward a bill, then we should amend it and adopt it there and then. In this instance, five years have passed when something could have been done. I know that we are debating another bill tonight which if it had been amended and adopted immediately would have perhaps prevented a lot of angst. I will support this bill and I look forward to further debate. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (4.36 pm): I rise to speak to the Penalties and Sentencing (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill 2010. In the minister’s second reading speech, he says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1070584"></A>
Sexual offences against children are some of the most disturbing criminal offences in our community, and enshrining this principle into law will ensure that the imposition of an actual jail term is required when sentencing an offender under the Penalties and Sentences Act for any offence of a sexual nature committed in relation to a child under 16 years. Judicial discretion is retained, but it will only be where it can be demonstrated that the most extraordinary circumstances exist that an offender may be sentenced to anything other than an actual term of imprisonment. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070585"></A>
That paragraph encapsulates, I believe, the overwhelming feeling in the community in relation to dealing with people who offend against children, particularly those who sexually offend against children. A great many people in the community read the newspaper and wonder what sort of people can do the things that they do. The smaller the child, the more unacceptable and the more difficult it is to understand. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070586"></A>
I note that the bill amends the act to require that, in sentencing an offender for any offence of a sexual nature committed in relation to a child under 16, the offender must serve an actual term of imprisonment, unless there are exceptional circumstances. I note that the example given is that a court may have, not must have, regard to the closeness in age between the offender and the child. I know the member for Nanango referred to this clause. While I understand the opposition’s wish to remove that from the statute, I can understand the need for there to be a recognition that some relationships do develop at a very young age and that there may be an opportunity for two young people who are in a relationship of trust and intimacy to have that relationship upset by a prison sentence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077306"></A>
I believe that many parents would be concerned at sexual activity between very young people, but it does happen and I think the court does need to have that discretion. However, as the member for Nanango also stated, there are some relationships that are very difficult to accept as being healthy--where one of the participants is a young child under the age of 16 and the other person is a much more mature person. I think that young child also has to have some protection. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077309"></A>
I also believe that the community will welcome the requirement that the court, when determining the appropriate sentence for an offender who has one or more previous convictions, must treat each previous conviction as an aggravating factor if the court considers that it can reasonably be treated as such given the nature of the previous offences. If they are a recidivist and the nature of their conduct is similar and unacceptable and if there is no possible ability to rationalise what they have done then it should be treated as a situation of aggravation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077310"></A>
There are a number of very publicly recognisable repeat offenders in Queensland, and I have not come across one person in my community who accepts their behaviour in any way, shape or form. In fact, members in my community would like the ones who have been cited in this parliament during this debate and the ones who are regularly in the public domain locked up with the key thrown away--and I support them 100 per cent. There is no excuse for it. People in my community see it as an unacceptable toleration on the part of the courts when these people are constantly released and then reoffend. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077311"></A>
This bill also establishes the Sentencing Advisory Council. I note that one of the functions of the advisory council is ‘to provide information to the community to enhance knowledge and understanding of matters relating to sentencing’. I remember when I first got into this place and we were debating a bill on truth in sentencing. I held the view--and I still hold it now--that if a person is given eight years they should serve eight years, particularly for violent offences and sexually based offences. Somebody from the Parole Board contacted me to give me a briefing; it was a pat on the head and a bit of education from their point of view to say that they needed the ability to shorten sentences as an incentive for people to behave in prison. The people I talk to in the community do not hold that view. If people misbehave in prison, extend their sentence; do not reduce it for good behaviour. You can call it simplistic, but that is how the majority of people feel. They are very clear in their understanding.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077312"></A>
I would seek some clarification from the minister on a matter. I believe there is some constraint on judges being able to justify the sentences they provide. I would not like to see the Sentencing Advisory Council become the arm of justification for particularly lenient sentences. There are not too many objections in the community for harsh sentences, unless it is absolutely outstandingly harsh, but there is always criticism of sentences that appear to be too lenient. I do not believe that the Sentencing Advisory Council should have an ongoing role in justifying or explaining lenient sentencing. I would be interested in what the minister understands that clause to mean. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077313"></A>
I note the breadth of the membership of the council. I believe it reflects a very wide range of people: victims of crime; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders; people who have some knowledge or experience in domestic and family violence; vulnerable persons facing the criminal justice system, such as persons suffering mental illness or an intellectual or other disability; those who have knowledge of substance abuse; and those who suffer from homelessness. All of those are factors that can lead to people showing criminal behaviours. I believe that their vulnerabilities have to be represented, but, again, the community would be disappointed if those issues became justification for lenient sentences for violent, serious or sexual offences. I believe that the majority of people in our community are fair-minded, and that is why they expect a fair sentencing structure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077315"></A>
The member for Gregory is passionate in his representation of young children and the vulnerable in our community. He has always been and will always be. I agree with him that our young children in particular deserve and need our protection to the best of our ability, and then some. It is wrong to say that a victim of a sexual offence ever gets over it because they do not. They are forever altered in their thinking, their experience and the way they inform their life into the future. It is important that those who are not killed at the hands of a perpetrator know that justice is done and that it is seen to be done. Appropriate, fair and reflective sentencing is as much a part of their reparation and their repair as it is of making sure that the perpetrator serves an appropriate sentence. I support the bill. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms STONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Springwood--ALP) (4.46 pm): I rise with pleasure to speak on the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill. When I am out and about in the electorate, one issue that comes up regularly in discussion is the lack of community support for some sentences handed down in our legal system. Around the state at barbecues, at community meetings, at Neighbourhood Watch meetings and in general conversation, people are talking and saying that they believe there are some punishments that are not meeting community expectations for the crime committed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077318"></A>
The Law, Justice and Safety Committee’s report into alcohol related violence stated that there is a growing community concern at the lack of sanctions imposed on violent offenders. Some feel that the judiciary is out of step with community expectations and does not impose sanctions that reflect the crime. In acknowledging community concerns over the sentencing of offenders, the Attorney-General, the Hon. Cameron Dick MP, recently announced the establishment of a Sentencing Advisory Council to afford greater community input on how criminals in Queensland are to be punished. In a media release he stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1077320"></A>
... members of the public and victims of crime will have a voice on the new sentencing advisory council, along with experts in law enforcement, criminal law, and juvenile and Indigenous justice issues. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1077322"></A>
The new body will have the opportunity to provide input into guideline judgments prepared by the Court of Appeal on the appropriate sentencing range for a particular offence.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1077324"></A>
It will help bridge the gap between community expectation, the courts and government in deciding criminal penalties. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077325"></A>
The committee supports community involvement in establishing the appropriate sentencing range for crimes involving alcohol related violence. The committee visited a number of late-night entertainment centres around the state where we spoke with management, staff and patrons. There was one issue that all agreed on--that the consequences for crimes relating to alcohol and violence did not match what they thought they should be, that more individual responsibility needed to be taken and that penalties needed to be lifted to fit the crime. That was raised with committee members everywhere we went by all sectors of the community. I really do hope that the creation of a Sentencing Advisory Council means that this area of the law will be looked at and community expectations will be better reflected in sentencing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077326"></A>
A Sentencing Advisory Council is not just about community expectations. It is also about a resource to educate and inform people. The majority of people in the community have little accurate knowledge of crime and the criminal justice system. While we might like to think we do know a lot because we all watch those numerous TV shows about crimes, courts and police, the truth is that we have very little accurate knowledge. I can remember a conversation I once had with a local police officer. I said that I personally felt the judiciary was letting us down with respect to community expectations of fitting punishments for crimes. He replied that he believed that 99 per cent of time they got it right because we do not have all the facts and details when making that assumption. He said that we usually only have what we have heard from the media and that the judiciary had all the relevant details necessary to make a ruling.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080772"></A>
I would have thought that if anybody was going to back me up on my statement it would have been a police officer, but I was wrong in this case. I have to admit that what he said is true; we do not have the accurate knowledge about the system and it is the mass media that does become our source of information on the justice system. He certainly was right in that regard. However, I still believe that the Sentencing Advisory Council will have very good input into bringing about that community expectation in our system to be fair and equal. Research confirms that by educating and giving people more information they then become more confident in the system and less punitive in their opinions of what is needed for a better outcome. I am pleased that included in the functions of the council is a requirement for it to provide information to the community to enhance knowledge and understanding of matters relating to sentencing.</Hansard-Body>

In January 2009, along with my neighbouring parliamentary colleague the member for Woodridge and the former Attorney-General, the member for Toowoomba North, I visited the Victorian Sentencing Advisory Council and questioned its members on their role. We also looked at the types of publications and decisions being made by it. I was impressed with the level of material being distributed by it for both educational purposes and for the decision-making process on sentencing practices. It has been established since 2004. It has done a lot of work with regard to community opinion on sentencing and having those opinions considered in the legal system. I look forward to Queensland’s Sentencing Advisory Council also publishing informative research on the complex nature of sentencing. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr KILBURN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Chatsworth--ALP) (4.50 pm): I also rise to speak to the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill. In doing so, I want to commend the Attorney-General for the leadership role that he has taken in this place in the time that I have been here in bringing bills to this House to improve sentencing in this state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080783"></A>
This bill sets out to do a number of things: to establish a Sentencing Advisory Council in Queensland; to confer jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal to use guideline judgements; to amend section 9 to incorporate two judicial sentencing principles currently applied by the Queensland courts when sentencing criminal offenders--firstly, that offenders convicted of an offence of a sexual nature in relation to a child under 16 must serve an actual term of imprisonment unless there are exceptional circumstances and, secondly, that in determining the appropriate sentence for a repeat offender previous relevant convictions must be treated as an aggravating factor; and, finally, amending section 161B to ensure that in the case of an offender convicted of an offence of violence against a young child or an offence that causes the death of a young child the court must treat the age of the child as an aggravating factor in deciding whether to declare the offender to be convicted of a serious violent offence.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080786"></A>
I have been listening to the debate on this bill, as I try to do with all of these bills. In particular, I have noticed a trend with many of the bills that the Attorney or the police minister have introduced relating to law and justice--that is, that those opposite make lots of comments about the Labor Party’s soft on crime attitude and make very inflammatory and misleading statements that are accidentally, if not purposefully, designed to inflame or instil fear into the community. The statements that we have heard in this place are that there is anarchy on the streets and that law and order is out of control. Unlike the member for Mudgeeraba, who comes in here and says, ‘I have statistics that show that’, I also have some statistics. Instead of saying that I will just table them--they come from the 2009-10 QPS statistical review which looks at crime trends over the past 30 years--I will go over them in detail.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080787"></A>
Let us look at the actual facts about the ‘out of control crime’. I will compare the crime rates to a year that I will randomly choose--1996-97. There is a good year! Offences against the person amounted to 740 per 100,000 people in 1996-97, down to 640 per 100,000 in 2008-09. Murder amounted to 2.2 per 100,000 when the LNP was last in power in 1996-97, down to 1.1 per 100,000. In fact, apart from three years, there is less chance of someone being murdered in Australia now than at any other time in Australia’s history. It is not out of control; there is less chance of being murdered now than ever in Australia’s history. Other homicides amounted to five per 100,000 in 1996-97, down to 2.6 per 100,000 in 2008-09. Assaults accounted for 490 per 100,000 in 1996-97, down to 450 per 100,000 in 2008-09. Sexual offences accounted for 176 per 100,000 in 1996-97, down to 128 per 100,000 in 2008-09. Robbery accounted for 66 per 100,000 in 1996-97, down to 44 per 100,000 in 2008-09. Offences against property are down, as is unlawful entry. When we actually look at the statistics instead of just making them up, as the member for Mudgeeraba does, every category of crime--</Hansard-Body>

Tabled paper:</Hansard-Italic>
 Bundle of crime statistics. </Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080790"></A>
Every category has been trending down over the last five years. That is hardly pointing to crime out of control. It is hardly pointing to anarchy on the streets. In fact, it proves the exact opposite of that: that the actions that this government has taken--its bolstering of the police force and the actions it has taken on sentencing--have actually worked and crime is trending down. Unfortunately, what is trending up is those opposite talking down the judiciary and ratcheting up fear in the community. Those who engage in that--not all of them but a few of them--should be ashamed of themselves because it is a disgraceful act. It is shameful for those members to purposefully instil fear in the community so they can run a political campaign and it is something that they should really think about next time they hold one of their tactics meetings. As I said, it reflects poorly on those members of the LNP who continue to do it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080792"></A>
It is very easy to inflame a mob. It is very easy to join a lynch mob. What is harder is to provide facts and to try to give people the evidence they need to come to a conclusion. As the member for Springwood said, it is easy to jump on the bandwagon after the facts are known. It is hard to go and educate yourself, to go and read the transcripts. We are not in the courts when decisions are made. We do not hear all of the evidence. That is an important thing that I think people need to consider before they react quickly. I do not think it reflects well on any of us to jump to conclusions and make decisions based purely on emotion without taking the time to at least try to educate ourselves. The simple truth is that we have a judiciary that is separate from the parliament, and for good reason. The judiciary is supposed to make those decisions not in the heat of the moment and not based on emotion or based on some MP’s desire to ingratiate themselves with a certain group of people in the community. It is supposed to make those decisions based on fact and evidence and to ensure it is fair based on other decisions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080793"></A>
I am the first to admit, as other members have, that sometimes decisions are hard to justify. Sometimes it is hard to understand why judges make those decisions. That is why we have a system whereby the Attorney can appeal those decisions. Given all of that and given that we have heard constantly from the other side that judges do not reflect community attitudes, I find it surprising that people on that side are so prickly about the fact that we are trying to set up a body to do exactly that. We are setting up an advisory council to advise the judiciary about what those relevant community standards are. I think that is a great thing and I think the government should be commended for actually doing it. As I said, I think it is important that MPs on all sides take the time and use their position not to denigrate the judges and not to denigrate the legal system but to educate people and to constructively engage in the process instead of just making statements designed to incite fear and to build distrust in the judiciary and the legal system. I commend the government and I commend this Attorney-General for the work that he has done to achieve positive outcomes. </Hansard-Body>

Ms GRACE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Brisbane Central--ALP) (4.58 pm): I, too, rise to support the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill 2010. This bill has three major and important functions: to establish the Sentencing Advisory Council, to give the Court of Appeal power to issue guideline judgements, and to strengthen the penalties imposed on child sex offenders and on those who commit an act of violence against a child or cause the death of a child. One of the strengths of Queensland’s criminal justice system is its capacity to change to meet the needs and expectations of the Queensland community. Earlier this year the Attorney-General brought legislation before this House to radically change the jurisdictions of the Magistrates Court, the District Court and the Supreme Court and to make changes to processes such as committal hearings, and I might add that they were excellent changes. Most of these changes take effect from next Monday. The legal profession in Queensland is to be commended for the work it has done in order to be prepared for those changes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080834"></A>
The establishment of the Sentencing Advisory Council is another important milestone in the evolution of the justice system in Queensland. The model the government has adopted is a combination of the best aspects of various councils established elsewhere, with certain characteristics, of course, that make it uniquely suited to Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080838"></A>
Sentencing advisory councils have been established across the world. Some of the work undertaken by these councils has been invaluable in assisting governments to formulate public policy based on proper research and statistics--I emphasise those words, ‘proper research and statistics’--not some of the outlandish comments that we have heard from those opposite in the House this afternoon.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080840"></A>
In 2006 the Victorian Sentencing Advisory Council conducted research into myths and misconceptions about sentencing. We have heard some of those again this afternoon. The council reviewed surveys relating to the criminal justice system which found that public trust and confidence are at critically low levels around the world. I think a lot of the time that comes from not knowing the full details of the case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080841"></A>
This bill is an important tool in ensuring that public confidence in our justice system is maintained at the level it should be. The council is to comprise 12 members. They will come from a broad cross-section of the community and will have experience in relation to a number of very important areas. I want to name some of them because I think they are important. They will have experience in relation to: victims of crime; justice matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; justice matters relating to domestic and family violence; vulnerable persons facing the criminal justice system; law enforcement; crime prevention; criminal prosecutions; criminal defence representation; civil liberties; corrective services, including offender rehabilitation; juvenile justice matters; criminal justice policy; criminal law, including sentencing; and criminology. That is an outstanding array of experience that will be on this council. </Hansard-Body>

The next part of the bill that I want to address is the part relating to the issuing of guideline judgements. This is contained in part 2A of the bill. Allowing the Court of Appeal to issue guideline judgements will give guidance to the lower courts on the appropriate range of sentences for a particular offence, or particular class of offence or offender. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080843"></A>
When the court is considering whether to issue a guideline judgement, the council will be empowered to provide advice to the court. What makes this bill vastly different from the private member’s bill introduced into this House in 2005 by the opposition is that the court will not be bound to follow the views expressed by the council, only to consider its views. I think that is a very important differentiation. Why? Because this maintains the important concept of the judicial independence and ensures that the Court of Appeal retains its discretion. This is an important factor in ensuring the validity of this process. It has to be, and we have to acknowledge that. However, we have seen this afternoon--and we saw it in the last sittings of parliament during the debate on the Justice and Other Legislation Amendment Bill--the scant regard that members opposite have for concepts such as judicial independence. Who could forget the contribution to the debate by the member for Mudgeeraba? She stated--</Hansard-Body>

Far and away the most contentious amendment in this bill is the changes to the retirement age for magistrates. The bill seeks to allow magistrates to retire five years later. This is merely a Labor government ploy to continue Labor appointed magistrates into the future and smacks of jobs for the boys. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

No magistrate should be guaranteed a job for life if they use poor judgement and/or questionable performance in the course of carrying out their duties. Members of a parliament have a performance review every three years. If we do not perform then the electorate ensures we are not returned. Jobs for the boys are in Labor’s DNA. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1080850"></A>
There needs to be a serious reflection of community expectations in terms of punishment for crimes that are committed in our society. The bill before the House contains amendments to the Magistrates Act that alter the retirement conditions. The last thing that Queensland needs is a generation of magistrates who are more interested in occupying chairs than upholding the laws of the state. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

We certainly have a very strong interest in the judiciary.

They say all these words and make all these statements without any evidence. It continues this afternoon and continues every time we have a debate in this House about the judicial system. It really is pathetic that that comes from the other side. After what I have heard this afternoon, thank goodness we are politicians and not members of the judiciary. If we were members of the judiciary, Lord help those outside who came before us. I can only say that I am glad we are elected officials and not appointed to that learned institution of the judiciary. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080858"></A>
This bill does not suffer from the failings of the private member’s bill and will ensure a system that has due regard for the importance of judicial independence. We as a Labor government will ensure that. We will not go on spruiking in this House unnecessary untruths about the judicial system without the full facts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080859"></A>
Another important improvement in this bill compared with the private member’s bill is the establishment of a designated office to provide support to the council. Because the role of the council will involve preparation of documents and the undertaking of research, the human resources component is very important. It is quite unimaginable how the opposition model of a council without support staff could have ever even functioned. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080860"></A>
The next important function of this bill is to enshrine in legislation a number of sentencing principles. The first has been long established in Queensland. In The Queen v Pham in 1996 the Court of Appeal stated that, unless there are exceptional circumstances, those who indecently assault or otherwise deal with children should be sent to jail. I concur with that statement. This judgement has been repeatedly endorsed by the courts and it is considered such an important part of Queensland jurisprudence that the government believes that it should be enshrined in legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080862"></A>
I know that members opposite have criticised the inclusion of the exceptional circumstances exception and have described it as it a get-out-of-jail-free card, like somehow we are playing a game of Monopoly here. But exceptional circumstances mean just that--exceptional circumstances. The courts have considered what this means. As Justice Chesterman has said, to qualify as exceptional the circumstances of the offender or the offence must be properly identifiable as truly out of the ordinary or extraordinary. In another case the court upheld this sentencing principle, rejecting an argument by the defendant that his were exceptional circumstances. As the Chief Justice said in that case, ‘The circumstances were not, in my view, sufficiently unusual to warrant the respondent avoiding incarceration.’ These words are working, in spite of all the hype that we hear often from those opposite. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080864"></A>
Also contained in the bill is a provision to ensure that, in sentencing repeat offenders, previous relevant convictions must be treated as an aggravating factor. This does not mean that the sentence that can be imposed is out of kilter with the actual offence; it means that the courts must take into account the fact that the offender has continued to show a disregard for the law and the community’s expectations. I think that is eminently sensible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080865"></A>
Finally, there is also an amendment to the Penalties and Sentences Act to ensure that a court, when sentencing a person who commits an act of violence against a young child under 12 or who kills a child, must take into account the young age of the child as an aggravating factor in determining whether a serious violent offender declaration should be made. Once again, this is a sensible step in the right direction. Declaring an offender a serious violent offender means that they must serve 80 per cent of their sentence before being considered for parole. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080866"></A>
The community--and I think everyone in this House--abhors violence against vulnerable children and expects the condemnation of the courts in sentencing such offenders. This amendment will strengthen the courts’ ability to impose sentences which reflect community expectations. These are important amendments to the Penalties and Sentences Act and important additions to the criminal justice system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080867"></A>
I would like to commend the Attorney-General and his staff for their commitment in ensuring that Queensland’s justice system is one of the strongest in the country. I am happy to stand up in this House anytime and make the statement that our justice system is one of the strongest in the country. I resent any indications without proper evidence that the contrary is the reality. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind) (5.09 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill 2010. There is no doubt in my mind that the judiciary in Queensland is clearly out of step with community expectations in relation to a whole range of sentencing matters. Only recently we have heard a number of instances where our Attorney-General, our chief law officer, has had to lodge an appeal because he also shares the view that our courts’ decisions have been out of step with community expectations and with what is fair and reasonable.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084623"></A>
It is very timely that we are debating this bill in light of the coroner’s inquest in relation to the investigation and circumstances surrounding the disappearance of Daniel Morcombe on the Sunshine Coast. I believe that our judiciary can certainly do better in relation to a whole range of sentencing matters, which many members from both sides of the House and on the crossbenches have touched on already during this debate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084625"></A>
I have listened to the speeches of the members of the opposition, including the speech of the shadow Attorney-General, but I believe that there needs to be an opportunity for our judiciary to exercise discretion in exceptional circumstances. That is what we are talking about--exceptional circumstances and a window of opportunity to exercise discretion. I believe that our judiciary wants to do the right thing and I believe that there are cases where they should have an opportunity to exercise that discretion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084627"></A>
I believe that the proposed Sentencing Advisory Council is a very good initiative and is well overdue. I was very pleased to see that on that advisory committee there will be a representative of victims of crime. Often we hear sob stories from the person who has committed the offence, yet the poor victim and the victim’s family have to bear it in silence for rest of their lives. So I thank the Attorney-General for recognising the importance of giving our victims of crime a real opportunity to be involved in sentencing in the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084628"></A>
It is very timely that while waiting for this bill to be debated I received a letter, dated 12 October, from a very prominent and reputable legal firm on the Sunshine Coast about a matter that had come before a magistrate on the Sunshine Coast. That matter involved the Transport Operations (Road Use Management) Act. Unfortunately, the magistrate was very critical of the mandatory penalties contained within that legislation that she had to act under. The magistrate encouraged the person involved and their solicitors to write to their local state member of parliament and lobby to have these mandatory penalties changed. Her Worship expressed the view that it was inappropriate for the discretion of the court to be removed as it prevented the magistrate from taking into account the individual circumstances of the case before her. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084630"></A>
It is noteworthy that an experienced magistrate was very critical of the mandatory penalties to be imposed under the act. The legal firm has written to me stating that they are of the view that this matter ought to be taken into consideration when the government undertakes a future review of the legislation. I say to the Attorney-General and the shadow Attorney-General that this evening or tomorrow I will forward a copy of this letter to them for consideration. I will be very interested to hear the government’s position and the opposition’s position. The reality is that the opposition is not just an opposition; in 18 months we may see that opposition form government. No doubt, what we are seeing at the moment is the opposition presenting an alternative case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084631"></A>
I will be very interested to hear the debate on this matter when the bill proceeds to the consideration in detail stage, but at the moment I am of the view that our judiciary needs to have, in my words, a small window of opportunity to exercise discretion, because there certainly are exceptional circumstances that need to be recognised. The case that was raised by the member for Nanango is very relevant. Heck, not everyone is a mature adult at 18 years of age. That is a fact of life. Yet some people are mature way beyond their years at 12 and do horrendous things. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084632"></A>
I look forward to this bill proceeding to the consideration in detail stage. I will be very interested to hear debate on the various clauses and, in particular, discussion on the amendments to be moved by the shadow Attorney-General to have a better understanding of what the opposition is proposing and also to hear the Attorney-General’s response to those amendments. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms DAVIS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Aspley--LNP) (5.14 pm): I rise to briefly contribute to the debate on the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill. It is with some scepticism that I speak about a bill introduced by a long-term Labor government which has long opposed forms of mandatory sentencing yet which now, seeking to appear tough on sex offenders, has opted for the Clayton’s version of mandatory sentencing which appears in this bill. Time and time again we have heard from this government about how tough its sex offender laws are--how they are some of the toughest in the country. Yet here we are supposedly overhauling sentencing laws for child sex offenders by introducing guideline sentencing provisions that add another layer to the work of the Court of Appeal. Surprising, too, is the Attorney-General’s expectation that merely codifying two existing judicial sentencing principles that apply already throughout Queensland’s criminal courts will make any significant difference whatsoever. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084635"></A>
Certainly, like every woman across Brisbane, I was seriously concerned about the serial rapist who stalked our bikeways and pathways for more than two years, particularly because at least one of the attacks occurred on the north side of Brisbane. I was then surprised and then outraged when I learned that the original sentence that was handed down by the Supreme Court was overturned, putting this serial sexual predator back on our streets in as little as 12 years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084636"></A>
As a community, we have a right to know that our parliament is delivering laws that offer real protection to law-abiding citizens from violent rapists and child molesters. Upon looking at some of the statistics that the shadow minister raised in his speech during the second reading stage, it is unsurprising that Queenslanders have no faith in this Labor government to deliver proper sentencing laws. We know from its own statistics that more than 38 per cent of sex offenders did not serve a single day in jail. Perhaps worse, only 16 per cent of such offenders serve more than three years of actual jail time. How can a government possibly claim to have the toughest laws when there is hard evidence before us that the laws are not working? The existing provisions of the Penalties and Sentences Act state clearly that detention as a last resort does not apply to offenders being sentenced for sex crimes against children. Can the Attorney-General tell me how these amendments can make the slightest difference to Labor’s weak sentencing regime? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084638"></A>
I turn now to the amendments being put forward regarding the Sentencing Advisory Council. However the Attorney-General may choose to present it, this policy was first introduced by a coalition--now the LNP--opposition in 2005 and voted down by many of the same members of this government who sit across the chamber--many now red-faced and seemingly a little hypocritical. According to the Attorney-General, this advisory council will have expertise covering a huge area--Indigenous and vulnerable people, victims of crime, civil liberties and juvenile justice to name a few. My fear is that this potentially valuable advisory council may well, in reality, become little more than a talking shop for the great and the good--an exclusive forum for the idealistic and tender minded--which produces no practical results. We have seen this time and time again. I want to hear from the Attorney-General how the selection process for this advisory council will be run, who has expressed an interest to date and just how independent that council will be from political interference. If this council is allowed the freedom to properly review sentencing within our judicial system, I hope that this government realises that it is not going to get the rosy reports it might expect to receive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084639"></A>
At this point can I say that I fully support the amendments earmarked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow Attorney-General. We need to ensure that child sex offenders get the necessary rehabilitation--something that the government’s proposal does not address. In fact, the government’s bill does absolutely nothing to ensure adequate lengths of sentences for such offenders. I believe that ensuring offenders get the right, targeted rehabilitation is crucial to reducing the risk that serious sex offenders pose upon their release. If we are to believe the Attorney-General’s assertion that we will see more sex offenders going to prison, I would hope that there has been some coordination and feedback from Corrective Services as to how much pressure that will put on the current delivery of rehabilitation programs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088278"></A>
At the moment not all programs are offered at each of the prisons and completion rates are average at best. We have talked much about the sex offender today, but it is the victim who deserves just as much attention and support. Sexual assault exacts a range of tangible and intangible costs for individuals, families and communities. A 2004 Institute of Criminology report found the costs of sexual assault totalled $230 million or $2,500 per incident, which is higher than the cost for physical assault as sexual victimisation takes a heavier emotional toll and inflates lost output and intangible costs of crime. The report went on to say that, given the costs of sexual victimisation, even low rates of sexual recidivism are of great concern. So as we debate the issues surrounding sex offenders, it is important to remember that there are victims in these crimes and they deserve to be recognised and supported. To conclude, let me make it clear that we on this side of the House take the sentencing of child sex offenders very seriously and always have done--unlike Labor, which seeks only the quick headline and only to be seen to be doing something. We deliver real laws to ensure effective sentencing that acts as a deterrent, is in line with community standards and ensures proper protection from these offenders. That is something this state Labor government, like those before it, will never deliver. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr PITT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mulgrave--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.21 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill 2010. The bill’s objective is to amend the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992 to establish a Sentencing Advisory Council for Queensland; to strengthen the penalties imposed upon repeat offenders, sex offenders and offenders who commit violence or cause death upon a young child; and to give the Queensland Court of Appeal power to issue guideline judgements. These amendments are intended to provide a more robust and efficient justice system and continue the government’s commitment to the ongoing modernisation and reform of the Queensland legal system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088284"></A>
The creation of a Sentencing Advisory Council will go a long way to bridge the gap between community expectation, the courts and government in deciding criminal penalties. For the first time members of the public and victims of crime will have more direct involvement into appropriate sentencing in this state and have a greater say on how criminals are punished in Queensland. These groups will be represented on the new council, along with experts in law enforcement, criminal law and juvenile and Indigenous justice issues. The aims behind the Sentencing Advisory Council are to promote consistency in sentencing, stimulate balanced public debate and raise awareness about the complexities of the sentencing process. The government acknowledges community concerns about sentencing and recognises that sometimes it may seem that the sentence does not fit the crime. But the public should have confidence in our independent judicial system which has served our state well for 150 years. It should also have faith in the independent discretion exercised by judges in determining sentences based on all the facts and circumstances relevant to a particular case. The Sentencing Advisory Council will help strengthen our system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088285"></A>
The second amendment to the act is strengthening the penalties imposed upon repeat offenders, child sex offenders and offenders who commit violence upon a young child and/or cause the death of a young child. The Queensland government is taking its tough stance on violent crime to a new level, introducing standard non-parole periods to ensure jail time fits the crime. This means that jail time will fit the crime for violent or sexual offences. Again, it also responds to the gap between community expectations and some sentences being imposed for serious crimes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088286"></A>
It is imperative that offenders who commit violent or sexual crimes spend appropriate periods in detention. Enabling the justice system to impose standard non-parole periods will achieve that. Adults convicted of sexual offences against children under 16 years of age will have to serve an actual term of imprisonment unless there are exceptional circumstances. These reforms recognise the seriousness of any form of indecent treatment of a child by an adult and reflect the potentially devastating consequences for young victims. Currently, the law only provides for a maximum sentence. What standard non-parole periods will deliver is a guide for the courts as to how much time a prisoner should spend behind bars. It is different to mandatory jail terms as the judge will still have the discretion to impose a sentence that deviates from standard minimum non-parole periods but will have to provide a detailed explanation outlining reasons. Standard non-parole periods have been credited with making sentences tougher, more consistent and more reflective of community standards in New South Wales where they have operated for seven years. Our new Sentencing Advisory Council will examine what the appropriate length of non-parole periods for violent or sexual offences should be and provide that advice back to government. Crimes to be covered by this new approach include murder, attempted murder, rape, serious assault and sexual offences involving children. This scheme will promote consistency and clarity in sentencing and help meet community expectations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088287"></A>
The third and final amendment to the act is to give the Queensland Court of Appeal power to issue guideline judgements. A guideline judgement is a means by which the Court of Appeal can give guidance to sentencing courts. Conferring jurisdiction on the Queensland Court of Appeal to issue guideline judgements will enhance public confidence in the integrity of the sentencing process and further support consistency of approach in sentencing criminal offenders. These reforms make it crystal clear that the community expects offenders to be punished appropriately for their crimes. It is important that judicial discretion and our sentencing regime reflect both the community’s and the government’s expectations, and I think this bill has the balance right. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind) (5.25 pm): I rise to speak to the Penalties and Sentences (Sentencing Advisory Council) Amendment Bill 2010. I begin by saying that this is a relevant bill for the people of the Burnett because recently there was a case where a businessman, John Gerard Greenalsh, was found guilty of sexually assaulting a teenage boy. He pleaded guilty in the Bundaberg Magistrates Court to two charges of sexually assaulting the boy. As a result, he was sentenced to 10 months probation and a two-month suspended prison sentence by a magistrate. In addition, Greenalsh was ordered to pay $500 as compensation to his teenage victim. I have spoken with the victim’s parents. I have spoken with the parents of other victims. This is the tip of the iceberg. It is unfair and incredible that this man is still able to hold a blue card. That is obviously an inequity in the system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088291"></A>
I will support this bill because it is better than nothing at all. It does take very small legislative steps. The government deserves to be patted on the back for it. But the LNP opposition must also be recognised for introducing a bill of similar intent a few years back. In relation to Greenalsh, I have called on the Attorney-General to appeal the sentence. The Attorney-General told us and the media that it was not his responsibility to do that. I have written to the police minister asking that he appeal the sentence. This is a classic case where a Sentencing Advisory Council would counsel the magistrate and make a finding on this particular sort of sentence.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088292"></A>
I have an alternative policy solution that would, as the minister says in his second reading speech, strengthen the penalties imposed upon repeat offenders, those who commit sexual offences against children and offenders who are violent to young children or who cause the death of a young child. There is a very small outside chance that dangerous sex offenders may serve more time in jail because of this legislation passing. Once again I would note that this legislation is big on headline and small on real substance. The minister said in his second reading speech--</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1088295"></A>
I welcome balanced public debate, but sometimes ‘balanced’ means one thing for the government and another thing for others. Balanced for the government often means debate that is not politically embarrassing and paints the government in the best possible light. I welcome a debate that is warts and all. That is what I call a balanced debate. The minister also said in his second reading speech--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1088297"></A>
The second part of this reform bill aims to strengthen the penalties imposed upon repeat offenders, those who commit sexual offences against children, and offenders who are violent to young children or who cause the death of a young child.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088298"></A>
The proof of whether this legislation will work will only be known after a period of time after this legislation passes. The use of the words ‘aims to strengthen’ does not create great confidence in me. I would have preferred that the minister used the words ‘will show more strength’. ‘Aims’ leaves a great big gaping hole that you could drive a semitrailer through. </Hansard-Body>

Queensland Labor wants to cheat its way to the next election. Optional preferential voting has been used in Queensland for the best part of two decades. Optional preferential voting is used in New South Wales and, despite the fact that the Labor government there is heading for certain defeat, even New South Wales Labor will not stoop so low as to rig the electoral system. Only the corrupt Queensland Labor government would do that. It says a lot that the New South Wales Labor government has more integrity than Queensland Labor. It will certainly lose the next election, yet it will not try to cheat the voters. The only reason Queensland Labor wants to change the system now is to force Greens preferences to go to Labor. This is a desperate, last-minute attempt by the Premier and Labor to cling to power by cheating and rigging the system. In his final report on the Fitzgerald inquiry, Tony Fitzgerald wrote--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1088344"></A>
A fundamental tenet of the established system of parliamentary democracy is that public opinion is given effect by regular, free, fair elections following open debate. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1088346"></A>
A government in our political system which achieves office by means other than free and fair elections lacks legitimate political authority over that system. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088347"></A>
He wrote that in 1989. Twenty years later, the same concerns about the potential for the voting system to be changed to suit the government of the day have arisen. This Labor government thinks it can change the goalposts whenever it suits it, to meet its political desires. It was the Labor government that changed the voting system in 1992 and now it wants to change it back because the Left side of politics is so divided between the Greens and Labor. Labor knows that it is facing political defeat because those who vote 1 Green will not choose to put Labor at No. 2 if they do not have to. If there is anything we remember from Premier Peter Beattie it is ‘just vote 1’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088348"></A>
The argument from the current Premier that optional preferential voting at state elections results in a high informal vote at federal elections does not stack up. Let us examine the facts. The Premier has gone on record as saying that when there is a proximity of federal elections to state elections there is a higher rate of informal votes. Yet when the 2010 federal election occurred we had not had a state election for nearly 18 months. In 2001 and 2004, the federal and state elections were held in exactly the same year, but I have not seen any evidence to show that the rate of informal votes increased markedly in 2010 compared to 2004 or 2001. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

In the 2010, 2007 and 2004 federal elections, Queensland had an informal vote rate that was below the national informal vote rate. In the 2010 election, the Northern Territory at 6.19 per cent and South Australia at 5.46 per cent both had higher informal vote rates than Queensland at 5.45 per cent. Northern Territory and South Australia both have compulsory preferential voting at a state level. In 2007, the Northern Territory at 3.85 per cent, South Australia at 3.78 per cent and WA at 3.85 per cent all had a higher informal rate than Queensland at 3.56 per cent. The Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia all have compulsory preferential voting at a state level. On those numbers alone, it is clear that the argument that somehow optional preferential voting is causing high informal votes in Queensland is simply not true. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1088352"></A>
New South Wales and Queensland are the two states running optional preferential systems for state elections, with New South Wales introducing it in the early 1990s and Queensland introducing it in 1992. The research shows that New South Wales and Queensland, the two states with optional preferential voting, have the lowest levels of informal voting among all the large states for state elections. Let me repeat that: the two states with optional preferential voting, New South Wales and Queensland, have the lowest levels of informal voting among all the large states for state elections. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1088353"></A>
Has this system of optional preferential voting really affected the level of informal voting at the federal level? At the 1984 federal election, in Queensland there was a 4.5 per cent informal vote and at the 1987 federal election in Queensland there was a 3.4 per cent informal vote. Those levels were higher than the three federal elections preceding the introduction of optional preferential voting. While some would argue that trend data would support the argument that optional preferential voting has somehow caused a rise in informal voting at the federal level, to automatically assume that OPV has somehow caused that does not correlate when, as I have previously stated, other states without optional preferential voting have greater rates of informal voting than Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1088354"></A>
At the state level, Queensland has a significantly lower level of informal voting and has remained steady at around two per cent over the past two decades. This level of informal voting is at risk if we move back to a compulsory preferential voting system. However, what did the ‘brains trust’ and Premier-in-waiting say about preferential voting on ABC Radio this morning? I see him sitting there now in the Premier’s chair. He cannot wait to occupy that chair. The member for Greenslopes and former Attorney-General for Tuvalu is already in the chair. He said that the informal vote is increasing in Queensland and New South Wales from the federal election. He said that the Australian Electoral Commission found that and that it has been suggested that there is a correlation between optional preferential and increased informal voting. However, he did not give any real evidence for this correlation, other than to try to spin that the advantage is not necessarily with the Labor Party, other than that somehow the two systems--federal and state--confuse people and increase informal voting. I think that is insulting to the more than two million voters across Queensland. Antony Green, the highly regarded political analyst, wrote--</Hansard-Body>

One innovation that has remained more or less unique to Australia has been preferential voting. (It is better known outside of Australia as the ‘transferable vote’, or in its single-member form, as the ‘alternative vote’.) In almost all other countries, you get the right to cast a single vote for your party or candidate of choice. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088359"></A>
Why is this suddenly an issue when it was not an issue during the 2007, 2004 or 2001 federal elections? I will tell you why. It is because this government knows that without Greens preferences it cannot win on its own merits. What is more, the Premier would have us believe that the federal Electoral Commission has indicated that the two different voting systems at a state and federal level have, as her Attorney said this morning, led to some confusion and a high rate of informal voting at the recent federal election. That is surprising, as voters may have been equally confused by the different voting systems for the Senate and the House of Representatives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088362"></A>
In the instance of the Senate, we all know that there is a choice. You can either vote 1 above the line or vote full preferential below the line. In the House of Representatives there is no choice and all boxes must be numbered. It could be argued that the high informal vote suggests that there should be voting choice for both the Senate and the House of Representatives, which could reduce the high House of Representatives informal vote. The Queensland Senate informal vote was 3.5 per cent, an increase of 1.16 per cent, and nationally the informal vote was 3.75 per cent, an increase of 1.2 per cent. The Queensland House of Representatives informal vote was 5.45 per cent, which was the third highest after New South Wales and South Australia and an increase of 1.89 per cent. Nationally the informal vote was 5.5 per cent, an increase of 1.6 per cent. Interestingly, the largest informal vote increase was from the paragon of intellectualism, the ACT, with 2.35 per cent for a total of 4.66 per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088363"></A>
Of course, if there is a will to reduce informal voting we would be happy to support further voter education. Surely if Labor’s motives were pure it would support voter education over rigging the electoral laws. Any changes to electoral laws must be bipartisan or risk being seen as dictatorial and nothing more than election rigging. The electoral laws are the foundation of our democratic system. In the world there are states and nations where governments change electoral laws to suit themselves, but none that I would want to live in. If at the election the voters of Queensland are waiting with baseball bats or chainsaws to throw out this toxic long-term Labor government after nearly 20 years in power, those opposite should have the integrity and backbone to cop it on the chin. Labor should not manipulate the voting system of this state in an attempt to rort its way back into power. </Hansard-Body>

 (Indooroopilly--LNP) (5.39 pm): I rise to second the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Surfers Paradise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088402"></A>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088403"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr EMERSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Let us be very clear here. The Labor Party are trying to rort the next election by attempting to change the voting system. They fear that the optional preferential voting system--a system introduced as part of the reforms inspired by the Fitzgerald anticorruption inquiry--could cost them power. So now what do they want to do? They want to scrap it for their political advantage. All the ALP are interested in is power at any cost. They will tell mistruths, they will rig elections and they will cheat. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088404"></A>
Of course, electoral rorting is not something new to the ALP. Let us not forget that three of their MPs left this parliament in disgrace as a result of the Shepherdson inquiry into electoral fraud. The Deputy Premier remembers it well, because he appeared before that inquiry. The ALP will do whatever it takes to hold on to power, including break the law. So now we are seeing the ALP wanting to scrap the Fitzgerald inspired changes. We have already seen Labor sell out their supporters with the asset sales. Now they want to sell out what few principles they have left by changing the voting system and cheating to win an election. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088407"></A>
Optional preferential voting was a recommendation of the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission, a body created by the Fitzgerald inquiry. EARC found that a democratic system of voting should not compel electors to express preferences they might not have. The EARC rationale was that ‘encouraging voters to express preferences is ultimately a matter for candidates and parties, not the electoral system’. And optional preferential voting was not new to Queensland. It was first introduced in Queensland in 1892, with first-past-the-post voting restored in 1942 and then replaced in 1962 by compulsory preferential voting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088410"></A>
Optional preferential voting produces a better quality of member of parliament because it allows voters to validly vote for good candidates without voting for all candidates, many of whom may not deserve election. It helps democracy by forcing parties to put up good candidates that encourage people to vote for them. The argument from Labor is that the system is broken--that optional preferential voting is causing confusion and informal votes. Well, let us look at the facts rather than Labor’s mistruths. When optional preferential voting was reintroduced at the 1992 election, a review found that it produced the lowest rate of informal voting at the past 60 Australian state elections. The Electoral Commission declared it a success and made Queensland elections more democratic by extending options for expressing political opinions and reducing the possibility of voter error. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088411"></A>
That informal vote continues to fall at Queensland elections. It was lower at the last state election in 2009 than at the one before in 2006. If anything, this suggests that we should be looking at adopting optional preferential voting at the federal level rather than scrapping it in Queensland. But Labor want to confuse voters--and the evidence for that was at the weekend Walter Taylor by-election. I worked at four booths around that ward on Saturday, and at every booth we saw ALP MPs, ALP councillors, ALP staffers and ALP members telling voters the same thing as they walked into the polling booths--that voters had to number every box. They knew that it was not the truth, but they wanted to cheat to win the election. Fortunately, the voters of Walter Taylor saw through them and that is why Labor got just 16 per cent of the vote. They could not con the voters of Walter Taylor at the weekend. So that is why Labor are trying to con them now and change the voting system to rig the next state election. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088413"></A>
Who has signed up to be part of this grubby, shabby, disgraceful plan to rig the election? The Attorney-General--someone who claims to be a man of principle--is going to review the voting system. The Attorney-General should be ashamed that he has agreed to be part of any deal to undo Fitzgerald inspired reforms and rort the electoral system. Let me remind the Attorney-General and every ALP member here of the words of Peter Beattie. He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1088417"></A>
Optional preferential gives people a choice and I support freedom of choice. The only reason to get rid of it is because of party self-interest.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088418"></A>
As I said, Labor are about power at any cost. The only reason Labor are considering changing the voting system is that the ALP are on the chopping block at the next election. The Treasurer is on the chopping block and the Premier is on the chopping block even sooner. The only way she can keep her job is to promise to rig the next election. Do not let the Premier, the Treasurer and Labor scrap Fitzgerald inspired reforms and sell out the principles of a fair electoral system. </Hansard-Body>

I think it would be a good idea if everyone took a cold shower and traced the genesis of this debate. This debate is occurring not because the Labor Party started it; this debate is occurring because the Australian Electoral Commission, following what appears to be a very high unintentional informal vote in the recent federal election, raised a number of genuine and serious concerns. Nobody can seriously contend that the Australian Electoral Commission is anything other than an independent body charged with the oversight of our democracy and is not a body that should be ignored or treated lightly. </Hansard-Body>

What did it show? It showed that Queensland and New South Wales are the only states that have optional preferential voting and that in the 2010 federal election the level of informal votes lodged in Queensland was 5.634 per cent--an increase from the level of the 2007 federal election of 3.56 per cent. Similarly in New South Wales--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I hear these opposite squawking about Mark Latham. One reason for the apparent increase, according to the Electoral Commission, was that Queensland voters appeared to confuse the state and federal voting systems. The most common reasons that votes were discounted as informal in the recent federal election--the most common reason, not as Mark Latham advocated that you do not cast a vote--was that Queenslanders were numbering their ballot with No. 1 clearly in an attempt to vote for the candidate of their choice. However, that vote did not count for anything because it was discarded as an informal vote. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088426"></A>
Let us deal with some of the mock outrage we are hearing from those opposite. Firstly, we are told that this would somehow rig an election. On that basis, the four elections that John Howard won were rigged. On that basis, the election that we have just had for the federal parliament was rigged. On that basis, the elections of the Victorian, Western Australian and South Australian governments were rigged. I have never heard such a preposterous claim. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088427"></A>
Secondly, there is nothing worse than listening to tories speak with pious sanctimony about Fitzgerald reforms. We have heard two of them already, and I am sure we are going to hear more tonight. But what happened in 1992 when that reform was put to the parliament? They voted against it. They actually moved amendments in the debate to prevent optional preferential voting. Here they are, 20 years later, trying to claim some kind of sanctimonious position when they opposed Fitzgerald then. Perhaps the worst example of hypocrisy--</Hansard-Body>

 What does the member for Southern Downs believe about this issue? The member for Southern Downs is on the record saying that he would change the ‘terribly unfair Queensland electoral system which was keeping Peter Beattie in office’. Mr Springborg said that Queensland’s optional preferential voting system was stacked in favour of Labor and that we need to look at moving towards compulsory preferential voting--and what did the member for Southern Downs say?--‘because I think it gives the best outcome’. That is the member for Southern Downs. He thinks the best outcome is compulsory preferential voting. What a fraud! What a fraud the member for Southern Downs is. </Hansard-Body>

So the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as usual, is spineless on this. He does not stand for anything. He has one position one day and another position the next. Let me be very clear: the government has not resolved itself on this issue. Cabinet has not even considered it. But am I asking questions? You bet I am. Why? Because I do not want Australians to lose their vote. I do not want Australians to be disenfranchised. </Hansard-Body>

One of the most fundamental rights of every Australian citizen in our democracy is the right to vote and for that vote to count. That is what we need to concern ourselves with--not some petty party politics but whether or not people are going into a ballot box believing that their vote has counted and finding in fact that they have inadvertently made an informal vote. We should not tolerate that circumstance, and if it is on the increase then we owe it to the citizens we represent to do something about it. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (5.49 pm): I speak in favour of the amendment moved by the Premier. There is a significant issue falling out of the last federal election and it relates to informal voting in Queensland. What happened in the last federal election? The number of informal votes increased by 50 per cent in Queensland--from 3.56 per cent in 2007 to 5.63 per cent in 2010. This issue was drawn to the attention of the Queensland community by the Australian Electoral Commission the day after the election when the spokesperson for the Australian Electoral Commission raised the concern about the level of informal voting in the media. A few days later, on 28 August, Mr Phil Diak from the Australian Electoral Commission raised concerns about the number of informal votes cast in Queensland by people who did not realise they had to number every box. What we are seeing here is confusion caused by two systems of voting. The two states that have optional preferential voting--Queensland and New South Wales--were the two states with the highest informal vote in the nation. It is not fair for people to unintentionally vote informally and not have a say in democracy. The Premier has said, ‘We will look at this. We will consider this significant issue, as any responsible government should, to ensure our citizens have a full say in democracy.’ We want to see the basis of this problem, the cause of the problem, and ensure that every person in this state has a say and that their voice is heard at the ballot box. That is the Labor tradition.</Hansard-Body>

He said, ‘Under optional preferential voting and the ploy of just vote 1, it’s an impossibility to win a three-cornered contest in almost every circumstance against the Labor Party.’ Who is pushing the ploy now? Then of course we had it all laid out by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on 5 August 2005 when he said that optional preferential voting was ‘terribly unfair’ and that ‘we need to look at moving back towards compulsory preferential voting because I think it gives the best outcome’.</Hansard-Body>

 (Hinchinbrook--LNP) (5.54 pm): From the New Testament story of the Apostle Paul, a conversion on the road to Damascus refers to an abrupt about-face on a serious issue of religion, politics or philosophy. When a single dramatic event causes a person to be suddenly aligned with something they were previously strongly opposed to, it is described as a conversion on the road to Damascus. For the Premier and the Bligh Labor government, that abrupt about-face, that dramatic event, that fundamental change, that single moment in relation to Queensland Labor support for full preferential voting instead of optional preferential voting was Thursday, 9 September 2010 when the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 newspaper published the latest Newspoll for Queensland. The poll showed primary vote support for Labor had plummeted to 29 per cent while primary vote support for the LNP had increased to 44 per cent, the Greens were at 14 per cent and votes for the Independents and other parties were at 13 per cent. The Newspoll showed a two-party preferred result of 43 per cent for Labor and 57 per cent for the LNP.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092617"></A>
Never in the history of Newspoll--which published its first Queensland state voting intention poll in 1985--had Labor’s primary vote fallen below 30 per cent. Indeed, the lowest it had ever been recorded at prior to the September 2010 figure of 29 per cent was in September 2008, exactly 12 months after the member for South Brisbane had been sworn in as the Premier of Queensland, when Labor’s primary vote was down to 38 per cent--a full nine per cent higher than the September 2010 result of 29 per cent. So the current Premier holds the record for leading Labor to its lowest Newspoll primary vote results since Newspoll commenced publishing results for Queensland state voting intentions. Before that you have to go all the way back to December 1986 and December 1987 to find a primary vote result for Labor below 40 per cent. In December 1986 and 1987 Labor was attracting a level of primary vote support of 39 per cent.</Hansard-Body>

The report of the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission, established out of a recommendation of the Fitzgerald inquiry, which Labor at the time treated like its New Testament, was tabled in this parliament on 8 November 1990. It recommended the adoption of optional preferential voting in Queensland. The Parliamentary Electoral and Administrative Review Committee tabled its report on 26 February 1991, supporting the recommendation of the commission’s report to introduce optional preferential voting at state elections in Queensland. Finally, the Goss Labor government introduced the Electoral Bill on 29 April 1992 which implemented optional preferential voting in Queensland and it has been employed at Queensland state elections since 1992.</Hansard-Body>

The member for Murrumba was a minister in that government, and the member for Rockhampton and the member for Sunnybank were government members, having been elected in 1989. Yet they sit here now ready and willing to abandon more of their principles to cling to political power. Those members of the Bligh government who sat in this place during the years of the Beattie Labor government--too numerous to mention--were all part of and beneficiaries of the relentless ‘just vote 1’ campaign that was promoted by Labor when it suited its own political circumstances.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092620"></A>
The pretence that the Premier has advanced in favour of jettisoning optional preferential voting in favour of full preferential voting is the increase in the informal vote at the recent federal election held in August this year, when the informal vote in Queensland was 5.45 per cent. If this was such a disaster, why didn’t the Beattie Labor government rush to implement full preferential voting after the 2004 federal election, when the informal vote in Queensland was 5.16 per cent--only 0.29 of a per cent less than the 2010 federal informal vote in Queensland? The fact of the matter is that at the 2004, 2007 and 2010 federal elections Queensland had an informal vote below the national informal vote. In the most recent federal election--which has supposedly caused the Bligh Labor government so much concern--both South Australia at 5.46 per cent and the Northern Territory at 6.19 per cent recorded informal votes higher than that of Queensland, and both South Australia and the Northern Territory have full preferential voting at their respective state and territory elections.</Hansard-Body>

Just to prove that the 2010 result was not a fluke, at the 2007 election South Australia and the Northern Territory and Western Australia all had rates of informal voting that were higher than Queensland. Like South Australia and the Northern Territory, Western Australia has full preferential voting. The Premier’s argument is completely baseless, it is dishonest and it proves nothing but that she has contempt for the people of Queensland. This conversion on the road to Damascus by the Premier and the Bligh Labor government is not proof that the Labor Party is a disciple of democracy but that Newspoll is its god. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1096494"></A>
The Fitzgerald inquiry was all about that kind of electoral corruption. If I may quote the National Party member for Tablelands at the time, Mr Gilmore, he stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1096497"></A>
There was no suggestion whatsoever by Fitzgerald that ... optional preferential voting should be considered ... preferential voting is the norm for the rest of Australia. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1096499"></A>
Thus sayeth Mr Gilmore, the National Party member for Tablelands in 1992. The climate of the time was, in fact, that we would look at optional preferential voting to see whether it worked. Let me quote from the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission’s report because it was this report, not the Fitzgerald report, which led to the change to optional preferential voting. It stated--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1096502"></A>
The Commission notes that all major parties support retention of compulsory preferential voting ... it is also aware that of the other States only New South Wales has departed from the norm. Unless the Commonwealth were to adopt optional preferential voting for the House of Representatives ... there will be a danger of confusion between elections for the two levels of government in the one State. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1096503"></A>
Nevertheless, it then went on to recommend optional preferential voting. The climate of the times was ‘we will give it a go and see whether it works’. It was hoped that the rest of Australia would follow the example of Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096504"></A>
As EARC stated, all parties supported compulsory preferential voting at the time. May I quote the words of Denver Beanland? He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1096506"></A>
If honourable members examine the preferential voting system, they will see that what is proposed ... is an optional system, something that even Labor Party members are concerned about. I notice that the Premier, Mr Goss, is on the record as saying that that system will be on a trial basis only. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1096507"></A>
That is what Denver Beanland said. I never thought that I would be quoting Denver Beanland with approval, but Denver, in retrospect, you are looking good. The shadow Attorney-General, Mr FitzGerald, said--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1096510"></A>
When the Commonwealth has compulsory preferential voting, why does Queensland have optional preferential voting? It causes confusion. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr BLEIJIE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kawana--LNP) (6.05 pm): At the outset I say that tonight what this is all about has been revealed. The Queensland public has been through 18 years of experimental voting systems and we have found out tonight, revealed by the member for Murrumba, that this has been a trial period. If we can add anything tonight, it would be that this has been one of the longest trial systems I have seen in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096527"></A>
The hypocrisy of this long-term Labor government is outstanding. Can members on this side of the House remember the <Hansard-Italic>

 green paper? Yes, they can, I am sure. Its overview states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1096530"></A>
A civil society depends on public trust in its democratic institutions. Good governance is a prerequisite of good government. A critical issue in good governance is ensuring the integrity of the key participants. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096531"></A>
I submit that key participants in this experiment would be the government and, of course, the opposition. This motion goes to the heart of integrity and accountability and we have seen a lack of these from this lazy, out-of-touch, toxic Labor government. In 2009 we saw a Premier who would say anything to get back into power. Now, in 2010, we see a Premier who will do anything to get back into power. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096532"></A>
Given the recent federal election results in Queensland and the current polling trend, Labor is trying to change the rules and the game and sneak back into office on the back of a Green preferences deal at the next election. The voting method for state elections in Queensland was changed in 1992 by none other than the Labor government. Why? Because it saw political opportunity in doing so. I can hear them in caucus now: ‘Folks, it’s not looking too good this next election, so let’s change the voting system to our benefit.’</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096533"></A>
A study of the history of recent state elections indicates the success of the ‘Just Vote 1’ strategy employed by Peter Beattie at the various elections. At the last federal election in August this year, the LNP recorded a two-party preferred swing to it of some 5.58 per cent. The final statistics on the two-party preferred vote were: the LNP, 55.14 per cent; Labor, 44.86 per cent. On the primary vote, the LNP received 47.42 per cent across Queensland as opposed to the Labor Party, which received just 33.58 per cent. Do members know what I put it down to? The unpopularity and disapproval rating of the Premier who sits on the other side of the House. It is because of that disapproval rating that we are now having this debate. I can imagine the scene in caucus. I know that the Premier does not have many supporters on the government side, apart from possibly the member for Everton. I can imagine the Premier standing up in caucus and saying, ‘Look, I know you want to get rid of me. Attorney-General Dick, I know you want the job, but I am going to pull a rabbit out of a hat. Do you know what it is? We are going to change the voting system. So then we can get members such as the member for Everton just over the line on a dodgy preference deal with the Greens.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096534"></A>
Of the 197,000 Queenslanders who voted for the Greens at the federal election, 75 per cent of those preferences went to Labor. This was a significant factor in Labor reaching its tally of 44.86 per cent--</Hansard-Body>

 Is it any wonder that we are having this debate? A report in today’s <Hansard-Italic>

 states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1096538"></A>
The Premier yesterday revealed she had asked Attorney-General Cameron Dick to assess whether confusion over different voting systems was driving a growing number of informal votes. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096574"></A>
Those opposite are looking at this because they are worried. I will tell members who is worried. The members for Chatsworth, Everton, Broadwater, Cook, Barron River, Toowoomba North, Whitsunday, Southport, Townsville, Springwood, Cairns, Mansfield, Ferny Grove, Pine Rivers, Kallangur, Mount Ommaney, Burleigh, Pumicestone, Mount Coot-tha and Redcliffe would be teetering just on the edge. Some 19 to 20 seats would change hands on the basis of figures taken with a mandatory preferential system. It would be far worse for the Labor Party with the optional preferential voting system. It is no wonder they are toying with this idea. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096577"></A>
The opposition’s motion is for bipartisan support. If we are fundamentally changing a voting system and pattern in Queensland, why not do it democratically and with the support of the government and the opposition? That is all this approach is saying. It is saying, ‘We are happy to talk to you about it, but let us do it for the sake of democracy with a bipartisan approach.’ The Premier says, ‘Rig the elections--it is not rigged when you are just changing the system.’ That is exactly what those opposite are doing here. They are going to change the system to help them at the ballot box. The Attorney-General says that they change their position on bills to suit their agenda. That is precisely what the government is doing here. </Hansard-Body>

(6.10 pm): One of the advantages of sitting on the crossbenches is that we have the capacity to look at motions and bills objectively and with a rational hat on. I must say at the outset that it is extremely disappointing when we see electricity prices increasing, water prices increasing and assets being sold that tonight we are going to have an argument to see which political party gets a greater head start than the other at an election. I believe that this is an opportunity that has been lost by the opposition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096581"></A>
There have been accusations flying from the opposition that the government is potentially trying to rig the next election. It could be argued that the motion in itself could potentially rig the next election. We need to look at this objectively. My very loud and clear message to the LNP tonight is: do not play the victim. Aim for victory. Win the hearts and minds of Queenslanders because they depend on you. You are the alternative government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096582"></A>
The LNP has wasted a golden opportunity to instead argue about who gets the greater head start. It could have used this 60 minutes to stick up for those battling Queenslanders who are hurting. My message to the LNP is: do not run scared 18 months out from the election. This is the LNP’s golden opportunity to create positive alternative policy and not argue about how the race will be won. It will be a level playing field. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096583"></A>
What is the LNP’s policy on tourism? What is the LNP’s policy on the agriculture and farming industries? What is the LNP’s policy on small business? Queenslanders want to know. I am not attacking the opposition tonight; I am giving them a motivational speech, which I have done many times before in the party room--at great cost, mind--and nothing has changed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096584"></A>
The intent of my speech is to motivate the LNP. Stop crawling scared into the rabbit hole. Do not go into the rabbit hole and put out faxes like, ‘They have changed the system. It looks like they are rigging the election,’ because what it would be saying to Queenslanders is, ‘We have already lost the next election.’ Stop playing the victim and aim for victory. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096585"></A>
Where does the LNP stand on accountability? Members of the LNP crossed the floor and voted with the ALP when the Independents decided to call a vote in relation to the Brisbane City Council bill. They wanted a secret civic cabinet where it suited them. That is not accountability. That is not standing up for Queenslanders. They cannot on the one hand fight for accountability and then cross the floor and do the diametric opposite. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096586"></A>
This is what has happened. Every time the Independents have tried to make a noise in this place and stick up for Queenslanders, the LNP has consistently decided to side with Labor--its supposed enemy. Where does the LNP stand in terms of the agriculture and farming industries? When we divided on the coal seam gas moratorium the LNP went across to vote with the ALP. It wonders why Queenslanders are disheartened. It wonders why farmers are ringing the six of us.</Hansard-Body>

There is no alternative government in this state. The people are sick and tired of it. This is the chance for the LNP not to cry victim but to aim for victory. This is exactly what The Queensland Party wants. The Queensland Party will stand for compulsory preferential voting. It is not a part vote and it is not a half vote; it is a full vote. It is a direct reflection of democracy. It will be a level playing field. It will be a fair fight. It will be fought on ideas. Politics is a competition of ideas. The LNP has an 18-month warning. From here on, it should give Queensland an opportunity to have an alternative government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096594"></A>
There is no objectivity.

(6.15 pm): Tonight the member for Murrumba has let the cat out of the bag. He has descended from orbit around Mars into the stratosphere and let the cat out of the bag. The people of Queensland are the oldest guinea pigs in the world. The people of Queensland have been guinea pigs for 17 years. They have been experimented on for 17 years and they do not like it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096598"></A>
What we have now is the member for Murrumba and the Labor leading a crusade to save the people of Queensland. In reality, this is about saving the Labor Party. Those opposite are not able to fix their internal problems so what they are going to do is fix the system. I think it is very instructive, very educational, to actually read the amendment which has been moved by the Premier. If she has success tonight this is what the resolution will read--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1096599"></A>
That this House opposes any change being made to Queensland’s voting system before the next state election unless those changes are in the interests of the democracy. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096600"></A>
What is that code for? It is unless those changes are in the interests of the Labor Party and particularly in the interests of the Premier’s shoulder parrot, the member for Mount Coot-tha, who cannot even get above body temperature when it comes to a primary vote in Queensland. The Premier’s repetitious shoulder parrot sits on her shoulder saying, ‘Anna’s right. Anna’s right. Anna’s right.’ He is the only person that she has left in the party room or even in cabinet that is prepared to support her as her party tries to line up all the others to launch a challenge. When you have a stench of political death around you, you do not want to be stepping up to the plate. She does have that one loyal supporter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096601"></A>
It is true that in times past I have been very supportive of the notion of compulsory preferential voting. I also concede that when we look at the electoral outcomes in Queensland we find that the people of Queensland are enjoying the opportunity to ‘just vote 1’. It gives them the chance to just vote 1--exercise one preference, exercise two preferences or indeed fill out all the preferences. They have an opportunity to just vote 1, give one preference or give more preferences. Optional preferential voting I concede is what the people of Queensland want. I concede that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096602"></A>
Over a period of time, optional preferential voting has certainly been to the disadvantage of this side of parliament. Instead of us rigging the system, do members know what we on this side of the House decided to do? We decided to get our house in order and put our side of politics together so that we are a credible, viable alternative for the people of Queensland. This government has now become the victim of its own success. It has become the victim of the ‘just vote 1’ campaign, which was actually developed by Terry Mackenroth when those on that side of the House did have some intellectual capability and some political nous. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100899"></A>
It was so successful that those opposite do not now like it, because they are divided on their side with the Greens spinning off and everyone else. So they are not prepared to get their house in order; they just want to fix the electoral system to suit themselves. But do you know what? If you can believe them, it is not about fixing the state electoral system--they know that they cannot fix Queensland, or so they say; they are fixing Queensland’s system to fix the federal system. Aren’t they so generous! This is about fixing it up with Julia Gillard. I am not sure if that is the help that Julia Gillard really wants, because she saw all the help that they could give her at the last federal election. It cost her about eight or nine seats in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100900"></A>
The government’s argument is completely erroneous. It is absolutely flawed, because there was generally a 1.5 per cent to two per cent increase in the informal vote right across Australia at the last federal election. That increase had nothing to do with optional preferential voting but a whole lot to do with other factors. This government wants to fix the system to stay in government. It does not want to go out there and prove to the people of Queensland that it is worth being re-elected. That is the fundamental point. Back in 1996 to 1998 we were asked--and there was a lot of pressure on this side of politics--to bring in compulsory preferential voting to suit ourselves. We had the numbers in the parliament to do that. But do members know what happened at that particular time? The government of the day, under Premier Borbidge, said, ‘We do not want to be seen to be fiddling with the electoral system to suit ourselves.’ Now that this government has political death shrouding it, it is prepared to do that. What we have now is one thing that is disadvantaging the Labor Party and we still have a one vote, one value gerrymander, where this government can win with only 46 per cent of the vote.</Hansard-Body>

Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (6.22 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Premier’s amendment, which advances the simple proposition that this parliament should be interested in electoral laws that promote the interests of democracy. That is what the other side takes offence at tonight. If members want to see the biggest example of hypocrisy that has ever been advanced in this chamber, they have just witnessed it. We had five minutes from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition--the loyal member for Southern Downs--who waltzed in here and admitted that, yes, he always had a different view. If you peel away the hypocrisy, for a moment there he inadvertently and transparently admitted why his view had changed and that is that now it is in his own political interests.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100904"></A>
This government is undertaking this debate because it is in the interests of democracy. Imagine if the Electoral Commission had raised this issue and the government had said that we take no truck with the independent Electoral Commission and dismissed the concern out of hand. Commentators and others would have said how dare we be so dismissive of the Electoral Commission. All that has occurred here is that the Electoral Commission--the independent Electoral Commission in this nation--has raised an issue and now there is a debate. Opposition members take such offence at the debate, because in their minds they are already here. In their minds they have already won.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100906"></A>
We heard the member for Kawana list the seats--again, because those opposite are planning on being here. Let me tell them that this is a debate that democracy needs to have in this state. If we take the motion that was moved by the LNP tonight--that only electoral reform that is supported by both sides of the parliament can take place--we would not be having this debate, because we never would have had optional preferential voting because, as the Premier pointed out, they voted against it. If that was the case, optional preferential voting never would have been brought in. I presume that this high-minded veto power of bipartisanship on electoral changes will be falling away the day after the opposition members make it over here--whenever that might be. That is the sword that goes to the argument put by the LNP.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100907"></A>
As the member for Murrumba said, to have the tories in this state walk in here and cloak themselves in Tony Fitzgerald is the height of hypocrisy. Fitzgerald supported free and fair elections. We are talking here about an electoral system that elected John Howard four times in a row. Are they seriously coming in here and saying that John Howard was elected illegitimately? The old desiccated coconut is out and about at the moment. He is flicking his shoulders and twitching his lips all around talk shows while he retails his tome to himself, his hubris puff of his own story. Why do opposition members not ask him if optional preferential voting is an illegitimate system? Of course it is not. What rot! What sophistry! What crap--I withdraw. What rubbish advanced in the name of and dressed up in their own blatant political interests.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100908"></A>
Let us take the substance of the issue for a moment. When it comes to compulsory preferential voting, the notion that that forces anybody’s preference to go anywhere is a nonsense. It forces no preference anywhere. The vote remains with the individual. It is not a matter for the Greens, let alone any other political party. It is not a matter for the Queensland Party, it is not a matter for Family First, it is not a matter for the old National Party, it is not a matter for the new Liberal Party that is being formed; it is up to the individual. No vote can be forced anywhere and to advance the argument denies the reality.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100910"></A>
Let us look at the notion that compulsory preferential voting advances the interests of the Labor Party. I think that the Labor candidate for the federal seat of Melbourne would have a pretty different view. Adam Bandt is the Greens member for the federal seat of Melbourne because of compulsory preferential voting. Take my seat for an example. It is basically a third, a third and a third, with two-thirds of it left of centre. Under compulsory preferential voting, my seat will be under threat. The risk in my seat is that I will lose to the Greens if the LNP runs third and a disciplined LNP ticket elects the Greens over the top. Historically, my seat has been dominantly two-thirds left of centre and one-third to the right. The only risk of losing my seat--the greatest risk--is by compulsory preferential voting being brought in. That is the unmistakeable political analysis that can only be advanced in this circumstance.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100912"></A>
Tonight, because opposition members have already assumed that they have won, they are so shrill. Because they have arrogantly assumed that the next election is theirs, they think that this is an issue. Let me say that those opposite have a much bigger problem than any potential changes to the Electoral Act in the interests of democracy. They have a problem with a leader who stands for nothing, who wants to cut Queensland jobs and who wants to cut public services. The biggest problem that the LNP members have in their electoral interests is the fool who they have elected to be the Leader of the Opposition.</Hansard-Body>

 There was a lot of noise and I wanted to make sure that the unparliamentary word was withdrawn. The temporary Clerk brought it to my attention. I am now satisfied that that word has been expunged. It is impossible to hear at times. I have allowed it, because it was not interrupting the speaker, but it was impossible for the Speaker to hear what was going on. So I think I was fair to both sides.</Hansard-Body>

Mrs PRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nanango--Ind) (7.40 pm): I rise to speak very briefly in this cognate debate on the Seniors Recognition (Grandparents Providing Care) Bill and the Carers (Recognition) Amendment Bill. This debate has been going on for all the years that I have been in parliament, so it is good to see the legislation come to fruition tonight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105243"></A>
Over the years, I and others have brought the concerns of grandparent carers to the attention of this House. We have shared a lot of the frustration that those grandparents have dealt with over the years as they found themselves in a situation that none of them had sought. They became the carers of their grandchildren for many reasons such as the death of the parents, the inability of the parents to care for their children because of drug use or other illnesses, or simply the fact that a single parent could not cope. Whatever the reason children come to be cared for by their grandparents, I believe that it is most appropriate that children are placed with their grandparents because they are known to them. The trauma of losing a parent or parent care, for whatever reason, is enough for a child to deal with. Therefore, placing a child, if appropriate, into a grandparent’s care must be far and away the best option for that child. However, that brings a lot of issues for the grandparents to deal with. As a grandparent, I am looking towards retirement. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs PRATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I have 14 so far. I enjoy it whenever the children come into our household. Our grandchildren come to our home, but we are also named as guardians for five little boys and godparents to four other children. They are probably in my home more than I am, which is quite amazing. I miss every minute that I do not see them. I assure members that they exhaust me no end. However, I would not trade one minute of that exhaustion, because they are the greatest blessing for grandparents. As I think someone may have said already, they are the reward for having children. In saying that, I think about being the proposed guardian of five boys and I would dread anything happening to their parents. Having five boys in the house is a handful for an hour or two. However, we treat them as grandchildren. My partner, Tony, and I do not have the responsibility of actually parenting them, and that is a very distinct difference. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105246"></A>
To have to go from being a grandparent to being the parent again would require enormous changes in your life and in the way that you and the child interact. You then become responsible for their education. You are responsible for their training in terms of the way they interact with society and the way they view the world. It becomes a more serious and a very intense role. At a time when you are expecting to slip into retirement and be comfortable, all of a sudden you are running children to school events and to extracurricular activities, and if their parents are still alive you may have to take them to supervised parent meetings. You run all over the countryside for those children. Therefore, the impact on your financial situation is indeed huge, as is the impact on your emotional and physical wellbeing. All of that has to be recognised, and I believe that it is slowly being recognised.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105247"></A>
Financially, the impost must be enormous. The grandparent carers I have spoken to are all my age and older. I do not think I have yet met one younger than me. The ones who are my age are possibly the youngest grandparent carers and the oldest, if I recall correctly, was 86. At the time, the suitability of having a child go into the care of that grandparent was questioned because of the grandmother’s age. I think in Queensland about 15,000 people have taken on the care of their grandchildren. Would that be right, Minister?</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>
(Mr O’Brien): Order! Member for Nanango, you should refer your comments through the chair. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105251"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs PRATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I beg your pardon. I just looked to the brightest spark in the room who should know. I am sorry about that. Whatever the number of grandparent carers there are in Queensland and Australia, two-thirds are reliant on some form of pension, government allowance or other benefit, which is an awful lot. We should bear in mind that today the average household containing children would have two incomes. For a person on a pension or some sort of benefit, the care of a child or children is a huge impost financially. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105252"></A>
I believe that the government should recognise the fact that there is a huge financial burden placed on grandparent carers and there should be some sort of remuneration for them.  However, to get that remuneration parents should not have to hand over their children to the government. It should be recognised in some form other than by having to sign their children away. I have spoken to many grandparent carers who are concerned about that issue. There are grandparent carers in my electorate who simply have not gone down that path. They struggle from fortnight to fortnight because they belong to a generation of people who are used to doing things for themselves. They are used to making ends meet, whatever it takes. I know a grandmother--the grandfather is no longer alive--who gets food packages, shops at St Vinnie’s and frequents shops that sell cheaper articles. She does everything in her power to make sure that the children are clothed, that they attend school every day and that they have three solid meals every day, but I know she is not doing it easily. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109349"></A>
I think perhaps the greatest toll is the change in relationship between the grandparent and grandchild. Most of us grandparents enjoy the fact that we can love our grandchildren, spoil them and hand them back. So to have to become the disciplinarian--although we are to a lesser extent in that when they come to our house we set the rules and they obey--to become the hard disciplinarian that it takes to be a parent, it has to be recognised that that is a huge change for the family and the child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109352"></A>
The grandchild might be disabled either physically or intellectually. That then adds another level of concern for the grandparent carer. They need respite. They need so much more help than perhaps most of us in this House realise. I am in the grandparenting stage, and I enjoy that. But to all the mothers here who have all the energy that a young mother has, imagine adding 30, 40 or 50 years to your age and having to do the same things that you are doing now. It is not an easy task. As I said, if the child has some sort of physical or intellectual impairment, then it is even harder and there may be confusion if the grandparent carer has not had to care for a child with a disability before. It used to be that grandparents could not access any medical information about the grandchild because of privacy laws. All those sorts of things come into play. They are issues that grandparent carers in my electorate have faced over the years and which at times I may have mentioned in the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109353"></A>
I believe this bill is a good one. I will be supporting it. I also recognise that issues may arise that have not been addressed in the bill. When these matters are raised with the minister, I ask that they not be sat on for six months or 12 months or two years or be there a change of government, a change of minister or whatever it might be. I ask that they be acted on immediately. While it may be a problem or an issue that we hear about, for the people who are living it, it can possibly be a nightmare that they are facing every single day of the week. So, when these issues come up, I ask that they be addressed immediately. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109354"></A>
As I said, this issue has been spoken about at length in this House. I commend both the government and the opposition. There was also a time some years ago when Peter Wellington brought in a bill that went along these lines. As I said before, it has been a debate that has been going on all the time that I have been here. I am pleased to see the bill before the House. I am pleased to support it. I hope it is just the start of many things to come in the future for grandparent carers. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr PITT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mulgrave--ALP) (7.52 pm): I rise to put on record my support for the Carers (Recognition) Amendment Bill 2010. Not only is there a diverse range of caring relationships in our community, but the caring role is spread across the whole community. During this cognate debate, other speakers have covered various aspects of the bill and other issues such as recognition of carers and grandparents by the Commonwealth and in other states; expanding membership of the Carers Advisory Council; how these amendments will benefit full-time grandparent carers; and of course the elements of the private member’s bill, introduced by the member for Burdekin.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109357"></A>
This evening I would like to particularly acknowledge carers in rural and regional Queensland and also Indigenous carers. Principle 11 of the Queensland Carers Charter states--and being from regional Queensland this seems to be an obvious statement but nonetheless true--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1109359"></A>
Remote and rurally based carers face additional difficulties caused by isolation. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109360"></A>
We know that approximately 47 per cent of carers in Queensland live in rural areas. We also know that approximately six per cent of carers in Queensland are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people. In the last financial year the Bligh government committed funds to recruit, train, assess and support foster and kinship carers who, as we know, can include grandparents caring for their grandchildren under kinship care arrangements. Of specific benefit to rural and remote foster and kinship carers, rural and remote allowances were provided to assist with additional costs incurred by foster and kinship carers residing outside metropolitan areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109362"></A>
The Time for Grandparents initiative of the Office for Seniors in the Department of Communities has recently been extended to include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander grandparents providing full-time care for their grandchildren. Under this program, respite and support for grandparents raising grandchildren is provided through the provision of grandfamily camps and recreational activities for grandchildren. These initiatives are just two examples of the way in which the government acknowledges the unique situation of carers in rural and regional areas of Queensland and Indigenous carers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109363"></A>
Carers Queensland has 12 offices across the state, from Cairns to the Gold Coast and west to Roma, and offers the most decentralised carers support of any one carers organisation in Australia. From this it is clear to see that Carers Queensland is for all carers--those in rural and regional areas and also Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander carers. Carers Queensland has also very recently launched a most informative DVD aimed at Indigenous carers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109364"></A>
I wanted to mention that in the lead-up to the debate on these bills I was contacted by Mrs Janet Goessling on behalf of the Cairns and District Grandparents Support Group. Mrs Goessling acknowledged that both bills have some good points and were introduced with the best of intentions--which I do agree with--but she suggested that they did not go far enough. I want Mrs Goessling to rest assured that, firstly, I, along with all members of this House, recognise and value the important role that grandparents play in caring for and raising their grandchildren; and, secondly, that I did take her advice and I have very carefully considered both bills. I would welcome an opportunity to meet with her and other representatives from the support group in the near future to discuss their concerns about what has not been picked up in the bill according to the support group. I thank the Cairns and District Grandparents Support Group for their ongoing advocacy and for taking the time to put pen to paper and letting me know their views. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109367"></A>
In wrapping up, my congratulations to Ministers Palaszczuk, Struthers and Reeves and all departmental officers who have been involved in bringing together the Carers (Recognition) Amendment Bill. It gives much deserved recognition to grandparents providing full-time care for their grandchildren, and initiatives of this government are providing pragmatic assistance for them to undertake this important role. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind) (7.55 pm): In rising to speak to the Carers (Recognition) Amendment Bill 2010 and the Seniors Recognition (Grandparents Providing Care) Bill 2010, I would like to acknowledge the goodwill that is in the House between both sides of parliament. I would like to thank the minister and also the shadow minister. The shadow minister, I think, must be especially congratulated for forcing this issue and taking the initiative in putting together the Seniors Recognition (Grandparents Providing Care) Bill 2010, which has essentially forced the government to respond in kind, and now we have this cognate debate. It is one of those happy circumstances where both sides of the House and of course the crossbenches are agreeing to this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109370"></A>
Grandparents are often left to pick up the pieces and care for their children’s children. A lot of the time when they are caring for their children’s children, as many members have indicated, it is in moments of crisis and often there are other government departments involved. They are often child safety cases. As many members have spoken before, I think that, if children are to be taken from their biological parents and placed in care, the first choice should always be with their grandparents. They should be involved always in the decision-making process. The Grandparent Carers Charter, as stated in the private member’s bill, is to provide a legislative framework for the recognition of grandparent carers and for that recognition to be used as part of the decision-making process on issues that directly affect grandparents. Of course that decision-making process involves the public servants who are working for Child Safety Services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109373"></A>
In my work as the member for Burnett--and all members would agree--there are many sad cases that come through my door on a daily basis. I can remember three cases of grandparent carers coming and speaking to me and asking for help. The first case was where the grandchildren were being transferred interstate to a less than ideal domestic situation. The grandparents told me about the love and care that they had given to their grandchildren. The grandchildren had been living with them for the majority of their lives. They had only ever known their grandparents. They had been taken away from their biological parents because they had been sexually assaulted by a friend of the father while the father and the friend were involved in illicit drug use. We fought hard to stop those children from being transferred interstate to New South Wales. Unfortunately, those children were transferred interstate. I would mention at this point the comparison between the child safety system in Queensland and interstate. In New South Wales they do not have a body similar to the commission for young children. So there is a lesser level of care in New South Wales because they do not have than independent body to look after the grandchildren. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113565"></A>
The second case I remember involved some Burnett grandparents who told me they aged 20 years after they started taking care of their teenage grandson. Once again, the problem involved drugs. He had some horrific behavioural problems, he committed crimes, he was involved in thefts. The grandparents told me how their lives were threatened by their grandchild who was under the influence of drugs and had a sword and how the grandfather said, ‘Go ahead. Kill me,’ when he was demanding money. The local police were very kind and they tried to help as much as they could in this situation. I have to commend the local police in Burnett, but unfortunately the grandparents had to relinquish this grandchild for their own survival.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113573"></A>
The third case involved a grandfather from Toowoomba I have been speaking with recently who was wrongly accused by Child Safety department officers of fathering his own grandchild. We have seen the Minister for Child Safety apologise for that, but I would have to say that it is very saddening that it took the intervention of the media, especially a story by investigative journalists Tony Koch and Amanda Gearing, to actually bring this issue to light.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113579"></A>
I note that the Grandparent Carers Charter has six conditions. As I read them, I get the sense more and more that they are a charter of civil rights or at least the precursor to a charter of civil rights. After experiencing a Public Service that is out of control sometimes when it comes to these decisions, I am thinking more and more that Geoffrey Robertson has got it right--that Australia, indeed Queensland, needs a charter of civil rights to guard against the excesses of the Public Service. In many cases, the decision making is shrouded in secrecy, as with child safety, and then we get to be in the situation where, as the old saying goes, absolute power corrupts absolutely. I know that there are public servants within Child Safety who are not following the rules. In fact, I have referred them on to the CMC, but it is very difficult to speak about the specific cases because at all times you have to guard the identity of the grandchildren. We need to be able to open the system up and shine a little bit of sunlight in.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113582"></A>
Bankruptcy is a big threat to all carers, including grandparent carers. Many members have spoken about that and the financial hardships that grandparent carers face. The problem for grandparent carers from regional centres who are taking the loved ones they are caring for to medical treatment in Brisbane is that the travel and accommodation subsidies need to be increased. I have suggested that they increase the travel and accommodation subsidies to the same level that MPs enjoy. That at least will be a starting point for a debate, because 15c per kilometre and $30 per night is not good enough for our carers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113584"></A>
A problem that I was not aware of that was brought to my attention at a carers conference in Bundaberg recently is that carers lose their accommodation subsidy of $30 and have to pay their full accommodation charges when the people they are caring for are admitted to hospital. In this situation, the carers travel from the regional centres and check into a hotel in Brisbane for a number of nights and as soon as the person they are caring for goes into hospital for treatment that carer who is left in the hotel room then has to pay full price for that hotel accommodation. The gentleman I was speaking to was getting the cheapest possible rate he could of $120 per night. He lost that $30 subsidy for both of them--so around $60--and then he had to pay $120. He said that he could not afford this sort of accommodation and that his only option while the person he was caring for was in hospital was to actually sleep in his car. This horrible situation is happening in Brisbane right now. Regional and rural carers who are coming to Brisbane for medical procedures and care for their loved ones are literally starving and going without food so they can afford the accommodation and travel. I hope the minister and the shadow minister take that into account when constructing future policy and finding solutions for these problems.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113586"></A>
On another issue, it should be acknowledged that all carers, including grandparent carers, have the right to approach their local member of parliament and have that member represent them in an official capacity, including group family meetings. I have recently been in a situation where my constituents have asked me to go along and be with them and advocate for them with senior public servants and those senior public servants have denied those people the right to have their local member of parliament present. That is absolutely an outrage in this democracy. Senior public servants should always be aware of the fact that their constituents can have their local member of parliament representing them. In closing, once again I would like to congratulate both the government and the LNP, with special emphasis on the member for Burdekin and shadow minister, Mrs Menkens. </Hansard-Body>

Ms STONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Springwood--ALP) (8.06 pm): I rise to speak tonight in this cognate debate on the Carers (Recognition) Amendment Bill 2010 and the Seniors Recognition (Grandparents Providing Care) Bill 2010. The Queensland government ensures seniors are valued and active members of Queensland communities through a number of initiatives, including the introduction of the Time for Grandparents respite program, the establishment of the Seniors Legal and Support Service, the Elder Abuse Prevention Unit and the seniors card, which provides discounts on a wide range of goods and services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113592"></A>
This bill recognises the tireless work of Queensland grandparents in the role of primary carers and primary decision makers for their grandchildren. These grandparents are taking on an incredible workload caring for their grandchildren, ensuring safety, care and love is a daily part of their lives. Whatever the reason, they are now the full-time carers of their grandchildren. They often take the role with pride and ask for very little, as it is their way of life--that you look after your family and family will always come first.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113594"></A>
This legislation will give them the recognition they deserve by extending the Queensland Carers Charter to recognise the role that grandparent carers play. It expands the Carers Advisory Council by two to ensure grandparent carers are represented. It extends the function of the Carers Advisory Council to include ‘working to advance the interest of grandparents providing full-time care for their grandchildren and providing general advice to the minister on grandparents’. This will certainly assist to support grandparent carers. I really do hope that those representatives will take their role in both hands and push for important services and the support they need and really argue for the resources and provisions that grandparent carers really want.</Hansard-Body>

Ms STONE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 She is a lovely lady, thank you. Just recently we celebrated her 90th birthday and she received some wonderful celebratory letters--one from the Prime Minister, a beautiful card and words from the member for Sunnybank, and a wonderful handwritten letter from the Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology, Robert Schwarten. I am sure members can imagine how eloquent that letter was from the Hon. Robert Schwarten! The words were something along the lines of, ‘You’ve stuck with the Labor Party through thick and thin and your animosity towards those toffee-nosed tories is outstanding.’ I have to say that Nana enjoyed reading that.</Hansard-Body>

Nanna’s local MP, Peta-Kaye Croft, the member for Broadwater, recently held a lovely community afternoon tea with the Premier. It was at that afternoon tea that the Premier and the member for Broadwater presented her with a certificate, flowers and a wonderful letter from the Premier. She thanks the Premier and the member for Broadwater, as do I and all my family members, for holding that presentation. It was a wonderful afternoon and one that we will always remember with happy thoughts. I have to say that Nanna really did love talking to the Premier. In her beautiful words she said, ‘Anna, I really love seeing you on TV ripping it right into those tories.’ I think everyone should have a Nanna like mine. We will end on the more reserved words of the member for Sunnybank. She wrote, ‘Gwen, you are truly an inspiration to women like Barbara and myself.’ </Hansard-Body>

As I have said in this place before, we have had too many hang-ups about what constitutes a family structure. Until the federal government accepts all family structures as constituting a family, we will never, ever get all that grandparent carers really need. In common with the member for Nicklin, I too hope that this does go on to do more for an extremely wonderful group of people in our communities. I support the Carers (Recognition) Amendment Bill. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs ATTWOOD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Ommaney--ALP) (8.10 pm): I rise to support the Carers (Recognition) Amendment Bill 2010. The bill would include grandparents providing full-time care for their grandchildren within the scope of the Carers (Recognition) Act, achieving the worthy policy intent of the Seniors Recognition (Grandparents Providing Care) Bill but without the adverse consequences of the private member’s bill. The government’s bill, if passed, would help facilitate consultation between government and representatives of grandparents providing full-time care for their grandchildren in the same way that the Carers (Recognition) Act helps facilitate that consultation in relation to carers of people with disability, frailty or chronic illness or pain. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117909"></A>
In recent times, in the course of my role as a parliamentary secretary to the minister for disability services and multicultural affairs, I have met with a number of representatives of carers of people with a disability, frailty or chronic illness or pain including members of the Carers Advisory Council and Carers Queensland. I greatly appreciate the valuable work that these bodies do and, even more, the valuable work that our carers do. All of our carers make tremendous sacrifices to make a better life for the people they care for. Their services are irreplaceable and they richly deserve the recognition that the government bill would give them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117912"></A>
On many occasions now I have met with various carers representatives through the Carers Advisory Council including representatives from Carers Queensland and grandparents to assist the Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs with the significant consultations that have occurred in relation to the government bill and also in relation to the development of the next Carers Action Plan. The legislative recognition of grandparents providing full-time care for their grandchildren is an important step. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117917"></A>
A number of members have spoken about the difficulties experienced by this group of carers, highlighting case examples that are known to them. I know there are many more. Some grandparents raise their grandchildren in an informal situation where the children’s parents are unable to continue their caring role. This may be because of serious ill health or it could be because of abandonment or neglect or even worse. At times, grandparents raise their grandchildren following orders of the Family Court or the intervention of the state child protection system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117918"></A>
The government’s bill would include both grandparents caring for their grandchildren under formal and informal arrangements within this scope. The bill would apply the provisions of the Carers (Recognition) Act to grandparents whose grandchildren live with them and where the grandparents are the primary caregivers and primary decision makers for the children. Because it is so broad, the bill does require grandparent carers to have a court order for it to apply to them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117921"></A>
The bill recognises the day-to-day reality for families rather than only a strictly legal position. Honourable members will note that the bill defines full-time grandparent carers as those who have their grandchild living with them or for whom they are the decision maker. For the purpose of the bill, the term ‘decision maker’ means no more than day-to-day decision making. That is, the term has its ordinary meaning rather than a legal meaning. In this way, the government bill will work to ensure that both informal and formal grandparent carers receive not only the recognition they deserve but also the benefit of government programs and services for grandparent carers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117922"></A>
We have heard from the member for Capalaba that since 2003 the government has been actively assisting carers by way of its Carers Recognition Policy and Carers Action Plan and about some of the important benefits for carers--and the people they care for--that have come out of that. In addition to the features of the current Carers Action Plan mentioned by the member for Capalaba, the plan also includes strategies to help carers within the mental health system, a work-life balance strategy including a self-assessment tool for businesses, and improved information and resources to support carers in their role. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117925"></A>
The Carers Action Plan for 2011-2014 is being developed against the background of strengthened recognition of carers and legislation and strengthened relationships between carer representative bodies and the government. I thank the Carers Advisory Council and Carers Queensland for their active and valuable contribution to the development of this plan. In conclusion, I would like to thank the minister for her ongoing commitment to carers in Queensland. I commend this bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SORENSEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Hervey Bay--LNP) (8.15 pm): I rise to make a short contribution to the Carers (Recognition) Amendment Bill and the Seniors Recognition (Grandparents Providing Care) Bill. Growing up in Hervey Bay, I watched two young children over the years. Their mother died and their father could not look after them, so they went to live with their uncle. Those children resided there for a couple of years and then the father remarried. However, he was in a situation of alcohol fuelled violence. Then they wanted the children returned. More or less, the children were only living with them so the father could receive child endowment, as it was called in those days, to get extra money to purchase alcohol. Sadly, one of those children committed suicide when he was in his early teens because he could not handle being taken from a stable family and put into an alcohol fuelled, violent situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117932"></A>
That is the sad part of this whole debate. Some carers do not have the necessary recognition in the courts so they can actually do something to remedy the situation. I have seen some sad situations, and that particular situation that I referred to occurred when I was only a teenager. I watched that young bloke die. Sadly, a lot of people do not do anything about it when they see this abuse going on. We all say, ‘It’s not our problem.’ But we should do something about it. This legislation that we are debating tonight is only a small step towards recognising the contribution to caring for some of these kids who need to be dragged from a harmful environment. We see this happen in some Aboriginal families where a carer is looking after the children. Then they are the returned to their parents and once again they are faced with a situation of alcohol and drug abuse. That is a pretty sad sight to see.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117933"></A>
If we give grandparents and other carers the ability to look after these children in a good, stable family home we might prevent some of those kids from committing suicide later in life. Those kids can be damaged by being dragged from one situation and being put into another. What is a kid to do when they move from a stable family into something totally different? How does a child adapt to those types of circumstances? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117934"></A>
I believe a lot of grandparents should be given custody of their grandchildren. Almost every day I see the situation--and I guess many other members do as well--in which grandparents try to look after their grandchildren when their daughter or son is abusing drugs. How do you then take that child from a stable family and a stable home life and put them back into a situation fuelled by drugs? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117935"></A>
I was a cared for by a carer for most of my life. I can tell honourable members that the thing that really worries a kid most of all is being taken out of that stable family and put into a situation about which the child knows nothing. That is my contribution tonight. I hope people take on board my comments. </Hansard-Body>

 In the Seniors Recognition (Grandparents Providing Care) Bill which I brought to this House, I gave members an opportunity to set aside politics and allow the parliament to officially recognise these special people who give their grandchildren a home, a family and love at a time of great need. It was a simple aim with an important motive--that is, to place on record our thanks and appreciation. Yet the Labor government ran away from joining with the opposition in that thank you in such a hurry that we are now left with a government bill that is exclusionary and divisive, a bill that fails to understand the needs of the people we set out to help, a bill that insults an unrelated group of people--carers of people suffering illness, disability, infirmity and frailty--by blindly treating everyone who cares as exactly the same. Grandparent carers are a special group of people. Carers are also a very special group of people. They have that in common. They live different lives--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs MENKENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is absolutely a crying shame. Both of these groups of people live different lives with different demands and different needs and they deserve different charters to recognise their efforts. That is the whole point of this bill. They deserve different charters.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117979"></A>
Two years ago I introduced the Carers (Recognition) Act into this House. It was a proud moment for me. It was an opportunity then, as the Seniors Recognition (Grandparents Providing Care) Bill is tonight, to honour something that happens in private homes every day of the year. It is something that is unheralded and unrecognised but something that symbolises what is so special about our community--people who, through the purist of intentions and regardless of the cost to themselves, set out to make another person’s life better. There are thousands of people who do this every day. Carers, through a set of circumstances beyond their control, go beyond the call. They centre their lives on the needs of the person they care for and every aspect of their life changes. Their ability to maintain or make external relationships, their capacity to work, their own health and wellbeing are all secondary to the need of the person they care for. They do it out of compassion and love and kindness.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117980"></A>
The variety of circumstances encountered by carers was nearly unlimited. The charter was designed to reflect special circumstances as well, such as young carers, ageing parent carers, regional and remote carers. It was a proud moment when the Carers (Recognition) Act passed this House because it meant our parliament had paused for a moment and given a salute to these people. In examining the needs of carers in the preparation of that act, it became apparent to me that there was another group of people who also gave up a lot to help others. In a set of very different circumstances but with the same dignity and compassion, grandparents who provide primary care for their grandchildren make a huge difference in the lives of those they help. The process of a grandparent becoming the carer for a grandchild is not an easy one, nor is it a standard one. The unifying factor is that it is often a result of tragedy and trauma. Children may be left without parents because of illness or accidents. Parents may be a risk to children because of drug or alcohol addiction or abusive behaviour. There are parents who neglect children, parents who are mentally or emotionally incapable of raising children and parents who make children’s lives very, very difficult.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117982"></A>
This is where grandparents step into these situations. They are terrible situations. They are emotional situations. They offer a future for these children. The stress on these grandparents comes from all directions. What they see is a sense of failure--that is, that their own children have failed as parents. They have a sense that they are responsible in some way for that failure because they are parents and that is what parents do. It could be a situation where they are surrounded by grief due to the death or illness of their own child. There can also be a lot of anger involved--anger at the behaviour that has led to the abusive behaviour or addictive behaviour of the children’s parents. There can also be the added stress of legal proceedings that may be necessary to formalise the care agreements.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117983"></A>
There is fear around how they are going to provide for their grandchildren. Their lives have changed. The grandparents go through a life-changing experience. There is also anxiety around whether they can provide the best environment. We see the worry with regard to costs. Often the biggest problem is the cost. They worry about how they can afford to pay for food, for schooling and for clothes. They are also alarmed about how they will protect the children from threatening behaviour. Added to that in many cases is pressure from the children’s parents who can be pulling strings from the other side. The grandparents also have huge concerns for their grandchildren, concerns about the emotional impact that these differing stresses will have on their grandchildren.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117984"></A>
They are only a few of the issues. The list of issues goes on and on. Each grandparent family has a different story. Every member in this chamber tonight will have spoken with grandparents who are in those situations. Grandparent families do share circumstances with others, circumstances which are alien to those who have never experienced these stories. From my perspective, that is why it is essential that grandparent carers have a distinct and special charter and that they are not tacked on to the end of the Carers Charter which is, in reality, what the government bill does. Grandparent carers have just been tacked on to the end of the Carers Charter. They are tacked on like an afterthought--a way to avoid an embarrassing situation. When a child begins to settle into life with his or her grandparents--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Down>

 That is exactly how they feel about it, member for Hinchinbrook. I could not agree more.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117988"></A>
Once the grandparents have those children, there is a whole new story. The children need schooling, they need social development and they need to make the most of any opportunity that presents itself. There again we see the grandparent carers assume the responsibility for making it happen. They make a lot of sacrifices. They have to sacrifice their time, their resources and their wellbeing to ensure that these things happen. Of course, most of them are on fixed incomes.</Hansard-Body>

Mrs MENKENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I think the grandparents have enough stress in their lives without having to listen to what is going on in this parliament tonight. Grandparents sacrifice their own time and their own resources. Often grandparents do this at a time in their own lives when they have a reduced earning capacity, they are nearing or in retirement, they are relying on a fixed income from superannuation or pensions. They are having to stretch the dollar when they cannot make more of them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117996"></A>
As I related in my earlier speech, grandparent carers have told me of the choice they have faced between putting food in their own mouths or shoes on their grandchildren’s feet. I have no doubt that the grandchildren in these stories are never barefoot. The result of the efforts of these grandparents is that their grandchildren can continue to develop, to grow and to participate in our community. They grow up with stable, loving families and with their whole lives ahead of them and with opportunities and prospects they otherwise would never have known. For all the sacrifice and dedication, all the grandparent carers crave is a little recognition. To that--</Hansard-Body>

I would like to bring up another matter. There has been a lot of concern expressed in the community, there has been a lot of concern expressed right across the sectors and there has been quite a lot of correspondence going backwards and forwards. A very interesting letter arrived just recently from the Office of the Premier. This letter was written on 19 October. It thanks the recipient for the email of 11 September concerning the Carers (Recognition) Amendment Bill 2010 and the Seniors Recognition (Grandparents Providing Care) Bill. The reply on behalf of the Premier goes on to state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I certainly appreciated the many and varied contributions of those members who spoke to the Seniors Recognition (Grandparents Providing Care) Bill. I certainly thank the member for Hinchinbrook for his very well-researched speech. As always, it was a very balanced speech. It certainly made a comparison and an analysis of both bills and outlined where and why the Seniors Recognition (Grandparents Providing Care) Bill gives far more to grandparents than the government’s bill. The member for Hinchinbrook also outlined the various concerns of the key stakeholder groups--the carers groups and the grandparents organisation. I would like to particularly thank the member for Hinchinbrook for his contribution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118048"></A>
We also heard the contribution from the member for Currumbin which, as always, was an excellent contribution. She also gave an excellent overview of both bills. She outlined the shocking case of a 68-year-old grandmother who was told by the department that she was too old to be a carer. What an appalling situation! That is an example of the heartbreak and anguish that is often experienced by many other people who are faced with these situations. I appreciated also the contributions from the member for Mudgeeraba and the member for Aspley, who gave very compassionate and balanced contributions. The member for Aspley in particular described the role of a carer in a very moving fashion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118049"></A>
The member for Glass House illustrated very well the strengths and value of the separate grandparents charter. The member for Lockyer gave the examples of several grandparent carers in his electorate and also outlined the stressful situations that they experience. The member for Gaven described this debate as the debate that we did not want to have, and I could not agree more. He expressed his disappointment and, with his background of being a compassionate GP, he illustrated the need for the recognition of this group of people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118050"></A>
The member for Coomera pointed out the importance of the decision-making powers of grandparents which is a concern with the government’s bill. As I pointed out earlier, the decision-making powers of grandparents are not acknowledged or legislated for in the government’s bill. The member for Buderim gave a very balanced and compassionate contribution. We know that the member for Kawana can be very provocative, but he certainly gave a very supportive contribution. We also we heard contributions from the members for Hervey Bay, Nanango and Burnett. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118051"></A>
I would have to say that I was quite disappointed with the contributions of the government members, because they were very busy trying to justify the minister’s bill, to which they spoke very strongly. I did not hear any government member shoot holes in the private member’s bill, but by giving full support to the minister’s bill they were able to cover their tracks. They were so busy trying to justify the political motivation behind not supporting, or at least amending, this bill. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1118052"></A>
I remind everyone again that the Seniors Recognition (Grandparents Providing Care) Bill was the first of these two bills to be brought into this House and Labor has just played a game of catch-up. But sadly, in the process of that catch-up game it has watered down the rights of grandparents and carers in a blatant political move. That is why I introduced the Seniors Recognition (Grandparents Providing Care) Bill--to acknowledge those wonderful people and provide official recognition and to give a reminder that their work is noticed and appreciated and their sacrifice acknowledged and recognised. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. A PALASZCZUK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Inala--ALP) (Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs) (8.35 pm), in reply: I rise to speak in support of the Carers (Recognition) Amendment Bill. The Bligh government has a strong record of supporting seniors and carers. I think all of us would agree that grandparents providing full-time care for their grandchildren make an invaluable contribution not only to the lives of their grandchildren but also to the whole of the Queensland community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118055"></A>
Although we recognise the opposition’s intention in seeking to introduce a grandparents recognition bill, the issue with the opposition’s bill is that it is simply unworkable. The bill is unworkable because the opposite sought to define full-time care to be more than 30 hours per week of care. Thirty hours is barely the standard full-time working week. That definition has the potential to include within the scope of the bill grandparents who care for their grandchildren only while their parents are working or grandparents whose grandchildren, together with the children’s parents, live with them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118056"></A>
In this day and age, it is widely accepted that many parents work and grandparents continue to care for their grandchildren while the parents are working. Under the opposition’s bill, if a grandparent was caring for their grandchild five days a week, eight hours a day they would be deemed to be the full-time carers and we as a government simply cannot accept that.</Hansard-Body>

Ms Jones:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 So my mother would be the full-time carer.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118058"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is right. The Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability has raised a very interesting point. Under the opposition’s bill, her mother would be deemed the full-time carer of her son. The opposition’s bill is simply unworkable. Further, the consultation requirements of formal notification and time limits are cumbersome and may discourage effective communication between groups representing grandparents providing full-time care for their grandchildren and the government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118059"></A>
The government is not opposed to the legislative recognition of grandparents providing full-time care for their grandchildren. In fact, the government fully supports the legislative recognition of grandparents raising grandchildren. I believe that the Carers (Recognition) Amendment Bill 2010 would achieve that aim in a much more practical way than the bill introduced by the member for Burdekin. It is those grandparents who step into the shoes of parents, even though their days of raising their own children are behind them, that the government believes should be recognised legislatively. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118060"></A>
Raising grandchildren can have a significant financial impact on grandparents. This often occurs at a time when their income is limited to the pension or earnings from investments. Not only do they have to meet the day-to-day living expenses such as food and clothing for both themselves and their grandchildren; they also have to meet education expenses such as school uniforms, books and excursion fees. They may also have to meet medical expenses sometimes arising unexpectedly and suddenly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118061"></A>
The Carers (Recognition) Act was passed in 2008 with a set of very clear objects, which were to recognise the valuable contribution by carers to the people they care for; to recognise the benefit, including the social and economic benefit, provided by carers to the community; to provide for the interests of carers to be considered in decisions about the provision of services that impact on the role of carers; and to establish the Carers Advisory Council. As a government we did not want to infringe upon the fundamental objectives of this act. What we have aimed to do is to keep the integrity of this act intact. That is exactly what Carers Queensland said to us, and we listened to them very carefully. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122946"></A>
The Carers (Recognition) Amendment Bill 2010 complements existing Bligh government strategies such as Positively Ageless--Queensland Seniors Strategy. If this bill is passed today it will mean that Queensland will become the first state in Australia to legislatively recognise these grandparents. The government’s bill is both symbolic and practical. It is symbolic in that it would give long overdue recognition to Queensland grandparents who provide full-time care for their grandchildren and it is practical in that it would require public authorities to reflect the principles of the Queensland Carers Charter in providing information that affects grandparents raising grandchildren. The charter would also contain principles specifically applicable to grandparents raising grandchildren. The bill would also require public authorities to consult with representatives of grandparents raising grandchildren in relation to policy and planning decisions that affect them. The bill would contribute to the continuation of the meaningful dialogue established between the government and representatives of grandparents raising grandchildren that has taken place during the development of this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122947"></A>
The amendment recognises grandparents who have the full-time care of their grandchildren because parents do not have the capacity to be full-time carers. This could be for a range of reasons. For instance, it could include parents going through a period of crisis such as a serious medical illness. While protecting the integrity of the Carers Act, which is fundamental to Carers Queensland, through this bill we will extend the definition of carer to recognise grandparents as full-time carers for their grandchildren where the child lives with the grandparent and the grandparent is the primary caregiver and the day-to-day decision maker for that child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122948"></A>
We will expand the membership of the Carers Advisory Council by two positions to provide for a grandparent carer providing full-time care for their grandchild as well as a member of a representative body of grandparent carers. We will amend the existing Queensland Carers Charter, again established under the Queensland Carers Act, to include recognition of the invaluable role that grandparents providing full-time care for their grandchildren play in the lives of their grandchildren and to include a further two new principles in the charter which would recognise grandparents providing full-time care for their grandchildren and assure them of access to information that supports them in their role. This access to information that supports them in their caring role is very important. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122949"></A>
However, it is important to note that these amendments to the Carers Act will not create individual rights, nor will they determine if a grandparent carer is the legal guardian of a child. A number of members have spoken about a grandparent carer who, although not the legal guardian of their grandchildren, is nevertheless doing the day-to-day, week in, week out care for their grandchildren and, for all intents and purposes, is the day-to-day decision maker. However, of course, many of these grandparents will not have legal guardianship. This is appropriately an issue for parenting orders by the Family Court or, where a child is in need of protection, child protection orders by the Children’s Court under the Child Protection Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122950"></A>
The amendments to the Carers Act will not change issues in relation to the guardianship of a child. However, what these amendments will do is ensure that grandparents have access to, for example, the services currently offered by carers organisations such as Carers Queensland. I am very pleased to say that the Queensland government funds Carers Queensland to the tune of $3.3 million recurrently to deliver a range of services. These services include information and resources for carers, counselling, referral services, a library of resources for carers, support for young carers, accredited training to assist carers in their caring role and support for the No Interest Loan Scheme which assists carers with financial support. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122951"></A>
Last week, as many members would be aware, was Carers Week. I was very pleased to announce last Monday that the government is injecting $2.5 million of brand-new money over three years to help Carers Queensland to support carers right across Queensland. This is a fantastic initiative. This $2.5 million over three years is a very clear sign of the commitment that we have in valuing the role that carers play right across our state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122952"></A>
Grandparents who, for example, are struggling to manage the maze of issues that may arise in their role caring for their grandchildren or who simply need support and someone to talk to will now be able to access the services provided by Carers Queensland. Carers Queensland has advised me they will open their services to grandparent carers as a result of this government bill. I am sure members will join with me in thanking their board and chief executive for this very important move. I have asked them to monitor and advise me of the uptake of services by this newest group of recognised carers. We will monitor this, and if they need some additional funding we will ensure they have the necessary supports to fulfil this very important role. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122953"></A>
Outside of these amendments, the government is also acting in other ways to support Queensland grandparents. As I mentioned earlier, we have a dedicated seniors strategy and the Premier has also recently announced that for the first time Queensland will have its own Grandparents Day on 7 November. Grandparents Day will be an annual event celebrated on the first Sunday of November each year, and I believe that this recognition is very important for all grandparents right across our state. </Hansard-Body>

Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 We will see about that. Through the government’s close engagement with the seniors round table and the Council of Grandparents, we have been able to ensure that Positively Ageless includes a focus on responding to the needs of grandparents raising their grandchildren. Many of these initiatives that fall under Positively Ageless have been highlighted by members during the debate--for example, the Time for Grandparents program that provides grandparents caring for children outside the child protection system with respite and recreational support free of charge. This support includes grandparent access to overnight camps which provide them with support from professionals who can assist with parenting, financial and other information and advice. The grandparents information line, which is operated by Lifeline, provides grandparents with information, support and referral on topics such as legal issues, finance, social activities and concessions. The line is staffed Monday to Friday from 9 am to 5 pm and provides a personal response to all callers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122956"></A>
I know that members on the other side of the House are concerned about the financial impacts that grandparents may face when they take on the responsibility of raising their grandchildren, and I share this concern. I can advise that the Commonwealth government is primarily responsible for providing financial support for grandparents raising their grandchildren. Grandparents who care for their grandchildren may be entitled to support from various Commonwealth government support services including the Family Assistance Office, the Child Support Agency, Centrelink and Medicare Australia. Where children are in out-of-home care in the child protection system, there are payments of allowances to approved carers, including foster and kinship carers which may include grandparents, for the child’s care and maintenance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122957"></A>
As the Minister for Community Services mentioned previously, the Minister for Child Safety has also been raising this issue at the national ministerial council. We do not see any action on the other side of this House raising issues, but on this side of the House we are continuing to raise issues with the federal government. Queensland has put it on the agenda--not any other state--and we will continue to fight for grandparents’ rights.</Hansard-Body>

 That is right. In summary, these amendments are another important milestone in this government’s recognition of grandparent carers. I would like to acknowledge the contributions of all the members who supported the bill. In particular I would like to acknowledge that it was the Premier who announced Grandparents Day coming up next month. I would like to acknowledge the honourable member for Algester, the Minister for Community Services, who has been here through the entire debate. That just shows how much we actually support this initiative and the amendments in this bill. I would also like to thank the members who participated in this debate and make some brief comments. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1122960"></A>
The member for Hinchinbrook considered that legislation about grandparent carers does not come within my portfolio responsibilities. Let me assure members of the House that under the administrative arrangements I have responsibility for the Office of Carers, the Carers Action Plan and the Carers (Recognition) Act. Also during his speech the member for Hinchinbrook quoted from an earlier letter from Carers Queensland. Let me update the House with a more up-to-date letter from Carers Queensland dated 15 September 2010. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1127387"></A>
Dear Minister,</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1127388"></A>
The discussions with your department have been very productive. We now have a much better understanding of what the government intends to achieve. We look forward to working closely with the government and the Department of Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs to help ensure the government achieves the best outcome for the carers of Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127389"></A>
The member for Burdekin stated that the government’s bill promises nothing more than to give some grandparents access to information. She knows that is simply not true. Essentially, the bill that she put forward was simply unworkable as it sought to define ‘full-time care’. We are recognising grandparents who are full-time carers and have the day-to-day responsibility for the decision making for their grandchildren. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127390"></A>
The member for Burleigh mentioned the two new principles in the Queensland Carers Charter as outlined in the government amendments. The member for Kallangur stated that the amendments to the Queensland Carers Act proposed by the government would make Queensland the first jurisdiction in Australia to explicitly recognise grandparent carers in legislation and the equally important recognition of carers for people with a disability, chronic illness or frailty. I reiterate that Queensland will be the first jurisdiction to recognise those full-time grandparent carers who look after their grandchildren and are the primary decision makers. That is an Australian first. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127391"></A>
The member for Redcliffe mentioned the government’s introduction of Grandparents Day, which I think has been welcomed by all sides of the House. The member for Capalaba acknowledged the contribution made by carers on a daily basis right across Queensland. The member for Waterford raised an issue about the term ‘primary decision maker’. I have written to the honourable member stating that it has its ordinary meaning and covers both informal and formal decision making. I have also elaborated on this in the explanatory notes, for the clarification of the entire House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127392"></A>
The member for Kawana was slightly confused. He stated that not all children who are being cared for by their grandparents have a disability. Of course we acknowledge that, but I think he was slightly confused as he thought that, as I was the Minister for Disability Services, my only focus was on grandparents who are carers for children with a disability. That is simply not correct. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127393"></A>
The member for Woodridge made a very thoughtful contribution, as she does in every debate in this House. She mentioned another important issue about ageing parents of children with a disability, which is one of my key priorities. I will continue to fight for more funding in relation to that. The member for Brisbane Central spoke about the significant role of grandparents and the importance of access to information for grandparent carers who are the full-time carers of their grandchildren and the primary decision makers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127394"></A>
The member for Gladstone placed on the record her utmost respect, regard and admiration for grandparents who look after their grandchildren. I totally agree with her sentiments. The member for Nicklin was concerned about public servants being made aware of the changes to legislation. The member for Nicklin has my personal assurance that when this bill is passed I will write to all ministers and outline their departmental requirements under the legislation. Also, I note that government departments and statutory bodies must consider the principles in the Queensland Carers Charter, established by the act, when making decisions that may affect the interests of carers. The member for Mulgrave spoke about the seniors strategy, which was launched by the Premier and the Minister for Community Services. He also mentioned the important role of Carers Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127395"></A>
I make specific mention of the member for Mount Ommaney, my parliamentary secretary. The member for Mount Ommaney works extremely hard and does an absolutely amazing job. She is always out in the community. She has worked very closely with Carers Queensland. She has been involved in a lot of negotiations, discussions and consultations, and has been with me at many consultations as well. I place on the public record that I think I have one of the hardest working parliamentary secretaries in government. I acknowledge her efforts and offer my personal thanks to her this evening. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127396"></A>
In conclusion, I thank all honourable members who contributed to the debate tonight and in the previous parliamentary sitting week. They have made a valuable contribution. They have placed on record and shared their stories. I think that members from both sides of the House will agree that we all value the important role that grandparent carers play in our society. That is one thing that we are not going to dispute. The only key difference that we have is the way in which we acknowledge that. We could not accept the opposition bill as it is unworkable, because it seeks to define a full-time carer. We have put in place broad-ranging amendments that are supported by Carers Queensland, the Council of Grandparents and the grandparents we meet on a daily basis who come into our electorate offices and share their stories with us. On their behalf we make representations to various ministers about the issues that they raise with us. They are doing a lot of good work in raising their grandchildren and my hat goes off to them. I thank them on behalf of the Queensland government for the work that they do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127398"></A>
I thank my ministerial staff and my departmental staff, led by Helen Ferguson and her team. Kim and the others have done an amazing job. Last week, during Carers Week, we announced the extra injection of $2.3 million, which I believe reaffirms our commitment to grandparent carers across this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127399"></A>
One group I would like to particularly thank is the carers for people with a disability, frailty, chronic illness or pain who have worked tirelessly to achieve recognition for such carers through the Carers (Recognition) Act. The work of the Carers Advisory Council and groups such as Carers Queensland has resulted in us having the legislative framework for carer recognition that the Carers (Recognition) Amendment Bill will build on. I also thank the Council of Grandparents for its contribution. The Council of Grandparents provides information and support to all grandparents and raises issues of concern to grandparents with government. In conclusion, Queensland grandparents play an important role in this community and this legislation will give grandparents who are full-time carers of their grandchildren the recognition that they deserve. I commend the government’s bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

The Seniors Recognition (Grandparents Providing Care) Bill seeks to achieve substantially the same objective as that contained in the Carers (Recognition) Amendment Bill which the House has just resolved to read a second time.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CRIPPS</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (8.58 pm): During the course of the second reading debate, I argued that for the Minister for Disability Services to seek to weld the interests of grandparents caring for their grandchildren onto the interests of carers caring for people in other circumstances was not only unsatisfactory but inappropriate. Both groups, that is, grandparents caring for their grandchildren and carers caring for others in need of care, sacrifice a lot to improve the lives of those in their care, but they undertake those roles in very different circumstances and have very different needs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132062"></A>
Grandparent carers are not people who care for the aged or the infirm. Grandparents do not necessarily care for people with disabilities. Their grandchildren may very well, as we have heard from the minister this evening, have a disability, but a grandparent who is caring for a grandchild with a disability is much more likely to be doing so because they are their grandchild, not because their grandchild has a disability. Grandparents caring for their grandchildren are people who in many cases put aside their retirement plans to take care of grandchildren because of the inability of the parents to care for their child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132065"></A>
Clause 3 of the bill amends the Carers (Recognition) Act. What is the justification for putting people who assume the role of parents into a bill dealing with recognition for people who care for others with a disability, infirmity, illness or frailty? Since when did bringing up children fall into disability services? Minister, won’t this act be inappropriately named if the government bill is agreed to by the parliament? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132066"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No, definitely not. I think the member is unaware that my portfolio, even though it says ‘Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs’, is much more broad. I actually look after the Carers (Recognition) Act. What we wanted to do was protect the integrity of the Carers (Recognition) Act, and our amendment is recognising those grandparents who are full-time carers and who are decision makers under this proposed amendment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132068"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CRIPPS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The minister puts forward the proposition that I, as the shadow minister, am unaware of her responsibilities as minister. That is simply not the case. The proposition the minister continues to put forward is that, because under the machinery-of-government arrangements she has carriage of the Carers (Recognition) Act, that makes it appropriate for her to introduce a bill relating to grandparent carers. The problem that the minister has is that we have a fundamental disagreement about the appropriateness of grandparent carers being dealt with under this act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132069"></A>
So the minister can continue to put forward the proposition that she contends that I do not have an understanding of the machinery-of-government arrangements, but that is because we have a fundamental difference of opinion about the appropriateness of grandparent carers being thrown in with and welded onto the Carers Charter. That is the fundamental proposition that the opposition has put forward throughout this debate. It is the reason we are proposing a separate grandparent charter in the private member’s bill. The minister can go on all she likes making assertions about the opposition not understanding what is going on here. But the fact of the matter is that the government does not accept our proposition--and it is the government’s right not to accept our proposition. We simply have a difference of opinion about the appropriateness of accommodating grandparent carers in the same charter as carers. </Hansard-Body>

 Explanatory notes to Mrs Menkens’s amendments to the Carers (Recognition) Amendment Bill. </Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132077"></A>
The first amendment I am moving inserts an additional clause, clause 3A. It will include the recognition of grandparent carers under the objects of the act. With this amendment, the objects of the act will then include carers as well as grandparent carers. This is the start of a raft of amendments that I will move today just to serve a simple purpose: to correct the mess that the government has made of its bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132078"></A>
No matter which way the government likes to put it, grandparent carers and carers for people with disability, infirmity, illness or frailty are distinct groups with very different needs, and at the very least they deserve separate charters. In order to give the government just one last chance to get this right, I am moving a number of amendments. A number of these amendments merely include grandparent carers in a number of clauses. Despite wanting to force grandparent carers into this act, the government has failed to include them in the wording of the majority of clauses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132079"></A>
The amendments introduce definitions to ensure that there are better parameters, less exclusionary parameters, for grandparents. Under these amendments, a grandparent carer is an individual who provides full-time care to his or her grandchildren because a parent has impaired capacity or would likely cause an unreasonable risk to the child’s health or welfare without support or is otherwise not willing or able to provide full-time care. What we are looking at in these amendments is a totally different perspective to, as the government has described, a grandparent who provides full-time carer to their grandchildren. We are looking at the parental incapacity or inability of parents to care for their child that puts the grandparent in that specific position. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132082"></A>
That is the important part that was missed out in the government’s bill that was intrinsically part of the grandparents providing care bill. The government has been making all sorts of comments about the fact that grandparents caring for their grandchild for 30 hours does not make them grandparent carers. There is a 30-hour stipulation that is in the definition of a carer. What we are looking at here is the original reason and perspective and balance behind what a grandparent carer is. It is a lot more encompassing and a lot less cumbersome than the government’s definition, which excludes most grandparents from its own recognition legislation. The government’s legislation excludes those grandparents who have care under a foster care arrangement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

The amendments I will move establish side-by-side charters. Unlike government members, who demonstrated that they would prefer to insult or ignore the needs of the community rather than come into this House in a bipartisan show of support for special members of the community, I am willing to be constructive and provide amendments to the bill before the House in order to make it best serve the needs of the community. I am really disappointed that the government’s bill does not fully achieve the initial intentions. </Hansard-Body>

I note the erratum to the explanatory notes that the government has brought out. I am somewhat perplexed about the erratum. An erratum to explanatory notes is not legislation. A change in the explanatory notes is not legislation. We note that there is a decision maker. We heard discussion from the member for Mount Ommaney about ordinary meaning versus legislative meaning. There is no definition in the bill, no legislative standing, for its adoption of ordinary meaning. The explanatory note is not a substitute for legislation. It is an insult to grandparent carers on top of another insult. This government deems grandparent carers not worthy of their own bill or even their own charter. </Hansard-Body>

 The government cannot accept these amendments. Essentially we have had a long and detailed debate about this, and I have made it very clear that we will not accept your definition of full-time care meaning at least 30 hours a week of care and supervision provided to the child in a grandparents’ home or another place. This is simply unworkable. It is simply unacceptable to the government. </Hansard-Body>

 It is not acceptable to working mothers--or working fathers for that matter. The member continually keeps raising this issue. It is unworkable, and we definitely do not accept this. In relation to the definition of grandparents, clause 5 of the government’s bill very clearly defines ‘grandparent’ as--</Hansard-Body>

(b) 	the grandparent is the primary care-giver and decision-maker for the child.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132125"></A>
That is very clear. It is very concise. It can be interpreted. It can be understood. All that the opposition is doing is continuing to go back to this definition of full-time care. We find it simply unacceptable to define it as 30 hours a week of care, so the government will not be accepting the amendments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132126"></A>
The opposition amendment also adds a new definition into carer under clause 3 subsection (2)--that is, ‘long-term mental illness’. I want to make a few comments about this. This was one of the issues I discussed at length with Carers Queensland. It is something that we will have further consultation on, but you just do not insert something in here without having meaningful consultation with groups about this particular issue. The government is prepared to talk further with Carers Queensland and other interested parties about this. We would also have to talk to the Queensland Alliance, and I know the member for Hinchinbrook is attending the Alliance AGM on Friday, as I am. He attended last year and it is good to see he is attending again this year. This issue needs to be discussed with a number of organisations. I think we can have further meaningful discussions across government about this and come back at a later stage.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132129"></A>
In summary, the government stands by our definition--it is very clear and very concise. Once again, the opposition’s bill and its proposed amendments are simply unworkable because they are trying to define full-time care. They are trying to put a time limit on it, and that is what makes the opposition bill simply unworkable.</Hansard-Body>

Mrs MENKENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It gives the definition of a carer, and as you look further down in the next amendment you will see that a grandparent carer is an individual who provides full-time care to his or her grandchildren because the parent is unable to provide that care. We are looking at two separate parameters and definitions. Grandparents understand this issue but it is very disappointing that the government does not understand this issue.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132137"></A>
I am afraid the government’s definition leaves out many grandparents. It leaves out grandparents who may be foster carers of their grandchildren and decision makers. The government makes this point about the decision maker, and a foster caring grandparent is not the decision maker. I am afraid the department of child safety is, and that is why this is a very divisive piece of legislation. I am very disappointed in the government because it has totally let down all of the grandparents. The government is trying to say that it has looked after grandparents right across-the-board but it has not.</Hansard-Body>

Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Before the minister responds, I would like to add a question for her to respond to. The member for Burdekin just said that grandparents who are foster carers will not be recognised under the bill that is under consideration now, yet the definition of a grandparent carer, quite apart from whether the arrangement is through foster care or not, is that a grandparent with full-time responsibility of the child in their home and the primary decision maker will be recognised by the Carers (Recognition) Amendment Bill. Can the minister clarify whether those grandparents who are able to take care of their grandchildren even though the child has been relinquished for foster care will or will not be covered?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132151"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am happy to respond to that. The member for Gladstone is correct that if the child is in a foster care arrangement those grandparents are recognised as part of the government’s amendments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132153"></A>
I will take issue again with the opposition. This government has done a lot for grandparent carers. What we are seeking to do today is very clear and very significant. It means that Queensland will become the first state to recognise those grandparents who are full-time carers and the primary decision maker for that child. As well as doing that, this government has also launched Grandparents Day, which is going to happen in November. We have not only done that, but the Minister for Community Services has actually launched a seniors strategy which provides even more support for grandparents. As I mention at length what else this government has done, I can also say that we have provided $3.3 million annually to Carers Queensland.</Hansard-Body>

I do not understand for one moment why opposition members do not look at their amendments and see that it is in clear, plain English. Any lawyer who looked at them would interpret them exactly the same way that every member on this side of the House has interpreted them--that is, that you are seeking to define a grandparent carer who looks after their child for more than 30 hours a week, which is unworkable.</Hansard-Body>

This amendment deletes clause 4 of the government’s bill and replaces it with an amendment to the section 5 definitions, adding the definitions of terms referred to later in the bill. Here we are looking at inserting that full-time care of a child by a grandparent means at least 30 hours a week of care or supervision provided to the child in the grandparent’s home or another place. It also seeks to insert a grandparent carer’s charter, as in the new section 7, a definition of impaired capacity as listed under the Guardianship and Administration Act 2000 and that a non-parent family member for a child means a person other than a parent of a child who is ordinarily understood to be, or to have been, connected to the child by blood or marriage. It also includes a definition of a statutory body as outlined in the Financial Accountability Act 2009. </Hansard-Body>

In relation to full-time care of a child by a grandparent, a later amendment will list the parameters that define why the grandparent is the carer.

 We have gone through this. We are basically going over old ground, so I will keep my comments brief. Yes, the member for Burdekin does define full-time care, and we went through why that is unworkable. If she goes to her amendment again about a grandparent carer, it states that it is an individual who provides full-time care. A lawyer interpreting this legislation would go back to the definition of ‘full-time care’, and it says here very clearly ‘of a child by a grandparent means at least 30 hours a week’. I rest my case. </Hansard-Body>

 (9.29 pm): As we discussed earlier during debate on clause 3, children who are cared for by their grandparents are usually put into that position because of an inability or incapacity of their parents to care for them.

 The minister has requested that I repeat the question in relation to clause 5. Earlier in the debate when we were dealing with clause 3 of the bill, we discussed the fact that children who are cared for by their grandparents are usually put into that position because of the inability or incapacity of their parents to care for them. Why, Minister, does the definition of ‘grandparent carer’ in this bill ignore the cause for grandparents becoming grandparent carers, the reasons for it and the processes that initiate it? </Hansard-Body>

The minister in her summing-up criticised the private member’s bill because it allegedly restricted the definition of a grandparent carer to someone who cared for a grandchild for more than 30 hours per week. The LNP opposition, as has been discussed regularly over the last few minutes, disagrees with the minister’s assertion in that regard. Furthermore, in the government’s bill the definition in clause 5 excludes grandparent carers as decision makers if a child is living with the grandparent or grandparents but has not been declared a carer for the purposes of being a decision maker. So the government’s bill could prevent a grandparent carer from being recognised as the carer of a grandchild notwithstanding that the grandchild may live with that grandparent carer on a full-time basis and regardless of whether or not they have been declared a carer as per the definition in the bill. As the minister would be aware, for example, the decision maker in Child Safety cases is the chief executive of the department through delegated officers. Why would the minister exclude grandparent carers from recognition as decision makers as per the definition in the bill?</Hansard-Body>

 In our bill the grandparents are carers if the child is living with the grandparents on a full-time basis and they are the day-to-day decision maker. I think the member has issues in relation to the definition of ‘decision maker’.</Hansard-Body>

Mr CRIPPS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I only have one more opportunity to pose a question to the minister in relation to clause 5. Before I do that, I just want to make a point to the minister and she may take it on board when replying to my question. I am making the point that a grandparent is a carer, under the definition in clause 5, of his or her grandchild if the child lives with the grandparent and if the grandparent is the primary care giver and decision maker for the child. But if the grandparent has not been declared the decision maker but the grandchild lives with the grandparent on a full-time basis, that grandparent will not be given recognition as a grandparent carer.</Hansard-Body>

A definition of a grandparent carer on both the grounds that the grandchild is a resident and the grandparent is the primary caregiver and decision maker would exclude a great number of grandparents who are formal or informal primary caregivers.

 The definition of ‘decision maker’ is its ordinary meaning, so what the member was saying is actually correct.

The existing definition of ‘carer’ is well defined as the provision of ongoing care in an unpaid, non-contractual capacity to another person who, because of disability, frailness, chronic illness or pain, requires care with everyday tasks. As the minister referred to earlier, this amendment does add long-term mental illness. This was not clarified as a separate condition in the previous bill. As soon as the previous bill was introduced last year, this was brought to my attention. I have discussed it across the sectors. This is an issue that came up last term when this bill passed. It has been acknowledged right across the sectors. This would add long-term mental illness to the applicable conditions. A person who fulfils this responsibility does deserve recognition regardless of their relationship to the person. A wife, husband, mother, father or other member is entitled to recognition. So it is certainly not an exclusion under this provision.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137184"></A>
The amendment also introduces a definition of grandparent carer as an individual who provides full-time care to his or her grandchildren because a parent has impaired capacity or would likely cause an unreasonable risk to a child’s health or welfare without support or is otherwise not willing or able to provide full-time care. This definition defines the circumstances of the parent’s inability to care for that child. It creates the situation and the reason why the grandparent then becomes the carer. This answers the question that the member for Hinchinbrook was trying to put to the minister earlier. This actually describes the principal reason that that grandparent becomes the grandparent carer.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137215"></A>
This definition captures all grandparents who are the primary carers for their grandchildren regardless of the formalities or circumstances of their assuming care. Because grandparents assume care for a range of reasons, which includes death, illness of parents, abusive behaviour, family breakdown--all of those sorts of reasons--this bill needs to avoid restrictions on the recognition of grandparents who are the primary carers, which is the area that I was concerned about and which I was trying to point out before. I believe that there are grandparents who are often in situations of caring for their grandchildren, but the parents are still legally the decision makers or the department of child safety is still legally the decision maker. There is a very fine line there. That is the area that really concerns me. That is the reason we want to include in this definition a description of the circumstances of why that grandparent is a carer. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I can understand the sentiments of what the member is trying to do. However, there are some problems and I will just address them briefly. As I mentioned previously, we have to have some further discussions with the sector in relation to whether we want to add conditions of mental illness to the Carers (Recognition) Act. That would be not just grandparents who are caring for their grandchildren who may have a mental illness. I think we need to have broader discussions with the sector. This amendment is very prescriptive, so I do not want to go down that path. The government will be opposing this amendment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137218"></A>
In relation to the member’s amendment, which contains a new clause 5(3) subclauses (a),(b) and (c), once again this issue was raised when we had quite a lengthy discussion with the Independents about the legislation. It is very difficult to prescribe examples case by case. Once you start defining examples in the legislation case by case, you allow some people in and not others. That is why, when the government went out for consultation on its proposed amendments, it was very clear from the groups that we consulted with that our definition kept the good intentions and the integrity of the Carers (Recognition) Act. However, it gave very clear recognition to those grandparents who care for their grandchildren on a full-time basis and who are the decision makers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137219"></A>
I take on board what the member for Hinchinbrook was saying previously. With the definition of decision maker, it is not the technical legal definition of decision maker; it is the ordinary meaning of decision maker, which is quite broad when we think about that term as a reasonable man on the street would. So the government will be opposing the opposition’s amendment. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs MENKENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I want to explain this amendment a little bit more. The addition of the term ‘long-term mental illness’ in my amendments applies only to carers, not to grandparent carers. When the suite of my amendments rolls out, this provision becomes an addition to the meaning of carers rather than grandparent carers. The suite of my amendments makes a delineation between the two. So this is just an addition to the original act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137222"></A>
I still would like to make the point that it is not really a case-by-case description of the parents. Grandparents are carers because the parents are unable to care for their children, for whatever reason. That is why the grandparents become full-time carers--because the parents are out of the equation. That is the bottom line. It is not really giving examples case by case; the parents are out of the equation. Every child has to have parents and in these circumstances they are out of the equation. The description of the parents, or why they cannot care for their children, does not really matter. That is really the strength of it. </Hansard-Body>

Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I just want to re-emphasise that issue of the member’s amendment, new clause 5(2), which inserts the term ‘long-term mental illness’. Following discussions with Julene Gibson, who is the president of Carers Queensland, I have written her a letter about this very issue. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1137227"></A>
In relation to the proposal raised to specifically recognise carers of people with a mental illness, I should like the opportunity to further consult with relevant stakeholders before making any further amendments to the Act. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1137229"></A>
In the event that other groups of carers seek legislative recognition in the future, those proposals would need to be considered on their merits and I would look to my Carers Advisory Council and relevant stakeholders to advise me. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137230"></A>
So can I say to the member for Burdekin that the government will not be accepting the amendment, because we need to undertake further consultation. I think that I have evidenced that tonight--that we are on the first step to doing that and we would welcome the member’s involvement in that process. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142412"></A>
This amendment is a fairly simple amendment. It inserts a new clause 5A after clause 5 and it replaces section 7 of the act. The section is renamed ‘The Queensland Carers Charters’ and reflects the addition of a new charter. It refers to schedule 1 as the Queensland Carers Charter, and section 7(2) refers to schedule 2 as the Queensland Grandparent Carers Charter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142413"></A>
As I explained, I believe that it is imperative that the grandparents have a separate charter to the carers. It is very important to grandparents to have a charter. As it has been described to me, this is the first tranche of recognition and further support for grandparent carers. They have a long way to go. We know that they have a long way to go. If they get this basic support in a charter of recognition it will go a long way towards later legislation, be it at the federal level or the state level. When it is just tacked onto the end of the carers charter with ‘and grandparents’, it really does not do justice to the type of care that these people give. As I have said before, it is very disappointing that all they have been given is an add-on to that existing charter. This amendment allows for the ‘Queensland Carers Charters’, which denotes that we will have separate charters--one for the carers and one for the grandparents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142414"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 We will be opposing the opposition’s amendment. Once again, the member for Burdekin’s attached charter proposed in schedule 2 contains the definition of full-time care. The 30 hours a week comes back into play because of her earlier proposed definition. We have been through that at length. The government bill has added to our Carers Charter two new principles. These two new principles were addressed at length in many consultations and meetings with various stakeholders. For the sake of members of the House, I will quickly reiterate what those two are. I think members would agree with me that these are very important additions to the Carers Charter. The two new additions are that grandparents who are carers for their grandchildren after having raised their own children should be supported in their important and challenging role and, secondly, grandparents who are carers for their grandchildren need easy access to information that is clear and relevant to their role as a carer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142415"></A>
I think all members of the House would agree with me that access to information is very important. I can see a lot of people around this chamber nodding, recognising that access to information is absolutely crucial. The government will be opposing the amendment because, as we have said all along, the problem with the opposition’s bill is that it seeks to define full-time care as 30 hours a week. Once again, the member has adopted that definition in her proposed charter and therefore the government will not accept that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142416"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs MENKENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The government is making quite a point about the fact that grandparents will have access to information. But when one reads very carefully that erratum it says in a new principle 11 that grandparents providing full-time care for their children could access information of a general nature that could be made publicly available, for example the availability of respite services. That is not really giving anybody anything. If it is publicly available, I cannot see that it is any great recognition. However, that is just a comment I wish to make after the minister’s comments. I am still disappointed that grandparents do not have a separate charter. That is the purpose of this amendment. I will outline the full breadth of the charter in a later clause, clause 12.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I may be speaking to clause 12, because we seem to be juggling between them. I wondered whether the fact that the member for Burdekin’s amendment, which defined full-time care as--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1154682"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, I know. The minister keeps talking about the definition of full-time care in relation to the member for Burdekin’s amendments and that it means 30 hours a week. I can understand the disquiet with that. It may be that the parents have gone back to work and the grandparents have volunteered to take care of the children for 30 or 35 hours a week, or even 60 hours a week, but the natural parents are still very responsible and want to be the primary decision makers for the children. Therefore, I understand the difficulty with the 30 hours. My question is this: in response to the member for Burdekin’s proposals to add other definitions, where her amendments include full-time care the minister keeps referring to the 30-hours-a-week definition. However, in fact, that definition has already been defeated. Therefore, will not the full-time care definition revert to the minister’s? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1154683"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, our definition will hopefully prevail. However, the whole presumption of the opposition’s bill has been based on its definition of full-time care. Therefore, I could not stand in this House without clarifying what they would have meant under their schedule 2, No. 4, where they continue to talk about full-time care. Their definition of full-time care has the definition of 30 hours per week, which would then make all of it unworkable. </Hansard-Body>

Mr EMERSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Indooroopilly--LNP) (10.10 pm): The Bligh government is continuing to ignore concerns about the protection, use and potential abuse of personal information it holds on members of the community. Last month I raised the issue of more than 57,000 motorists being spied on by the Bligh government in a secret investigation of users of park-and-ride facilities. The study conducted over the last 18 months has seen car numberplates recorded after commuters parked at bus and train stations and ferry terminals. TransLink has then obtained through Queensland Transport the addresses of the owners of these vehicles. Not one of these 57,000 car owners voluntarily gave their details to TransLink. Normally it would only be the police who could access this information. These commuters are not criminals. But those who obtain this information--and there is no indication that any security checks have been undertaken--now know where these commuters live and when they are at home or not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1159776"></A>
I subsequently asked the transport minister a question on notice to reveal which TransLink staff by position had access to the data. I also asked how many TransLink staff had access to that information. The minister’s answer confirms both this government’s contempt for parliamentary process and the arrogance of a ‘don’t you worry about that’ attitude to the protection of personal information. I say contempt and arrogance because the minister failed to answer either question. So no-one knows, apart from the government, who and how many had obtained the private information of these 57,000 commuters. Is it any wonder that the Privacy Commissioner, Linda Matthews, has criticised the study. The Privacy Commissioner is currently investigating the operation, saying that TransLink should have told commuters that their details were being collected. She said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1159778"></A>
It is a concern when information about people is gathered without their knowledge.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1159779"></A>
The implications are very clear to everyone--the public and the Privacy Commissioner--except the state government and the transport minister, because the transport minister continues to defend the study. She says that it was less intrusive than surveying individual commuters. By ‘less intrusive’ what she means is that by spying on commuters and keeping it secret the government does not need to ask commuters permission to access their private information or be forced to make any awkward explanations. What other abuses of our private personal information is this government undertaking? It is obviously pointless asking this minister. She will not tell Queenslanders even when asked in parliament. I suspect that it is the same for her colleagues. The public does not trust this government for good reason. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr SHINE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (10.13 pm): Last week I had the enormous pleasure of attending the AGM of TOMNET, the Toowoomba Older Men’s Network Inc. It is a group founded largely by the effort of Lloyd Enkelmann, who is still heavily involved as the services and training coordinator. Others on the staff--Carole Macgowan, Chris Thompson and Jan Bell--all do a sterling job. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1159788"></A>
TOMNET’s vision is to value older men, regardless of their circumstances, and provide meaningful peer support networks that are responsive to and reflective of individual need and that positively promote the role of older men supporting older men in the community. TOMNET aims to identify and connect with isolated older men and establish peer support networks and services to improve their physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing and provide them with a sense of belonging. Its objectives are to provide opportunities for social interaction, to gain an understanding of the issues facing older men, for personal development and awareness, to pass on skills and knowledge, to share interests and experiences and to talk about personal and sensitive issues in a safe and confidential environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1159790"></A>
This year TOMNET continues its close partnership with the Toowoomba Flexi School and the Rotary Club of Toowoomba East. Twelve of its men have been involved in an online mentoring program funded by Rotary. For this the school and TOMNET have recently been acknowledged, winning a state-wide prize of $50,000 for outstanding achievement. It continues its reading and literacy program with Toowoomba South State School. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1159797"></A>
Patron Glen Postle has been the guiding light with respect to the Toowoomba Flexi School involvement. I am very pleased to acknowledge the strong leadership of Noel Hannant and the splendid support he will receive from his executive committee--Alan Yorston, Rod McLean, Ian Yeates, Ken Elborne, Bill Woodside, Joe Short, Les Banks, Don Longmore, Rod Murray and Keith Jordan. At the AGM, honorary life membership was conferred on Daniel Freeman, Tom Clark, Merv Allen, Tom Plant and Robert Brown, joining last year’s awardees John Edwards, Ray Jordan, George Scott, Theo Bosch and Jim Berr. My heartiest congratulations go to all of them on receiving this prestigious acknowledgement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1159812"></A>
Guest speaker Scott Clark of Queensland Health spoke on mental health issues of older men, incidence of suicide, men’s reluctance to access medical treatment and male social isolation. His address was of course well received. At the AGM acknowledgement was made of the recurrent state government funding extended for two more years which has given TOMNET the chance to create policies and establish a solid foundation. I acknowledge the support tonight and throughout the last year or so of the Minister for Communities. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms DAVIS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Aspley--LNP) (10.16 pm): I rise to address a matter of enormous concern to the northside community--the future use of the QUT campus at Carseldine. In order to give the community an opportunity to come together to discuss their aspirations on the future use of the vacant precinct, on Sunday I hosted a community conversation where around 100 people took the time to come together and talk about their visions for the productive use of the campus.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1159818"></A>
Attendees came from across the northern suburbs, Caboolture and the Redcliffe Pensinsula and from as far away as the Gold Coast. There were educators, training providers, community groups, those with an interest in the performing arts and environmentalists. They all had aspirations for the future use of the site as an active educational and community precinct that preserved the urban open space and local environment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1159819"></A>
In an attempted hijack, on Saturday the Premier, along with the Minister for Public Works, announced in a joint statement--without any community consultation--a unilateral decision to take over the campus and redeploy public servants at a proposed cost of $50 million. This is a government with a demonstrated history of disregard for community consultation. I think it is most notable that in 501 words of a press release there was not one mention of consulting with the community--not one.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1159820"></A>
Had the government bothered to consult, it would have discovered that we are a community with positive ideas for current and future generations; a community with a desire for the preservation of green space; a community with an overwhelming desire for the preservation of an important educational precinct. And this government is acutely aware that the land in Carseldine was originally gifted to the state with the express wishes of the benefactor that the site be used for educational purposes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1159821"></A>
What I find totally astounding is that to date we have had a number of government ministers who want a slice of the site but there is one glaring omission from the group, and that is the Minister for Education. They talk the talk of education but have shown no interest in investing in education at this site--noting that it is, and will be, at the centre of the northern Brisbane region and serviced by public transport. This is the only precinct of its type between the Brisbane CBD and Caboolture.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1159822"></A>
There is also great interest in considering the site for broader educational options, given that QUT has decided to abandon the site. This includes vocational education, community education, other tertiary institutions and innovative thoughts around improving the delivery of secondary senior schooling in the north Brisbane region.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1159823"></A>
My community saw this as being consistent with providing scarce community space for performing arts, sports and recreation--with the theatre on that site being the only reasonably sized theatre on the north side between Brisbane and Redcliffe. On behalf of the community, I implore the government to reconsider its decision before any work commences on the site--both on the green space and on the current buildings.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1159824"></A>
I fear that the Bligh government has continued its abandonment of the north side. In 2007 it was the short-sighted decision to move the Children’s Hospital and now it is to rob the north side of the great opportunity of a regional education precinct. This government simply does not care about north Brisbane. It is simply tired and out of ideas. </Hansard-Body>

To promote the Queensland Ready Reader program, I have been visiting schools in the Morayfield state electorate and have been reading to prep and year 1 students. So far I have been to Burpengary State School, Minimbah State School, Jinibara State School and Narangba Valley State School. I also visited Burpengary Meadows State School with the parliamentary secretary for education and member for Broadwater. I will also be dropping by the other schools in the Morayfield state electorate over the next month or so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165155"></A>
I have enjoyed visiting our local schools and am pleased that in some small way I have helped our young people with their reading. On each visit to the respective schools, I have read a book called <Hansard-Italic>
Mrs Echidna’s Dilemma</Hansard-Italic>
. This book is written by a local author, Betty Johnson. Betty lives at Narangba and is an active community member. Betty’s book was inspired by a patchwork quilt that she made over a number of years during her train trips to Brisbane. I used to catch the train with Betty and I clearly remember watching her patchwork quilt take shape. From those humble beginnings, the book <Hansard-Italic>
Mrs Echidna’s Dilemma</Hansard-Italic>
 was created.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165158"></A>
To acknowledge Betty’s outstanding work, I have been pleased to not only read this great book to students at our local schools but also donate a copy of the book to each school in the Morayfield state electorate. The books have been a real hit and I understand from a number of school principals that the books have been a popular addition to their school libraries. If the reactions of the prep and year 1 students are anything to go by, then they do not just appreciate the quality of Betty’s story but they enjoy reading generally and have a genuine interest and passion for reading. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165159"></A>
The prep and year 1 students did not get off that easy. After reading to them, I gave each student some homework to do. Of course, the students were less enthusiastic with that particular part of my visit, but their homework was fairly straightforward. I asked them to tell everyone in their house about how much they loved reading and I asked them to encourage people in their home to join the Queensland Ready Readers program. I did this because it is important for parents to read to their children more often at home. We know that reading aloud to young children improves their development. We also know that national and international research shows that there was a 90 per cent chance that a child who was a poor reader at the end of year 1 would remain a poor reader at the end of year 4.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170392"></A>
I am proud of this state government’s commitment to encouraging more parents to read to their children from an early age. By visiting our local schools and reading to our local students, I hope that I am able to encourage more people to get involved in the Queensland Ready Readers program and give our young people a flying start to their education. </Hansard-Body>

Toowoomba Bypass</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr RICKUSS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lockyer--LNP) (10.22 pm): I rise to bring forward another issue that continues to affect my area--the Toowoomba bypass. I am glad to see the member for Toowoomba North in the House tonight because he will well and truly understand that this is vitally important to Toowoomba. The member for Toowoomba South and the Main Roads minister--who are also both here tonight--will also realise how important this bypass is. The bypass is of vital importance to the Lockyer and the Toowoomba district. Every day, 3,000 to 4,000 B-doubles drive down James Street in Toowoomba. How ridiculous is that. There are 100,000 people in the town of Toowoomba who have to fight with these B-doubles. </Hansard-Body>

Mr RICKUSS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I notice the interjections from the member for Waterford. The town of Beenleigh, which I am well acquainted with, was bypassed years ago. It was bypassed by a government that could plan and think--a good conservative government. That government planned and thought and got the Beenleigh bypass in 30 years ago and it made Beenleigh develop. This should have happened to Toowoomba years ago. The preliminary planning for it was started in the 1990s, and the full planning started in 2001. I received an answer today about the planning and development for the Toowoomba bypass and it said that more planning is required. We have only been planning this for nigh on 10 to 20 years, yet more planning is required. This is extremely disappointing and I am sure the minister will understand my disappointment in this matter.</Hansard-Body>

 Why is this so low down in your priorities? That is what I want to know. What has happened to this government? Where are its priorities? The government has no priorities. I know the member for Toowoomba North is very disappointed that this has not been put in place, but I cannot understand why he has not lobbied his colleague, the minister, to make sure this gets built. This is ultimately important for Toowoomba. It really is important.</Hansard-Body>

The member for Toowoomba North sits over there and says nothing. He sits on his hands. He is like one of those monkeys. I cannot work out which one he is--the dumb, the blind, whatever--but he is definitely like those monkeys. The member for Toowoomba South will support me every day on this issue because he knows how vitally important it is for our area. </Hansard-Body>

‘Walk a day in my shoes’ Program; Petrie Meals on Wheels</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165182"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms O’NEILL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kallangur--ALP) (10.25 pm): Lynne Bailey kindly allowed me to walk a very little way in her shoes when she invited me to act in the role of supervisor/coordinator of Meals on Wheels in Petrie. Meals on Wheels runs on volunteers, and some of these volunteers have been there for years. I was very much a rookie, but everyone was very kind. I was handed my apron and hairnet and was told to wash my hands and get busy. I am pleased to say that there is no photographic evidence of me in my apron and hairnet. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165183"></A>
Lynne’s role is varied and busy. From organising volunteers and staff to making sure that every stove, sink and cleaning station is staffed, to military precision in meal preparation and delivery, Lynne is hard at work from early in the morning. Today’s meals have to be cooked, portioned and put into containers. The delivery schedules are already done, but all the specials have to be made up. Then there are always tomorrow’s meals to be prepared, recipes found and ingredients weighed and measured. There are safety inductions and hygiene rules to be explained. The staff ensure that there is meticulous compliance with health regulations, temperatures and storage rules. This is all in a day’s work.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165184"></A>
The kitchen hums along. There is constant washing up and stirring, measuring and checking the progress of cooking. Then there will be a rapid moving of hot food around to warming ovens or into the coolroom. This is not that easy when the dishes are for meals for maybe hundreds of people and double the size of any used in a domestic kitchen. The lucky recipients are able to have their likes and dislikes catered for--extra gravy, no carrots, more peas et cetera--and of course all allergies and health regimes must be attended to. The kitchen has a great team. They all work well together, with lots of laughter and looking after each other. We stopped for a welcome break around 9 am and that tea was fantastic. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165185"></A>
Lynne and her team have lots of lists. They constantly check the weight, quantities and ingredients, both for reordering and for current needs. Teams call out numbers across the room. It is a bit reminiscent of an operating theatre or a military operation--sounding out the numbers, double checking, stacking, sorting. I have been cooking for a really long time. I like it, but I must admit to being daunted by making an egg custard with 20 litres of milk, 34 eggs, powdered milk and cornflour. The pots were as big as baby’s baths, and if it all goes wrong there is a lot at stake--both cost and time wise--not to mention my chagrin if I proved completely inept. I was ably assisted during the critical stirring and temperature checking and I am pleased to say that it all turned out well and safely made it to the coolroom. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165186"></A>
Meals on Wheels could not survive without the wonderful volunteers that turn out time after time, but their work would not be possible if there were not well-organised, hardworking and efficient people like Lynne keeping the operation on track and doing hundreds of tasks to make sure all the recipients get great food delivered on time. I scratched the surface of a supervisor’s job. There are all the administrative tasks to do and supervise and the safety and wellbeing of drivers and delivery teams and many things I still know nothing about, but I am enormously grateful for the opportunity to experience as much as I did. </Hansard-Body>

Tugun Bypass</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165189"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs STUCKEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Currumbin--LNP) (10.28 pm): Australia’s most expensive road--the Tugun bypass--is likely to become even more expensive. Labelled by media and residents as an eyesore and a financial black hole for taxpayers who have to cough up for another poor decision from the Bligh Labor government, it is quickly turning into an embarrassment just like the ill-fated desalination plant. Finally, over a year since I first asked him, the Minister for Main Roads has revealed just how much it will cost to replace smashed glass panels along the bypass--or has he?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170536"></A>
According to the minister, 18 smashed glass panels have been replaced with glass at a staggering cost of $370,000. This price is not only unbelievable but also totally unacceptable. That is over $20,000 per panel. In reply to question No. 1408 I was told that a contract had been awarded for $605,000 to replace about 70 more broken glass panels with an acrylic material. A Plexiglass product was selected of 20-millimetre thickness with a filament running through it to add extra strength and durability. Two weeks later in another question, No. 1576, the same minister said that he had awarded a contract for acrylic/polycarbonate panels, which shows that he has misled the parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170540"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I rise to a point of order. That is absolutely incorrect. I have never awarded a contract in my life. The honourable member should know that ministers do not award contracts when it comes to this matter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170541"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170543"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 If the honourable member believes that the member is deliberately misleading the House, that is a matter of privilege and you should write to me about that matter. It is not a point of order, however. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170544"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs STUCKEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 May I correct my words to say that the same minister said that a contract had been awarded for acrylic/polycarbonate panels, showing that he misled parliament. Industry experts say that polycarbonate loses its optical and physical properties in a few years and is a poor substitute. It was used in bridge panels in Albury/Wodonga and panels clouded in two years. Main Roads has guarantees from the suppliers that it will last 15 years, but others dispute this. Acrylic Plexiglass panels on the Kennedy Drive Bridge, Tweed Heads, installed at the same time as the glass panels on the Tugun bypass, look as new. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170546"></A>
Speaking today with suppliers Plastral, who were contracted for the acrylic panels for this project, I discovered that a new quote has been requested by Main Roads for a cheaper and thinner acrylic product of 15-millimetre thickness without the strengthening filament. Why is the thinner, inferior-quality material now being requested? Clearly, the minister has again misled the parliament and the people of Queensland. This project is becoming a dog’s breakfast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170547"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I rise to a point of order. I find those words offensive and ask that they be withdrawn. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170549"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs STUCKEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I withdraw. Suppliers Plastral have told me that they will not be quoting on the tender for the 15-millimetre acrylic simply because they do not believe it can do the job and they therefore do not want to be associated with a failure as they have so many success stories that support the quality of their product. They are also concerned that this government’s bad decisions to use inappropriate products will tar all transparent barriers with the same brush. Unlike the Minister for Main Roads and the Bligh government, they have principles. Almost $1 million extra is being spent--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs STUCKEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I withdraw. I am waiting for a reply from the minister as to whether the cost he has publicly quoted includes the removal and replacement of broken glass panels. My concerns are that more money will be thrown away. Why has it taken so long to replace these panels? Why are new glass panels sitting on the ground near Tweed Heads? Why did the government use glass panels in the first place? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr KILBURN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Chatsworth--ALP) (10.32 pm): I would like to make a contribution to this very lively adjournment debate and talk about some wonderful young people in the Chatsworth electorate. Last year I was fortunate to be at the Camp Hill State School when they announced their leadership team for 2010. In that leadership team were four wonderful young people named Jack Bottomley, Sarah Gower, Kayla Stevenson and Jack Brand. Over the last year during the events I have attended I have seen these young people grow into fantastic, mature young adults. Not only does the leadership team at the Camp Hill State School perform the usual role of a leadership team; they take complete control of things like school assemblies and the other events that go on at the school. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170562"></A>
Recently I attended to hand out Ready Reader certificates in the school’s fantastic hall, delivered by the Labor government as part of the BER program. They now have a hall in which they can fit the entire school for an assembly. The wonderful year 7 leadership team ran the event, arranged for all the children to attend and had the awards all ready for me to present when I arrived. I would like to personally congratulate those four young people as they move from Camp Hill State School to secondary schools. If their leadership skills are anything to judge them by, I am sure that they have wonderful futures ahead of them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170564"></A>
On 21 October I sponsored a public forum at Gumdale State School, once again in a fantastic new hall delivered by this government with funding from the federal Labor government. Forty-five Chatsworth residents attended a forum at which Sean Webber from the PPP parenting program spoke to a number of parents about the power of positive parenting. I would like to thank the PPP group and Mr Sean Webber for volunteering his time to come and educate parents in my electorate on effective ways to deal with young children and the Positive Parenting Program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170569"></A>
I would also like to thank a wonderful business in my electorate, the Carina Leagues Club. I have been visiting schools recently, and a number have started sustainable gardens. I visited Mr Doug Wakefield, the CEO of Carina Leagues Club, and Wade Core, the president, and spoke to them about the programs that my local schools have running. The Carina Leagues Club then volunteered to donate $2,000 to five schools in my electorate--that is, Carina State School, Mayfield State School, Belmont State School, St Martin’s and Whites Hill College. That is a total of $10,000 donated by the Carina Leagues Club to build sustainable gardens and educate young people about sustainability. That $2,000 will go a long way because another great corporate citizen in my electorate, Bunnings, has offered to match them and to work with them to make sure that the schools get maximum value for their dollar. I would like to congratulate those two businesses on supporting schools in my electorate.</Hansard-Body>

Tipperary Point-Red Hill Suspension Bridge</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170578"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr MALONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mirani--LNP) (10.35 pm): Tonight I wish to talk about the collapse of the Red Hill suspension bridge in Mount Morgan. In the 1890s, six suspension bridges were constructed over the Dee River to give miners access to the mine. Only two of those remain. Others have been destroyed by floods. They were constructed with wooden decking supported by steel cables. They are amongst the oldest structures left in Mount Morgan from the mining industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170580"></A>
One of those six original bridges--and one of the two remaining in Queensland--is the Tipperary Point-Red Hill suspension bridge, which spans the Dee River. It was badly damaged in the 1928 flood and declared unsafe and unuseable. It was rebuilt in 1937 by the Mount Morgan Shire Council, and I have the original plans for that rebuild.  Not only is this bridge a very important part of Mount Morgan’s history, it is also a vital tourist attraction. Although not in good condition due to a lack of ongoing maintenance, it served a useful purpose in that it provided the only access for townspeople living on the Red Hill side to cross the Dee River when in flood. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170584"></A>
Rockhampton Regional Council sent contractors to erect a barricade around the bridge for safety reasons until a decision was made on its future. The contractors proceeded to dig around the foundation anchor blocks of the bridge and it would appear that they let go and the bridge collapsed into the Dee River. As a result, the Department of Environment and Resource Management commissioned an engineering report by Opus on the bridge. This was prepared by Andrew Barnes, Opus regional manager. The report states that Andrew is a civil engineer who sits on the Queensland Heritage Council and is affiliated with the National Trust of Australia and he has considerable experience in the field of heritage structures review and repair. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170589"></A>
Visual overall inspection of the bridge took place on 12 October 2010 to assess the general condition of the bridge timbers and the viability of salvaging the collapsed swing bridge as well as the strength, viability of serviceability of the bridge in its current state. The report declared three options. Option 1 was demolition and removal. Option 2 was temporary stabilisation of the bridge and lifting the main structure out of the river. Option 3 adopted option 2 plus additional works either now or at a later date to allow the structure to be utilised by the public. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170591"></A>
In conclusion, as a result of the collapse the Tipperary Point-Red Hill suspension bridge has lost all its structural capability, with the remaining part of the bridge sitting in the Dee River. The report states that the failure occurred due to the pulling out of the anchor rods from the sill log which resulted in loss of tension for the suspension cable and the collapse of the bridge. Suspension bridges are efficient, simple and low-cost options for spanning large distances. Remember, this is one of only two remaining swing bridges left in Queensland. It is very important to the people of Mount Morgan on a practical level, especially in times of flood. It is also an important tourist attraction and it has a very high heritage value to the district. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170593"></A>
Here and now I am calling on this state government--and I will also be calling on the federal government--to get behind the rebuild of this bridge and add some real dollars, not just a token gesture, to those of the Rockhampton Regional Council. </Hansard-Body>

Mr O’BRIEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cook--ALP) (10.39 pm): On Sunday night I had the great pleasure of joining the mayor of the Cook Shire Council, Peter Scott, to launch the new website for Cooktown. The website puts Cooktown on the electronic map and plans to take Cooktown to the world and bring the world into Cooktown. The project is a Blueprint for the Bush funded project. It plans to promote Cooktown and Cape York and, more importantly, the businesses in that community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170638"></A>
People in Cooktown understand that most investment decisions made by travellers nowadays, whether they are airline bookings, tour bookings, accommodation bookings, are made before those people leave their lounge room. That is why the Queensland government and businesses in Cooktown have joined forces to put this website together and make sure that Cooktown has a great presence on the website. It is a fantastic website. It is www.cooktownandcapeyork.com. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170642"></A>
People can book tours and accommodation. It contains fantastic information. The reality is that there is so much to learn and so much to do in wonderful Cooktown. It is not just the history of Captain Cook, but 40,000 years of history in Cooktown. There are some wonderful Indigenous businesses that can step people through the 40,000 years of history. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170645"></A>
An award-winning and fantastic business run by Willie Gordon is Guurrbi Tours. Everyone in Australia should have the pleasure of doing that tour with Willie. He not only talks about the history of the place but takes people on a spiritual journey themselves. There are other fantastic things to do and places to visit like the James Cook University, fishing tours, bush walking, the Vera Scarth-Johnson artworks, beautiful sunsets and the Discovery Festival. Cooktown offers the platform to launch oneself into Cape York Peninsula. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170650"></A>
I want to thank a number of people who have helped put the website together. John Lang was the original designer of the site. He was helped by Lauren Erickson from Bloomfield when John was unavailable. John Haberman is the Cook Shire Council’s IT guru. I would also like to pay tribute to the Cooktown Chamber of Commerce and Tourism members who put in countless unpaid hours to make sure the website is the success that it is. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170656"></A>
It is also already the No. 1 site on google. Members can google Cooktown and Cape York. It is going to be a great investment by the state government in making sure that tourism and businesses in Cooktown continue to thrive and continue to benefit from the growing number of tourists who are interested in Cape York and Cooktown and will continue to want to come there. </Hansard-Body>
