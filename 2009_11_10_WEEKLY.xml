Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.34 am): There are many different people in this chamber from different walks of life with different social backgrounds and family experiences. But one thing that we all share is that education played a vital role in determining our paths in life. Whether it was in a one-room, one-teacher country school in Western Queensland or one of its big city cousins, the education we received has been central to the make-up of who we are. That is why I was very pleased this weekend to announce a $1 billion investment in the wages and conditions of Queensland teachers.</Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Speaker. The 12 per cent wage increase over three years, along with extra pay for new teachers, a new classification for senior classroom teachers and pay for principals and other school leaders, will deliver better education for Queensland children. We all know that teachers are at the front line of delivering better education, and this package recognises their critical importance in improving student outcomes. We want to see even more of our best and brightest students choosing the profession of teaching, and this package means that beginning teachers in Queensland will become Australia’s best paid graduates. We also want to give our best performing teachers an incentive to stay in the classroom and keep delivering good results for Queensland kids. That is why this agreement rewards teaching excellence and experience through a new salary classification. Next year holds a number of interesting challenges and professional opportunities including the national curriculum and increased effort to keep lifting our NAPLAN performance. The resolution of this round of enterprise bargaining gives us the opportunity to focus on delivering important reforms in education for the benefit of our children. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.36 am): My government went to the last election with a promise to save and create Queensland jobs through the toughest of economic times. One of the key planks of that promise was our commitment to support one of the state’s economic drivers--our tourism industry. The industry employs more than 200,000 people both directly and indirectly, with 90 per cent in small to medium sized family businesses. Last year alone it pumped almost $9 billion into our state’s economy, so we know that the success of this industry is vital to Queensland’s prosperity. That is why we made a commitment at the election to invest an extra $36 million over three years into the tourism sector. Since we have made this commitment, extensive consultation has taken place with national and state industry leaders to determine where best to put those funds into the tourism sector. We have already implemented a number of initiatives, launching two new campaigns to attract interstate and international visitors, and last month I announced the appointment of a Tourism Queensland representative in the Middle East to maximise sales activity for our state from the busy and emerging Middle Eastern market.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001520"></A>
We are now in the process of finalising a new three-year tourism strategy to secure the industry for the future and protect the thousands of jobs that it supports. Before finalising that strategy we want to hear from industry leaders--the people with personal experience of the pressure that the economic downturn has placed on tourism. So today I am pleased to announce that our government will be hosting a tourism jobs summit on 25 November bringing together tourism operators and industry leaders from around the state with the aim of honing in on key initiatives for the future. Our government understands the importance of consulting with industry and operators when planning for their future. It is essential that we have all hands on deck to develop new ideas, innovative strategies and real solutions for this important part of our economy. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 I am glad to recognise that the member for Rockhampton was lucky; I was not. However, it was a particularly successful day for two local residents, whose horse took out the cup. I am sure that honourable members will join me in congratulating Laurence and Prue Eales of Hendra, whose filly Shocking won this year’s famous race.</Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
There you go! No wonder I have no chance of winning at the cup! Laurence and Prue Eales bought Shocking at the Magic Millions Gold Coast Horses In Training Sale two years ago from Queensland vendor Kevin Thomas of Washpool Lodge at Aratula. Recent buyers at last month’s Horses in Training Sale will no doubt be hoping that their investments deliver the same results in the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003588"></A>
This sale is a very important part of what happens in the Gold Coast equine and tourism industry sectors. The $8 million Horses In Training Sale has become a major international equine sales event, attracting buyers from around Australia and overseas. Fifty-four per cent of horses offered at this year’s sale were sold to Asian buyers. The prestigious event is one of three international sales conducted at the Magic Millions Gold Coast complex, with the $100 million January Yearling Sale and the $50 million National Breeding Stock Sale also attracting interest from around the world. The three sales combined are estimated to inject more than $85 million into Queensland’s economy and continue to build on Queensland’s international reputation and credentials in the thoroughbred racing and bloodstock industries.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003591"></A>
In a further sign of the growing success of our equine industry, a Korean production company is set to film a television drama at the Magic Millions complex in mid-January, during the last two days of the 2010 Yearling Sale. Magic Millions will be working with Tourism Queensland to ensure maximum exposure and benefit for Queensland and the Gold Coast. We want people from all over the world to come to Queensland and inject valuable tourism and sales dollars into our economy. This film will be another opportunity to promote Queensland to the world. In simple terms, our equine industry creates jobs and we want those jobs to grow. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Integrity and Accountability Framework</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003594"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.41 am): Queensland is in a state of transformation. Our modernisation is not restricted to our economy or the phenomenal increases in population that we witness each and every week. We face unique challenges today--challenges that we could never have imagined 20 years ago. The way our government and other governments around the world do business is changing and our systems need to change with it. This is a responsibility that our government treats as a priority and a responsibility that is key to good government. It is also our duty to continually adjust to meet the current challenges and the challenges of tomorrow. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003595"></A>
Today I am pleased to announce that over the next 12 months our government will deliver the most comprehensive suite of integrity and accountability reforms in more than two decades. This program of reform will focus on four key principles as the backdrop to a robust integrity and accountability framework. We will introduce stronger rules of integrity and accountability, we will build a stronger culture of ethical behaviour across the public sector, we will build upon and maintain a program of strong scrutiny and we will have stronger enforcement of the rules and requirements. These are the foundations, the very basis upon which the Queensland integrity and accountability framework is built.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003596"></A>
These reforms span the full range of public office--from ministers to MPs, from ministerial staff to public servants and statutory office holders. The aim and the message of these reforms is clear: our government expects the highest standards of integrity and accountability from everyone in public office. These reforms will shape the Queensland of tomorrow. They will give Queenslanders greater access to their government. They will drive a culture of the highest ethical standards. They will shine the beacon of scrutiny across more areas of public office and they will make sure that the options to deal with those who do not meet their ethical obligations are stronger. They will ensure that Queensland continues to lead the nation in delivering open and accountable government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003598"></A>
In August our government released the discussion paper <Hansard-Italic>
Integrity and Accountability in Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
 and encouraged members of the public to have their say on this pivotal question: how can our integrity and accountability be improved and strengthened? As part of this vital consultation, I convened a round table of experts to consider the more than 200 submissions that the government received followed by nine discussion forums from Toowoomba to Townsville. The bottom line is that it has been two decades since this framework was comprehensively reviewed. Today, that ends with reforms requiring legislative and administrative changes to deliver all Queenslanders a modern system of accountability and integrity. A number of these can take place immediately and will be included in a new integrity act 2009, which will be in place by the end of this year. Similarly, many new administrative requirements will also be actioned in the same time frame. Other reforms require more detailed consideration to implement and these will be delivered during 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003599"></A>
Our government is committed to clear, consistent and comprehensive rules and standards. That is why we will deliver a ban on the payment of success fees to lobbyists for achieving favourable outcomes from government. These new laws will not only apply to fees payable for procurement of government contracts but also, for example, apply to fees contingent on securing meetings with government representatives or securing licences or changes to legislation, regulation or policy. Our government will always be open for business with any worthwhile proposition irrespective of the involvement of lobbyists, but I cannot stress in stronger terms that there is no place for the payment of success fees with my government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003600"></A>
Our government has created a register of lobbyists and earlier this year introduced the Queensland Contact with Lobbyists Code, which places obligations on government representatives as well as lobbyists to ensure that contact is conducted in accordance with the public expectations of transparency, integrity and honesty. We will now move to enshrine this code and its requirements in legislation. Oversight of the code will be given to the Integrity Commissioner rather than the director-general of the Department of Premier and Cabinet, as is currently the case. We will also greatly expand the Integrity Commissioner’s role, and I will touch on that in a moment. Additionally, we will introduce measures that require newly appointed Public Service officers and ministerial staff to disclose whether they have worked as lobbyists in the past two years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003602"></A>
These are just some of the examples of our strong new rules to provide us with a strong system of integrity and accountability. I encourage all members of parliament, members of the media and members of the public to obtain a copy of this document titled <Hansard-Italic>
Response to Integrity and Accountability in Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
, which I seek leave to now table.</Hansard-Body>

].</Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003606"></A>
It outlines a host of legislative and administrative changes that will come into effect over the next 12 months, including changes to requirements related to pecuniary interests, the State Procurement Policy and the declaration of gifts. I also encourage everyone with an interest to familiarise themselves with those changes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003608"></A>
A vigorous integrity system requires a public sector culture based on strong leadership and a dedication to ethical values. Our government is committed to developing and strengthening Queensland’s ethical culture and we will deliver reforms to the Whistleblowers Protection Act during 2010. That act is an important mechanism for facilitating scrutiny and supporting people who do the right thing and stand up to wrongdoing. These reforms will ensure that our legislation is of the highest standard.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003611"></A>
We will establish an ethical standards branch within the Public Service Commission to assist all public servants, including senior executive staff, by providing independent advice on ethics issues. Our government must be accountable to the people it serves, and the decisions we make, the processes we undertake and the information we hold should be open and available to the public wherever practicable. We are committed to achieving open government through strong scrutiny. That is why we will expand and enhance the role of our Integrity Commissioner. Through this significant expansion, the Integrity Commissioner will now be accountable to the parliament through the Members’ Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee, which will be renamed the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003615"></A>
The Integrity Commissioner will additionally be given oversight of the Queensland Register of Lobbyists, be permitted to provide advice to all members of parliament, be required to report on whether chief executive officers have complied with their obligation to provide annual statements of interest to their responsible minister, and be given access to the Parliamentary Register of Related Persons’ Interests. The office of the commissioner will now function as an independent officer of the parliament, reporting through the revamped all-party Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee. This will allow for more dedicated supervision of what will be an enhanced regulatory regime and will ensure complete independence in the performance of this function. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003618"></A>
We will deliver an overhaul of political donations and campaign funding if the Commonwealth does not act in this matter. The transparency of relationships between elected officials and political donors is a matter of public interest and the regulation of political donations is currently being examined at a federal level. However, if the Commonwealth does not act on this issue by July 2010 we will lead the nation by introducing a cap on political donations. In the consultations, the overwhelming level of support was for a cap of the $1,000 mark and that is where we will move to in the absence of any developments at the Commonwealth level. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005165"></A>
Integrity in government is about much more than the mere absence of corruption. It rests in how a government conducts itself every day. Open access to government is an important part of that effort. Today I am also pleased to advise that our government will deliver a regular people’s question time, giving members of the public direct access to their government. This has been prompted by the success of two live online forums on integrity and accountability issues held in September during which members of the public submitted questions both before the forums and during. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005166"></A>
It was clear from the fact that more than half the questions submitted by the public related to matters other than those contained in the green paper, and went to issues as local as a road in their neighbourhood and to questions about their school or their local hospital, that people wanted that direct access. People want to be able to go on their computers regardless of where they live in Queensland. So from 2010 we will hold regular online video web question times in which the public can put their question to myself as Premier and a different selection of ministers on each occasion. This initiative will make the government more accessible than ever before. We will use technology to ensure that the door to our government is as open as possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005167"></A>
No one system is perfect. In that light, it is essential for any integrity system to have a range of enforcement mechanisms and disciplinary measures in place. Queensland currently has an extensive range of institutions and measures in place to ensure that adherence to prescribed rules and obligations can be enforced across the breadth of the public sector. A dedicated and well-resourced anticorruption body with wide powers to investigate and compel both public officers and private persons is a necessary feature of any integrity system. The Crime and Misconduct Act makes the CMC the equivalent of a standing commission of inquiry to improve integrity and reduce misconduct in the public sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005168"></A>
Our government is committed to ensuring that our enforcement regime is strong. That is why we will make a formal referral to the CMC requesting it to conduct an independent review of current police discipline and misconduct processes. Due to the unique power bestowed on our police officers and the corresponding trust that is placed in them by the community, it is appropriate to give separate and detailed consideration to the issues of police accountability and integrity. To this end the Attorney-General will formally refer this issue to the CMC with a view to this being finalised by mid-2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005169"></A>
Our government owned corporations are responsible for significant amounts of public money and should be subject to the highest levels of scrutiny and ethical standards. The government will deliver amendments to the Crime and Misconduct Act to ensure that all GOCs can be investigated by the CMC, ensuring that the use of public resources by these bodies is subject to the strongest scrutiny. The task of maintaining and updating Queensland’s integrity and accountability framework must be an ongoing mission. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005170"></A>
Along with the reforms that I have outlined, there were many submissions received during this process that went to the question of an upper house in Queensland. The majority of submissions did not support the introduction of an upper house and the government will not be moving in that direction. However, we do take on board the views expressed in many submissions that the parliamentary committee system in a unicameral parliament could and should be considered and strengthened. To this end I will be moving to establish a parliamentary inquiry looking at unicameral systems in other parts of the world and looking at their committee systems with a view to a comprehensive overhaul of Queensland’s committee system including the possible overall of our legislative processes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005171"></A>
The task of maintaining and updating Queensland’s integrity and accountability framework must be an ongoing mission. The reforms that I have announced today reflect the views of the hundreds of academics, businesspeople, non-profit organisations, human rights organisations, religious groups and other Queenslanders who took part in this process. I thank them for their contribution and for their commitment to our state. The reforms cover each of the four key principles identified through the consultation process and they deliver important and significant changes ranging from technical processes to wholesale reform. This package of reforms is only the first step. As new challenges evolve, the Queensland system must continue to adapt and change to meet them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005172"></A>
Under our government Queensland will continue to strive to stay at the forefront of accountability and integrity in government, delivering stronger rules, a strong culture of ethical behaviour, strong scrutiny mechanisms and strong enforcement to ensure public confidence in the institutions of our democracy.<Hansard-Speech-End>

National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (9.54 am): Last week I was pleased to attend the launch of a new partnership between the Princess Alexandra Hospital and the Royal Darwin Hospital. Through a national tender process, the PA Hospital has become the major partner in the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre at Royal Darwin Hospital. The centre is the front line for critical care and trauma in South-East Asia and the Pacific. It was crucial in providing trauma care following incidents such as the Bali bombings, the Boxing Day tsunami and other tragic events. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005176"></A>
I thank the Rudd government and, moreover, the federal health minister, Nicola Roxon, for their $50 million commitment to this project. The Princess Alexandra Hospital has extensive leadership in trauma management. In fact, it conducts most trauma surgery in the state. I am proud to say that the PA is very well positioned to contribute to the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre based at the Royal Darwin Hospital. Due to their geographical position, the Northern Territory and Queensland are the first port of call when Australia is called upon to help our neighbours in major disasters. Queensland was the first to send medical and nursing staff as part of the rapid response to Samoa in the aftermath of the tsunami. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005177"></A>
I noted at the time that one person in the media criticised us for sending Queensland staff overseas. There are three reasons we should help our neighbours: the first is that it is the right thing to do; the second is that it gives our staff here vital experience in the field so that, God forbid, if a disaster happens on our shores our staff have the skills and experience they need; and the third is that it could be your son or your daughter in that nightclub, on that beach or in that hospital bed and to know that they are receiving the best possible care by the best of the best brings some comfort. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005178"></A>
The PA now shares an extensive trauma management infrastructure with the Northern Territory. This means that it will be able to deploy clinical staff to Royal Darwin Hospital. For example, nurses will be trained regularly at Royal Darwin Hospital so when the time comes to be called they will be able to go in there and know exactly where they are going and exactly what they are doing with established human relationships, which is a very important part of operating in a trauma situation. This will assist with the treatment of patients being transported from Darwin to the specialist services available through the PA. The PA brings extensive educational capacity to this partnership. It will give centre staff direct access to the PA’s technologically advanced trauma management education and training. This will help provide development and mentoring benefits to staff. It will also provide for regular exchange of staff for training and familiarity with the Darwin setting and training via videoconference and telemedicine. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005179"></A>
The government’s investment in telehealth across our state is building a modern Queensland and delivering greater access to health care across our decentralised state. This investment will be crucial in our trauma partnership with Royal Darwin because the skills and advice of PA specialist surgeons and internationally recognised researchers in trauma management can be provided to Royal Darwin Hospital in real time during the disaster situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005180"></A>
Last but certainly not least, PA offers, through this partnership, strong links with organisational leaders in disaster response and trauma management within Queensland. Those of us within our region who face disasters in the future will be the beneficiaries of this great initiative. I can confidently say that there is not a member in this House who would not dearly wish that there was no need for this service, that there was no natural disaster, act of terrorism or similar insurrection overseas, but while there are people on this earth who take satisfaction from committing heinous acts that take the liberty and life of their fellow humankind, that maim, injure and cripple, there will also be a need for this centre. The work that these doctors, nurses and allied health professionals do is unparalleled and vital and a grateful nation thanks them. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Chibanda, Dr J</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005183"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (9.57 am): On Friday I referred to the independent Health and Quality Complaints Commission and the Crime and Misconduct Commission my concerns about the registration and quality of work of a Dr John Chibanda at Emerald Hospital. He came from the Northern Territory, I am advised, as a medical professional in good standing registered in Australia. I am advised that his references were checked and that he did not disclose any criminal history. The doctor was stood down by Queensland Health on Wednesday after issues were uncovered raising further doubts about his professional conduct. Allegations he was working outside of areas in which he was appropriately registered have been identified. Further, it appears that he failed to declare a previous overseas criminal charge when he registered with the Medical Board. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005184"></A>
I want anyone who may have concerns about their treatment to come forward. People can call 13HEALTH for advice or information if they have concerns about their treatment. While Queensland Health has advised that it does not believe that any patient has died or suffered permanent injury as a result of the doctor’s work, I want every patient’s record to be rechecked. A person’s perspective is also very important; they may have attributed an incident to something else. I do want people, if they have concerns, to make sure that they are satisfied with their treatment. Queensland Health is currently in the process of doing this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005185"></A>
I am concerned about the level of disclosure made to the Medical Board by the doctor himself. The form clearly requires disclosure of charges, not just convictions--even if, as he has claimed, it was quashed. I am further concerned about the conditions under which Queensland Health allowed this doctor to practise. I am concerned that questions have been raised about the standard of care that he provided. I make it crystal clear that I expect there to be a full and rigorous investigation of these matters. That is why I have referred them to the independent CMC and the HQCC. If there has been anyone who has been misleading or if the wrong thing has been done there will be no forgiveness; there will be strong action. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005186"></A>
Moreover, as these matters are now before the CMC and the HQCC, it is not appropriate to further canvass this matter in the House. Queensland Health has been utterly transparent, referring all matters to independent investigative bodies, the CMC and the HQCC. All cooperation will be provided to ensure those investigations are completed thoroughly and quickly. These independent bodies must be allowed to get on with their investigation without political interference.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Queensland Economy</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (9.59 am): While cautious of the road ahead, we remain fundamentally optimistic about Queensland’s economic prospects into the future. Queensland entered the global financial crisis with momentum. We have taken the tough decisions to fund a record building program, maintained business friendly policies such as the lowest payroll tax regime in the country, our major trading partners are on the improve and we maintain rapid population growth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005234"></A>
Last week, on Melbourne Cup day, the Reserve Bank plunged again, firming up its view of the economy’s prospects. The RBA board lifted the official cash rate by 25 basis points--the second quarter-of-a-per-cent rise in consecutive months. The federal government has also acknowledged the stabilisation of the national economy in its Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook released last week. The growth forecast for 2009-10 has been revised up by the federal government to 1.5 per cent, with 2010-11 growth increased to 2.75 per cent. It must be emphasised that those forecasts are still below trend and it should be noted that the Commonwealth also trimmed back its forecasts for later years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005235"></A>
However, among all levels of government, including our own, there remain nearer term challenges. According to the federal government, unemployment will not reach original forecast peaks but it will still increase, with projections suggesting that there are still another 105,000 jobs around the nation to be lost before the labour market turns around. Despite the improved growth projections, the federal government improved is projected deficit from $57.7 billion to $57.6 billion for this financial year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005236"></A>
It can be reasonably expected that any changes to Queensland’s forecast bottom line for 2009-10 would be similarly modest at best. As I said during the last sitting of parliament, Queensland’s ‘revenue-less recovery’ means that our economic turnaround will be more akin to that of a battleship than a Ferrari. This is because our key drivers of revenue, such as transfer duty, payroll tax and coal royalties, are yet to show any buoyancy from 2009-10 beyond the steady rebuild forecast at budget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005237"></A>
A major concern for Queensland, and indeed the nation, was noted in the reserve’s statement on Friday. The bank particularly noted the lack of support in the non-house construction market. It said that multi-unit residential construction and commercial property are expected to be a drag on the economy, largely due to funding constraints. While credit available to private sector firms remains restricted and activity in the private construction market lags, a key source of state revenue will remain stagnant. This underscores the importance of our building program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005238"></A>
What is important for Queenslanders to know is that this government will not be spooked by the economic indicators. We will hold strong on our record $18 billion building program, we will not cut services or sack public servants and we will not raise taxes. We will maintain our economic strategy, putting the levers in place to ensure a stronger Queensland into the future. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (10.02 am): At the start of this year, the Bligh government and the Queensland Police Service, with the support of the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
, set an ambitious target of limiting the road toll to below 299 in 2009. Today it is my sad duty to inform the House that as of midnight last night the state’s road toll was 298, just one death away from the goal. It is inevitable that the road toll will pass 299 as there are still more than 50 days left in the year. In fact, instead of reducing the number of deaths on our roads this year, Queensland is on track to record another awful road toll statistic. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005243"></A>
The target of 299 was always an ambitious but achievable target. The 2008 road toll of 328 was 32 fewer than 2007, when it was 360. The police and the government were optimistic that, through continued strong enforcement and education, they could influence a further reduction in the number of lives lost on our roads every year. Disappointingly, a minority of drivers on our roads continue to endanger their lives and the lives of others. It is this group of people we must reach with our road safety messages. They need to change their attitude and behaviours before they get behind the wheel if we are to reduce the carnage. Excessive speed is one of our greatest killers on the road. If drivers made the conscious decision to simply stick to the speed limit, we could substantially reduce the road toll. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005244"></A>
Later today the Queensland Police Service will conduct public events to highlight the awful tragedy of our road toll. Two hundred and ninety-nine people wearing white hats will gather in King George Square to graphically remind the community of the terrible carnage on our roads. Similar events will be held in every police region across the state. We must continue to publicise the impacts of road deaths on our community as a means of changing the attitudes and behaviours of road users. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. GJ WILSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (10.04 am): Our year 12 students are preparing to leave school and start the next chapter in their lives. I take this opportunity to wish them well as they prepare to enter the workforce or training or go to university. It can be daunting moving on after 12 years of schooling, but it is also an exciting time for students. There are so many different options for students. I hope that through their time at school they have been able to discover the future path that is right for them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005249"></A>
The Bligh government’s goal is to help all students achieve their aims, whether that is attending university, undertaking an apprenticeship or traineeship or moving straight into the workforce. We have implemented a range of reforms in schools to increase students’ access to programs designed to help them get a head start in their careers. Many high schools have strong vocational education and training programs or offer students the chance to undertake school based apprenticeships and traineeships. This helps give them a kick start in their chosen careers, with many completing a good portion of their studies while still at school. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005250"></A>
Those programs are critical to ensure that students who do not want to attend university or other tertiary study have options that appeal to them. It is about helping students find the pathway that is right for them and helping them get there. This year, a new Pre-apprenticeship Skilling Pathway program for school leavers has been promoted to students interested in a future in the trades. School based apprenticeships and traineeships, structured workplace learning and work experience programs have also introduced young people to the world of work, helping them to develop work readiness and vocational skills. Queensland is leading Australia in school based apprenticeships.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005251"></A>
Gateway schools and the Queensland academies provide programs that give students exposure to industry or allow them to take university level classes, undertaking research and assessment with university students. One program involving Professor Ian Frazer sees students undertaking cutting-edge medical research, working with some of the greatest scientific minds in Queensland. By giving students more options during their school years, the Bligh government is working towards our Q2 target of having two-thirds of Queenslanders holding trade, training or tertiary qualifications by 2020.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005253"></A>
Finally, I know that many will soon be heading off for schoolies celebrations to let their hair down after the hard slog of exams. I take this chance to wish them all the very best on their much deserved break. However, I also remind them to stay safe, to stay healthy and to always look after their mates. I know that Education Queensland is supporting the Department of Communities to help make this a safe and fun event for schoolies. I congratulate the class of 2009 on completing school and wish them every success as they enter the next exciting phase of their lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005254"></A>
On behalf of all students leaving school in 2009, I extend our appreciation and gratitude to all the Education Queensland teachers for the excellent contributions they have made to educational opportunities in state schools. I assure them of our continued support. I congratulate teachers and the QTU for adopting such a progressive position on the government’s pay negotiations with them. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (10.07 am): Smart Service Queensland is the front door to the Queensland government and it is continuing to expand its Queensland Government Agent Program, QGAP, throughout the state. QGAP is a state-wide network of 70 integrated service counters located in rural and remote communities. Those counters deliver a broad range of state and Commonwealth government services and information and process more than 200,000 transactions annually, bringing in some $23 million in revenue for a range of agencies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005259"></A>
Service counters are currently located throughout the state, from Stradbroke Island in the east, Camooweal in the west and Cooktown in the north to Crows Nest in the south of Queensland. I am pleased to inform members that the Department of Justice and Attorney-General has approached Smart Service Queensland with a list of courthouses to be used as potential QGAP sites. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the Attorney-General for his assistance in that regard. As a result, eight new locations have been identified, with the Taroom office having commenced trading on 26 October. Nanango, Toogoolawah and Gayndah are scheduled to open in late November, while Mossman, Childers, Pittsworth and Tully are due to open in March next year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007053"></A>
Queenslanders in these centres will be able to access a range of services over the counter including vehicle registration and renewals, traffic offence payments and inquiries about justice of the peace services. Each site may include anything from public housing rental assistance inquiries to applications for birth certificates. Customers can also access federal government information about the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, Medicare and the ACCC. In addition to government services, QGAP accepts insurance payments on behalf of Suncorp, NRMA and QBE Insurance. The number of services provided at each QGAP site varies depending upon the size of the community and the demand for service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007054"></A>
This is a program that was instituted by a Labor government. It is something that we provided as part of our service to Queenslanders and we are continuing to build upon it. Our ICT strategy--Toward Q2 through ICT--commits to strengthening the role of Smart Service Queensland as the primary point of contact for Queenslanders. Right now we are covering the length and breadth of the state, and I am proud of the excellent service that Smart Service Queensland’s Queensland Government Agent Program provides for rural and remote Queenslanders. Again I reiterate that this is a Labor program. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Free-Flow Tolling</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007059"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. CA WALLACE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Thuringowa--ALP) (Minister for Main Roads) (10.10 am): The transition to free-flow tolling on the Gateway and Logan motorways is now complete, with improved safety and travel time savings being experienced by motorists. It is part of the Bligh government’s commitment to ease congestion in the south-east. Since the introduction of free-flow tolling, accidents around the toll points have reduced by 80 per cent and motorists are saving up to 10 minutes in travel time across the network.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007060"></A>
With the alignment work completed at the toll points last week, vehicles are now able to travel at full speed through these points--no need to stop, weave, slow down or search for loose change. More than one million go viatags are now in circulation, and motorists who use the Gateway will experience further benefits when the $1.88 billion Gateway Upgrade Project is completed--less congestion and an extra 15 minutes in travel time savings.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007062"></A>
We have delivered free-flow tolling two years earlier than originally planned so that motorists can experience the benefits sooner. To meet this ambitious target, Queensland Motorways procured, planned, developed and implemented the complex new systems during an intensive 18-month period. This included necessary infrastructure work to support the transition to free-flow tolling, as well as the technological work to install Australia’s first single-gantry electronic tolling system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007063"></A>
The final transition to free-flow tolling began on 1 July, with the progressive closure of the existing cash tollbooths. From 21 July, work began to remove the plaza facilities at the Kuraby, Loganlea and Heathwood-Stapylton toll points and to complete final alignments for new free-flow lanes on the Logan Motorway and Gateway extension. At the Gateway Bridge, the toll plaza has also been removed. However, temporary lanes remain as the Gateway Upgrade Project continues.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007064"></A>
While I know there were some initial teething problems, which Queensland Motorways moved quickly to correct, the customer service centres, contact centre and online facilities are all functioning well. Free-flow tolling offers traffic flow and travel time reliability results, improved safety and reduced pollution as queuing and weaving around tollbooths is eliminated. It is another example of how the Bligh government is delivering on its promise to ease urban congestion and reduce emissions in South-East Queensland. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Electrical Safety, Insulation Installation</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007067"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (10.13 am): The electrocution of an insulation installer in Brisbane on 14 October and the injury of a fellow worker has highlighted, in the most tragic circumstances, the electrical safety risks associated with installing ceiling insulation. I would like to express my sincere condolences to the family and friends of the deceased worker and I extend my hopes for an early recovery to the injured co-worker. I must also acknowledge the representations made to me by the member for Albert, Margaret Keech, on behalf of the deceased worker’s family. I know that she is supporting them and also wishes to publicly extend her condolences.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007068"></A>
The responses of both the federal and Queensland governments to these safety issues has been both rapid and comprehensive. Immediately after being notified of last month’s incident, inspectors from Workplace Health and Safety Queensland and the Electrical Safety Office went to the scene of the incident and launched an investigation, which is ongoing. The next day the Electrical Safety Office posted a safety alert for installers on its website and to its email subscribers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007069"></A>
Then on 16 October, the Electrical Safety Office convened a meeting with the Office of Fair Trading, the Building Services Authority and other government agencies to consider measures to improve safety for insulation installers and homeowners. As a result, all agencies circulated the alert dealing with the electrical safety risks associated with installing foil ceiling insulation. The alert went to tens of thousands of electricians, electrical retailers, construction companies, manufacturers and other businesses--18,000 on the Electrical Safety Office and Workplace Health and Safety Queensland mailing lists alone and another 30,000 recipients through Fair Trading’s <Hansard-Italic>
Smart Business Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007071"></A>
As part of a coordinated approach to addressing safety issues in this industry, federal minister Peter Garrett and I also discussed a range of improved safety requirements for insulation installers. As a result, I issued a ministerial notice on 30 October under the Electrical Safety Act for installers to comply with several important safety conditions, starting on 1 November 2009. These conditions included the banning of metal or other conductive fasteners when installing ceiling insulation as well as requiring on-site risk assessments before any installation work commences. These conditions also complement a series of changes announced by the federal minister about the Home Insulation Program.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007073"></A>
It is disappointing, therefore, to see reports that a very small number of installers may not be following the new directives that became effective on 1 November. All these reports will be investigated by the Electrical Safety Office and action will be taken against firms if they have breached the new conditions. Banning the use of metal staples and other conductive fastenings is an important response to the safety concerns arising within the insulation industry. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. RG NOLAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport) (10.16 am): In recent weeks there have been a number of delays which have inconvenienced commuters on the Citytrain network. While in the last financial year 91.74 per cent of trains ran on time, this figure had improved to 94.3 per cent in the September quarter this year. In the last couple of weeks, however, the performance of the rail network has been poor. In October, 4.8 per cent of trains were delayed due to track issues, and last week this was 8.5 per cent. This is not good enough. I apologise to commuters for this recent and unacceptably poor run.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007077"></A>
On their behalf, I have demanded answers from Queensland Rail and we are taking steps to improve performance. My advice from Queensland Rail is that the recent performance is the result of a series of unfortunate incidents at critical locations and is not indicative of a systemic maintenance issue. In the last week, for instance, one major delay occurred on the Cleveland line because a storm disrupted power. Another unacceptable delay occurred when a worker severed an optical fibre at South Brisbane and a third resulted from a police incident.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007078"></A>
I am advised that there is no evidence to indicate an overall deterioration of the network. Queensland Rail conducts visual inspections three times a week and regular track audits using computer technology. That auditing indicates that the ‘overall track condition index’--a technical measure of track quality--has been constant for the last five years, notwithstanding an increase in services. To maintain this standard, the government funds QR for track maintenance. This year, at $56 million, the Citytrain track maintenance budget is at its highest level ever.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007079"></A>
It is true that QR has recently introduced new rules to enhance safety on the network. This has led to some increase in the time taken to respond to incidents in some cases. Safety is and always will be our No. 1 priority, but these new measures will take a little while to bed down. I have directed Queensland Rail to meet with unions and work with them to get the balance right between safety and responding quickly to incidents.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010507"></A>
No-one likes delays, and again I apologise to commuters. I can assure them that our network is maintained appropriately and that we are continuing to work towards building a better public transport system. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Glassing</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008752"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PJ LAWLOR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southport--ALP) (Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading) (10.18 am): As part of the Bligh government’s commitment to stop glassings and alcohol fuelled violence, a new antiglassing campaign is being launched today targeting Gold Coast patrons. The targeted campaign will run in the peak celebration season from today to 2 January 2010 and will highlight the consequences of glassings for both the perpetrator and the victim. The Queensland government has worked in partnership with industry and taken significant measures to increase security and safety on licensed premises. However, it is apparent that for conditions on licensed premises to be effective patrons must be educated about responsible behaviour. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008754"></A>
The targeted campaign will consist of radio and press advertisements in the Gold Coast region. Ads such as this will send the message that if you glass someone you will get up to 14 years but if you get glassed it is for life. The new campaign has been timed to deal with schoolies and the New Year festive season--a time when large numbers gather in the entertainment precinct. The incidence of glassings has been higher on the Gold Coast than anywhere else in the state, and local media have led a strong campaign to stamp the culture out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008755"></A>
The advertisements for this campaign depict the hard-hitting reality and devastating impact a glassing incident can have on young lives. I hope the campaign will encourage young people to be responsible and to walk away from violent situations. While we recognise that there is a parliamentary inquiry underway, the government has been proactive in raising awareness of the consequences for everyone involved in alcohol fuelled violence. The results of the parliamentary inquiry will, however, inform the government’s direction for possible future campaigns regarding alcohol related violence.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008756"></A>
We must continue to work towards a cultural change in binge drinking. This is a generational problem that we cannot walk away from. The Bligh government is committed to a safer Queensland. I thank the collaborative efforts of Liquor Licensing, licensees and police in addressing the safe and responsible provision of alcohol. We will continue to work with them to encourage responsible patron behaviour. <Hansard-Speech-End>

One Chance at Childhood</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PG REEVES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mansfield--ALP) (Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport) (10.21 am): The Bligh government is committed to innovative programs for Queensland’s children and young people. This includes programs like the One Chance at Childhood initiative for children from zero to four years of age. The aim of the program is unashamedly to put the needs of young children first and to give babies and toddlers some stability in their young lives, because they only get one chance at childhood.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008761"></A>
We cannot put a time limit on decisions about a child’s long-term care. The reality is that decisions about a child’s long-term care are not taken lightly, and never should be. The One Chance at Childhood program recognises that and provides expert advice to support front-line child safety officers who are faced with those considerations. This initiative is not ‘one size fits all’ and must be responsive to the individual needs of individual cases. Everything is done in the best interests of the individual child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008762"></A>
If parents are working well to resume the care of their child, child safety staff will support them to keep their child safe. However, it is a sad fact that there are times when reunification for a child in care is not possible and never will be. In these cases, children and young people need stability and permanency. Research recognises that children need stability in their living arrangements and relationships to reach their physical, emotional, social and intellectual potential.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008763"></A>
The Queensland government is delivering on its commitment to child protection by supporting programs like One Chance at Childhood. The government has made the tough decision to support front-line services and increase the child safety budget to a record $638 million this year. On the other hand, the LNP would have cut three per cent from the child safety budget. That equates to a loss of at least 170 front-line child safety roles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008764"></A>
The One Chance at Childhood program and its dedicated staff are ensuring our children and young people can reach their full potential. I want to assure families, child safety staff and the community that this vital program will continue to operate. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. KL STRUTHERS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Algester--ALP) (Minister for Community Services and Housing and Minister for Women) (10.23 am): In a world first, the Arsenal Soccer Schools program has taken its coaching and mentoring program behind bars at the Brisbane Youth Detention Centre. It is helping young offenders kick some real goals to get their lives back on track. The Arsenal Soccer Schools program runs in eight communities around the state and 20 countries around the world. This is the first time the coaching program has been taken into a detention centre. Teaching soccer is secondary to the real goal--to help young kids on the wrong side of the track believe in themselves, and to respect themselves and each other. It is a pilot project and, if all goes well, the program could be expanded to the Cleveland Youth Detention Centre in Townsville and to some Indigenous communities in remote areas.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008771"></A>
There are 12 young people taking part in the Arsenal Soccer Schools project in the centre--nine boys and three girls. Sport is a great vehicle for social change. It is about instilling confidence, belief, self-esteem and responsibility--all good values--into young kids to help them lead a more fulfilling life than they were once leading. From what I hear, the soccer program is already making a real difference to these young lives. We have moved on from the days when you simply locked the door and threw away the key. With our youth justice conferences and our early intervention strategies, we are giving young kids the chance to turn their lives around. We want to help them break the cycle of crime. In youth detention, they have access to flexible training and education to help equip them with the skills they need to get their lives back on track. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008772"></A>
We are delivering sweeping new reforms to tackle youth crime. We are giving courts wider powers to impose curfews on young offenders and to name dangerous young offenders, and we are giving police stronger powers to arrest dangerous young offenders. But the bottom line is: we see detention as a last resort and our focus is on getting kids to take responsibility for their actions, change their habits and get their lives back on track. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. A PALASZCZUK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Inala--ALP) (Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs) (10.25 am): This week is Spinal Injuries Awareness Week. It is not just an important week for people with spinal cord injuries, their families and carers but also an important week for all Queenslanders. In Queensland, around 90 spinal cord injuries are sustained every year. On average, that is one person every four days who has their life turned upside down. Many people will be permanently paralysed and need to use a wheelchair as well as requiring assistance with basic tasks such as eating and bathing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008778"></A>
Last Friday I met with Martin Hume, an inspirational 20-year-old man from the Gold Coast. Martin is a quadriplegic as a result of a boating accident on the Tweed River two years ago. In fact, he spent his schoolies week in the spinal ward. He is more determined than ever to live a productive and rewarding life, and he has enrolled this year to study at Bond University next year. He is delivering a very powerful spinal injury awareness message to thousands of Queensland schoolchildren each year. He has delivered his message to 6,000 Queensland students this year as part of the Spinal Education Awareness Team--or SEAT--program. The Bligh government contributes $80,000 a year to help run the SEAT program, which is expected to reach 100,000 Queensland students this year. SEAT presenters do a great job educating young people about spinal cord injuries and the steps they can take to prevent them. We are pleased to be supporting this program as part of our efforts to build a modern, inclusive Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008780"></A>
The Bligh government is delivering more than ever for Queenslanders with spinal cord injuries. Since 2006 we have committed over $50 million to the Spinal Cord Injury Response initiative. It is an initiative between Disability Services, Housing, Queensland Health, the PA Hospital Spinal Injuries Unit and the Spinal Injuries Association. It ensures people with spinal cord injuries get access to essential personal care, specialised equipment, safe, appropriate and affordable housing and home modifications. Through this initiative alone, we have helped 61 people since 2005 to return from rehabilitation to life in the community.  While we cannot cure spinal injuries, we can give Queenslanders the care and support they need if they are seriously injured. That is exactly what the Bligh government is doing. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.28 am): My first question without notice is to the Premier. Last week the Premier admitted that her Labor government had spent $62.7 million on advertising in 2008. Given that the annual report of the Electoral Commission indicates that a referendum could be held for less than a quarter of that amount, will the Premier now hold a referendum on privatisations to give Queenslanders a chance to have their say, or is it the case that the Premier wants to be heard but refuses to listen? </Hansard-Body>

In March this year my government was elected with a mandate to guide us through the worst of economic times. We were elected with a mandate to keep our building program going. We were elected with a mandate to manage our budget without slicing 12,000 jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010595"></A>
The real question here today is: if such a referendum were held, how would the Leader of the Opposition vote? How would the shadow Treasurer vote? How would the member for Moggill vote? Let us look at their record on this issue. What does the member for Moggill think on the issue of government ownership. In 2006 he said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1010597"></A>
... sometimes we need to sell government owned assets in order to reinvest those funds in more urgently needed infrastructure that it is more appropriate for a government to provide. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1010598"></A>
So there is a vote for the ‘yes’ case. What did the Leader of the Opposition have to say in 2007? He said--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1010600"></A>
... the government does not have to be involved in activities that can be best performed by private enterprise. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1010601"></A>
Another ‘yes’ vote. What did the member for Clayfield have to say on the issue in 2006? What did ‘Big Red Tim’ have to say? ‘Big Red Tim’ said--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1010603"></A>
One has to ask: why not sell the poles and wires as well? Why not sell the generators as well? Most informed commentators know that this is the best solution to provide adequate power efficiently and with little risk to government. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1010604"></A>
Another ‘yes’ vote. He will be writing the ‘yes’ case. What did the member for Southern Downs say in his economic objectives policy this year? He said--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1010605"></A>
An LNP government would not oppose privatisation of public assets. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1010606"></A>
Another ‘yes’ vote. I would be very happy to receive a written ‘yes’ case from the Liberal National Party for such a proposition and I would give it my best consideration. </Hansard-Body-Continued>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My second question without notice is also to the Premier. I refer the Premier to the ‘Have your say’ surveys currently being distributed by Labor MPs in their electorates seeking community feedback. Given that the Premier and her Labor Party are spending $1.9 million of taxpayers’ funds to sell the privatisation agenda, will the Premier explain why her local MPs ask for feedback on 11 issues, none of which is privatisation? </Hansard-Body>

 I applaud the efforts of my caucus members to be out talking to their constituents about local issues that concern them. What you will see from members of my caucus is that they will be out talking to their local schools about the needs of those schools and talking about programs like State Schools of Tomorrow. They will be out talking to their local hospitals, as I expect them to be. People will see them out meeting with local community groups because they believe, like I believe, in open and accountable government--the sort of open and accountable government that we saw in Barcaldine last week, the sort of open and accountable government that people are going to see in online question time forums in 2010. These are the sorts of issues that matter at a local level. They are the sorts of things that my backbenchers and my caucus members are out talking to their electorates about on a regular basis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010616"></A>
What we have seen in the last week is nothing more than a fraud being perpetrated by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is a member of a party that went to the last election and went to every election before it saying that the government should not own commercial assets. When those opposite were in government they spent millions of taxpayers’ dollars on developing a privatisation program. </Hansard-Body>

We know that the Queensland budget, as with the budget of every state government in Australia, has necessitated some decisions in order to bring that budget back into balance. Our government is up to the hard decisions to do exactly that. Why? Because a balanced budget helps us invest in what Queenslanders need--better schools, better roads, better hospitals, better services for passengers on our Citytrains, more ambulances, better paramedic pay. All of those issues have to be at the heart and centre of government. That is what our agenda is. We stand for jobs. We stand for a modern Queensland with better services and better infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the member for Southern Downs, who takes every opportunity to talk this state down. I reject the view of the member for Southern Downs that Queensland is not the best state in Australia because I believe it is. Queensland is one of the few states in this country that has a standing commission of inquiry in the CMC. The reason we have it is because a Labor government implemented it. The reason we still have it is because the Liberal National Party did not get the chance in the 1990s to dismantle it. It tried to dismantle it and we have strengthened it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010628"></A>
Our reforms today will mean that Queensland will be the only state in Australia to ban success fees for third-party lobbyists. We will be the first state in Australia to commit to a specific cap on electoral donations and have a time frame for implementing it. We will be the first state in Australia to put in place legislation to regulate lobbyists. We are the only state in Australia to have an Integrity Commissioner. With these reforms we will give that position more power and more independence. As I said, we are one of only three jurisdictions in the country with an independent anticorruption body--an anticorruption body that is actively supported by Labor and was actively undermined using taxpayer dollars during the reign of the Liberal National Party in the mid-1990s. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010634"></A>
Let us be clear about this. These are the sorts of reforms that only happen by and large in any government of any political persuasion anywhere in the world when there has been a major cataclysmic event that sees a massive failure of the system. That has not happened here. What we have not seen, despite all the allegations--</Hansard-Body>

 My question without notice is to the Premier. I refer to the Premier’s recent censoring of submissions to the green paper on Labor’s corruption. Will the Premier now explain why her staff have again been censoring debate on YouTube by deleting unfavourable responses to a recent video regarding privatisation? Is it the case that the Premier wants to be heard but refuses to listen and is not prepared to countenance any dissent? </Hansard-Body>

 There was no censoring of submissions to the green paper. In the first week one officer of the department, without any direction from me or my office, concerned about a possible defamation, took some material out of a document. When I found out about it, I directed that it be put back in and issued a direction that there should be no limitations on what people want to put forward because I am happy to hear the good, the bad and the ugly. So there was no censoring of the green paper process. I am equally unaware of any of the allegations that the member makes about YouTube or in fact any other documents in relation to my agency.</Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, every day. Time is a slow healer. I indicated in my ministerial statement this morning just how much governments’ interaction with the public is changing, not just in this state but at all levels and across the world. Technology is making it possible for us to have direct interaction with the public in a way that distance, particularly in a state like Queensland, previously made very difficult or in many cases impossible. In this parliament we have seen the development of things like e-petitions for example that have made it more accessible for people. We see the development, as I outlined this morning, of our proposal for a people’s question time.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010691"></A>
I thought the process that we entered into with the green paper was an experiment. I was very pleasantly surprised to see the amount of interest. What that means is that people do want access directly to government, and we want to give them that access. What Queenslanders again can expect is not only a government determined to put us at the absolute forefront of accountability and integrity in Australia but also a government that wants to grab with both hands the opportunity that technology gives us to be a modern government for the people of Queensland. Queensland is being transformed into one of the most successful and modern states of the Commonwealth, and the reforms today take us one further step down that path. These are reforms that Queenslanders can be proud of.</Hansard-Body>

 I thank the honourable member for her question and for her genuine interest in these matters. As I have outlined, we have a genuine commitment to ensuring that Queensland is leading the country in this regard. We have, I think, a very strong reputation for the safety nets we already have in place, but we do not want to rest on our laurels. We want to build on that and take it further. But more than that, we know that the sorts of prohibitions that the Labor Party has been prepared to put on itself are not being matched by those opposite. Those opposite have had extensive opportunity over the last six months to enter into the same agreements with their own party that they will no longer, for example, participate in pay-per-view dinners. Have they agreed to do that? No. They have had six months of opportunity to say that they would be prepared to look at a limit on political donations. Have they done that? No. They are not capable of reforming themselves, so our legislation will have to drag them kicking and screaming--as it always has. Every reform of the Liberal and National parties in Queensland has had to be legislated because they are incapable of reforming themselves.</Hansard-Body>

 Whenever you are ready. What we saw yesterday, though, was probably one of the most extraordinary developments from the Leader of the Opposition. He held a press conference in which he said that he would now be personally running a crusade to restore public confidence in the integrity of public officials; he would become the ‘Mr Clean’ of Queensland. It is now four months since he promised he would release the list of people who went to the $20,000-a-head dinner. Yesterday he told journalists that he still did not know who was on the list. He needs to do a little bit of memory cleansing if he wants to be ‘Mr Clean’ because in August he told this parliament that he had the list in his wallet, but he still cannot get it out of his wallet! Every woman in the parliament knows the type: this is the man who tells you for 20 years he will clean the bathroom, but there is always an excuse--always an excuse, and they are nodding their heads! We have seen the type. What he needs is to get out the Mr Muscle and clean out his memory and tell the people of Queensland who came to the $20,000-a-head dinner, because until he does his credibility on this issue is in shreds. Promising this list was the one promise the member for Surfers Paradise has made in seven months, and he has not kept it.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Well, you heard it here first! It is all revealed! The Labor Party has been paying itself its own money! Shock, horror! Caught red-handed! Let us be absolutely clear. When the Labor Party gets donations--when it receives money--what does it do? It invests it. When it invests it, it then pays a dividend back to itself. It seems that the horror from the other side of the House would indicate that when the Liberal National Party receives donations it puts them in a shoebox under the bed or perhaps in a brown paper bag. But the way that the Labor Party manages its finances, quite prudently, is to ensure that when it has funds it invests those funds and then pays a dividend back to the party. This is the Labor Party paying itself Labor Party money. This is not an organisation donating to the Labor Party. This is not an individual.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010716"></A>
Of course, one would think that the Liberal National Party does not have similar funds, and of course it does. It in fact has three at least that I am aware of. It has in the past had things like the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation, and we know that the Lord Mayor of Brisbane has such a fund. Labor Holdings is Labor Party money--the Labor Party investing its funds and paying itself a dividend from it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010719"></A>
This is the calibre of contribution that we can expect from the Liberal National Party in a debate about how to take Queensland forward, how we could lead the country, how we could redefine politics, how we could develop a different political relationship with the Queensland community. This is an opportunity for us. This is a chance for us to change the political relationship with the electorate. And where are the conservatives on this? Absolutely nowhere, as usual. They have had seven months and they still have nothing to offer. We will be looking to develop a bipartisan committee to look at the parliamentary committee system. But after this morning’s performance, you would have to have very low expectations about what it will deliver. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WELLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>

<A ID="pgfId-1012988"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. Queensland is the most decentralised mainland state in Australia. There are people in a very diverse pattern of settlement throughout this great state. The other day we had the community cabinet at Longreach and Barcaldine. One can see the very significant development patterns that are out there. So, unlike the other states, we have people living in regional and remote parts of the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012989"></A>
One of the ways we can make sure that we deal with the needs of those people is to use modern technology. These days, it is very difficult to have a medical specialist in every place that we want, let alone a doctor. One of the issues with medical specialists is that, for very good reasons, they tend to congregate with each other so that they can have appropriate working hours, conditions and the like. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012990"></A>
Telehealth is actually understanding that it is not about technology; it is about the use of technology. A little while ago I was at Toowoomba Hospital--a great hospital, I might add. The anaesthetist and the theatre nurse were conducting a consultation with a young mum, off the top of my head, from Dalby and her son. He was going to have his grommet surgery in a couple of weeks time. That pre-operative consultation was able to take place through telemedicine. That saved that family the inconvenience and, indeed, the expense--which is often the case if you are on the land or you are self-employed in regional and remote Queensland--of actually coming down, in that case, to Toowoomba or other places. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012992"></A>
At the present time, Queensland Health is hosting a conference on success and failures in telemedicine to talk about how we might do things better. For example, not only are we dealing with the issue of consultations--and in 2009-10 we will have 20,000 consultations with patients and carers through videoconferencing--but also we need to have a look at the extent to which we use telemedicine for other aspects of what we do, for example pathology but in particular radiology. X-rays are taken electronically and they can be beamed to anywhere else on the earth to be read by a radiologist when needed. That means that, whereas in the past a film would be taken and someone may have been able to look at it locally, the ability to send it to a radiologist to have a look at it in detail instantaneously is something that Queensland Health is rolling out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012993"></A>
We need to understand that, if we are going to be serious about telemedicine, we need to make it as seamless for clinicians as possible. It is not about making it more difficult; it needs to be seamless for them. One of the things that we will be talking to the federal government about in terms of the $43 billion it has to invest in IT is that it gives health and hospitals a big priority. Additionally, at present you do not get a benefit from, say, the services of a nurse at the other end of the screen which you might want to charge to the medical benefit system. So there is a disincentive for a doctor to necessarily be involved in a consultation if they are not a patient’s own doctor in the private sector. That is something that we are taking up with the Commonwealth. Telemedicine has the advantage of delivering medical services further afield, and that is a good thing. </Hansard-Body>

 I will start again. Electoral returns out last week show the trade union movement gave $2.8 million in cash to the Labor Party for the state election. Under the cap on donations announced today, is the Premier proposing to stop the same unions simply spending this $2.8 million on advertising of their own to support Labor? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>

 If the member for Clayfield wants to propose that unions stop advertising against the government, I would be happy to join him on a unity ticket. Surely, we can come to some mutually agreed arrangement. </Hansard-Body>

 If the member puts it up as a topic for the Wednesday night debate, he will get unanimous support from this side. The question goes to some serious matters and I am very happy to have an opportunity to talk about them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013007"></A>
Firstly, let me just say that, to my knowledge, wherever there has been some cap on political donations anywhere in the world there has been equally a cap on the election campaign expenditure on all sides of politics and Independent candidates. There have been similar restrictions on what is called parallel campaigning. That is to stop political parties of all political persuasions getting around the political donation cap by having donations made to a third party, whether it is a trade union or some organisation that is set up that then effectively runs the campaign. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes. There are some very celebrated campaigns that come to my mind, such as the Mundingburra by-election where we know, quite disgracefully, that not only did the Queensland police union campaign but they campaigned because they were getting something in return. They got an MOU. What was the MOU? To nobble the CMC. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That was delivered. In government, those opposite made every attempt to deliver on that MOU but, thankfully, the courts and the independence of the judiciary in this state put a stop to them and then the people of Queensland put that stop even further. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013013"></A>
These are the issues that will have to be considered. I think all of those things have to be seen as part and parcel of the same reform: public funding, a cap on donations, a cap on campaign expenditure and restrictions on third-party and parallel campaigning. That is one of the reasons I think this reform would be best done at a federal level so that it applies across Australia. But if that is not the case, we will move here in Queensland. That is the reason, given the complexity, we will be looking at this carefully over a reasonable period of time--about six to seven months. As I said, this is about revolutionising the way we go about the political process in Queensland. I say again, that Labor is ready and willing to lead from the front. If those opposite want to live in the 1950s, they can stay there. </Hansard-Body>

Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Mundingburra for her question and for her understanding of the choices that face this government--choices that we make so that we can invest in important environmental assets for the state like the Cromarty Wetlands, which the member advocated for on behalf of the North Queensland community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013021"></A>
There is no change to the timetable and there is no change to the timetable for the sale of Forestry Plantations Queensland. We said from the start that it would be the first asset and we said from the start that it would go to the market inside the first 12 months. We said this from the start and, indeed, it has been a matter of public record for some time. On 10 June in the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian Financial Review</Hansard-Italic>
 it was stated that it had already been confirmed that the first asset to be put to the market would be FPQ in the next 12 months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013023"></A>
The reality is that what happened yesterday--the excitement and flurry from the Leader of the Opposition--was born from a dishonest premise, and he knows it. He knows that he was being dishonest, just as he is being dishonest with the people of Queensland when he comes in here and wrings his hands and has his lip quivering about the nature of our circumstances and denies that he is not a supporter of privatisation. Where is he on this issue? In the past he has supported the privatisation of schools. As the Premier pointed out this morning, the Leader of the Opposition supported the privatisation of the lotteries. On that day when he contributed to the debate on that issue he said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1013025"></A>
It is based on our belief that the government does not have to be involved in activities that can be best performed by private enterprise. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015099"></A>
The former shadow Treasurer, the current shadow education minister, no doubt supports the privatisation of schools and the privatisation of other assets. The current shadow Treasurer supports the full privatisation of the electricity industry. The member for Caloundra supports the privatisation of pensioners’ assets to himself.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015100"></A>
The reality is that the Liberal National Party in this state, as does the Liberal Party federally, supports privatisation--always has, always will. It took it to the last election in its policy platform. It has supported it in the past through the commission of inquiry. At a federal level it has been on the record as saying, as the federal shadow Treasurer has said, that governments should be focusing on what is important to the community: hospitals, good quality schools, making sure there are proper aged-care facilities, roads, public transport, law and order. The fundamental point here is that the Liberal Party in this state believes in this. The Leader of the Opposition is being dishonest to the people of Queensland in denying that it has always been his past. He is running from his past. He is not being honest with the people of Queensland. More to the point, as has been so clearly demonstrated by the things he has said on the record here in the past, worst of all he is not being honest with himself. </Hansard-Body>

 I am very pleased to advise members that, while I am very busy as Premier and rarely able to get to individual branch meetings, I do have a process in my electorate whereby on at least three occasions during the year on a Saturday afternoon I invite all members of all branches to come along and have several hours with me. I have already had one of those this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015108"></A>
I am pleased to advise the House that the Labor Party is a very democratic organisation. It has not only regular branch meetings but also regional conferences. It recently held a conference of all of the branches in the Brisbane southern suburbs, not only including my electorate but also including the other southern Brisbane electorates. I attended that. There were more than 100 people there. Unfortunately, the person who has made some comments this week for reasons of his own was unable to be there. That is a great pity because I certainly would have enjoyed the opportunity to debate the issue with him. </Hansard-Body>

The Queensland Labor Party is a broad church. It has many views and people are entitled to those views--unlike the Liberal National Party, which seems hell-bent on expelling those people who have the audacity to complain about it. This is a question from a party that in the last month or so has moved to expel someone who was once a very senior member of its organisation who had the audacity to say that in his view the Liberal Party has died, the Liberal Party has ceased to exist, the Liberal Party in Queensland is pushing up daisies, the Liberal Party of Queensland is, in fact, a dead parrot. What happened to this poor chap? Out the door--expelled. In fact, it was worse than that. He actually sent in a letter of resignation. The party refused to accept the letter of resignation because it wanted to expel him. That is how dissent is managed on the other side. Even former federal members are not safe. Poor old Gary Hardgrave! There is a jihad against Gary. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs ATTWOOD:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology. Would the minister advise the role the Department of Public Works is playing in providing jobs and training for young Queenslanders? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015116"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for her question and her ongoing interest in matters related to the portfolio of the Department of Public Works, especially QBuild. At every single estimates hearing I have ever attended, discussion has invariably turned to the business units that we have. Every single year without fail, those opposite who have sat on those panels have criticised QBuild, QFleet, Goprint and SDS Publications. There is no mistake whatsoever in its policy that should it ever scrape its way over here those units would be dead as a dodo. We know that for a fact. Actually, all the QBuild blokes know it, too. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015117"></A>
What would have happened if those opposite had been in office for these last 10 years? I will tell members. There would be 1,239 fewer tradespeople in Queensland. There would be 1,239 fewer kids in this state who would have got a job in the construction industry. There are 330 young people--male and female, Indigenous and non-Indigenous--out there at the moment working in the construction industry through QBuild. That is our record. Just recently, 3,200 Queenslanders voted with their feet and voted QBuild the most popular employer of the year because they applied to become apprentices with QBuild. Regrettably we had only 100 jobs to give but, out of those, 70 per cent are going into regional Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015118"></A>
Every time we hear those who sit opposite prattle on about privatisation, just remember this: every chance it gets it would privatise QBuild and QFleet. Would the young bloke out at QFleet, one of the six apprentices who was good enough to be down at the V8 Supercars in the pits as a panelbeater, Anthony Bowen--a top young bloke--have a job under those opposite? No, he would not. I invite anybody to scrutinise the estimates records for the last 11 years. They will find without fail the criticism of each of those enterprises that are run through the Department of Public Works. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015119"></A>
The hypocrisy of those opposite could be spread with a knife, or probably a No. 4 shovel. The reality is that each one of those opposite sneak around boardrooms spruiking how good privatisation is. That is especially so for the Leader of the Opposition, who went down to a legal firm--and I know that for a fact because there were four people there--spruiking about how good privatisation was. The forked tongues are out. It looks like a blue-tongue lizards’ day out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015120"></A>
The reality is that, for all this piety that we hear from those opposite, they would not blink to privatise every enterprise in Queensland. The trade union movement knows it. I know it. This side of the parliament knows it. It is about time the people opposite had some honesty and integrity and owned up to it. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Transport. Public transport in Queensland is in meltdown. Trains are literally coming off the tracks at crawling speed and over 1,000 services were delayed because of infrastructure issues in 2008-09. In light of this, will the minister table the Premier’s letter to her with her ministerial charter of goals and explain whether she takes any ministerial responsibility for this appalling failure of the Citytrain network?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017169"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. You would not want to let your dripping hyperbole get in the way of a range of what I think are pertinent facts. As I have already outlined to the House in my ministerial statement this morning, indeed there have been some recent issues with fixing track faults on the Citytrain network and I apologised to commuters for that. As I have already indicated, the government is acting to ensure that those recent issues are fixed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017171"></A>
The on-time running performance of the Citytrain network has improved. Last year, 91.74 per cent of trains ran on time. In the first quarter of this financial year, 94.3 per cent of trains ran on time, although, as I have said, as a result of a series of incidents that on-time running has been reduced in recent weeks. There are a couple of reasons for that. As I have said, one is a series of unfortunate incidents. The other is that Queensland Rail has recently introduced new safety procedures for track-side maintenance which has meant that in the interests of safety some faults have not been fixed as quickly as they would have been previously. I have directed Queensland Rail to work with the unions to improve the speed of that response. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017172"></A>
Nonetheless, the government is extremely committed to the quality of our public transport network. That is why this year we are spending $56 million on the maintenance of the Citytrain network, which is more than has ever been spent before. Our government is the first in a very long time to expand the Citytrain network, with current projects underway to extend the network to Richlands and ultimately on to Springfield, and to extend the network to Varsity Lakes. That is in stark contrast to the last National Party government, which ripped up the rail network to the Gold Coast. While this opposition can only suggest a railway line that does not join up with the broader public transport system, this government has a strong and proven commitment to expanding and maintaining public transport services. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for Brisbane Central for her question. In addition to this government’s commitment to public transport--a commitment that, I might add, has seen public transport patronage grow by 50 per cent over the past five years--this government is very committed to seeing more people using active transport, that is, cycling and walking to work. We understand that in order to reduce our carbon emissions and encourage a fit and healthy population, a great deal can be done to encourage people to cycle to work. At the moment, only about one per cent of trips to work are made by bike, although we know that there are great opportunities for cycling in Queensland. We have fantastic weather and we have a lot of bikes. In Australia each year for the past nine years more bikes than cars were purchased. Lots of people own bikes. As a government, we can create opportunities for those people, not just to ride that bike for recreational purposes but to ride it to work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017180"></A>
That is why we have a comprehensive cycle network program to roll out safe bikeways across the state. It is why we are now opening an $8 million end-of-trip facility at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital in the electorate of Brisbane Central. The Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital Cycle Centre was built as part of the Northern Busway project. It is located next to the RBWH busway station. It is a great example of integrating sustainable transport options to help tackle climate change and congestion.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017181"></A>
For instance, people from the north side can ride to the hospital, either because they are among the 18,000 people who visit the hospital each day or because they can then shower and catch a bus into the city for work. The cycle centre is very conveniently located next to local businesses in Bowen Hills, it is part of Brisbane’s largest hospital complex which, as I said, receives 18,000 visitors every day, and it is close to local educational facilities and the RNA Showgrounds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017182"></A>
Key features of the centre include 750 secure bike parking spaces. The centre is capable of being expanded to provide 900 spaces in the future and there are 900 lockers. There are showers for men and women and, as I said, there is security for the bikes that are parked there. As part of our Q2 targets, the government is committed to environmental sustainability and a fit and healthy Queensland population. This bike centre will very much contribute to that end. </Hansard-Body>

Dr DOUGLAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Transport. I refer the minister to the Commonwealth budget, which states that the funding for the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project will only be offered on an equity share basis. Can the minister explain why Gold Coast public transport users will be forced to pay commercial return fares that will allow the Rudd government to take a profit from this project? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017188"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for Gaven for the question. I think it would be illustrative to know whether he is one of the LNP members who supports the project or whether he is one of the LNP members who opposes it. It has now been a couple of weeks since I stood in this parliament and suggested to the member for Surfers Paradise, who had been coming in here and suggesting that he supported the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project, that, if he were so keen, he may want to remove his name from the Stop Light Rail website, which lists him as one of the supporters of the anti-light rail movement. In contrast to the opposition, which took a whole range of different positions to the last election on this very important project, the Bligh government conceived it, secured funding from local government and the federal government for it and is now moving full steam ahead with finalising agreements with those governments so that construction will begin on the project early in the new year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017192"></A>
The Gold Coast Rapid Transit project will fundamentally change for the better the nature of the Gold Coast. It will increase the rate of public transport takeup from its current level of around four per cent to around 10 per cent. It will not be a stand-alone light rail system. We will also improve bus services so that the local bus network better hooks into the light rail network, making the Gold Coast a more sustainable public transport city. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017193"></A>
In the weeks ahead the government intends to ask the market for expressions of interest in this project. We expect to partner with the private sector on the delivery of the project. In direct response to the question of the member for Gaven, through TransLink the state government will bear the revenue risk. As is well understood, public transport is not a huge money maker. For instance, at the moment in the public transport network commuters pay about 25 per cent and government pays about 75 per cent of the real cost. As we have always said, the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project will be a part of the TransLink network and, as such, the revenue risk will be borne by government. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The Bligh government is committed to building 21st century classrooms throughout our state schools in Queensland. The opposition is committed to cutting jobs, cutting capital works and cutting the services that should be delivered on the front line in the education sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019419"></A>
Yesterday I was pleased to join the member for Everton and the Premier in announcing the next phase of the $1 billion State Schools of Tomorrow program--that is, $200 million of capital works to be rolled out over the next 18 months. That will involve over 300 schools, 1,800 classrooms and 320 projects the length and breadth of Queensland employing 1,500 workers across the state. This is the program that we are now undertaking to build first-class facilities throughout Queensland because we want first-class facilities, along with first-class teaching and educational programs and first-class teachers. I congratulate the Queensland Teachers Union and teachers for coming to a sensible, proactive compromise with the government about quality teaching over the next three years so that we can also put $1 billion into quality teaching over the next three years. We are investing in infrastructure. We are investing in new schools. We are investing in extra pay. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019423"></A>
This program is a smaller version of the bigger $18 billion infrastructure building program, protecting and creating 127,000 jobs, that is vital to Queensland’s future. But what do those opposite want to do? They went to the March election with a recipe for cutting jobs--36,000 workers over three years--and a three per cent productivity or efficiency dividend. They went to the election with a proposal to freeze and reduce capital works, which would mean that this $200 million would not be rolled out. They went to the election committed to cutting vital services. They have since opposed Building the Education Revolution in Queensland. The member for Gympie wanted an 18 per cent pay rise for teachers. The member for Moggill said that if we pay teachers more there will be less money for capital works. They are all over the shop when it comes to their position. It has been 234 days since the election. They have no policies, no ideas and no education and training plans for Queensland on the LNP website. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability. Last week the Gladstone airshed study findings stated that the region’s air quality is comparable to that in the south-east corner. Given the very significant difference in population between the south-east corner and Gladstone, will the airshed quality in Gladstone continue to be a focus for government for monitoring and improvement? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019437"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms JONES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I can assure the member for Gladstone that the monitoring of Gladstone’s air quality will continue to be a priority for this government. I know that personally she is very passionate about this issue and has made many representations on behalf of her constituents to me as the current minister and also to previous ministers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019438"></A>
The member would also be aware that since we have been in government we have actually expanded the number of sites at which we conduct monitoring in Gladstone. This has been as a consequence of lobbying from the member and also because we understand the genuine concerns in the community. But of course, as always, I undertake to this House that we will continue to monitor air quality and employ the environmental laws that we have put in place to ensure the protection of that community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019439"></A>
Let us be very clear about the record of environmental protection in this state. This government has introduced tougher environmental protections than any other government in the history of Queensland. That is because we believe that we have to protect the unique environment that we have here, and this includes monitoring air quality not only in Gladstone but also in other communities across Queensland. For example, one of the first trips I made as minister for the environment was to Mount Isa, where I met with the member for Mount Isa, Betty Kiernan, and members of the local community who were also concerned about environmental air quality in their community. I unveiled new monitoring technology, which was a first. The technology was actually borrowed from NASA--so it is NASA technology that we have in Mount Isa. It gives real-time, quality information on air monitoring in Mount Isa. This is something that was fundamentally welcomed by the community and something that I know the member for Mount Isa supports. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019445"></A>
In answering the member for Gladstone’s question, I assure her and take this opportunity to assure all of the people of Gladstone that we will continue to monitor air quality in Gladstone. This is part of our commitment and we have done this and proven this by expanding the air monitoring stations in that community. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BOYLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would have thought honourable members opposite would be pleased indeed to hear the news that I have about the Sunshine Coast council. A survey was published in the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunshine Coast Daily</Hansard-Italic>
 a couple of months ago which found that 65 per cent of residents were satisfied with the performance of the amalgamated Sunshine Coast council. I was pleased then to take the opportunity to visit the Sunshine Coast council. The mayor, several councillors and officers of the council met with me and detailed just some of their very considerable accomplishments in the 18 months or so that it was at that point since amalgamation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019459"></A>
There would be no doubt that this was as difficult an amalgamation as any could be--three very different councils with different cultures and different histories. Obviously there was concern from a proportion of Sunshine Coast residents. But the council, the mayor and the councillors have stepped up to the mark. I will give some examples of the ways in which they are indeed leading into the future. They are planning for the next 20 years. I have copies of wonderful planning documents in which the Sunshine Coast community is invited to participate. They include <Hansard-Italic>
Our place our future</Hansard-Italic>
 and, with <Hansard-Italic>
Our place our future</Hansard-Italic>
, the announcement of a new planning scheme and ways in which the community can participate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1173205"></A>
Not only that, the Sunshine Coast has also released a draft biodiversity strategy, a draft climate change strategy, a flooding and stormwater management discussion paper, an open space discussion paper, an affordable living discussion paper, a cultural heritage background study and a sustainable transport discussion paper. In fact, this council is stepping up to the mark, and how! Already the council has announced considerable savings--$60 million in savings from a change to the regional sewerage network, something that would not have been possible pre amalgamation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019464"></A>
Is it getting support from its local members? We would expect that its local state members would be proud indeed of their achievements, but not so the member for Noosa, Mr Elmes. He never stops talking about yesterday, about ‘de-amalgamating’. He and the shadow spokesperson for local government are yesterday’s men. Along with their Liberal and National colleagues they talk about yesterday, whereas the Sunshine Coast council talks about the future. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport. I refer the minister to a case where his department has delayed and advised parents seeking help for their child to perjure themselves in court by falsely admitting to child abuse. Will the minister now undertake to introduce early real intervention programs within Child Safety Services so that parents are not placed in this position? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019473"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question and for finally, after eight months, asking a child safety question. I think it is important that Child Safety Services has children as its No. 1 priority. Child safety officers look at children in very complex family situations and make decisions based on what is best for the child. At no stage should child safety officers--and they do not--tell parents to perjure themselves. The issues that the member is talking about are very complex. There are difficult situations when it comes to the care of children, particularly children who are born with significant disabilities. These are heartbreaking decisions that parents have to make as to whether they can look after the child in the longer term or whether they need to put the child into the care of the department. The government recognises that there is a small number of parents who have raised this issue who have not been able to care for their children. I have met personally with people in this regard. The Minister for Disability Services also met with me in that regard. We are working together to ensure that families can make the best decision for themselves and for the child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019474"></A>
It is not easy, it is very complex and we need to work through that. We now have a situation in the Department of Communities where there is no wrong door. There is a range of services we can utilise to work together to ensure that our No. 1 priority is the child’s best interests. We can then work with the families to decide what are the best choices for themselves. As I said, it is very complex and it is very difficult. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019476"></A>
If the member has a specific case, I am quite prepared to sit down and talk with him. Obviously I cannot talk publicly about individual cases, but I would be prepared to speak to him to give him the full facts of particular cases. This is a very complex situation. There is not one decision that fits all cases in Queensland, but I am quite prepared to work with him and discuss individual cases with him. I will continue to work with the Minister for Disability Services to ensure that in these complex situations children are our No. 1 priority and the best decisions are made for those children. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition) (11.32 am): Integrity starts with telling the truth. Today the Premier has come in here and waxed lyrical about integrity and accountability in her <Hansard-Italic>
Response to Integrity and Accountability in Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
. But there is nothing under the ‘strong rules’ section on page 8 that says, ‘Tell the truth when you go to the ballot box.’ When I travel around the state, that is what the people of Queensland are so angry about. There is nothing in the ‘strong rules’ to say that politicians and the Premier should tell the truth when they go to the ballot box. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028090"></A>
‘Strong scrutiny’ is mentioned on page 11 and yet today the Premier has used the executive government to change the name of the Members’ Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee, without any consultation with the parliament, to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee. This was the very same committee that was looking into the matters of Gordon Nuttall in December 2005. The government used its numbers to absolve the former member for Sandgate of the issues that the Members’ Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee was going to deal with. Now the Premier has the gall to come into this House and change its name to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028094"></A>
We talk about integrity and yet we know that this is the same Premier who last week used the numbers to vote down legislation that would make members and ministers tell the truth in this House. The Premier has the gall to come in here and say that we have issues of integrity and accountability that can only be dealt with by this <Hansard-Italic>
Response to Integrity and Accountability in Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028096"></A>
Today we also heard the Premier talk about Labor Holdings and defend the resources that Labor Holdings has and which it built up over 20 years, potentially of corrupt donations. Who is to know, because we cannot find out? The Premier now wants to cut donations from private enterprise or corporations to all parties to $1,000 when the government has this massive resource. Directors of Labor Holdings and lobbyists sit on government owned corporation boards and make investments affecting government, and of course that helps to build on the revenue they have. This change which the Premier is making will not affect union donations. The Premier said this morning that union donations may well be capped at $1,000 but not the issue of parallel campaigns. Again, it is a distraction of the Premier. Unions will, as they did in the Work Choices debate, and as the Queensland Teachers Union and the Queensland Public Sector Union did at the last election, spend millions of dollars on campaigns to which the LNP has no access. The people of Queensland want a level playing field in terms of resourcing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028102"></A>
The Premier then says, ‘We may well have public funding.’ This is just more money spent by the Labor government. Someone else can pay--OPM, other people’s money. Labor are very good at using that but not at ensuring that we have a fair, equitable election system. That is where the Premier, as I say, has come into parliament today talking about these issues. When I travelled around Queensland talking about saving jobs and stopping privatisation, we saw deception in the government’s ‘myths, not facts’ brochure. Economists, university lecturers, investment bankers and other observers are talking about the sale of assets that the Premier has announced taking place over three to five years. Yesterday in the <Hansard-Italic>
Financial Review</Hansard-Italic>
 whilst Forestry Plantations Queensland may be sold by the end of the year, the other assets are now slated to be sold by 2010-11. Again, there were a number of spurious claims in the ‘myths, not facts’ document including the claim about raising $15 billion which will save $12 billion on investment in those assets. These are monopoly assets for which the government says it is going to claim all this interest, and yet it is talking about interest rates potentially of 12 per cent when of course we know it pays seven. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028103"></A>
We have a loss of $320 million per annum of income which is going to put pressure on future deficits. We have a disastrous record of privatisation from the government. It claims that the asset sales are only a particular percentage. We saw last week in the parliament the government did not know whether it was one per cent or what it was. I say very clearly, as I said last week, the LNP going to the next election will tell the people of Queensland what we will do after an election. We will stick to it afterwards and we will also be upfront and honest with the people of Queensland, and not change our minds before the writs are returned. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr SPRINGBORG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southern Downs--LNP) (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (11.36 am): No amount of spin and deception and promises to this parliament by a government and a Premier which apparently have undergone a conversion on the road to political annihilation is going to save them from the wrath of the people of Queensland who were deliberately misled and deliberately deceived at the last state election. Make no mistake about it: when you look at the Premier and those members opposite who owe their very existence in this parliament to political deception and misleading, the people of Queensland are never, ever going to forget or forgive them for that level of dishonesty. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028108"></A>
If the Premier is absolutely committed to restoring integrity to the electoral system in Queensland, then the Premier should make a commitment to tell the truth at elections. That is the fundamental problem which is underpinning the lack of faith and confidence in the electorate at the moment. This Premier went to the last state election and deliberately deceived the people of Queensland by not telling them of secret plans to introduce a fuel tax and to privatise so much of public owned infrastructure in Queensland. That is the fundamental problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028109"></A>
This Premier has been dragged kicking and screaming to this conversion also by the words of Tony Fitzgerald in recent times. To add insult to injury, this government, through this Premier, wants to enshrine the natural political advantage of the Labor Party in Queensland. Make no mistake about it: the reforms that the Premier is talking about today selectively enshrine the natural political advantage of the Labor Party by disadvantaging its political opponents, whether it be the opposition, or Independents or anybody else who wants to step up to the mark in Queensland. How does it do that? It does that by enshrining the advantage that comes from Labor Holdings and the massive war chest that it has there, and not restricting the money that can go in there or come out of that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028139"></A>
The Premier has weaselled around this today because she has no intention of making amendments. Parallel campaigns are in no way going to be dealt with. What did we see at the last state election? We saw the Queensland Council of Unions contribute $335,000 in parallel campaigning, the Queensland Teachers Union contribute $73,000 in parallel campaigning and the Queensland Public Sector Union contribute $222,000 in parallel campaigning to the Labor Party. That does not include the direct donations from the unions of $2.8 million, of which $220,000 went into a hopelessly unsuccessful attempt by the CFMEU to unseat the member for Mirani. So we see the natural advantage that actually goes to the Labor Party from the unions and its courtier of mates who are very happy to go out there and run parallel campaigns. That will be enshrined by the laws that Anna Bligh is going to introduce in this parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028143"></A>
There are no other organisations that run parallel campaigns and as descriptively go out there and advocate a vote for a particular political party like the unions do. The other parallel campaigns which are generally run are benign and do not even advocate a vote for a particular political party and therefore would not even be noticed. If we seek to put a cap of $1,000 on these donations it in no way affects the natural political advantage of the Labor Party because the millions of dollars that would otherwise have gone into direct donations will go into parallel campaigns that will say exactly the same thing. There will be millions of dollars. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028144"></A>
This is very similar to what we saw during the last federal election where the union movement spent some $28 million in parallel campaigning supporting the Rudd government. This is about enshrining advantage. If the government was serious it would take on board what the LNP has been suggesting--that is, a cap on election expenditure. That levels the playing field in Queensland. Those opposite do not level the playing field in elections when they seek to restrict the donations and the availability of resources to one side of politics and enhance and enshrine their natural advantage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028145"></A>
This is not about accountability. This is about the Labor Party and a desperate rearguard action to try to keep themselves in government in perpetuity in Queensland. Make no mistake about it. It cannot do it honestly. It cannot do it by taking a policy platform to the people of Queensland. It has to do it deceptively in this most disadvantageous manner. That is what this is about today. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SHINE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (11.42 am): In contrast I wish to make a positive contribution to the debate, particularly in relation to two matters that are occurring in my area--one in my electorate and the other in the wider Toowoomba area. The first is the representation I made on the behalf of the Minister for Sport and the Minister for Education to officially mark the start of the construction of the Highfields State School’s new multipurpose community auditorium. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028151"></A>
The new high-quality purpose-built indoor auditorium will be an asset to the school and the wider community of Highfields. The Queensland government was delighted to contribute $1.1 million towards the project. Some $584,000 was provided through the community’s Major Facilities Program with a further $515,000 from Education Queensland’s Smart Schools subsidy. The Australian government also contributed $1.5 million through its Building the Education Revolution program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028155"></A>
I would like to highlight here that the school’s P&amp;C will also contribute $200,000 towards the fit-out of the facility. That is a fantastic effort and a clear demonstration that the Highfields community is well and truly behind this project. I particularly wish to mention the invaluable work done by a long-term advocate and current P&amp;C treasurer, Bronwyn Cairns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028157"></A>
The Major Facilities Program provides funding to develop and enhance sport and recreation infrastructure to meet community participation needs, to support local, regional, state, national and international levels of training and competition, and to attract and host key sporting events. This exciting project will involve construction of a new auditorium to provide a venue for sports activities for the school and the local community. A wide range of sporting activities will be catered for including gymnastics, dance, karate, skipping, ball games, handball, aerobics, porta bowl, badminton, futsal, volleyball, table tennis and others. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028159"></A>
It will also be suitable for use by the school’s music and drama program. The facility will also be available for use for the community outside school hours and during school holidays. I am told that activities including dance, karate, gymnastics, after school and vacation care, girl guides and other sports are already being planned. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028160"></A>
As a government, we are very keen to encourage more Queenslanders of all ages to get involved in sport and recreation. Sport can teach important values and life skills including self-confidence, team work, communication, inclusion, discipline, respect and fair play. It also teaches the importance of setting and achieving goals, perseverance for success, what healthy competition is all about, as well as how to handle success and defeat. Sport can prepare children and young people for their future, whether it be on the playing field or throughout their working career. Importantly, it helps lay the ground work for a lifetime of good health. Through the Toward Q2: Tomorrow’s Queensland initiative we are aiming to make Queenslanders Australia’s healthiest people by reducing obesity by one-third by 2020. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028163"></A>
Secondly, I refer to an occasion when I represented the Hon. Craig Wallace, the Minister for Main Roads, to officially commission the upgrading of the Spring Street to Nelson Street section of the New England Highway. When it comes to our road network, the state government’s message is clear: our top priority is safety. The upgrade is a fine example of the government’s investment in improving safety and traffic efficiency in regional areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028165"></A>
As part of this $12.2 million project, 1.46 kilometres of the highway has been upgraded to provide two 3.5-metre-wide traffic lanes. Work also included installation of traffic signals at the Nelson Street intersection, installation of raised medians, and upgraded drainage infrastructure and route lighting. Motorists now have dedicated turning lanes on Ruthven Street and Nelson Street, and the Albion Street intersection has also been upgraded. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028167"></A>
These works will help cater for growing traffic volumes on this section of the highway as well as provide a smoother and safer southern entrance to Toowoomba. The government also recognised the growing importance of cycling facilities to reduce congestion and encourage a greener and more sustainable approach to transport. To that end, the project features 1.5-metre bicycle lanes north bound and south bound. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028169"></A>
I congratulate the Department of Transport and Main Roads staff for their hard work on this project and also Basic Construction Services which undertook the construction work. This is the fifth in a series of projects to upgrade six intersections on the New England Highway as it passes through Toowoomba under the rural and regional roads funding initiative. Work has already been completed on the Griffith Street intersection, the Campbell Street-Chalk Drive intersection, the Alderley Street intersection and the section from James Street to Long Street. Work is taking place at the moment at the intersection of Jellicoe and Ruthven streets in North Toowoomba. This is all part of the government’s commitment to safety and transport efficiency and investing in regional areas. As the member for Toowoomba North, I had the pleasure to recently commission the second stage of the four-laning of the New England Highway at Highfields. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr MOORHEAD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Waterford--ALP) (11.47 am): I rise to bring to the attention of the parliament the outrageous exploitation of Mr Michael Petts by fringe credit providers who exploited a man at his most vulnerable. Michael is the son of my constituent Mrs Margaret Dixon. Michael passed away in tragic circumstances in October last year. The circumstances of Michael’s death are currently before the coroner and, according to the rules of this House, cannot be raised in this place. Michael was a talented man who ironically had a rewarding career in the finance sector. Michael was a devoted father and husband. However, his life became more and more difficult with the onset of mental illness. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028182"></A>
Michael had been homeless for a short period. But in 2008 he was living in Brisbane Housing Co. accommodation in Kelvin Grove. Sadly, Michael was the victim of his own charity with a visitor who Michael had offered to help taking over Michael’s home, his bed and taking money from Michael. During periods of decline in his mental health Michael also found it difficult to control his financial affairs, often relying on family, friends and emergency relief agencies to provide the essentials to sustain him. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028183"></A>
In the debate that led up to the Consumer Credit (Queensland) and Other Acts Amendment Act 2008, I, like every other member of this parliament, was lobbied by the fringe credit providers about the imposition of an annual percentage rate of 48 per cent on lending. We were told by these lobbyists that credit providers were honest, decent providers who had the best interests of the borrower at heart. We were told that these payday loans were for one-off borrowers looking to pay the rego or an unexpected dentist bill. Chief among the lobbyists was the Cash Converters group. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028215"></A>
Cash Converters was misleading when it said that these loans did not exploit the vulnerable. It was misleading when it said that it was concerned for the interests of borrowers. I say this because Michael Petts’s circumstances are an example of a vulnerable person exploited with interest rates of 500 per cent and more constantly being put through the wringer of payday lending. This cycle of debt was made by Allegretto Pty Ltd trading as Cash Converters Fortitude Valley.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028222"></A>
On 20 February 2008 Michael Petts borrowed $195 from Cash Converters Fortitude Valley to repay a total of $263.25 over 23 days ending on 14 March 2008. That is an interest rate of 555 per cent per annum. On 15 March 2008, the day after the previous loan was to be repaid, Michael Petts borrowed a further $195 from Cash Converters Fortitude Valley to repay a total of $263.25 over 27 days ending on 11 April. That loan had an interest rate of 473 per cent per annum. On 14 April, three days after the previous loan was to be repaid, Michael borrowed $60 from Cash Converters Fortitude Valley at an interest rate of 511 per cent per annum. Three days after that repayment, he borrowed $70 at 532 per cent per annum. One day after repaying that, he borrowed $137 at 473 per cent interest. He repaid that loan and four days later he borrowed $100 at 555 per cent per annum. From February to July 2008 Michael had borrowed six loans of between 473 per cent and 555 per cent, earning Cash Converters a tidy $264 on lending $757 over a six-month period--all from someone who could not afford the loans and had a limited capacity to make financial decisions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1175333"></A>
On 31 July 2008 the regulations capping interest rates came into effect. On 1 August 2008, the first day of the operation of the cap, Michael Petts pawned a Nat King Cole CD worth all of $5 for a loan of $121 at a rate of 420 per cent per annum. Before the due date for repaying that loan, Michael again pawned the Nat King Cole CD, this time for $150 but again at a rate of 420 per cent per annum. All in all there were five sham pawnings of the Nat King Cole CD arrangement, all at 420 per cent per annum or more from 1 August until Michael’s death on 24 October 2008. While avoiding the legal obligations of the 48 per cent cap, Cash Converters Fortitude Valley has avoided even the most basic of moral obligations--not to exploit the most vulnerable in our community for financial gain. It is too late for Michael Petts, but I hope that Cash Converters will stop this disgusting practice. I can only hope that the current review of consumer credit by the Commonwealth government will close this loophole exploited by these loan sharks. While I congratulate former fair trading minister Margaret Keech and Kerry Shine on the introduction of the cap, behaviour like this means that consumer credit regulation must go further. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Caloundra--LNP) (11.52 am): In Queensland the provision of front-line medical services is delivered by our hardworking nurses--men and women who studied for a number of years and who devote themselves wholeheartedly to providing care and compassion to many people in the community. Nurses have fulfilled an important historic and, critically, professional role in the development of medical care in Queensland and without them we would be in a much sorrier state. The work that they undertake cannot be applauded enough. However, on a recent visit to Charters Towers I was shocked to read the health minister was reported in the local newspaper refusing to agree to establish a secure dementia unit at Eventide because ‘the appropriately qualified staff are not in place to ensure the provision of a safe and sustainable service’. That statement prompted angry comments from nurses disgusted that the health minister had denigrated their profession and clearly lacked insight into the work they were undertaking on behalf of the community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028232"></A>
Eventide has a bed capacity of about 110 and services a very large area assisting people who are going through difficult times in their old age and deals with dementia patients at the moment. The member for Mudgeeraba, Ros Bates, and I had the chance of talking to the action group leading the charge for a high-security dementia ward at Charters Towers on Saturday, 31 October. I can tell you this: the health minister was lucky he was not there. Della McDougall, a nurse of 40 years, made this comment--</Hansard-Body>

Who is he to judge what nurses know and do. He has put down our whole town--Charters Towers doesn’t matter.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1028237"></A>
A lady by the name of Grace Robertson, who has been living in Charters Towers for a period of 10 years, made this comment--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028239"></A>
Why would people want to become nurses when they are treated like that by the Minister?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1028243"></A>
Families in the last 12 months, who have relatives in Eventide, have been told they will have to go, because they can’t look after them.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028244"></A>
Charters Towers is a proud community, and it is proud of its heritage and it is proud of the enormous contribution it has made and is making to this state. Equally, the nurses in Charters Towers are proud of the contribution they make to the care and health services they give not just to people who live in Charters Towers but to all who live in the region. Nurses in Charters Towers are appalled that the health minister has made such an attack on their capacity to provide services to the people they love, the people they know and the people they are committed to providing health care for.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028245"></A>
The action group is not going to let this matter rest. This group of dedicated men and women, including retired nurses, are going to fight this battle. They are going to fight the battle because it is the right thing to do because they understand that Charters Towers needs a secure high-care dementia unit. Without doubt the health minister is wrong--plainly wrong--when he makes these disparaging comments in relation to the nurses of Charters Towers. These are women and men who provide excellent service and excellent care. Nurses with 40 years experience have a lot to say about the provision of health services and people like the health minister should be listening to them, not classing them as inappropriately qualified. This action group will continue its campaign, and I support it all the way. The member for Dalrymple has fought a hard and consistent campaign on behalf of the people of Charters Towers, and the LNP supports him. The member is a man who believes in the capacity and ability of nurses, as I do. This action group will continue its fight and it will take the issue to the front gates of Eventide on Saturday week.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr WATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Everton--ALP) (11.55 am): I have mentioned before in this House that obesity is a major cause of preventable chronic disease and is a big threat to the health of Queenslanders and the state budget--something that should be of concern to all taxpayers. The latest figures show that six in 10 Queensland men and four in 10 Queensland women are overweight or obese, and those rates are going up. That is why the Bligh government is committed to its Toward Q2 target to make Queenslanders Australia’s healthiest people by cutting obesity by one-third by 2020. I am pleased in my new capacity as the Parliamentary Secretary for Healthy Living to inform members about a recent award received by the Queensland government in recognition of our efforts to tackle obesity.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028253"></A>
For the second year running, the Queensland government has been awarded a gold medal for its commitment to battling obesity by the Australian and New Zealand Obesity Society. The award was presented as part of the national Couch Potato Awards at the society’s annual scientific meeting where states are ranked from best to worst according to their efforts to prevent obesity. Speaking on behalf of the obesity society, Monash University public health researcher Dr Anna Peeters said that the strong leadership by the Queensland government on issues related to obesity prevention has lifted Queensland above other parts of Australia. The society mentioned the government’s commitment to make healthy foods more affordable and accessible, our work to address unhealthy foods in public facilities such as public hospitals, and significantly increased funding for public transport, cycling and walkways. The gold medal award demonstrates that we are making good progress towards meeting our Q2 target.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028259"></A>
In Queensland we currently have over 100 coordinated nutrition and physical activity initiatives being rolled out across government to help Queenslanders get healthier. We are also undertaking regular reporting of the cost and availability of healthy food throughout the state to help us better advocate for equity in access to healthy food regardless of where people live. In addition to this, we are coordinating over 115 local projects promoting nutrition and physical activity in communities, with these programs working specifically to help Queenslanders integrate more physical activity and healthy eating into their daily routines.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028260"></A>
We are all aware that in order to be healthier individuals we need to exercise and we need to eat healthily, preferably two fruit and five vegetable servings each and every day. But, for many of us, finding extra time in our lives to exercise seems almost impossible. Thankfully there are some great initiatives happening that can make being a healthier person a social activity that not only gets us moving but puts a smile on our face as well. Earlier this month I had the opportunity to participate in National Ride to Work Day, and that certainly put a smile on my face. Even more so, it put a very big smile on the faces of the people who saw me in lycra. That was a way for each of us to not only find our 30 but also see how easy it can be to incorporate more exercise in our daily routines. I know the member for Moggill also likes sporting his lycra every now and then as well. We can have a lycra show one day! Not only does exercise make us healthier; it also positively impacts the environment when we make choices to walk to the shops, ride to work or catch public transport. Just 30 minutes of activity a day can also help reduce the risk of developing heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, cancer and a range of other diseases.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028262"></A>
Recently the Minister for Sport highlighted that women play an important role in keeping families fit and healthy. I know the member for Ashgrove, the member for Bulimba and the member for Sandgate--all of whom I can see in the chamber--play a very great role in keeping their families fit and healthy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028304"></A>
Research shows that it is women who have the highest level of influence on physical activity levels and what we eat in the household. That is why the Queensland government is targeting women through the Find Your 30 campaign to encourage Queenslanders to be more active. Our research shows that Queensland women are engaging most with the Find Your 30 campaign which shows the important role that women are playing in Queensland to help create active futures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028307"></A>
The opportunities to get fit with others are endless. National Ride to School Day, National Health and Fitness Week, National Walk Safely to School Day and National Walk to Work Day are the kinds of initiatives that the Queensland government is partnering with and which led to us receiving the gold medal. So the next time an opportunity presents itself, I encourage people to get some friends together and give it a go. It is pleasing that the Queensland government’s efforts to reduce obesity have been recognised with this award. Queensland will continue to take an active role in combating obesity. Reducing the rate of obesity means giving Queenslanders the opportunity to live a long and healthy life free from chronic disease. It means that we will be on the right path to achieve our Q2 objective of becoming Australia’s healthiest people. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr FLEGG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Moggill--LNP) (12.00 pm): I want to address some remarks to the government’s appalling handling of the professional teaching workforce in this state. Over the past many months we have seen an ugly confrontation between the government and its professional teaching workforce--a confrontation that has seriously harmed morale within the ranks of Queensland’s teachers and which has severely discouraged the recruitment of teachers in this state. We have been littered with quotes on this issue, particularly from the education minister. I draw particular attention to one dated 30 July when he said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028315"></A>
This industrial dispute will not be resolved through industrial action. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028316"></A>
It’ll only be resolved by the independent umpire ruling on the pay increase. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028317"></A>
The government had insisted that it could not afford to pay teachers any more than the initial offer. It could and it did, but it could have done so in a way that damaged our schools far less. The government said that it was committed to arbitration and that this issue would be dealt with by arbitration. No, it was not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028318"></A>
What changed? The things that the government said were set in cement did not prove to be set in cement. What changed was the political reality of a Premier who was under pressure and who sidelined her minister. It was no surprise to hear the public announcement and the ministerial statements on this issue this morning coming from the Premier, not the sidelined minister. That reminds us of another minister who had assets from her portfolio sold out from underneath her and who just days before did not even know. Here we have another minister who is irrelevant to his own portfolio--another failed minister who needed the Premier to come along and bail him out because he was out of his depth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028319"></A>
Aside from the politics of this issue, there was a missed opportunity for the government to work cooperatively with the professional teaching workforce of this state. Throughout this whole dispute, the LNP urged the government to respect and be supportive of the teachers of this state. We took a very responsible attitude. We did not throw around promises that everybody knew we could not deliver or that would not be relevant in another 2 years but urged the government to be strongly supportive and treat our teachers as professionals. Right from the beginning we maintained consistently that our teachers should not be the worst-paid teachers in this country.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028320"></A>
<Hansard-Bold>
A government member:</Hansard-Bold>
 They’re not.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028321"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 They certainly are not now. We maintained our concern about the way the government was exploiting so-called temporary teachers as a cost-cutting measure. From the beginning we expressed consistently our concern about the treatment and retention of senior teachers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028322"></A>
The pay deal that has been struck involves not just a 12 per cent increase across-the-board; it involves extra pay on top of that for beginner teachers--for stream 2 and stream 3 teachers. It involves one-off payments to teachers and it involves a whole new pay level being created, senior teachers level 2. Perhaps we could describe senior teachers level 2 as very senior teachers. This particular classification is available to teachers who have served four years or more and is based not just on their seniority but also on merit selection.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028323"></A>
I wish to comment particularly on temporary teachers. We have seen the number of what the government calls ‘temporary teachers’ increase from 2,000 teachers to 6,000 teachers, because it could dud them on holiday pay. After this decision, the government cannot dud temporary teachers on holiday pay anymore. I predict that we will see the government back away from its policy of employing everybody as temporary teachers so that it did not have to pay them holiday pay. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WETTENHALL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Barron River--ALP) (12.05 pm): Cape York and Torres Strait are recognised as two of the most spectacular and culturally important tourism regions in Queensland. To ensure that the potential of tourism in this vast region is developed, in 2008 the Queensland government adopted the Cape York Peninsula and Torres Strait Tourism Development Action Plan. The purpose of this plan is to provide a strategic vision for the future of tourism in Cape York and the Torres Strait that incorporates the aspirations of cape and island communities and the commercial realities of industry and to establish key tourism priorities such as infrastructure, training and capacity building for communities and tourism operators, product and market development and improved visitor management. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028329"></A>
The vision of the plan is to achieve long-term sustainable development of tourism on Cape York and the Torres Strait that respects and celebrates the culture, traditions and lifestyle of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, enhances environmental integrity and creates economic and social growth. The plan identified economic, social, cultural and environmental goals focused on developing a sustainable tourism industry. Among the key strategic priorities identified in the plan is enhanced public infrastructure to support tourism visitation and the effective management of visitor, environmental and social impacts. A priority action was to establish and develop a bush camping sites development program for Cape York on all land tenures and initially identify three site locations for the development of new infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028330"></A>
I am very pleased to report to the parliament that on Monday, 12 October 2009, together with the member for Cook, I travelled to Somerset in the northern peninsula area--not far from the tip of the cape--to officially open new bush camping facilities at this popular location for visitors. The facilities comprised toilets, a shelter and water storage and will greatly enhance the experience of visitors to this beautiful and historic site. The project was developed in partnership with the Gudang people, who are the traditional owners of the land, through the Aputhima Land Trust, and will be managed by the trust with the assistance of the Northern Peninsula Area Regional Council. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028335"></A>
A number of local people attended the opening ceremony including Aputhima Land Trust Chairman Mr Bernard Charlie and Councillor Gina Nona. I want to take this opportunity to again recognise and thank Mr Charlie and the trust for working cooperatively with the government to bring this project to fruition. These new facilities at Pulu--the Somerset bush camp--will generate an income stream for local people from the collection of camping fees and will provide some employment based on management of the area and facilities. The member for Cook and I were the first people to camp at Pulu. The camping registration receipt No. 001 bears our names. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028339"></A>
Whilst in the area we took the opportunity to inspect other sites throughout Cape York proposed for development of further bush camping and ecotourism facilities including the now abandoned Pajinka lodge near the very tip of Cape York and at Cockatoo Creek on the Old Telegraph Track. The tip of Cape York is the most northerly point on the Australian mainland and for many is the ultimate destination of their trip to the tip. Upon their arrival, though, visitors will find no facilities whatsoever. At such an iconic destination with such high visitation from both independent travellers and guided tours, this situation cannot be allowed to continue. As a first step to address this problem it has been agreed that funds will be allocated to conduct a site assessment to determine the best location and tenure for the development of new visitor facilities at this iconic location. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028343"></A>
Similarly at Cockatoo Creek, high visitation with no facilities is causing the area to become degraded. We must recognise that more and more people will come to the cape and that basic facilities have become necessary to safeguard hygiene, to avoid environmental damage and to meet visitor expectations. Subject to reaching agreement with the traditional owners, new facilities are proposed to be installed at this location as well.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028344"></A>
Throughout Cape York, people who work in the tourism industry reported to us that they had enjoyed one of their busiest seasons. The global financial crisis has obviously not deterred people from visiting the cape--no doubt for many the trip of a lifetime. There could be many explanations for this, but the continual improving condition of the Peninsula Development Road is undoubtedly one. This main access road through the cape is a tribute to our Main Roads workers and is in excellent condition. Through word-of-mouth in the travelling community, increasing numbers of people will have the confidence to visit the cape. Implementing the Cape York Peninsula and Torres Strait Tourism Development Action Plan will ensure a high-quality experience and yield new opportunities for the people who live in this unique and wonderful place. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms SIMPSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maroochydore--LNP) (12.09 pm): Frustrated commuters who are increasingly left waiting for trains that fail to turn up on time or have been cancelled will receive no comfort from the transport minister’s statement today. Just saying sorry is not enough when her apology is accompanied by her blatant denial of the extent of the problem. Minister Nolan’s defence of the state of Queensland Rail’s passenger system as nothing worse than ‘a series of unfortunate incidents’ demonstrates that the minister is out of touch or deliberately ignoring the issue. If she, as the minister responsible for public transport and the Queensland rail system, cannot see that the problem is bigger than a series of unfortunate incidents rather than a systemic failure which has been going on longer than October then she has no hope of delivering the service that Queenslanders deserve. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028381"></A>
In the last two weeks Citytrain achieved on-time performance standards on only one day for peak services. The weather was not the main reason for the failure; infrastructure failures were. Latest figures published in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 show that in 2008-09 1,000 train services failed to turn up on time due to infrastructure failures; rolling stock failures affected 900 train services; and weather was responsible for delaying only 346 train services. If members were to ask commuters whether they thought that the service was world class, as the government continues to claim, they would say no because what they are seeing is an almost daily failure of services due to maintenance issues on the track as well as issues with rolling stock. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028382"></A>
The performance standards of trains is one thing, but what is the ministerial charter of goals that the minister has received from the Premier? I asked the minister for that this morning and she refused to respond, which raises the question of what is in the minister’s performance standards and whether, in fact, she is meeting those standards. What are the key performance indicators? Is a key performance indicator of a Bligh government minister the ability to deny that there is a problem? Well, this is a problem that involves more than just a few one-off incidents.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028383"></A>
We know that there has been an increasing failure of the rail system which is unacceptable. We know that there is an increasing maintenance failure which is seeing points and signals failing and services closed down. We have not yet heard an explanation as to why a slow-moving train in the middle of the city fell off the tracks. That cannot be put down to a series of minor incidents. There is clearly an issue with the rail network when we see an ongoing problem with more and more days of lost time for commuters. Commuters in South-East Queensland, as well as all of Queensland, deserve a public transport system that works. They deserve honesty and transparency from the government about the real state of affairs and just what is affecting their services. What we have seen from the state government in response has been a push to blatantly put up fares and take more money from public commuters while denying that there is a problem with a service which is no longer reliable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028384"></A>
Today I have addressed the issues of Citytrain, but this problem is also reflected in freight and rail network services throughout Queensland. This is a problem which is not only affecting this particular service but is also having a huge impact given that we do need to encourage people to take public transport. That public transport has to be reliable, it has to be delivered; it is not good enough for the government to simply deny that there is a problem. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs ATTWOOD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Ommaney--ALP) (12.14 pm): I rise to speak about the great work and cooperation of the Department of Main Roads in upgrading the important road infrastructure that affects residents and businesses in the Mount Ommaney electorate. Those projects include the multilevel Centenary Highway interchange, the Wacol to Darra Ipswich Motorway upgrade and the new Wolston Road, with consultations currently taking place regarding Progress Road and Sumners Road. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028388"></A>
Improved safety and traffic flow resulting in reduced congestion are just some of the benefits motorists will experience when the federally funded Ipswich Motorway upgrade from Wacol to Darra is completed by December 2010. Residents of my electorate have told me how much they appreciate the free-flowing access between the Centenary Highway and the Ipswich Motorway due to the completion of the multilevel Centenary Highway interchange. Previously, traffic along the highway backed up from Sumners Road during peak times, making it frustrating and time consuming for people to commute to work. More than 55,000 vehicles travel along this interchange every day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028389"></A>
Businesses in the Sumner Park Industrial Estate sought my representation last year in relation to their concerns about the impending closure of Bullockhead Street into the estate due to the construction of fast lane off-ramps from this interchange. The then Minister for Main Roads, the honourable Warren Pitt, listened to my concerns and a temporary ramp was constructed at a cost of $3 million to keep Bullockhead Street open for an extended period. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028390"></A>
During this period work started promptly on the new Wolston Road access and egress out of the estate. When I raised the issue with the Lord Mayor at a chamber of commerce meeting he agreed to fund the Wolston Road project as an election commitment prior to the council election in March 2008. However, the Lord Mayor advised that council would have to take three years to design and construct the road. Main Roads came to the rescue and completed the work in months to coincide with the closure of Bullockhead Street. This was supported by local businesses during negotiations with me and the former minister. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028391"></A>
Main Roads started work in February 2009 and the road was completed on 9 October this year. It was a real shame that the Lord Mayor and the councillor for Jamboree Ward chose not to invite the councillor for the area and me as the local member to the official opening of the road. It was more shameful that Main Roads people responsible for the project were not even invited to the opening. The LNP decided to take front-page credit for the project without even acknowledging the valuable contribution of Main Roads who saved council over $3 million in construction costs and a lot of inconvenience and time. This is typical of the arrogance of the LNP council administration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028392"></A>
Main Roads was able to use its established team to overcome many of the time-consuming hurdles that council would have faced in constructing the road such as site establishment, calling and assessing tenders, acquiring materials, hiring machinery and subcontractors, development of the budget and cost management, relocation of services and allocating money to one year instead of three. As the state member for the area, I can only applaud the work of the team at Main Roads who always conduct themselves in a professional manner and just get on with the job. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028393"></A>
In relation to the Progress Road interchange, the project is in its detailed planning multicriteria analysis phase. From 24 August to 20 September three possible design options were publicly displayed and meetings were held with key stakeholders and directly affected owners. A final report is being developed that incorporates the estimated cost of the three options and the development of the preferred option. The preferred option will be available for public consultation from March to mid-2010. Main Roads will be lodging a funding application with the federal and state government budget review committees in relation to stage 1 construction costs which include a bridge over the Ipswich line and removing the current level crossing at Wacol. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028394"></A>
Further great news for residents of the Mount Ommaney electorate is the work that is being done to look at the problem of congestion along Sumners Road in morning peak hour. I took this issue to the Main Roads minister earlier this year and to the previous minister late last year advising of my concerns regarding safety and delays occurring along the stretch of Sumners Road leading to the bridge. I am pleased that Main Roads are working towards a solution to this issue as part of a proposed longer term Centenary Highway upgrade in the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028395"></A>
During the state election a campaign flyer was put out by the local councillor and the LNP candidate promising $9 million from council to fix Sumners Road. We still have not heard from the local councillor about when the promise will be implemented. I guess it is just another election ruse along with all of the other promises made by the candidate at that time. On the part of this government, we are sticking to our commitments to improve the road and transport options in this region and Main Roads is certainly doing all it can to satisfy the needs of residents and motorists in the Mount Ommaney electorate. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs PRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nanango--Ind) (12.19 pm): One of the greatest political slogans I have ever heard is, ‘It’s time’. I am going to steal that slogan and say that it is time for a new hospital in Kingaroy to service the South Burnett. It is time that this issue was addressed in an appropriate manner. The time is now. Today I ask the minister to ensure that, in this instance, the government is not labelled as being all talk and no action. I ask him to take responsibility for all the talk that has gone on over the years and to state that the time for talk is over; there will be a new hospital to service the many thousands of residents of the South Burnett. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028424"></A>
We have had our makeovers, our bandaids and our patches. The poor old hospital is really starting to break down. It is tired. Its carcass is starting to disintegrate and that is affecting everybody, including the townsfolk and the people who work in the building. It is time for a greenfield site to be nominated and it is time for the plans to be drawn up. Members may be aware of a recent and potentially disastrous event that happened at the hospital involving the lift, which is not a very modern one. The hospital that we currently work with was built in 1938. It is 71 years old. If the lift is 71 years old, it is pretty old. Some have said that the lift was built in 1968, but I believe it was built at the same time as the hospital, so it is 71 years old. It is an old lift. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1028425"></A>
Recently, a small nut came loose, jamming the lift door’s locking mechanism. Until that particular fateful day, baby Isabella Nimere-Dirago was a perfect one-year-old baby. Although she will not remember how she got the scars on her face, her family will. Little Isabella’s pram plummeted down the elevator shaft when the lift fault allowed the doors to open while the lift was on another floor. In a desperate attempt to save the baby, her mother, Shevaun, lost her balance and tumbled into the lift shaft onto her baby. One can imagine the desperation that that young mother felt as she tried not to land on her baby. Can members imagine what went through her mind? She thought she was going to crush to death her own baby. It was a real possibility. They were both relatively lucky and escaped that end. However, the family that watched them fall felt that they may be going to more funerals than the one they had just attended. As it was, Isabella and her mother were lucky. They were flown out of Kingaroy. Isabella underwent cosmetic surgery for the lacerations on her face and her mum received treatment for an arm broken in several places. That was a relatively good outcome, but it may not have been so good. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028428"></A>
We know that all buildings have to receive maintenance, as this hospital does all the time. But this lift disaster, which is not the first little disaster to happen at the hospital, is a symptom of an ageing and deteriorating building. The lift has now been certified safe following an investigation. But it is time to nominate a greenfield site for a new hospital. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028429"></A>
This has been going on for a long time. Three years ago I was told that Kingaroy was one of four towns earmarked for a new hospital. That was three years ago. Recently the mayor was told that we were one of two being considered. I can only assume he was acting in sheer frustration when the mayor suggested that the lift be done away with and the first-floor services be put into demountable buildings, but that is totally impractical. However, I can understand his frustration, as we are simply trying to get services for the people in our districts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028430"></A>
Our doctors, nurses and other staff deserve decent facilities. Visiting specialists deserve adequate facilities. I am aware of the significant body of work that has been done, but bandaids and braces can no longer fix our hospital. It has to be replaced. As small country hospitals are converted to aged-care facilities or closed, diminishing available services even further, the need for a new hospital increases. I ask the minister: do not let another baby, do not let a patient, do not let anyone fall down and hurt themselves because of our deteriorating hospital. We all know it is deteriorating and needs to be replaced. It is time. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms JARRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Whitsunday--ALP) (12.23 pm): Living and working in Queensland’s regions is a huge privilege. We do not need to plan for traffic congestion on the way to work and we do benefit from our proximity to the very best of nature’s gifts. As great as it is to visit cities like Brisbane and enjoy access to fantastic cultural and retail facilities, I do not know many people who would voluntarily swap their lifestyle in regional Queensland for a city existence. There is no doubt that rural living has its challenges and there is a perception that our city cousins get the lion’s share of the state’s wealth at the expense of those living in the bush. When I hear those comments, I remind people that the Labor government in Queensland has developed a 10-year partnership plan with AgForce and the LGAQ that has been specifically designed to support rural and regional communities. It is called Blueprint for the Bush and it aims to foster and support the development of sustainable, liveable and prosperous rural communities in Queensland. Funding and assistance has been delivered to the bush through this whole-of-government project. Today I will tell the House about just two projects delivered through the program for the benefit of regional Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028434"></A>
Several weeks ago I was proud to represent the Minister for Primary Industries, Tim Mulherin, to officially launch a B4B funded regional branding initiative that seeks to promote the Whitsundays by supporting products grown or produced in the region. The logo, ‘Made in the Whitsundays’, aims to signify quality in the products carrying the brand. It will extend the tourism experience beyond the usual activities to include eating quality local produce and purchasing examples of products that truly reflect the total experience that is the Whitsundays. This is a very timely initiative for the local horticultural industry based around Bowen, as they seek to delineate their high-quality produce in a competitive market. They were pleased indeed that Minister Mulherin endorsed the brand at a launch at the Brisbane produce markets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028436"></A>
However, fresh produce is just part of the story. One local eatery, the award-winning Capers restaurant at Airlie Beach, has taken on the challenge of promoting high-quality local produce through its locavore menu. Having sampled dishes based on local pork, fish and beef, together with the world’s best fresh fruit and vegetables, followed by our locally produced coffee, I can honestly say that I think Mark Bell and the team at Capers have hit on a winning formula. Best of all, our visitors go away with fantastic memories of the Whitsundays, based as much on culinary experience as anything else they might do. This is a great initiative that has been developed by the local economic development group, Enterprise Whitsunday, with the assistance of funding from the Blueprint for the Bush program, an absolutely winning combination. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028441"></A>
A week or so ago, along with 40 other groups from rural and regional Queensland, a group from the Whitsundays came to Brisbane for the 2009 Country and Regional Living Expo. This event was held at the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre and its aim was to bring the country to the city in a way that alerted cityfolk to the incredible opportunities that await those who make a tree change or a sea change. The expo gave regional shires and communities the chance to market themselves and display the benefits of living, working and playing in their areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028443"></A>
The weekend’s events kicked off with a country breakfast for more than 1,500 lucky commuters at Central Railway Station. A number of regional members of parliament attended the breakfast and worked up a sweat serving bacon and egg rolls to hungry travellers, while making sure that everyone knew about the opportunity to find out more about the country at the weekend’s expo. It is not just the relaxed lifestyle that lies in wait for tree and sea changers. There are also many job opportunities in both traditional and emerging sectors to be found in areas right across the state. A jobs board at the expo set out in detail 350 real jobs that are available in regional and country centres right now. Also on display was a list of business and investment opportunities for those wanting to take up those particular opportunities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028444"></A>
I am pleased to say that the exhibitors were successful in generating interest among the visitors to the expo. About 62 per cent of those who completed the visitor registration forms indicated a desire to move to regional Queensland within six months to two years. I congratulate the enthusiastic councils and regional organisations that travelled to Brisbane to take advantage of this Blueprint for the Bush sponsored event. As a regional member, I was certainly proud to launch the Country and Regional Living Expo. I hope that those whose interest was sparked by the event continue to do the research and make their dreams a reality by moving to one of our amazing regional areas. They will most certainly be made to feel welcome when they come. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (12.29 pm): I present a bill for an act to provide for an integrity commissioner, to facilitate the giving of advice to ministers and others on ethics or integrity issues, to establish a register of lobbyists and provide appropriate limitations on the contact between lobbyists and government representatives, including by providing for a code of conduct and prohibiting the payment of success fees, and to make particular related amendments of this act, the Government Owned Corporations Act 1993, the Local Government Act 2009, the Parliament of Queensland Act 2001, the Public Sector Ethics Act 1994, the Public Service Act 2008 and the Right to Information Act 2009.

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028489"></A>
In August this year the government released the discussion paper <Hansard-Italic>
Integrity and Accountability in Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
 to seek public input on how Queensland’s integrity and accountability framework could be improved and strengthened. The feedback from Queenslanders was clear: Queensland already has a robust integrity system but there is always room for improvement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028490"></A>
This bill is the first step in our process of strengthening Queensland’s integrity and accountability framework. As I have already announced this morning, a comprehensive program of reform will be completed by the end of 2010 which will build on the initiatives in this legislation. This bill implements wide-ranging enhancements to the functions and independence of the Integrity Commissioner, in recognition of the importance of this unique role to the effective functioning of our integrity framework. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028491"></A>
The Integrity Commissioner will become an independent officer of the parliament reporting through a parliamentary committee. To facilitate this, the Parliament of Queensland Act 2001 will be amended to rename the current Members’ Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee as the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee. This committee will take on the additional function of oversight of the Integrity Commissioner’s performance and functions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028492"></A>
The bill provides the Integrity Commissioner with several important additional functions. Firstly, the Integrity Bill provides that any member of parliament may seek advice from the Integrity Commissioner. I have previously made it clear that I would require all government members of parliament to meet with the Integrity Commissioner annually. The bill facilitates these annual meetings which will be available for all members of parliament. This expansion of the Integrity Commissioner’s role is designed to ensure that members of parliament receive regular independent advice on dealing with potential conflicts between their personal interests and their public duties as elected representatives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028493"></A>
Secondly, the responsibilities of the Integrity Commissioner will be extended to include responsibility for the administration of the Register of Lobbyists. In an Australian first, the bill will create a statutory regime for the regulation of the lobbying industry by putting the current requirements of the Queensland Contact with Lobbyists Code in legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028494"></A>
In addition, we are delivering on my commitment to ban the payment of success fees to third-party lobbyists on the basis of achieving a successful outcome from government. These reforms will provide clear direction and oversight for the lobbying industry, establish a high standard of ethical practice within the industry and ensure the probity and accountability of interactions between government representatives and the lobbying industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028495"></A>
This bill will also introduce a new process to monitor and report on compliance with the requirement for directors-general to lodge statements of interests with their responsible minister. The Public Service Act 2008 will be amended to require CEOs to provide a copy of their statements of interest to the Integrity Commissioner with confirmation that the statement has been provided to their minister. The Integrity Commissioner will report on the compliance of chief executives with this requirement and will be able to identify any non-complying CEOs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028496"></A>
Finally, the Integrity Bill will amend the Government Owned Corporations Act 1993 to bring government owned corporations within the jurisdiction of the Crime and Misconduct Commission in relation to misconduct investigations. This will ensure that the use of public resources by these bodies is subject to the scrutiny of the CMC and that inappropriate behaviour can be appropriately pursued. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028497"></A>
The job of delivering integrity and accountability in government is an ongoing mission. This bill begins a process of reform which will implement significant enhancements to our current system. My government is committed to continuing to drive reform and will continue to work hard to ensure that our integrity and accountability framework reflects the very high standards of integrity, accountability, transparency and honesty that Queenslanders expect of their government, both now and into the future. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The Credit (Commonwealth Powers) Bill 2009, which I shall refer to as the referral bill, provides for the referral of power to the Commonwealth parliament to make laws for the regulation of credit and repeals relevant credit legislation in Queensland. The referral bill will enable the Commonwealth to establish a single national law for the regulation of credit. Consumer credit in Australia is presently regulated by states and territories by way of the uniform Consumer Credit Code. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028516"></A>
The Consumer Credit Code applies to most consumer credit including personal loans, continuing credit contracts, housing loans, leases and hire purchase agreements where the credit is for personal, domestic or household use. However, over the years some states and territories have introduced additional credit laws that are not consistent or even present in each jurisdiction--for example, interest rate caps and finance brokers legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028517"></A>
Because of these inconsistencies and the acknowledgement that credit does not end at state borders, in 2008 the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, agreed that responsibility for the regulation of credit matters, including finance broking, should be transferred from the states and territories to the Commonwealth. A seamless national regime will assist in ensuring that consumers are better protected in their dealings with credit products and credit providers, including finance brokers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028518"></A>
Upon completion of the transition, the Commonwealth will be the sole regulator and enforcer of the national credit laws. ASIC will be given extra powers to police the scheme. The transition of credit to the Commonwealth will be implemented in two phases. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028519"></A>
Phase 1 will be the transfer of responsibility for existing key credit regulation to the Commonwealth. The majority of the national laws will commence on 1 July 2010. However, low-level registration requirements, which require credit providers and finance brokers to provide their contact details to ASIC, will commence earlier, on 1 April 2010.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028520"></A>
The existing state and territory legislation, the Consumer Credit Code, will transition to a schedule to the Commonwealth’s National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009. The transition of the current Consumer Credit Code is an acknowledgement of the good work states and territories have done in the credit area to date.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031916"></A>
The scope of the present Consumer Credit Code will be extended by the Commonwealth to include regulation of credit provided to purchase, renovate, improve or refinance a residential investment property. Other key elements of phase 1 include a licensing regime for all providers of consumer credit and credit related services, and industry-wide responsible lending conduct requirements on licensees. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031919"></A>
The Commonwealth drafted its phase 1 laws in consultation with representatives from industry, consumer groups, and external dispute resolution schemes. Each state and territory has participated in the transition process through the Financial Services and Credit Reform Implementation Task Force, which is chaired by the Commonwealth. The Australian government introduced the National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009 into the federal parliament on 25 June 2009. The bill was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for a public inquiry and was subsequently passed by the Senate in late October 2009. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031921"></A>
Phase 2 of the transition consists of the Commonwealth considering additional credit matters such as extending the credit laws to small business and an examination of state approaches to interest rate caps. The Queensland government has strongly urged the Commonwealth to include an interest rate cap in its national regime and will continue to do so. All jurisdictions that currently have an interest rate cap will maintain them while the Commonwealth assesses the operation of the first phase of the national reforms in states both with and without interest rate caps. Queensland remains committed to an interest rate cap, and the bill gives effect to this by continuing Queensland’s interest rate cap regime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031922"></A>
To enable the Commonwealth to implement its new national credit laws, the states and territories must first pass legislation referring power for the regulation of credit to the Commonwealth. I turn now to the referral bill being introduced here today. The referral bill is based on section 51(xxxvii) of the Commonwealth Constitution, and is model legislation developed by all states and territories through the Parliamentary Counsel’s Committee. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031924"></A>
The provisions of the bill accord with the terms of an intergovernmental agreement--namely, the National Credit Law Agreement 2009--to which the Commonwealth, states and territories will be parties. The referral bill provides for a two-tiered approach to the referral of powers to the Commonwealth for credit matters. The initial reference is a text reference, which means that the text of the National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009 and the National Consumer Credit Protection (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2009, as tabled in the Legislative Assembly of Tasmania, is the lead referring state. I table a copy of those Commonwealth bills, which can also be accessed electronically at the Commonwealth government website at www.comlaw.gov.au.</Hansard-Body>

The second tier is the inclusion of a limited amendment reference to allow the Commonwealth to amend the referred credit matters. Part 3 of the referral bill lists the Queensland legislation that will be repealed upon commencement of the national credit laws. By making this referral of power, Queensland will be helping to deliver a historic national reform to improve the regulation of credit. This will enhance consumer protection and modernise Australia’s financial services marketplace. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031927"></A>
I would like to acknowledge the considerable efforts of industry, consumer groups, officers of the Commonwealth Treasury, ASIC and state and territory officers in progressing these important reforms to date. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms SIMPSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maroochydore--LNP) (12.43 pm): In rising to speak to the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009, I acknowledge that this is an omnibus bill which will amend a number of provisions across various acts. The acts to be specifically amended include the Maritime Safety Queensland Act 2002, the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994, Transport Operations (Marine Safety) Act 1994, Transport Operations (Passenger Transport) Act 1994 and the regulation under that act, the Transport Operations (Road Use Management) Act, the Transport Planning and Coordination Act 1994, and the Transport Security (Counter-Terrorism) Act 2008 for particular purposes, as well as making other consequential and minor amendments in the schedule. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031940"></A>
This omnibus bills includes diverse provisions. They seek to amend child related crime provisions for drivers of public passenger vehicles as well as protection of transport infrastructure for inappropriate development. The power to suspend or cancel taxi licences will be extended. It also expands transport inspectors’ powers to high-occupancy vehicle lanes as well as giving power to direct masters of ships and port infrastructure in exceptional circumstances in the public interest.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031941"></A>
The LNP will be supporting this bill, but we have some serious reservations about the impact of some of the provisions proposed by the government in this bill. In speaking to child related crimes specifically for public passenger vehicle drivers, I note that this section modifies the transport provisions preventing people convicted of particular crimes from receiving an authorisation to drive a public passenger vehicle. The proposed change will allow people who, when young, committed a child sex offence against a person of comparable age and who have not reoffended to apply for exceptional circumstances consideration by the chief executive to issue a public passenger vehicle licence. It is foreshadowed that such exceptional circumstances would apply to such cases as where a 17-year-old had a sexual relationship with an under-age person, for example, a 15-year-old girlfriend, and who has not reoffended since. In such cases it may be found that the applicant is not at risk of reoffending and exceptional circumstances can be found. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031943"></A>
Under the rules as established by the bill before the House, the chief executive must take any advice of the Commissioner for Children and Young People and Child Guardian into account. It is the LNP’s position that this is not strong enough. There is no obligation on the chief executive to consult the Commissioner for Children and Young People and Child Guardian and, if the commissioner recommends that exceptional circumstances should not be granted, there is no obligation on the chief executive to take this advice; only that this advice should be taken into account.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031946"></A>
Having consulted with experts in child safety, the LNP believes the safeguards must be stronger. I will be moving amendments during consideration in detail to address our concerns. These amendments have two aims--firstly, they require that the chief executive must consult with the Commissioner for Children and Young People and Child Guardian on whether there is a case for exceptional circumstances and, secondly, if the commissioner’s advice is that exceptional circumstances should not be granted, the chief executive must take the Commissioner for Children and Young People and Child Guardian’s advice. If the commissioner does not provided advice on this matter or the advice is that there is a case for exceptional circumstances, the discretion for the decision remains with the chief executive.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031949"></A>
As the government is advised that there is only an extremely small number of cases where exceptional circumstances may apply, this provision will not add unduly to the commissioner’s workload. The commissioner has skills, knowledge and access to make an informed decision on such matters. It is vital we do not allow watering down of our requirements on this issue by default. Queensland currently has some of the strictest rules in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031950"></A>
On a broader matter, I would ask that the minister give an absolute commitment that, in the moves underway towards a national licensing scheme, our strict rules will not be impacted. Other states have much less stringent rules providing public passenger driver licences to child sex offenders. Will the minister state unequivocally that the national process will not lessen the standards in Queensland?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031952"></A>
In addressing the issue of transport infrastructure and inappropriate development, we note that the provisions of this legislation are seeking to provide recognition particularly of prior use and to ensure that transport infrastructure’s uses are not compromised by inappropriate development in the vicinity. Transport infrastructure is critical for our society. I was advised during the government briefing on the bill that the reason for this amendment is unfortunately partly due to the removal of the concept of a social good under beneficial assets by the EPA. Public transport has been considered a social good under this rule. Obviously, that is no longer the case. This left public transport with no power to ensure inappropriate development did not occur. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035174"></A>
In addition, a recent court case brought into question whether controls around airports were legitimate. Even more concerning, ports and rail freight infrastructure currently have no protection from inappropriate development. As a result, unsuspecting potential residents are not guaranteed their dwellings will be built in a way that is appropriate to the location. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035175"></A>
The LNP welcomes the provisions in this bill forming the head of power for the transport department to impose requirements and restrictions on new developments near transport infrastructure, including ports, airports, rail freight and public transport activities, to protect the public interest. We recognise that, in many ways, this is only a step in the process. We also note that this legislation does not include roads which fall under the jurisdiction of Main Roads and that provisions already apply under its jurisdiction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035176"></A>
I seek from the minister clarification of what protections exist in this bill for truck freight facilities and similarly for rail freight facilities. Freight is vital. Without an efficient freight network that is flexible our society would grind to a halt. Both trucks and trains are critical in this network as are their freight terminals. It is an important role of government to minimise the impact of any nimby syndrome. Clarification of this matter would be appreciated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035177"></A>
The provisions in this bill are consistent with the principle of protecting prior use for the effectiveness of our transport assets. Importantly, the inclusion of ports can be seen as an admission that the LNP’s position on the Townsville cruise terminal development and the need to protect prior use rights was correct. The Labor Party bagged us for raising concerns about the residential component of the proposed development being located so closely to the Townsville port and the potential to compromise the activities of that port which are so vital for the economic development of the region and Queensland. We saw the concerns about the lack of protection around that port even when the development had state government involvement. I welcome these provisions and certainly hope to see the provisions clearly outlined to provide protection for prior uses such as ports because we cannot allow them to be comprised due to inappropriate development beside them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035178"></A>
I also welcome the clearer statement of the ability to protect our flight paths leading into airports as essential to avoid the impacts of curfews on our airports while also protecting the standard of living of those residents in surrounding areas. While the LNP supports this provision we would also like to raise concerns that the resulting encumbrances should appear on land titles, not just in planning schemes. Increasingly, planning schemes are extremely complex. It is very difficult for someone who is even very skilled to be able to access detail as to where the potential footprints of these encumbrances may be. I understand that this legislation provides the head of power in that regard and that there will be further work done with the Department of Infrastructure and Planning as to how the guidelines will be rolled out. I would ask that the minister and her colleagues take on board the need for instruments with regard to title to be more transparent. I know that it has been a bit ad hoc in our state. Sometimes things will appear on rates notices but not on any of the search instruments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035180"></A>
I want to address the issue of the power to suspend or cancel taxi licences and the extension that is proposed in this bill. The LNP supports the ability of Queensland Transport to impose an appropriate taxi industry security levy on taxis using secure ranks. We understand this has wide support, has been done with consultation and is effective. The current levy is $324. I believe that this is fixed to inflation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035181"></A>
Our concern with the provisions in this bill is that they are an unnecessarily draconian extension of power. There is the potential to cancel a licence if such a security levy is not paid. I have been advised in the briefing that very few operators have not paid the levy. Of the 2,900 licences, in the first year there were seven nonpayments and three still outstanding. Last year there were six nonpayments and four were still outstanding. Around seven in 6,000 nonpayments totalling $2,000 out of around $2 million does not appear to be a major problem. There are mechanisms in place to pursue the recovery of those funds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035182"></A>
I understand that Queensland Transport is frustrated by delays in recovering this levy as are so many users of the debt recovery system. That system needs to be reformed rather than creating a head of power just for Queensland Transport to recover a levy from a few taxi operators. Seeking a change so that they cancel or suspend a taxi licence for nonpayment instead of pursuing the licence holder through the court system is the equivalent of using a sledgehammer on a peanut. Existing similar provisions allow the cancellation for not paying the taxi licence or committing a disqualifying offence which is much more serious. Cancelling a $300,000 to $400,000 licence for a $300-plus levy payment is disproportionate. Thus we have serious reservations about this provision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035184"></A>
I want to move now to another provision in the legislation which has been quite contentious--that is, the extension of the powers of transport inspectors to high-occupancy vehicle lanes. The government is intending to trial the use of transport inspectors to police high-occupancy vehicle lanes next year. The amendments in this bill will allow transport inspectors to stop vehicles breaching Queensland road rules in relation to high-occupancy vehicle lanes and require the person to state their name and address and produce a driver’s licence if they believe they have committed an offence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035187"></A>
Only South-East Queensland has high-occupancy vehicle lanes consisting of 70 lanes of varying lengths totalling 68 kilometres. This amendment will expire on 31 March 2011, with the ability to extend it to 31 March 2012 if the trial has not concluded. In addition, this extends the time transport officers can pull vehicles over to between 6 am and 7 pm on business days instead of the current dawn until dusk provision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035188"></A>
The LNP has strong reservations about these provisions on a number of grounds and we will be opposing them. We are concerned about the lack of appropriate resourcing for this trial. We are also concerned about the move to extend the brief of transport officers beyond that of road safety and into enforcement of a provision which could be seen by some as revenue raising and enforcement of congestion measures rather than road safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035189"></A>
At a time when we should be really focusing on road safety I think that is a genuine concern. There are only around 170 transport inspectors in Queensland, 79 of whom are based in South-East Queensland. I understand from the briefing that there is no intention to expand the number of transport inspectors to cater for this trial. Transport inspectors fill a critical safety role but to ask officers to take on more work to manage the government’s congestion failures with no more resources will necessarily impact on their wider safety duties. We are opposing this section due to the lack of appropriate resourcing for transport inspectors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035191"></A>
There is also a concern with regard to the time extension beyond dusk. The move to expand the dawn until dusk operations of transport officers to 6 am until 7 pm means transport operators will be operating in the dark and at the most dangerous part of the day--that is, soon after dusk--most if not all of the year. Under these provisions they will have the power to pull people over in high-occupancy vehicle lanes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035192"></A>
I am not convinced that this provision will appropriately support the safety outcome required. In addition, there have been strong concerns raised by people publicly about the stopping of drivers in uncertain light by non-police officers and how this will be perceived by people driving. Currently after dusk transport officers must be accompanied by police. I took this issue up in public forums and I also raised it in the public forum of Facebook to see what people’s feedback was. I received quite extraordinary feedback. I will read some of those comments into <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
. One man said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1035194"></A>
Not on your life. I definitely would not be keen on my wife driving home to be pulled over. I doubt the ALP has thought this through. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1035195"></A>
Others were concerned about transport officers not being as easily recognised as police officers for having these powers. One woman commented--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1035196"></A>
No way. Surely they have not thought this through. What about the safety of women and children. There is no way that I would stop and what would they do if someone doesn’t stop? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I want to put on the record more comments and feedback I have received from members of the public with regard to concerns about people who are not police officers pulling them over, particularly at night. The current law provides that transport officers have to have police with them to pull people over at night. The provisions in the legislation before the House extend the powers of transport officers in that they are able to pull people over in high-occupancy vehicle lanes after sunset. This has caused concern for some motorists, as many people do not necessarily know the difference between vehicles that might have flashing lights but which are not police vehicles and whether they truly are who they are supposed to be. This was a concern when the legislation was originally introduced into the parliament for transport officers, but the provision for having police present with them at night continued to be on the statute books.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040496"></A>
A comment from one gentleman was that he did not mind under certain conditions so long as transport inspectors--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040497"></A>
... continue to wear their uniform of ID and drive marked vehicles with the distinct flashing lights then I have no problem, but I thought the enforcement of the traffic act was the jurisdiction of the police. Transport are there to ensure the transport laws are enforced--load limits, public transport et cetera, including taxis.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1040498"></A>
Another woman commented--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040500"></A>
I read in an email where people are putting flashing lights on their cars and pulling in behind lone females and then pretending they were police. Once they pulled you over, bam! There you were another missing person. No way! Is it true that you’re allowed to keep driving until you reach a service station or a police station or somewhere safe before you pull over? If it truly is the police, would they frown on you for doing that?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1040501"></A>
Another comment was--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040503"></A>
I would certainly hesitate before pulling over if they were not the police.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040504"></A>
This is obviously a matter of concern to a number of members of the public as to people who have the power to pull them over who are not the police, but I think this issue is exacerbated at night-time when people may not be as aware of transport officers and their powers and being able to see who is actually performing those particular functions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040506"></A>
I also want to read into the record of the House the concerns of the RACQ, which was concerned about transport officers being called away from their core duties which are predominantly for safety issues. The RACQ’s press release states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040508"></A>
Transport inspectors should concentrate on vehicle safety. The RACQ wants to see more transport inspectors enforcing motor vehicle safety standards rather than policing transit lanes.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1040509"></A>
The state’s peak motoring body says--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040511"></A>
Enforcing minimal vehicle occupancy numbers in transit lanes should not compromise helping to ensure that cars and trucks are safe enough to be on the road in the first place.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1040513"></A>
The RACQ’s general manager for external relations, Gary Fites, said--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040515"></A>
The state government’s thin gray line of transport inspectors was already struggling to conduct sufficient roadside roadworthiness checks to deter those motorists who did not maintain their vehicles to basic safety standards.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1040516"></A>
He continued--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040518"></A>
An RACQ online poll earlier this year revealing 76 per cent of respondents had not seen a roadside safety check in the past year is a fairly fair reflection of the lack of frequency and profile of such operations. While vehicle defects are seldom a major cause of crashes, their combination with driver error or poor road safety conditions can certainly influence the degree and severity of crashes.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040519"></A>
There were also concerns expressed from some in the union movement once again about the lack of transport officers and the fact that this provision in this bill is going to be pulling them away from their primary duties. We know that transport officers have duties particularly with regard to heavy vehicles and enforcement of these provisions. Heavy vehicle provisions with regard to fatigue management are extremely critical, as are the loads that people carry on their vehicles and ensuring that they are safe and operating within the law. Transport officers have a range of these duties, and they should be predominantly about ensuring the safety of vehicles and road safety issues rather than having their very thin numbers spread further in duties which are not predominantly associated with road safety issues. That is the reason we will not be supporting these provisions in this bill, because it is pulling these officers who are already underresourced away from those primary duties which should be focused on road safety issues.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040520"></A>
I want to address another aspect of this legislation which allows for the power to direct masters of ships and port infrastructure in exceptional circumstances. This bill gives the general manager of Maritime Safety Queensland the power to direct the master of a ship to operate the ship in a certain way and to require the owner-operator of infrastructure to accept a ship. It is understood that these amendments stem from the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Dawn</Hansard-Italic>
 incident involving a case of H1N1, swine flu. During this episode it was determined that no power existed to direct masters of ships to dock or otherwise act as directed in the public interest. Likewise, there was no power for a port to be directed to accept and accommodate the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Dawn</Hansard-Italic>
. I note that this power is only to be used in exceptional circumstances and in the public interest. Examples given are a contagious disease shipboard and a natural disaster whereby facilitating the off-loading of equipment or materials from a ship would assist the community. I seek clarification from the minister. Firstly, will the minister undertake that the interpretation of ‘exceptional circumstances’ and ‘in the public interest’ will be construed narrowly?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040522"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (Ms Farmer): I think we can leave those questions until we consider the bill in detail.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040523"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This is an omnibus bill and there are sundry issues raised in this bill, and one of the issues is how broad or how narrow the definitions are going to be. Concerns have been raised that these terms could be interpreted broadly and inappropriately used. Secondly, this bill contains no provisions for compensation for ships or ports. The department advised in its briefing that ships are covered by international insurance provisions. I would ask the minister what provisions exist for ports that incur costs or loss as a result of such a direction from the general manager of Maritime Safety Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040524"></A>
Furthermore, these provisions are not only applicable to passenger ships. I understand that they have predominantly been drafted as a result of a potential disease issue with a cruise ship. However, the drafting of this legislation will pertain to a far wider range of ships and, therefore, the insurance provisions for those ships may be quite different. I certainly flag that issue with the minister as to what the potential impact will be beyond the cruise ship industry, given that we are also an export nation and ships being held at bay or being directed elsewhere may have implications for a different aspect of the freight market. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040525"></A>
In speaking to this legislation, we recognise those aspects that are in the public interest and raise some concerns about other aspects as mentioned, particularly the provisions pertaining to transport inspector powers in high-occupancy vehicle lanes and the extension of taxi licences. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (2.38 pm): This is quite an expansive bill. As the shadow minister described, it is an omnibus bill combining areas ranging from powers to suspend taxi licences through allowing public transport inspectors to supervise high-occupancy vehicle lanes to providing new powers directing ships’ masters and port infrastructure to operate a ship in a certain way and the port to operate in a certain way. We support some aspects of the bill, but not all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043404"></A>
There are some implications from some of the changes that would seem to be excessive and probably unnecessary. Whilst it is always important to update, modernise and streamline legislation that relates to departments, the changes that are implemented could make things a little more onerous, more challenging and probably for the worse. I say this because although the key transport issues facing us in this state would seem to be pre-eminent in most honourable members’ minds and in the minds of the members of the public, these issues are not being addressed in this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043405"></A>
Members of the opposition have had it thrown up to them by government speaker after government speaker that the GFC has changed everything, that state-sponsored infrastructure spend is mandatory and must be maintained, even at the expense of driving up the state’s total debt problem. If that logic were to be followed, then why did this bill not propose a new range crossing either side of Toowoomba, expedite the road project from Nerang to Tugun four lanes both way, ensure the full duplication of the Gold Coast rail line to Coolangatta, provide a new bridge for Innisfail and an upgrade of the Bruce Highway north of Rockhampton to proper motorway status? That is what should have been introduced in this House today by a government that believes that it is Keynesian in theory. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043406"></A>
If I am to accept the comments of the Treasurer today that things are indeed improving, not only will state revenue rise to at least the three per cent increase projected but also inflation remains low, official cash rates remain low historically and many of our builders are urgently seeking greater work opportunities for their staff, often only working at 80 per cent of their full capacity. Honourable members, transport infrastructure is really at low levels for a growth state of 4.4 million, with only a marginal slowing of those arriving each week. The issues that I am raising really should be part of the legislative program of this government currently. We have only one more sitting week of the year before Christmas. The clock is ticking. The bill we are dealing with relates to some very low-key issues that occasionally just need to be ticked through. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043407"></A>
I have raised the first issue of the prevention of adverse impacts from transport generated environmental issues. All types were offered as examples--from housing and education to individuals themselves. Similarly, examples of the emissions raised are those of light and vibration. But there is one that I would like to raise in particular that I will discuss at a later time and that is the issue of noise generated from the transport network and complaints from landholders who have purchased recently or who have purchased previously property adjacent to the public transport and transport network. The more contentious areas I will come to in a little bit more detail and suggest why another approach might be more appropriate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043408"></A>
There is a great saying that in all things engineering it only takes one man to make a difference. What seems to be occurring in transport is a history of the past 10 years of Labor: a Tugun bypass that took 10 years to build, a financial disaster called BrisConnections, the ramping of huge B-doubles through Toowoomba and down to the eastern side of the Great Dividing Range, a capital city in gridlock, country roads gradually turning to dust and a rail system that only enriches its executives. Yet I know that the Gateway Bridge is being duplicated and everyone got to wear a hard hat when the new bridge was joined.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043410"></A>
But I think I will raise the other controversial issue. Right in the middle of the highest historical price of steel ever in history, with massively increasing state debt, this Bligh Labor government built the Kurilpa Bridge, with an almost obscene excessive amount of steel superstructure--and that was a walkway that was constructed--to support it. Forget about the need for the public to walk--they need to walk and they need to burn off fat, because we are becoming as people a fatter nation--we have to be careful about the way we spend money. A prudent nation would be first in constructing a bridge that reduced excessive waste and directed that steel to a higher need. That bridge is a shining example of a failing government building a monument to itself and relegating the needs of the voting public to last in the list of priorities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043411"></A>
Logically, the most contentious clause in this bill would seem then to follow from a government that appeared to be chasing front-page advertorials as opposed to introducing consistent legislation. That first would be the power to suspend taxi licences when the current levy is not paid. Apparently, last year there were only six such offences committed and only four are still outstanding. That is out of the 2,900 licences that are allocated. This is a compliance rate of 99.998 per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043412"></A>
Just to give members a rough idea of the value of the taxi industry in thumbnail form, I point out that it is a commercial, non-government, non-subsidised public transport system. It is competitive, the licensees pay market rate for their licences in all varieties of cities and towns, their registration fees are substantial and they are heavily regulated. Many owners lease their plates for a fixed return. In Brisbane, those returns have recently returned to stability after a period of severe instability and they are of the order of nine per cent for roughly a $500,000 investment. The cost of a licence is higher on the Gold Coast for a lower return. Many of these licensees are owner-drivers. The industry is a massive employer of permanent full-time and permanent part-time people, students and a variety of others. Many of these people use taxi driving as a means to provide extra funds for their families in addition to what they earn from their own full-time jobs. All of our taxi companies are massive employers of new immigrants who are building their lives in Australia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043413"></A>
This new law is unnecessary and unjustified. I think the intention of this new law is to possibly make the government feel like it is doing something when it could easily electronically deduct the fees from the licensees, just as occurs in many other areas of everyday life. The government could easily do that and should withdraw this contentious clause. </Hansard-Body>

There are other areas in the bill that I think can be addressed by changes. They would not embrace the broad intention of the bill but they would significantly enhance it. The first of those is a change to the transport provisions that prevents those people who have been convicted of particular crimes from receiving an authorisation to drive a passenger vehicle. This change will allow for a modification of the current law and relax it in relation to individuals who, when young, committed a child sexual offence against a person of comparable age. The chief executive must take advice on the matter from the Commissioner of Children and Young People and Child Guardian. The LNP suggests a change to the effect that they must consult and, if the licence is not granted, the chief executive must take advice on the matter from the Commissioner for Children and Young People and Child Guardian--and that is ‘must’.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043415"></A>
This change is reflective of the fact that for 80 per cent of the time the government and the opposition agree. For 20 per cent of the time they disagree, and of that 20 per cent, a significant percentage of that disagreement is around small issues such as this issue. There can be no ideological opposition to the suggested change. It is a practical suggestion and I would ask that the minister embrace it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043416"></A>
Similarly, there are many changes that staff within Queensland Transport have had to endure that make no sense. I give members the example of RoadTek, which is a 100 per cent Queensland government owned business that is being deliberately disallowed from contracting for open contract government and even non-government jobs. That is despite RoadTek having a workforce that is acknowledged as having some of the greatest bridge-building skills in the First World in a variety of design-construct material circumstances. Yet we have extremely irregular cost-plus projects that are allowed to go on despite no fixed end date for construction and a heavy focus on enriching Labor crony lobbyists. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043419"></A>
The other issue of contention in this bill is that of extending the transport inspection powers to high-occupancy vehicle lanes. The key issue here is that there are 170 transport inspectors in Queensland. No extra inspectors are being considered. Honourable members, we have nine million tourists each and every year on the Gold Coast alone. We need a designated group of transport police who are clearly identified as such. The first step could be to have tourist police dressed as such who might also be involved in this issue on those roads that are linked to major tourist destinations. This is the norm in all other major developed countries in the First World--from Ireland to Turkey in Europe. I would suggest that transport police focus on their key roles of managing the massive trucking, bus and commercial fleets on our roads. Their current burden is substantial and this extra role is wasteful with regard to their specific skills. I think it is a backward step not reflective of world’s best practice and I would urge the minister to ask her staff to research promptly those areas. I also refer to the issue of the tourist police. They are a positive in tourist capitals throughout the world. </Hansard-Body>

In many ways the problems in transport rival the ad hoc populism of the current Labor administration’s water policy. If one’s motive in solving a problem is all about politics and nothing about outcomes then very little of substance will come of it--just as delaying the extension of the north-south four-laning south of Nerang to Tugun for 10 years despite the population increasing by 300 per cent and then spending $50 million per kilometre on the Tugun bypass demoralised all bar the contractors. Yet the 20 kilometres between Pimpama and Nerang cannot get open-grade asphalt finished to reduce noise and improve safety for a cost of $20 million. </Hansard-Body>

This particular issue of excessive environmental noise from the motorway is probably one of the keys that led to the first issue raised in the minister’s second reading speech about ‘transport generated environmental emissions’. Queensland Transport’s responses to me have ranged from denial to talk of excessive use of air conditioners and shutting up the most vocal of those who have complained. The minister gave a considerable amount of time in her speech to almost blaming the public for their poor choice of housing selection, stating--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1043460"></A>
When a person buys a property with the knowledge that the development was designed and constructed in compliance with the exposure limits, it is unreasonable for them to complain about everyday emissions from public transport. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043461"></A>
Well, the construction of the motorway from Brisbane to Surfers Paradise was not to make people’s lives any worse, and open-grade asphalt--that is, concrete--was to cover the road surface on completion. This was not done. The noise is awful for both drivers and locals. The road is also dangerous in the wet due to haze, and aquaplaning is common. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043462"></A>
If this bill aims to shut people down totally on the issue then I personally wish to inform the minister that it will not. Too many older and younger people are compelled to use the road because locals have to use the main road, the motorway, to link from community to community. It both divides us and unites us but it is dangerous in the wet. The road must be appropriately surfaced. It is a matter of urgency. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043463"></A>
The bill also applies to public transport. The Gold Coast light rail has some major outstanding issues of contention. The transport minister clearly stated that the state is committing at least $380 million initially and there is an open guarantee to underwrite the losses of the planned public-private partnership of a $1.8 billion project. The federal government expects a return. This does not link to the heavy rail at Helensvale. It terminates at Parkwood, under the entry of the new planned university hospital gates. I am sorry, but I do not understand. If the policy is to improve public transport for commuters, is the minister seriously encouraging even more people to park their cars at Parkwood along with the 20,000 Griffith University students, the projected 7,000 hospital workers and staff, the 2,000 visitors and, on top of this, the people who want to park there and commute into Southport, Surfers and Broadbeach? I guess the explanation is that it is partially around the need to duplicate fully the railway line from Brisbane to Helensvale. The distance required is 10 kilometres from the rapid transit system terminus. It is not reflective of need or common sense and it is critical that this link be made. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043464"></A>
This leads to another contentious change in the bill allowing power to direct masters of ships and port infrastructure in exceptional circumstances. The reason given for the need is that those on board the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Dawn</Hansard-Italic>
 had swine flu. Formulating a policy because of one incident handled poorly and introducing changes to ports is somewhat dangerous. Ports are really important. Currently Brisbane is the busiest port in Australia and Hamilton is busier than Fisherman Islands. This is expected to change over the next five years. Yet here is the transport department proposing a bill about ports, knowing the critical role of Fisherman Islands. The Premier is driving a policy of asset sales, in particular the motorway linking to Fisherman Islands, and she will probably get peanuts for it in this market. Not only does one not sell the kingdom; one does not sell the keys to the kingdom. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043465"></A>
The port at Fisherman Islands is a critical port for our state’s infrastructure. It has taken years to build up. The sand and the silt from the river and Moreton Bay have provided the materials for its construction. The roadway to it is lined with gold and the sweat of Queensland labour. It has been paid for by Queenslanders. When laws are being proposed to direct vessels to our primary port, we must ensure that we have control over that port and access to it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043466"></A>
Transport decisions are undoubtedly difficult. They are expensive, labour intensive and disruptive, and there are a lot of stakeholders. Many feel that roads are redundant and the need to travel on public transport is high, but they do not use it. We cannot all get access to it because we live in a decentralised state. In an ideal world, it would be great if vehicles ran on water vapour, we had solar panels and biofuel was the main fuel used. Currently that is not the case, so we have to deal with what we have and make the best of it. We have to make laws that are appropriate to our needs and for the times. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043467"></A>
The reasons for all of this are to be found in human behaviour. We are increasingly sedentary, and we are increasingly urbanised and coastal dwelling. We are homeowners in urban sprawl and increasingly ignorant of what is achievable. Our roads have not been kept up to the standards required. Their planning is often ad hoc and far too sensitive to politics. The answers are there for all to see. Many do not like to hear them because they seek perfection but they just do not want to be delayed in getting it. I think this bill should have actually reflected the needs of the time. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr EMERSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Indooroopilly--LNP) (2.56 pm): I rise to make a brief contribution to debate on the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, particularly in relation to protecting transport infrastructure from inappropriate development. The growth in South-East Queensland means that this is an important amendment. The South East Queensland Regional Plan indicates that by 2031 there is a requirement for an extra 156,000 dwellings in Brisbane alone. This creates issues in terms of the impact on local public transport. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043470"></A>
The amendments particularly look at the issue of dealing with significant adverse impacts on existing and future public passenger transport. On the aspect of ensuring that public transport remains viable, these amendments are particularly welcome. What is important as well is that the public retains its faith in the public transport system. Any Queenslander looking at the front page of the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 would have seen those rather shocking figures and been concerned about the state of the public transport system. Those figures are astonishing: 691 hours of delay across the network last financial year and more than 4,960 late or cancelled trains. The biggest cause of delays to trains on the network was infrastructure faults. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043471"></A>
I was astonished to see the minister get up earlier today and finally recognise the problem, apologise for it but also acknowledge that even recently we are looking at almost one in 10 trains being delayed. She felt that that was an improvement compared to what was happening last financial year, acknowledging that more recently there have been delays. This has become so poor. The other day I heard Spencer Howson on ABC Radio running a chocolate wheel on what line would not be running that day. If it were not so serious it would be a joke. It is not a joke, and it is no laughing matter for the many thousands of commuters who are regularly inconvenienced by the delays in the transport system and the train system in particular.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043496"></A>
The Ipswich rail line, which runs from the electorate of the member for Ipswich through my electorate, is a perfect example of the problems that we are facing. The Indooroopilly station is the busiest station outside the CBD. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043499"></A>
I turn to the most recent overloading figures for that line. While the minister has claimed that improvements have been made previously, the reality is that the most recent figures show, in the afternoon peak hour, a 300 per cent increase in the number of overcrowded or beyond-capacity trains. That is not an improvement; it is a dramatic worsening of the situation. That needs to be fixed because, sadly, we have not seen any real improvements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043500"></A>
I acknowledge that more people are taking public transport. However, this government seems to have dropped the ball on that issue. It seems to be beyond the government to encourage more people to take public transport, because it has banned more park-and-ride spaces at five stations in my electorate and at Corinda station, which is in the electorate of Mount Ommaney. Park-and-ride facilities are a wonderful way to encourage people to take public transport. Sadly, this government has put in place impediments to that. There has been a 20 to 40 per cent increase in fares. </Hansard-Body>

Mr EMERSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I note the member for Chatsworth is obviously concerned about the increase in fares as well. His electors would be very keen to take public transport, but they must be concerned, as are all the residents of South-East Queensland, about the increase in fares. That is an impediment. We want more people to use public transport, particularly as it helps with congestion. The greater the use of public transport the more cars we get off the road, and that helps ease congestion, which is a major issue in my area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043504"></A>
I would be remiss if I did not mention the gap at the Indooroopilly Railway Station. We talk about the safe transport of persons, as mentioned in the bill. Sadly, a week and a half ago the <Hansard-Italic>
Westside News</Hansard-Italic>
, our local paper, cited further examples of people being injured at the Indooroopilly Railway Station. On the weekend I ran a community corner, during which a resident of Graceville told me that her mother will no longer use the Indooroopilly Railway Station because she is concerned about safety issues at that station. It is a disgrace to see a gap 15 centimetres wide and 40 centimetres high when the government has just spent almost $27 million refurbishing that railway station. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043506"></A>
I conclude by saying to the minister, again, that this is an important amendment. We have to preserve the effectiveness of the public transport system. However, we also have to ensure that people have confidence in the public transport system. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr SHINE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (3.02 pm): In her second reading speech, the minister indicated the breadth of the bill before the House, which covers a wide range of topics from amendments designed to prevent adverse impacts from transport generated environmental emissions to making minor changes to ensure delivery of the government’s transport infrastructure program and to improve or clarify legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043509"></A>
With respect to the first topic, the prevention of adverse impacts from transport generated environmental emissions, I am particularly keen to advocate the extension of bikeways in South-East Queensland and in my electorate in particular. This morning in question time the minister was asked about what is being done in relation to bikeways. I know that is a priority of the minister. I have had the opportunity to speak with her about the desirability, in my view, of building a bikeway from Highfields in my electorate to the CBD of Toowoomba. In Toowoomba terms, that is a fairly lengthy distance, but in terms of other bikeways in South-East Queensland it is not that significant. The minister is aware of my advocacy of that cause, which I believe should be to the forefront of transport planning. In the answer that she gave this morning, I was interested to hear the minister indicate to the House that, whilst only one per cent of road users use bikes, in the past year more bikes than cars were sold. That clearly indicates the community’s growing attraction to travelling by bike, which is altogether a positive thing, bearing in mind the health and environmental positives that follow from it. For example, I note the fact that in many areas of Brisbane, along the M1 and on the Gold Coast the government has extended bikeways. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043511"></A>
Recently a number of parliamentarians from both sides of the House and I attended the Australian Parliamentary Conference in Western Australia. I took the opportunity to look at the splendid new motorway that has been built from Perth to Bunbury and beyond. It is a magnificent highway. The train line runs adjacent to the highway and at various stages along it there are train stations with park-and-ride facilities in abundance, which seem to be used almost to capacity. A bikeway also runs alongside the highway. I think the road was only opened about two months prior to my travelling on it. During the evening peak hour we saw only one cyclist on the bikeway, which extends probably for some 20 to 40 kilometres at my guess. Use of the bikeway is yet to pick up, although that part of Western Australia is fairly level country and one would anticipate that bike riding would be particularly popular. I am a keen advocate of more bikeways for the city of Toowoomba, which is certainly in line with the government’s desire, as expressed in its Q2 vision, to create a healthier and greener Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043514"></A>
Another point that I want to raise briefly concerns the extension of powers for transport police. There is always a certain reluctance to see people other than policemen and women being given powers of arrest, powers of search and so on. It is always of concern to those of us who are concerned about civil liberties. I note that clause 33 authorises an officer who is not a police officer to require the driver of a private vehicle to produce his or her licence et cetera. That is all very well, but it contrasts with new section 475Y(3), which states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1043518"></A>
When making the requirement, the authorised person must warn the person it is an offence to fail to state the person’s name or residential address ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1043519"></A>
In other words, in one clause of the bill--which refers to a different act, of course--there is a requirement that a warning be given that it is an offence for a person to fail to state their name, whereas in another clause such a warning does not occur. It may be that it is already in the principal act. I would ask the minister to make some comment in relation to that, at the appropriate time. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043544"></A>
It would be remiss of me on a bill of this nature not to make reference to the need for a second range crossing to Toowoomba. I am pleased that the honourable member for Gaven also made reference to it. It is good to see that interest in this matter is extending beyond our immediate region. As has been said often by members representing Toowoomba and nearby electorates, the need for this crossing is incontestable. Whilst it is a federal road and is the responsibility of the federal government, it is important that the state keep it as a very high priority, which I understand that it is. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043547"></A>
I had the pleasure recently--and I think the member for Toowoomba South did as well--to attend the chamber of commerce meeting at which Everald Compton spoke, and spoke well, about a number of things. He announced the intention to proceed with the connection of the inland rail from Moree to Toowoomba and spoke about the effect that it will have on transport operations in South-East Queensland, particularly at Charlton, just outside Toowoomba, and the impact that it will have necessarily on road transport up and down the range. Already we have about 3,000 to 4,000 transports going up and down the range every day. The result of having that new rail line from Melbourne to Toowoomba will obviously increase that road traffic enormously. As well, on a daily basis we are seeing an increase in traffic resulting from the opening up of the Surat Basin. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043551"></A>
These developments have an adverse effect on the roads in my electorate, particularly James Street and Tor Street, which also border the electorate of Toowoomba South. The adverse effects have been covered numerous times by me and other members in this place. I take this opportunity to mention the need for that range crossing yet again and also Mr Compton’s remarks which I found interesting where he advocated that private enterprise, particularly people of financial substance in Toowoomba, should look to band together to provide the impetus, if you like, for the construction of that road into the future. With those few remarks, I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs MILLER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bundamba--ALP) (3.12 pm): I rise to support the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. I would like to particularly address the amendments in relation to the prevention of impacts from transport generated environmental issues. I would like to place on record my complete support for the amendments because they are very important for my area. I certainly concur with the view that there is no reason for land to be developed without taking measures to mitigate the adverse environmental emissions from public transport. I think that is very good. I understand that we are going to have a framework to place conditions on land affected by environmental emissions from public transport. I understand also that the department will be able to ensure that development conditions mitigate impacts on the health and wellbeing of the developments’ occupiers and users. </Hansard-Body>

I was brought up in the suburb of Dinmore in Ipswich in Dinmore Street, where my parents still live today. I grew up with the trains on one side and Brisbane Road, which is our major highway, on the other side about 100 metres away. We accepted the noise. We became so used to it that the trains did not bother us at all. In fact we did not hear them quite often when they went through. In my electorate, Redbank is the railway hub of the area and we also have the Redbank railway workshops there. Residents who live in Redbank have no problem with the rail. They have no problem with the light from the rail or the lights from the rail yards. In fact, I can remember a few years ago that a couple of the big overhead light bulbs blew and the older people from the Redbank area asked us to make sure that the bulbs were replaced really fast because they felt that criminals might come into their area because there was not enough light. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043560"></A>
I would like to talk about noise barriers. We have made noise barriers in Redbank into a public artform. We have the D’Arcy Doyle mural and also the famous coalminers mural, which was sponsored by the CFMEU Mining and Energy Division. In Goodna this Friday I will be launching the RSL sub-branch memorial sound barrier, which depicts the portraits of eight Navy and 12 Army veterans in full dress uniform. The length of this noise barrier is 150 metres. It recognises the contribution that these men and women have made to the Goodna community. I would certainly like to thank the artists from Phantast who have worked on these murals for their assistance in painting these portraits. Not to leave out the Air Force veterans, they had their mural painted many years ago. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043566"></A>
Noise barriers should not be seen as just noise barriers; as I said, they should be seen as public artforms. I believe that these public artforms in the form of noise barriers should reflect the history of the suburb, reflect the suburb’s culture and also outline what makes that particular suburb tick. They should always be used as public art.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043567"></A>
I also want to comment in relation to the newer suburbs in my electorate. I know that many people buy the cheaper blocks of land--for example, along the Centenary Highway and along the Ipswich Motorway. I am particularly referring to the AV Jennings development which abuts the Ipswich Motorway. What has always concerned me is that the Ipswich City Council has allowed developments to be built almost right on top of the highway and then as soon as the people bought there the first thing they would do is complain to us about the fact that there were no noise barriers. I am very, very pleased that we will be amending the legislation in relation to these issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043569"></A>
I have had a number of people contact me from the Springfield Lakes area in relation to noise complaints, particularly since the Centenary Motorway has been extended to Yamanto. I think what people need to understand is that Main Roads does not whack up noise barriers just because people complain. There is noise modelling along the Centenary Highway. There has to be noise modelling so that they can then determine where noise barriers may be required. </Hansard-Body>

 No. It was not Johnny Howard’s money. It was actually our money: it was $360 million of state government money. In relation to noise barriers, the exact height and location of the barriers is determined by the noise modelling and affected property owners. It should also be realised that some residents do not want noise barriers. Sometimes when you go out for public consultation there might be half who want noise barriers and the other half who do not want them. That can be very difficult and can in fact divide a local community. However, when you combine noise barriers with public art, I think it turns into a positive for any local community. </Hansard-Body>

In relation to the construction of major roads in our area, I believe that Main Roads, which is constructing the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway right through my electorate, has done an excellent job.

Let me say that, wherever we need to have noise barriers, they are going to be painted and they are going to reflect the culture, the history and the art of our local community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047136"></A>
To get back to Springfield, what we need to understand is that the Centenary Motorway and the railway line are currently being planned right through to Springfield. If developers want to contribute to bring this railway line forward from 2015, our government is all ears. However, it will not be built until that time unless there is a significant contribution from the developers. When that happens, there will be noise modelling. People from Horizon Alliance will be working with the local community in relation to those issues.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1047140"></A>
I would like to talk briefly about the criteria for assessing exposure to noise. The assessment comes about through combining the legislative noise criteria for both roads and rails.

In conclusion, I would like to state that my electorate loves public transport. I know that some members have talked about a lack of park-and-ride facilities. I would love more. In fact, we are going to have more at the Dinmore park-and-ride. I must place on record that it has been delayed for a few years, mainly due to the mucking around of the Howard government in relation to the Ipswich Motorway. We have had to relocate Telstra lines and God knows what else. </Hansard-Body>

I understand that in a few weeks time we will be starting on the upgrade of the Dinmore park-and-ride given that we have now moved those Telstra cables and the other essential services there.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050475"></A>
In conclusion, people in our electorate do love public transport. There is not a spare car parking space from Bundamba right through to Goodna. If we could have more park-and-ride spaces we would be grateful. I have brought this up before in relation to the planned park-and-ride at Springfield: we need more than 100 car parks. In fact, I believe we need 1,000. The member for Toowoomba North spoke about the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference in Perth which I was also able to attend. We learned at that conference that in Perth they have literally hundreds and hundreds of car parking spaces in the outer suburbs. What happens is that people catch a bus or drive their car to the park-and-ride and then hop on a high-speed train. One of the things that amazed me is that we were doing about 105 kilometres in a 110-kilometre zone and all of a sudden a train went whizzing past us. That is a wonderful assessment of how the park-and-rides work in Perth. Our government should get over to Perth and have a look at these massive park-and-rides which do work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047157"></A>
I was also talking to very good friends of mine--Troy and Amanda Wells--who have moved from Collingwood Park to Perth. Troy rides his bike to work every day on those wonderful bike paths that they have in Perth. His wife never drives into the city of Perth because she is able to catch a bus to the park-and-ride and then catches a train in. With that contribution, I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (3.24 pm): I rise today to make a contribution to the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009, which amends 13 pieces of legislation which is designed to achieve the following objectives: provide power to direct masters of ships and port infrastructure in exceptional circumstances in the public interest; establish child related crime provisions for drivers of public passenger vehicles, for example, taxis and buses; protect transport infrastructure from inappropriate development; extend the power to suspend taxi licences and extend the transport inspector’s powers in high-occupancy vehicle lanes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047162"></A>
As per discussion with the Speaker, I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047163"></A>
Leave granted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050501"></A>
I will address these individually.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050502"></A>
The Bill will enable Maritime Safety Queensland to manage the safe operation of ships in pilotage areas. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050504"></A>
The Amendment gives the General Manager of Maritime Safety Queensland increased powers which stems from the Pacific Dawn incident which was arriving into port with cases of H1N1 Swine flu and at the time it was determined that no power currently existed to direct ships to dock or otherwise as directed in the public interest.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050506"></A>
This amendment will only apply in exceptional circumstances and when the public interest requires it. An example of this would be a contagious disease aboard a ship where off-loading of materials or persons from a ship would either assist the community or protect the community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050507"></A>
It is important to note that this provision does not apply to security/terrorism circumstances which come under Federal jurisdiction nor do they apply in instances of illegal immigration.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050508"></A>
This provision protects our Queensland citizens from potential pandemic exposure to the spread of disease.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050509"></A>
The Bill will also modify the Transport provisions preventing people convicted of particular crimes from receiving authorisation to drive a public passenger vehicle such as a taxi or a bus. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050510"></A>
This change allows people who, when they were younger, had committed a child sex offence against a person of comparable age and who have not reoffended to apply for exceptional circumstances for a public passenger vehicle licence.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050511"></A>
This amendment should also include mandatory consultation with the Commissioner for Children and Young People and Child Guardian, and if the advice from the Commissioner must be taken before any such licence is approved.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050512"></A>
This would guarantee that the circumstances of the person, who had committed the sexual offence, are taken into consideration and a risk management is undertaken to ensure that no child is at risk from a person operating a taxi or a bus in the public environment.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1174701"></A>
In the interests of child safety this provision is imperative in order to protect our most vulnerable.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1174702"></A>
This Bill will also enable Queensland transport to impose a taxi industry security levy on taxies using secure taxi ranks. Many taxidrivers have not paid this levy and this legislation is seeking to change this around so that they will now have the ability to cancel or suspend a taxi’s licence for non-payment instead of pursuing the licence holder through the court system.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050515"></A>
This is seen as a heavy handed response to a minor problem when this Government is still doing nothing in the electorate of Mudgeeraba to enable ease of public transport for our residents.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050516"></A>
In so far as taxis are concerned, it is impossible to get a taxi back from Mudgeeraba in the evenings as cabbies do not wait for a fare back, therefore leaving patrons stranded. Businesses in the area complain regularly to me that patronage of their restaurants are down due to the inability to get a cab home if you have had anything to drink.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050517"></A>
And don’t get me started on buses!</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050518"></A>
This is yet another example of the complete lack of understanding from this Government concerning the difficulties associated with living west of the M1.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050519"></A>
I now turn to the enforcement of high occupancy vehicle lanes. At this stage we do not have transit lanes on the M1 from Mudgeeraba to Nerang and I guess that is because we have been waiting for 8 years for the M1 to be upgraded from four lanes to eight lanes.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050520"></A>
At this rate with the upgrade of the 6 laning from Nerang to Mudgeeraba of 12 kilometres which will take 2 years to complete I would imagine that when the 8 lanes happen it will be close to another 8 years wait before we on the Gold Coast have to concern ourselves with high occupancy vehicle lanes.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050521"></A>
The Queensland Road Rules (QRR) make it an offence under section 154 to drive a vehicle other than a bus, taxi or bicycle in a bus lane and under section 156 it is an offence to drive in a transit lane without the specified minimum number of persons in the vehicle unless the vehicle is a bicycle, bus, taxi or motorcycle. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050522"></A>
The Government is intending to trail the use of transport Inspectors to police High Occupancy Vehicle lanes from next year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050524"></A>
This amendment will enable transport Inspectors to stop vehicles they believe are breaching the Queensland Road Rules if they reasonably believe a person has committed or has just committed an offence against section 154 or 156 between the hours of 6am and 7pm on business days.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050525"></A>
Currently there are only 170 Transport Inspectors in Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050526"></A>
Whilst it is noted that it may assist police resourcing be freeing up police for more targeted law and order tasks, there is no intention of increasing the number of inspectors to undertake this amendment.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050527"></A>
The electorate of Mudgeeraba already has a resourcing issue with a lack of police and indeed the Minister himself admitted that a police officer from Mudgeeraba will be taken to staff the new much lauded Reedy Creek Police Station which is in Robina in the electorate of Burleigh. Confused? I would say duped.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050528"></A>
If this added responsibility for Traffic Inspectors is a smoke screen to dupe the public into thinking that it will ease the burden on our already stretched thin blue line, the Liberal National Party would oppose this amendment due to the sheer lack of resourcing provided by this Government. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr CRANDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Coomera--LNP) (3.24 pm): I rise to add to the debate on the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. This bill amends 13 pieces of legislation, and I would like to address just one area of this bill--the Transport Operations (Road Use Management) Act 1995, the TO(RUM) Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047168"></A>
I note that transport inspectors currently have power under the TO(RUM) Act to stop heavy vehicles and to ask drivers to produce drivers’ licences and name and address information. I am told we have around 170 transport inspectors and there is no intention to expand this number. The Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services mentioned this morning that our road toll was 298 at midnight last night--a terrible figure, I am sure we would all agree. The point I am coming to is that I am sure heavy vehicles would have been involved in some of these deaths. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047169"></A>
It seems to me that with a limited number of transport inspectors--namely, 170--perhaps we would be better served if they focus on heavy vehicles, and in doing so help to reduce or hold back the loss of life. For every loss of life on our roads, there are many who are also injured and hospitalised. There are only 170 transport inspectors out there, and we are now asking them to stretch themselves that much further to police T2 and T3 lanes. I recognise that some relief would be given to police if transport inspectors were doing this type of work, but at the end of the day whether you have one, two or three people in a T2 or T3 lane is not really a life-and-death or life-and-limb issue. It is more about policing something that has been designed to encourage people to have more than one person in their motor vehicle when travelling to and from work during busy times of the day. It is not about safety; it is all about policing that particular aspect.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047170"></A>
These 170 transport inspectors, it would seem to me, would be specialists of a sort, given that their role is heavy vehicle interceptions, or getting involved in accident scenarios where heavy vehicles have been involved. I am concerned that taking them away from that role would have a fairly major effect on our road toll, or will have the potential to do so. I would assume breaches and accidents involving heavy vehicles are of more concern, in other words. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047171"></A>
These transport inspectors are, as I said earlier, specialists in heavy transport areas. To take them away from those areas is of concern. Having said that, I recognise that this is a trial; I recognise that it goes to a certain date. The extension of that date would only be if it were intended to bring the legislation in on a permanent basis. If it were the case that we decided these transport inspectors were worthy of doing this work and we took them away from the other very important work that they were doing, I would hope that we would give serious consideration to increasing the numbers from 170 transport inspectors to whatever would be required. I would hope that the effect on other areas of their work--in other words, the heavy vehicles area--will be taken into consideration when this provision of the bill is put in place.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.29 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. I have been listening to the contributions of the members so far and I would like to put on the record that I certainly will be supporting the proposed trial of extending the powers of our transport inspectors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047204"></A>
For some time I have approached the government and previous ministers about this very issue. I have been approached by, believe it or not, transport enforcement officers. They have shared with me many of the powers they already have and many of the duties they already have and they have said, ‘Peter, we believe we could contribute significantly to an improvement in road safety by being given additional powers.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047205"></A>
As a former police officer, I believe there is a need for this. This is an opportunity to extend the powers of our transport officers. I believe they have demonstrated the ability to do good work. The reality is that it costs a lot of money to train police officers. If we are able to employee equally competent people to do some other duties then I would certainly support that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047206"></A>
I realise this is a trial. Let us wait and see how the trial goes. I understand the main issue in the opposition opposing this to date is simply the number of transport officers. The opposition is saying that there are 170 transport officers and their duties need to be prioritised only to heavy vehicle enforcement.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047207"></A>
As I travelled to parliament this morning I saw as I was coming along the highway transport officers doing their enforcement work. It is not just transport officers who do the heavy vehicle enforcement work. There are many specialist police officers who do that as well. They are equally competent. This is a trial and I would support the trial. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047208"></A>
I would urge the government and all members to consider other ways that we can extend enforcement powers to transport officers. They have a great track record. They do a great job. If they are up to the task of doing additional duties and they are keen to do those additional duties then let us give them a chance to do those additional duties. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047209"></A>
Another issue raised is that of public transport and the need to make sure that there are appropriate developments near main transport corridors. I certainly hope that the government can bring forward the upgrade of the railway line from Landsborough to Nambour. We have many people living in close proximity to this railway line. This is an important railway line. At the moment it is very congested with people travelling to and from Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047211"></A>
I use this as another opportunity to flag for the government that this is a high priority for many people on the Sunshine Coast--not just those in my electorate of Nicklin but those in the whole region. We would urge the government, perhaps in next year’s budget, to review the funding to see whether more dollars can be allocated to this very important project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047213"></A>
I realise the government is currently in negotiation with a number of property owners affected by the new preferred corridor. I am pleased to see that there are funds available in the budget for those negotiations to proceed to a conclusion. I look forward to the bill proceeding to the committee stage. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr WATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Everton--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.32 pm): The comments that I would like to make in the debate on the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill particularly relate to amendments that it is making to further relieve congestion in the south-east corner of Queensland. As the member for Nicklin has just mentioned, the amendments that I want to discuss are those that relate to the granting of powers to transport inspectors to enforce high-occupancy vehicle lanes. These are the T2 or T3 lanes that are only open to vehicles carrying two or three passengers and bus lanes. They are an efficient way of moving people around. Given the number of cars on the roads around the south-east corner that have only one occupant, that is a very inefficient way of moving people around compared to the number of people that we can move in a fully occupied bus or car with two or three occupants. We need to reserve space on our roads to allow those high-occupancy vehicles to move people around as freely as possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047219"></A>
Currently the use of those lanes is policed by police officers within the Queensland Police Service. They do a fantastic job, but I would have thought that they would have more pressing things to do than write out tickets for people who wrongly use the high-occupancy vehicle lanes. That is why I support the amendments to grant enforcement powers to transport inspectors. It is obvious that we need to make sure that someone is enforcing those lanes and that single-occupant vehicles are not cheating the system and using those high-occupancy vehicle lanes. I think it is entirely appropriate that those powers be extended to transport inspectors, especially since we are only talking about that happening on a trial basis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047220"></A>
This amendment is the latest in a long list of measures that the Bligh government is taking to relieve congestion in the south-east corner. Those of us who live in this part of the world know that our population is growing at a rate of 2,000 people a week. That is undoubtedly placing pressure on our road and transport systems and is making it more difficult to get around. That is why I am very happy to support a number of the initiatives that the Bligh government has taken to relieve congestion in our cities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047222"></A>
They are things like big infrastructure investment. We have been hearing a lot lately about the duplication of the Gateway Bridge. That will certainly benefit people in the northern and eastern parts of the city, including residents in the electorate of the next speaker, the member for Bulimba. Closer to the electorate that I represent, we are all looking forward to Airport Link being progressed. We know that the drive to the airport from many parts of Brisbane, including from the areas that I represent, can be a difficult one at times. Airport Link is a great investment by the state government to speed up the trip both to and around the airport. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047224"></A>
The transport minister recently released a plan relating to the future transport needs for the north-western part of Brisbane, which is the area I represent. That plan is the Western Brisbane Transport Network Investigation. There has been some criticism of the government in recent times for not planning adequately for the transport needs of our area into the future. This is a great example of how serious the government is in looking further ahead and looking at the transport needs for the area in the next 10 to 20 years. It flags a range of potential infrastructure measures that will speed up the journey around that part of the world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047226"></A>
We are also investing record amounts of money every year in public transport. I know that people in my area have of late benefited from the duplication of the railway line between Mitchelton and Keperra. While it is not incredibly close to home, the Northern Busway will also benefit people in the electorate of Everton by encouraging people who currently use South Pine Road and Old Northern Road to move back to using Gympie Road, closer to where they live, and that will free up the traffic on Old Northern Road and South Pine Road. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047229"></A>
There is a range of other measures that the government has taken that I will not go into. We are very serious about tackling congestion both in terms of infrastructure investment and other measures like the ones we are debating here--that is, innovative strategies to use the existing road network that we have more efficiently. We are serious about tackling congestion and making it easier to get around. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047230"></A>
I cannot let the opportunity of a transport bill go past without raising a couple of local transport issues that I have taken up with the relevant ministers. A couple of speakers have already talked about noise barriers. Certainly that is an issue that a number of constituents have raised with me, particularly in Everton Park. We do have a large number of trucks using South Pine Road and Old Northern Road. The people living on those roads would appreciate either noise barriers or some kind of signage to request that truck drivers give consideration to the fact that there are local residents in the area. I have raised that with the main roads minister and will continue to do so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047231"></A>
To some extent, we have been a victim of our own success with the increase in the number of people who are catching trains from the Mitchelton part of my electorate. I know that the member for Ferny Grove has long advocated the need to expand park-and-ride facilities at Ferny Grove station. He is continuing to battle away. He sets a very good example for new members of this parliament in how he can press home a local issue to relevant ministers. I am crossing my fingers just as he is that in future months and years the government may be to take some action in that regard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047232"></A>
Why we are talking about Ferny Grove station--and some may question the relevance that has to my electorate--is that I have seen data recently that indicates the number of people who live in the catchment of the Ferny Grove station who use the park-and-ride facilities at the railway stations in my electorate. The problem is that they come in from Samford or other such areas and try to get a park at Ferny Grove station but when it is full they keep on driving in and take up spaces in car parks at the railway stations that are in my electorate. I fully support the efforts of the member for Ferny Grove. If we can expand the park-and-ride facilities at Ferny Grove station that will benefit constituents in my electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047233"></A>
I have also raised with the transport minister the need to expand park-and-ride facilities at Mitchelton train station in particular but also at Grovely and Oxford Park stations. It is fairly early in the morning when the car parks are full. It is a good sign. It shows that people want to use our public transport services but we do need to make sure that supply keeps up with demand. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050575"></A>
I have also previously raised with the transport minister the need for additional bus services into the northern part of my electorate, in the suburbs of Albany Creek and Eatons Hill in particular, and I have been very pleased with recent expansions of the services into those two suburbs. However, I think it is fair to say that, particularly off peak, the services are pretty inadequate. The problem we have here more than anything is that Moreton Bay Regional Council does not invest a single dollar in public transport services, unlike the Brisbane City Council and unlike the Gold Coast City Council. I have raised with both local councillors and the mayor on a couple of occasions the need for Moreton Bay Regional Council to come to the party and start putting some money into public transport services. The state government can only do so much. I have raised the need for those extra bus services with the transport minister and will be sure to remind her at every opportunity I have. With those few comments, I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms FARMER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bulimba--ALP) (3.40 pm): I rise in support of the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. I want to first talk about the addition of a definition for the term ‘law enforcement agency’ in the Transport Security (Counter-Terrorism) Act 2008. This government is serious about protecting commuters and our surface transport operations from acts of terrorism. To do this, we need to be able to share information with other Australian jurisdictions. This amendment will ensure that the chief executive can take account of intelligence information from other Australian jurisdictions when deciding which surface transport operations may be at a higher risk. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050585"></A>
Transport operations are targeted by terrorists. Less than 12 months ago we all witnessed the tragic events unfold in Mumbai, where 52 people lost their lives and a further 109 were injured at the rail terminus alone before further deaths were caused in the international hotels. Recent law enforcement activity by Victoria and the Commonwealth in relation to a suspected terrorist plot indicates that such an attack could occur in Australia unless we remain vigilant. It is critical that Australian jurisdictions share knowledge to maintain readiness. Being aware of what is going on in other jurisdictions will only improve our own prevention measures and capability to respond decisively to a terrorist threat.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050587"></A>
In particular I want to talk about amendments to the Transport Operations (Passenger Transport) Act 1994, which will amend the driver authorisation regime and create a regulation to allow the chief executive to suspend or cancel a taxi service licence for nonpayment of the taxi industry security levy. The Transport Operations (Passenger Transport) Act 1994 driver authorisation regime is designed to protect people who use taxis and buses. The regime currently achieves this outcome by establishing a number of categories of disqualifying offences, including category A and category B. Category A contains extremely serious offences. People who have been convicted of category A offences are not eligible to hold or apply for driver authorisation as they are automatically disqualified. Category B also contains a range of serious offences. People applying for driver authorisation who have been convicted of a category B offence are also disqualified. However, they do have leave to request special consideration if they can demonstrate an exceptional circumstance. This leads me to my support for this amendment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050590"></A>
Evaluating driver authorisations for applicants who have committed serious offences is a sensitive and difficult issue. The current Transport Operations (Passenger Transport) Act 1994 regime is ill-equipped to deal with this sensitivity and difficulty. With this amendment we will be bringing this legislation into line with other Queensland legislation such as the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian Act 2000. The bill contains an amendment that will mean people who are convicted of any category A offence while under 17 years of age will be eligible to apply for driver authorisation as these offences will be considered category B offences. I want to reiterate that category B offences still disqualify a person from holding a driver authorisation. However, they could potentially be able to hold driver authorisation, but only if they are able to demonstrate to the chief executive that exceptional circumstances exist. This amendment still acknowledges that the need to ensure the safety of people travelling on public transport is paramount but provides a level of discretion in circumstances where the applicant offended as a child.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050593"></A>
For those members who may doubt the good sense of this change, I draw their attention to the similar provisions in the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian Act 2000 which relate to applicants for blue cards. As members will be aware, blue card holders can work in regulated businesses such as child-care facilities. I also want to assure the House that the decision-making requirements of category B are sufficiently robust in that the legislation requires the decision maker to evaluate the applicant’s claims with regard to the paramount principle that children and other vulnerable members of the community must be protected. </Hansard-Body>

As well, the Transport Operations (Passenger Transport) Act 1994 empowers the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian to advise the decision maker as to whether exceptional circumstances exist. It is the policy of the Department of Transport and Main Roads to always seek the advice of the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian in relevant cases. The decision maker must take into account the commissioner’s advice in making their decision. I am sure the House will agree that this approach matches our objective and this amendment shall achieve this.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050599"></A>
I also want to speak about amendments in relation to the taxi security levy, which funds secure taxi ranks in Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast, the Gold Coast, Cairns, Townsville, Toowoomba, Mackay, Rockhampton and Ipswich. I am sure the House would agree that secure taxi ranks are essential taxi infrastructure. There is clear evidence that secure taxi ranks lift consumer satisfaction, confidence and patronage by increasing safety and security. Because of this extra patronage and flow-on benefits to the licence holders, it is appropriate that these secure taxi ranks are funded by the levy on taxi licence holders. Licence holders who do not pay the taxi security levy are currently pursued through the courts by the Department of Transport and Main Roads. This process is obviously time consuming and costly for the department while valuable court resources are expended on these claims. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050603"></A>
I commend this minor amendment, which will effectively make collecting the taxi security levy similar to collecting the taxi service licence fee. This will mean that the chief executive will be able to suspend or cancel a taxi licence for nonpayment of the taxi security levy. This is a simple change which will save valuable court resources while ensuring taxi licence holders pay their fair share. The chief executive will of course not rush to suspend or cancel licences. Licence holders will be given 28 days to respond. This initiative demonstrates the department’s continuous improvement of the taxi industry for the benefit of all stakeholders and the travelling public.</Hansard-Body>

Like the member for Everton, I cannot let a transport bill go by without mentioning a transport initiative which is of great benefit to the Bulimba electorate. I have spoken in this House previously about the active transport initiatives which have been put forward by the minister, and I commend her for her enthusiasm in this regard. I want to commend the TravelSmart program, which is being rolled out on the south side of Brisbane. This is an excellent program that has already achieved major outcomes on the north side of Brisbane and will greatly assist in achieving some of the health outcomes that the Bligh government is seeking. It will also help with traffic congestion issues and assist in addressing climate change. I commend the minister for her work in that regard and look forward to the program rolling out in Bulimba. I commend this bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (3.46 pm): I rise to address the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. I want to focus in particular on the proposed amendments to the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 and particularly some of the clauses that look to insert a new definition and some elements of what are regarded as beneficial assets. These additions identify the potential negative environmental impacts of transport infrastructure but clearly offset these against the benefits of such assets. It is interesting to note that the government now says that, although the operational use of transport infrastructure may have significantly adverse environmental impacts, its operational use is necessary for the community’s environmental, social and economic wellbeing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050614"></A>
I also note that this morning the Premier stated quite clearly that her government stands for better transport infrastructure which is why, given this and given the proposed amendments that will enshrine the benefits of such assets, I want to focus on two glaring omissions. Firstly, I want to look at the lack of continued funding for the north coast rail duplication. As the minister would well be aware, this is the main freight and passenger route servicing all points north of Caboolture, and at this stage we have a rail duplication that is finished at Beerburrum. For as long as this infrastructure is overlooked, freight and passenger patronage will continue to put increasing pressure on our road system, increasing the maintenance costs on such Main Roads infrastructure as the Bruce Highway. While this infrastructure is overlooked, we need to invest heavily in such road infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050619"></A>
I was privileged to be present at the recent opening of the Bruce Highway upgrade to Caboolture, but we already need to look north of Caboolture and at the impacts that increased freight will have as we truck oil and various other commodities north to places such as Bundaberg, Gladstone and beyond. That can only continue to be a drain on the government’s purse and, therefore, surely a cost-benefit analysis would show that investing in that rail duplication needs to happen sooner rather than later. I would add that, if the government was serious about the environmental benefits of public transport and was intent on reducing emissions from vehicle usage, it would be looking to invest in rail projects such as that north coast duplication as soon as possible.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054164"></A>
The other omission that I would like to spend a bit of time focusing on is the CAMCOS study. A time line of how this CAMCOS project has developed would show that it also is well and truly delayed and needs to be built sooner rather than later. The 2000 Arup report showed that stage 1 should have been operational by 2005, stage 2 by 2015 and stage 3 by 2015 plus. It is in that 2015-plus time line that the rail will be developed progressively from Beerwah north to Maroochydore. Back in 2001, a three-stage study had already been completed. It identified environmental and social constraints and opportunities. It identified the preferred transport mode as heavy passenger rail. To be honest, I am really neither here nor there on that. I would happily accept a light passenger rail service as much as a heavy passenger rail service. That study also examined alternative options, benefits, environmental impacts and proposed strategies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054169"></A>
The completion of the rail line to Beerwah to facilitate the CAMCOS initiative was scheduled to be finished by 2012 but, as I just said, that time line has already been delayed and there really is no end time in any of the plans now. The latest is that the full duplication all the way through to Nambour will occur before 2025, which gives little comfort to those along that corridor and those along the CAMCOS corridor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054170"></A>
Studies have also shown that the Maroochydore area presently experiences significant congestion in peak periods, particularly at the Buderim-Mooloolaba intersection and at the northern end of Nicklin Way. Those areas are expected to increase in congestion if measures are not taken to improve that network. The demand on the rail link from the Buderim-Mooloolaba intersection to Maroochydore approaches some 4,000 passengers a day in 2011. The rail corridor from Caloundra to Beerwah approaches 1,000 passengers per day. There will be increased revenue of about $2.3 million per year, increased public transport travel time savings of $2.9 million per year, increased accident savings of $0.8 million per year and increased environmental benefits of $0.5 million per year. I suspect, given the latest focus on climate change, that environmental benefit would be vastly more significant than the estimated half a million dollars a year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054172"></A>
So when we consider modelling such as that, which has been included in various reports on the CAMCOS study, and when we consider the fact that it is easier and far more beneficial to build transport infrastructure before we put in place new residential developments--and I think particularly of the Caloundra South development that the government is pushing the Sunshine Coast Regional Council to develop sooner rather than later--it is necessary that we look at building CAMCOS far sooner than originally planned for two reasons. Firstly, it reduces the potential for nimby reactions to a subsequent rail corridor being implemented even if the land for it has been purchased and there have been plenty of studies done on it and, secondly, it will reduce car dependency. If a project such as Caloundra South goes ahead without the rail and infrastructure in place, people will rely heavily on their vehicles and on the roads to get into Caloundra, to get to points further north and to access the Bruce Highway to travel south. This infrastructure is overdue. If the government wants to fast-track development such as Caloundra South then it needs to fast-track its investment in public transport infrastructure on the coast. I think those projects are two prime examples. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054175"></A>
Again, as I said, this clause looks to enshrine in the legislation the environmental, social and economic benefits of public transport. Given that, I therefore seek the minister’s consideration of these two projects. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr JOHNSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gregory--LNP) (3.53 pm): It gives me pleasure to rise to speak to this legislation. It is important legislation in many ways and I want to refer to certain aspects of it. For various reasons, the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 had to come before the House. It is an omnibus bill that includes such diverse provisions as those covering child related crimes and drivers of public passenger vehicles--taxis, buses et cetera. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054178"></A>
Going back a couple of years ago a chappie in my electorate made representation to me for a bus licence. When the department of transport did a check on him, it found out that he had been associated with a serious crime that he had no involvement in at all. Because he was in the house at the time the crime was committed, he was convicted for being an accessory. He did 12 months jail because he did not have the funds or the backing from his family or anyone else to get the proper professional help to put a case forward for his defence. Unfortunately, at the time I made representation to the director-general of Queensland Transport, the law was it is now and this person was severely penalised. For the past 30 years he has lived with that penalty. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054179"></A>
I congratulate the government on this amendment, because it is very worthwhile. There are many people in such a predicament and they are in that predicament through no fault of their own. Two wrongs do not make a right. This change will now allow that person to be an integral player in the operation of carrying kiddies to and from school functions or recreation functions in his area. He has a family and he is a reputable member of the community. I wonder how many other people fell within that provision. Today, we are seeing a reversal of this idiotic, lame-brained idea. It is one that I have to say to the minister: congratulations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054180"></A>
I refer to the issue of protecting transport infrastructure from inappropriate development. This is a very important aspect of this legislation. Going back to 1996, 1997 and 1998 when the Borbidge government was in power, we saw development take place on the north side of Brisbane at Mango Hill. At the time, one of the most important functions was to make absolutely certain that that community was established without interference in later years--20 or 30 years down the track--from major development, such as the installation of water pipes, road infrastructure or whatever. I think today we have seen a reversal of what has happened in the past. Although we are debating aspects of this legislation--and I know the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning introduced legislation into this House just recently--I know that a lot of environmental issues are affecting some of our infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054181"></A>
As I said briefly a while ago to my colleague the shadow minister for transport and main roads, in a lot of these developments a significant cost is the cost involved in resumptions. That cost is brought about because of poor planning. I know that when we were in government and the Pacific Motorway was being built there were resumptions through Eagleby and other parts of the Gold Coast. At the end of the day, that paid off. Sometimes resumptions are the only way to go. But today, with escalating property prices, regardless of the colour of the government, huge amounts of dollars will be spent on resumptions that will eat into its budget because of poor planning. This legislation will address that phenomena in no uncertain terms, and that is important. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054182"></A>
I know what developers can be like. They come through the door and say, ‘This is a good deal.’ You can bet your bottom dollar it is a good deal! By the time they get through the door you are ready to show them the door again because you know that it is not a good deal. I think this aspect of this legislation will shut down some of that mentality and at the same time put in place some responsible development practices that will be overseen by the state government in conjunction with local government. Also, the people who live in those areas are not going to be affected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054183"></A>
Another very important aspect of this bill addresses environmental standards in relation to public transport. I have listened to some of the contributions to this debate in the House this afternoon from speakers representing both sides. Environmental issues are more important than ever. We now have a situation on our hands where the environment is No. 1 on the agenda. We have to talk about greenhouse gases and the vandalism of the environment. We have to be held responsible. When we build infrastructure we have to show that we are doing it properly, with purpose and that there is a real need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057520"></A>
This is about getting it right the first time. I heard my colleague the member for Glass House make mention of the CAMCOS concept on the north coast. I believe that the government has to look at fast-tracking that concept. When we talk about public transport and passenger transport, CAMCOS is a valuable concept that will provide infrastructure to meet the needs of Sunshine Coast residents, to bring them into line with the Gold Coast and allow them to use heavy rail. I know that it is long overdue and that it will cost a lot of money, but I urge the minister to do all in her power to see that we get this back on the agenda so it can be brought forward. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057523"></A>
One only has to drive on the Bruce Highway to see the need for this infrastructure. In the early morning the traffic is choked up coming into Brisbane and in the late afternoon it is choked up going out. So many of those cars have only one person in them--the person behind the wheel. That is a reflection on this and past governments that dragged their feet on public transport infrastructure. I heard the Treasurer say just last week that 2,100 people a week are coming to live in this state. Unfortunately, the majority of those people are settling here in the south-east corner. This is overtaxing all types of infrastructure, not just transport. We have a long way to go to catch up. That catch-up has to be a priority of government, regardless of what government it is. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057524"></A>
The other aspect of the bill that I want to talk about is the power to suspend and cancel taxi licences. This is a very tough ask when we are talking about a paltry $300 or $400. A $300,000 or $400,000 licence can be suspended when only a few of those charges are not paid. I call on the minister to look at this. A taxi licence is a big investment for people. The taxi industry is on its knees at the moment. It is a very important industry in terms of public transport. I believe that it is the safest form of public transport that we have. One can get a taxi to pick them up from point A and take them to point B. If the person’s home is in a lonely suburban street, the taxi can make sure the person gets inside the door. We need to make certain that we keep this industry at the top of the tree as far as public transport goes. I call on the minister to look very closely at this because it could be damning for some of these operators. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1057525"></A>
While I am on the subject of taxis, I have to refer to some of our brothers from overseas who are driving these taxis. I have had a hell of a ride with some of them lately. Recently I was going out to St Lucia--</Hansard-Body>

Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I do not have time for that; I am not like the minister. They tell me that you play every Friday afternoon out at Ferny Grove. Is that right? It is not right? I did not think it would be right. This cabbie said to me, ‘Sir, you are going to have to get out now.’ I said, ‘Get out? What for?’ He said, ‘My wife’s in town. I’ve got to go back and pick her up and take her home.’ I said, ‘You’re a nice how-do-you-do you are, old mate. I’m not getting out at all.’ I said, ‘Your wife’s safe. Where is she?’ ‘She’s waiting for me at the office.’ ‘Well, that’s very bloody good, I’ve got to say, old mate, but I ain’t getting out.’ Anyway, I had to go about another $5 or $6 on the fare. I wonder how many other people would have got out. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1057528"></A>
I had one bloke come from the airport one day and we finished up at Indooroopilly and it cost me $75 to get here. I could have driven the flaming thing and got here for half the price.

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057529"></A>
I wonder what sort of a process taxidrivers have to go through to get a licence. One bloke the other day threw me the <Hansard-Italic>
Refidex</Hansard-Italic>
 as soon as I got in the cab and said, ‘Show me the way.’ I said, ‘Show you the way where?’ He said, ‘To the airport.’ He came out the gate of Parliament House and he wanted to turn right so he could go up the ramp and out. I said, ‘Listen here, bloke. It might be five o’clock in the morning, but you’ve got to go around here and back up around to Margaret Street.’ Holy smokes! Is it any wonder our road toll is going up if we have drivers out there like some of our taxidrivers in Brisbane.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057530"></A>
It is an unfortunate situation. I back the commissioner in relation to his comments in the paper this morning. I wonder if some of these drivers have a licence. I wonder if they flick to it the next bloke because they all look the same. This is a very serious situation in the city of Brisbane. In other parts of the state I know that we have local people driving cabs who do a very able and exemplary job, but the problem here in Brisbane has to be addressed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057531"></A>
I come back to what Mr Atkinson said in relation to the road toll. Our road toll is the result of people who are impatient, have no respect for others on the road and are just downright stupid. This is a situation that cannot be further tolerated. I say to the minister here today that all the ideas in the world will not fix it. I think the most important function is enforcement by Queensland police. Give the police the powers to bring those people to justice and throw the book at them for doing the wrong thing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057532"></A>
Another aspect of this legislation is the extended powers of transport inspectors in relation to high-occupancy vehicle lanes. I cannot agree with high-occupancy vehicle lanes being policed by transport inspectors. I have read through the explanatory notes. I realise that it is only a trial until 31 March 2011 and can be extended to 31 March 2012. The rights and powers of Queensland police to pull up and apprehend people have to be respected. They have the authority to carry out the surveillance of vehicles and determine whether a vehicle is breaking the law. When it comes to transport inspectors carrying out this role, I think we are losing sight of what their real responsibilities should be. I know that we are talking about HOV lanes--taxis, buses et cetera--but we have more need for those transport inspectors in other parts of the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057533"></A>
Over a period of time many people have criticised the heavy transport industry for violation of road laws et cetera. There have been fatalities in the heavy transport industry, but many of the fatalities in the heavy transport area are caused by the idiots who run interstate. They come into South-East Queensland, running against time lines and running the gauntlet in a lot of cases. Just the other day I was on that horror stretch on the Sunshine Coast between Cooroy and Gympie, where I go a fair bit. I had one of my little granddaughters in the car with me. The next minute I look in the rear-vision mirror and there is a B-double semitrailer about from here to the member for Burdekin away. It was right behind me. My granddaughter was terrified. The speed limit is 90 kilometres an hour along there. There is nothing wrong with the road; it is just the flaming idiots who are using the road. At the end of the day, we have to throw the book at those people forever and a day and take them right out of the equation. Many people are fearful of those big lorries. People like me know how to negotiate them. I know what their capabilities are. They do not frighten me. I know what they can and cannot do. Something has to be done about the stupidity of tailgating.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064559"></A>
 I have never been a supporter of the concept of using cameras, but if people are photographed and detected for irresponsible driving habits maybe we can get them out of the equation. I do not always agree with Hughie Williams, but I certainly agree with him when it comes to the issue of road safety. In western areas, the long-distance transport operators are among the most courteous on our roads. We do not have the fatalities and altercations that we see when drivers have to meet deadlines for markets in Sydney and Melbourne. One day my wife and I were travelling to Cobar out of Bourke, New South Wales. We were following a B-double. My wife was driving. I said, ‘How fast is that bloke going?’ She said, ‘I don’t know, I can’t catch him.’ I said, ‘Give me the wheel, and I’ll catch him.’ By the time I caught up to him I was doing 135 kilometres per hour. I know I was breaking the law, but that bloke was in a B-double, probably carting bananas or some other fruit to Adelaide or Perth, because he turned off and went towards Broken Hill. Those are the idiots who are causing problems on our roads and who we have to contend with. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061049"></A>
Today I say to the minister that we certainly have some serious issues to address. I have made representation to the Director-General of Queensland Transport in relation to heavy-vehicle occupancy lanes. I applaud Dave Stewart, who I believe is doing an excellent job. He understands the issues in relation to some of the people who are breaking the conventional structures of road trains in western Queensland. He is certainly onto that. I am talking about type 2 road trains travelling into places such as Emerald in the middle of the night and over-length configurations running against the usual regime between Mitchell and further in. Those are all road safety issues. I commend Mr Stewart for what he is doing in that regard. He is doing an excellent job. </Hansard-Body>

Clause 18 enables the general manager to direct the master of a ship to do certain things in exceptional circumstances. This is a very important aspect of the legislation.

We have removed the ships of shame from our waters; now we have to make sure that we have no crews of shame but only crews of responsibility. I applaud the minister for this aspect of the legislation. </Hansard-Body>

In closing, I wish to congratulate the minister. She could not come out to Barcaldine and Longreach last week, but I thank her for the reinstatement in time of the air services into Blackall and Barcaldine. They are a very, very important part of the social fabric of those communities, and I believe those communities deserve those services. I know major work has to be done on the turnaround areas, both at Blackall and Barcaldine, but it certainly means a lot to the local people. I thank the Mayor of the Blackall-Tambo Regional Council, Councillor Jan Ross, and the Mayor of the Barcaldine Regional Council, Councillor Rob Chandler, for working closely with me and the government to make certain that that situation was reversed. I thank the minister for that. I put that on the record here today. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DOWLING </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Redlands--LNP) (4.12 pm): I rise in support of the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. The bill seeks to amend 13 pieces of legislation, but I will limit my brief comments and questions to three areas that I think are relevant. They have been touched on by others, but I will put them on the radar myself. The three items are: the protection of transport infrastructure from inappropriate development, the power to suspend taxi licences and the extension of the transport inspectors’ powers to police the high-occupancy vehicle lanes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061061"></A>
The principle of protecting the development of transport infrastructure is commendable and we have probably needed it for a long time. It is critical to protect that transport infrastructure as we move forward. It is interesting that with the development of transport infrastructure we have included the issue of amenity, adding emissions to the mix. I am not entirely sure how we are going to address those issues going forward. I know that the issues of noise, dust, hours of operation and so on come up time and time again whenever there is the expansion of a road network or increased intensity in bus or rail use, although we have not seen a great deal of that in the Redlands. I would ask the minister--who was in the House--to look at the provision of dual rail to Cleveland. The current service is being very heavily used. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061062"></A>
It is interesting to see the expansion of ports, the increase in bus and rail patronage and airport curfews. While we are looking at protecting the capacity to expand, the legislation does not go into a great deal of detail as to how that expansion may roll out. Are the indicators size, volume, dust, noise or hours of operation? All of those are critical issues. It is rather interesting that the Prime Minister of the country was fairly active in fighting against aircraft noise from our own Brisbane Airport, where the airport curfew is midnight. I am sure most members would agree that that can be counterproductive in a state that relies fairly heavily on airline transport and the tourism industry. In the past those areas have gone largely unprotected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061064"></A>
The question for me and my community relates to the notification in the first instance. I know from my background in the council, this used to come up time and time again. People would assert that they had done searches but failed to find things such as overlays that impacted on the properties they were buying. They were not able to actively search to find out where there might be a rollout of power, rail or bus infrastructure or increases in the road infrastructure network. The issue for me is how we will notify such people. Issues arose around covenants. Quite often covenants lapse at the first change of hands. The first person may sign off on a covenant, but they are not always duty bound to hand on that covenant. You start to lose some of those controls. For me this is about how people find out information such as whether an expansion program is planned, be it road, rail, bus transport and so on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061065"></A>
The other issue that will be interesting to grapple with is the principle of TODs--transport oriented developments--and how they might be managed. It seems to me that the people who move closest to the train track, the bus terminal or the airport are the ones who complain the longest and the loudest about the noise, the inconvenience, the hassle with parking and all of the other things that go along with a transport oriented development and how it might be managed moving forward. I have briefly touched on the planning for the duplication of the rail line to Cleveland which, in itself, is a recognised TOD. I encourage the minister to give that some consideration. The residents of the Redlands, Cleveland and Capalaba are very avid rail users. Sadly, because of the single line and the limited services they can access, they cannot utilise the line to maximum capacity. It is the same with our bus networks, which are very well patronised. The numbers certainly support an expansion of those services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061066"></A>
The Redlands area has grown. This has been touched on by other members. The member for Gregory touched on this before me. We have allowed the rollout of development, but the infrastructure has failed to keep up. The infrastructure has not been delivered in a timely manner. An example from my neck of the woods is the Cleveland-Redland Bay Road. The redevelopment of that road had been budgeted for and planned, and was to be rolled out in 2001-02, but that road infrastructure never happened. Is it any wonder that we have the gridlock that we have? As well as that, we did not get the transport rollout that we needed to offset the lack of road infrastructure. Growth has occurred and the pressures are there now. I know that the people of Redlands, Cleveland and Capalaba are really looking forward to those roads being completed and to the public transport rollout, both rail and bus. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067961"></A>
The southern Moreton Bay islands also have transport issues. It is about providing the transport links. It is about looking at the park-and-ride infrastructure there. It is an issue that has been avoided by this state government and previous state governments over a long period of time. It is an issue that the council has tried to grapple with but has failed to come to terms with. That issue is ongoing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067965"></A>
It is about key transport infrastructure. It is incumbent on this House to take that on board and address those issues and invest capital into those programs. If we are serious about public transport as a way forward, then we will support those proposals such as the park-and-ride strategies. A previous speaker who went to WA mentioned the park and rides over there. One of the fundamental differences--and I did not pick up on it from any members who talked about the WA example--is that in Queensland we tend to go about 400 metres between stops. That is counterproductive. In WA they go about four kilometres between stops. That is what makes it stack up. That is what gives you a timely system and a timely people movement program--build the infrastructure at four-kilometre intervals, not 400-metre intervals. That is one of the subtle differences that we need to be addressing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067968"></A>
Getting back to the issue of park and rides, there is pressure on Weinam Creek with the expectation of the community that it will remain a foreshore. It is the conflict between that and transport, and then it is about viewsheds for the residents who live nearby. The state has for such a long time been silent on this issue. The road linkages between those points is critical to my community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067970"></A>
Getting back to notification--and I did not mention this before--transport infrastructure needs to be on the titles. That is the only place where people are going to pick up these things--by doing a property search. Residents need to be able to find transport infrastructure--where it impacts on residents and where proximity needs to be determined--when they do a title search, the most basic fundamental title search. It may not give them all the answers, but it must raise a flag. It must be something that sparks them to do a secondary search so that they can find out. It must tell them where to look so that they do not come back later and say, ‘No-one told me. We did the due diligence but we did not find it.’ In a lot of cases with these planning schemes you do need to be a combination rocket scientist and nuclear physicist to find these things out. They are some of the most appalling documents and you need someone who has that expertise which many people cannot afford. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067971"></A>
When we talk about issues around rail transport and rail shunting yards, again it begs the question. People move into those areas and as the demand and volume increases then the hours of operation increase and then you start to get complaints. I spent some time as a railway worker, so I know only too well the complaints we would get when someone new would move into the area. Complaints were also about lighting spilling into their homes. I heard earlier that some people actually applaud lighting--in Redbank they wanted lighting so they could see what was going on. It has been my experience that people did not want lighting flooding into their homes and into their bedrooms when they were trying to sleep. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067972"></A>
When talking about rail, we need to talk about all of those issues--how we manage the conflict between amenity and lifestyle and the need for transport infrastructure and the greater need of the community. So all of those issues need to be front and centre, certainly when it comes to rail shunting yards. It is about the community expectation and the community certainty of what it is they have invested in. After all, the single biggest investment that any of us make is the family home in most circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067973"></A>
There is a bus depot in Capalaba in the electorate of Michael Choi. It is growing rapidly and it needs to move further south. But the provisions for park-and-ride or to be able to facilitate that has not been catered for. As I said earlier, Redlands and Cleveland are largely at capacity on both their rail and bus transport networks. The road network is certainly well beyond capacity. The roads are chock-a-block every day coming in and out of town. So park-and-ride and road infrastructure are key. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067977"></A>
Also, we have the issue of ferry operations. In both my electorate and that of Cleveland, we have water based transport. We have ferry operations and barge operations and the state government fails to recognise or acknowledge or manage or administer in any way the barge transport network. If we are serious about transporting people, we need to look at the whole picture. It is about the number of outlets from the islands. At the moment each of the islands in southern Moreton Bay have only one point of exit and entry. It is the same at Weinam Creek. There is that one single point of entry. All the while we are squeezing entry and exit points into one, we are just not able to function and cope with the growth. So there needs to be some serious consideration given within the transport ministry to looking at alternatives. Also, there is the issue of the noise of operation of a ferry system. It sounds romantic but, when people hear the diesel engines firing up, the barge moving in and out and the sounding of the horn, they do complain about those issues. So it is about managing all of those issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067980"></A>
The second dot point that I would like to talk about is the taxi licence suspension legislation. It has me in many ways puzzled as to why the government would move down this path as it relates to the security levy. The security levy is $345. When you do a little research, you find that there is only a handful--seven or half a dozen at best--who have failed to pay that levy. Here we have a whole department amending this legislation to pick up those few who default, when there are so many other mechanisms that are already in place that can very effectively achieve that. We are talking about 2,900 cab licences and of those fewer than 10 have defaulted. Is this mechanism being put in place because, like so many other fees and charges, there is a huge increase coming in the taxi security levy? At the moment the levy is $324. Is that going to jump through the roof to $3,240? That would be one of the few reasons why this kind of strategy would be implemented. I am concerned that it is being implemented because of the rapid increase in the defaulters that is likely to occur should the levies increase by that amount of money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067981"></A>
The third point I would like to touch on is the extended powers for transport officers. In one of my previous jobs I was involved in sales and that saw me travelling countless tens of thousands of kilometres all around Queensland. I would see the transport officers out doing their job. Their function was all about heavy vehicle transport safety. That should not be forgotten in this debate in any way, shape or form. It is critical that they are out there doing that job. There are 170 officers in Queensland who are charged with that responsibility to see that our heavy goods are transported in a safe way across Queensland. If we start to take them off line, then we start to water down that strategy. Yet we wonder about the percentage of accidents or incidents, as they are called, involving heavy vehicles on the road. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067982"></A>
We also have to question the ability of transport officers to know what it is they are walking into when they start to manage these T2 lanes. Do they have access to a database similar to that of the police? Do they have access to the registration networks? Are they able to check for licences that have lapsed? What would happen if a transport officer pulled someone over in a T2 lane who was quite obviously drunk, gave them their $100 fine and sent them on their way? What powers of detainment do these transport officers now have? Is it only about the $100 revenue-raising exercise? Because that is clearly what it is all about. How will they know about outstanding warrants for the people they are pulling over? We also have to question whether they are going to receive suitable training for the role they are going to perform because they are in no way trained to the level that our Police Service is, not even close. So we are taking our transport officers off the road, we are going to dilute the heavy vehicle transport safety with this strategy, and I am genuinely concerned for the personal safety of transport officers in undertaking these new roles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071379"></A>
I have raised the issue of their suitability and that of training. It is also about identification--both their identification as duly authorised officers and the community’s ability to identify them as officers who are able to pull them over on the highway. I believe this is high risk and high stakes. If the premise is traffic congestion, surely there are better ways to manage it. It is proposed that these officers will have RBT style roadblocks, or they will be out on the side of the road looking for people travelling in T2 lanes inappropriately. They then have to pull them over. I suggest that they will cause greater traffic chaos and congestion through their activities on the roadside at peak time than if they were not there at all. I was listening to 4BC the other day--</Hansard-Body>

 Absolutely, the fount of wisdom. I want to paraphrase ‘Bluey’ O’Gorman, a long-serving, well-respected senior police officer in the state of Queensland, now retired. I am absolutely certain there are very few people with a greater insight into road safety and issues of traffic management. He was very concerned and alarmed. He had just been on a road trip. I think he qualifies--and he may not thank me for this--as a grey nomad, but he has recently been to Victoria and New South Wales, as I have recently myself, and to WA. The one thing you notice when you drive the highways is that our Queensland Police Service, for all the numbers and for all the police cars that we have out there, is largely invisible. There are a handful of rainbow coloured vehicles out in the paddock, and they are great for a PR stunt, but they are largely invisible. When you drive the highways--</Hansard-Body>

 Members opposite, all you have to do is drive from Sydney to Melbourne. The minute you leave Queensland you will see police cars everywhere. They are fully badged up. I know full well that there are a lot more police out there than we see, because I see the unmarked cars out there as well. But if it is about safety, if it is about reducing the road toll that we have heard about today--a road toll of 298 is a tragedy, and I made my living on the road so I am very sympathetic to those road users--if it is about seriously addressing those issues, then it is about visibility. It is about getting branded police on the side of the roads and travelling the highways in high visibility. It is not about taking some of their powers off them and giving them to other lesser branded, differently uniformed officers in the transport department. It is about branding them and having high visibility so you know full well they are out there and you see them.</Hansard-Body>

One other thing we have not picked up on is that it is a trial. Until March 2011 it is a trial. What are the indicators that will be used to assess its success? How will we know that it has worked? How will we know that this has been a success? I do not believe there are any acid tests in here. I do not believe any measures have been put in place to say, ‘If this happens, this will have been a good thing.’ I think it is just another case of ‘think it up but don’t think it through’. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms CROFT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Broadwater--ALP) (4.33 pm): I rise to support the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. As many honourable members would know, South-East Queensland is one of the fastest growing regions in Australia, with about 1,500 people moving here each week. It is estimated that almost nine million trips are made by South-East Queensland residents on a typical weekday, and this places significant pressure on our transport system. It is for this reason that we need to use our transport system as efficiently as possible. The Queensland government, through the Department of Transport and Main Roads, the Queensland Police Service and the Department of Community Safety, is committed to providing initiatives and improvements to the network to ensure congestion is managed appropriately. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071396"></A>
This is why the Department of Transport and Main Roads is looking at a number of initiatives across the five core elements of congestion management. Through better land use and planning, smarter travel demand management, increased travel options, improvements in efficiency and significant spending to increase capacity, the government is targeting congestion in a proactive way. Each of these five areas has a number of initiatives or projects that will assist in reducing the impact or chances of congestion being created. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071398"></A>
To fully utilise these initiatives we need to ensure each and every component of the transport system is working to its full potential. The government’s South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program, which is being rolled out between 2009 and 2026, has committed a massive $780 million to the high-occupancy vehicle network program which includes bus lanes and transit--T2 and T3--lanes. We need to ensure that each and every one of our more than 70 existing high-occupancy vehicle facilities is being used to its potential and that as new high-occupancy vehicle capacity is introduced it is also used effectively. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071400"></A>
HOV lanes are designed to encourage more efficient use of road space. HOV lanes have the potential to move more people with fewer vehicles and encourage mode shift from single-occupant vehicles to high-occupancy vehicles. They also provide travel time advantages, more reliable travel times and lower operating costs for public transport services. A well-functioning Brisbane arterial would rarely carry more than a thousand vehicles per lane per hour, which equates to about 1,300 people per lane per hour. A heavily utilised HOV lane, for example the transit lane on Lutwyche Road, could carry 40 buses per hour, carrying more than 1,600 people, and about 200 compliant vehicles, carrying more than 400 people. Motorists sitting in other lanes might perceive this as an empty lane but it is actually carrying more than 2,000 people per hour--well in excess of the standard arterial lane. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071401"></A>
Every single-occupant vehicle that enters a HOV lane steals a potential space for more efficient vehicles and stops a HOV lane reaching its maximum potential. The Queensland Police Service does a fantastic job in helping keep us moving safely on the roads by dealing with life-threatening road safety offences such as speeding and drink driving. The amendments will provide for a trial during 2010 of additional powers for transport inspectors to enforce compliance in high-occupancy vehicle lanes. This will make our road network more efficient without imposing additional burdens on the Queensland Police Service so that they can continue to undertake their crucial road safety duties. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071403"></A>
A more efficient road system will also help us achieve a more sustainable region. The 2008 RACQ congested roads report entitled <Hansard-Italic>
The effects of fuel consumption and vehicles emissions</Hansard-Italic>
 found that vehicles in congested conditions can emit up to 30 per cent more greenhouse gas emissions due to inefficient vehicle operation. In July of this year the government released the draft South-East Queensland Climate Change Management Plan, which showed that South-East Queensland was responsible for more than half of Queensland’s total transport emissions. The majority of these emissions are attributable to car and light commercial vehicle use. This effect is also recognised and studied internationally. For example, the European Commission estimates that European cities, many of which experience serious congestion problems, are responsible for about 40 per cent of all transport emissions in Europe. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071409"></A>
Under the Queensland government’s climate change strategy, ClimateQ, managing congestion is seen as important for effectively managing transport emissions, particularly in South-East Queensland. High-occupancy vehicle lanes are important for generating mode shift to more greenhouse efficient use of vehicles. That is, high-occupancy vehicles reduce the greenhouse gases emitted per passenger per kilometre travelled. However, for high-occupancy vehicle lanes to be effective, enforcement is required. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071442"></A>
The Department of Transport and Main Roads recently commissioned an evaluation of existing South-East Queensland high-occupancy vehicle facilities. I understand the findings of this evaluation are being used in the development of the high-occupancy vehicle network plan, which is due for release late in 2010. The results of this work show that there are high levels of noncompliance. This means that those people who are making their contribution to a more sustainable future by catching buses or car-pooling during peak hours are having their efforts undercut. Not only is their journey slower, but the overall efficiency of the road is reduced and pollution is increased. Trialling enhanced high-occupancy vehicle lane enforcement sends the message that this government is serious about the issue of congestion management and reducing transport emissions. Doing the right thing will be recognised and supported. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071446"></A>
Just like the police, transport inspectors wear a uniform when on duty. They are highly experienced and are already out and about on our roads, making them safer. Transport inspectors currently exercise powers to stop private vehicles for a range of vehicle related matters such as unregistered, uninsured and unroadworthy vehicles and for tailpipe air quality testing. Transport inspectors also already exercise significant powers in relation to heavy vehicles, including vehicle related offences as well as fatigue management and licensing requirements, providing them with significant experience in conducting on-road operations. These amendments allow for a trial by transport inspectors to help in our fight against congestion and pollution by extending their powers to enforce compliance of high-occupancy vehicle lanes. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. MM KEECH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Albert--ALP) (4.41 pm): With 2,000 people coming to Queensland each week and most of those settling in South-East Queensland, particularly in the electorate of Albert, I support very strongly the bill and the provisions which focus on easing road congestion on our freeways. It is estimated that almost nine million trips are made by South-East Queensland residents on a typical weekday. This places significant pressure on our transport system, on our roads as well as on our environment. It is for this reason that we need to use our road transport system as efficiently as possible, and that is exactly what the Bligh government is doing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071453"></A>
The system of high-occupancy vehicle lanes is a very important aspect in improving the network to ensure congestion is managed well. Unfortunately, as a regular driver on the South East Freeway, I know only too well that not all road users drive responsibly where the network provides for high-occupancy vehicle lanes. In particular, I have noticed that the T2 lane is often used by single-driver vehicles which then prohibits the free flow of buses and those people who are car-pooling on their way to or from work. I welcome the amendment in the bill, which provides a trial for transport inspectors to undertake enforcement of high-occupancy vehicle lanes. Trialling enhanced enforcement of these lanes will send a very strong message that the government is serious about the issue of congestion management and reducing transport emissions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071456"></A>
I have confidence in the ability of transport inspectors to do the job of enforcement. Just like the police, transport inspectors do a very good job, often under difficult circumstances, and wear a uniform when they are on duty. They are highly experienced and are already out and about on the roads making them safer. Currently, transport inspectors exercise powers to stop private vehicles for a range of vehicle related matters such as unregistered, uninsured and unroadworthy vehicles and for tailpipe air quality testing. In fact, it was not too long ago that I saw them in Beenleigh undertaking exactly these types of inspections. Transport inspectors also readily exercise significant powers in relation to heavy vehicles, including vehicle related offences as well as fatigue management and licensing requirements, providing them with significant experience in conducting on-road operations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071458"></A>
These amendments allow for a trial by transport inspectors to help in our fight against congestion and pollution by extending their powers to enforce compliance of high-occupancy vehicle lanes. Very importantly, by giving transport inspectors the power to undertake enforcement of these lanes, the amendments will also free up police to focus on other key priorities. I congratulate the minister on her first bill. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs MENKENS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burdekin--LNP) (4.44 pm): I rise to address the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill before the House tonight. As we have heard, this bill amends 13 pieces of legislation which cover marine operations, public transport and transport infrastructure. I certainly do not intend speaking to all of the amendments but I would like to cover a few, starting with the Transport Operations (Marine Safety) Act. The explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1071464"></A>
The amendments to the Transport Operations (Marine Safety) Act 1994 provide for two related powers for the general manager of Maritime Safety Queensland to direct the master of a ship to navigate or otherwise operate the ship in a specified way, and to direct a person in charge of a place to allow a ship to be berthed at the place, to allow access through the place to and from the ship. These two powers will enable Maritime Safety Queensland to manage the operation of ships in pilotage areas in exceptional circumstances when the public interest requires it. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071465"></A>
I am aware that this amendment is designed to prevent a similar situation to that which occurred in relation to the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Dawn</Hansard-Italic>
 and its infected passengers and crew. I wonder if this amendment would also be applicable to those large container ships that regularly navigate through the delicate Great Barrier Reef. For example, we do not want a situation such as that which occurred in Moreton Bay where there was a large oil spill on the reef. As farmers are having to carry the burden of ensuring the health of the Great Barrier Reef, I am sure they would be glad to hear that our shipping lanes are being as closely monitored by this government as they are. In the case of a cyclone, these ships could be prevented from potentially causing damage to this environmental icon. I believe this power is only to be used in exceptional circumstances and in the public interest such as in the case of a contagious disease like swine flu on board or a natural disaster such as occurs in the cyclone-ravaged Far North where ships can dock to deliver much-needed equipment and materials that would help that community. Those of us from the north know that the only way to deliver these goods is by sea because the Bruce Highway in those situations is not flood proof. I support this amendment but wonder if, in such events, compensation to the port or ship could have been included. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071469"></A>
The modification of the Transport Operations (Passenger Transport) Act 1994 will reclassify all category A driver disqualifying offences as category B if the person convicted of the offence was a child at the time of the offence. This is to provide a limited natural justice process to allow people convicted of such offences to have their individual circumstances reviewed. Category A offences include child sex offences. At the moment people who have committed such offences do not receive authorisation to drive, say, a public passenger vehicle, be it a taxi, bus, train or ferry. It is essential that these people be screened to the highest degree to prevent any opportunity for them to commit another offence, particularly against a child. Our children have a right to be protected from predators and I only hope that this legislation will weed them out of our public transport system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071471"></A>
However, I also understand that there will be a change to the Transport Operations (Passenger Transport) Act 1994 that will allow people who, when a juvenile, had committed a child sex offence against a person of similar age and who has not reoffended to apply for exceptional circumstances considered by the chief executive to issue a public passenger vehicle licence. People who have committed such offences as a juvenile and have not reoffended do, I believe, deserve a second chance, and this amendment will allow them an opportunity to get that second chance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075038"></A>
When this legislation came in, the owner of a taxi fleet came to see me with one of his drivers who had been convicted of an offence at a very early age. I believe he was not much more than a juvenile; he was certainly only a teenager and he did go to jail. He had been successfully driving taxis for 20 years and was even given awards but he lost his licence. The owner and the driver realised that that was the legislation and they accepted it, but this amendment is good in that it gives certain people a second chance. The Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian should be in a situation to be able to advise the chief executive on these cases, and that is an important move. I am not aware whether the chief executive would be privy to court documents, but surely the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian would be well briefed on that individual and its advice would be very important.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075042"></A>
Public safety is the big issue here, and it is imperative. Since the introduction of security cameras in taxis several years ago, that level of safety has increased. However, these security cameras have created some logistical problems in regional areas, and I refer to the specific issue of downloading security images. A firm operating in my electorate recently had an incident occur in one of its vehicles. More specifically, an offender travelled in one of its vehicles after he had committed an offence. He was not a particularly smart criminal because he rang for the taxi on his mobile phone and the taxi took him to his destination, but his mobile phone was tracked from the taxi company’s records so the police knew that a taxi had picked him up. As I said, this was not a very smart criminal. The police had all of the evidence.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075043"></A>
However, the problem arose in that, because this is a rural area, the taxi company had to take the car off the road for half a day while waiting for the availability of a police officer to download the images required, because in this particular area there is only one qualified person who can download the images and he just circumstantially happened to be on leave and the computers had been taken back to Townsville. There is a time limit involved here, because I believe that security camera footage only has a life span of 36 hours before being replaced by other images. It was really only because the taxi owner was willing to take the car to Townsville to download the images and lose half a day’s work in the process from the goodness of his heart that the police were able to recover the images. It has been pointed out that, if there were an authorised organisation in these rural areas that could download the image in the immediate area, this would not have been a problem. I mention this for the minister to take note of because I have no doubt that circumstances do occur where this could happen in other regional areas. This particular situation did not involve danger to the taxidriver, but perhaps had there been an incident where the taxidriver could have been endangered and the police were unable to get those security images downloaded it would certainly be a rather upsetting situation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075050"></A>
With regard to the Transport Operations (Passenger Transport) Regulation 2005, this amendment bill moves to extend the power to suspend or cancel taxi licences. At the moment Queensland Transport has the ability to impose a $324 taxi industry security levy on taxis using secure taxi ranks. Very few of our taxi operators fail to pay--I understand that it is only about three in 3,000--but those few who do not are taken to court by the department in an effort to recoup the payment. The department has decided that it cannot wait for the court backlog to be cleared and wants the legislation changed to allow it to cancel or suspend a taxi’s licence for nonpayment. This is similar to those provisions it already has for the nonpayment of taxi licences or where the taxi licence holder has committed a disqualifying offence. This would appear to be quite a heavy-handed response for what is surely a reasonably minor problem, and I do have concerns about that part of the legislation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075057"></A>
The amendment of the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994, which moves to protect transport infrastructure from inappropriate development, is one of common sense. We often hear reports of residents who have moved to an area, say near an airport or port, who after having lived there for a while make complaints about the noise or traffic coming from the airport or port. These essential services need to be protected from any interference caused by developments in close proximity. This amendment forms a head of power for the transport department to impose requirements and restrictions on new development near transport infrastructure including ports, airports, rail freight and public transport activities to protect the public interest. Previously, restrictions on developments encroaching close to our transport infrastructure could be imposed through the Environmental Protection Agency.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075060"></A>
I agree that we do have to protect prior use and the effectiveness of our transport assets. The inclusion of ports in this legislation will have an effect and protect the Townsville port from any impositions that may be caused by the proposed development of the Townsville cruise ship terminal. The LNP raised the issue of prior use when the plans for the Townsville cruise ship terminal and residential development were floated, and this amendment shows we were right to raise those concerns. However, the encumbrances to be imposed by this legislation need to be extended to land title and not just planning schemes to further ensure the protection of our transport assets. Some of these assets are those that the government is in the process of trying to off-load--assets that of course are being sold to pay off this government’s monumental debt. Assets such as the Abbot Point Coal Terminal and the Queensland Rail above and below rail coal business, which are in line to be sold, should be kept in state hands as there are indicators that resources are on the increase, and selling those off one at a time cannot be justified.</Hansard-Body>

We note that Labor’s 2008 state platform document stated that privatisation of public enterprises should not be used to solve revenue problems of governments, and this government has gone against its own party and is willing to sell off these vital pieces of the state’s transport infrastructure. One only has to read the letters to the editor in our papers to see that this is not going down well with the public. Even in today’s <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 Labor’s State President, Andrew Dettmer, says that there could be irreparable damage done to Queensland through the privatisation of key assets. He went on to say that the government needs to listen to the people and called on the Premier to walk away from the $15 billion privatisation program. So this government is not only turning its back on the negative public opinion toward the sale of assets but turning its back on its own party. Key transport infrastructure needs to be kept in public hands and protected from any urban incursion. I certainly support the shadow minister, the member for Maroochydore, and her comments in her very well-reasoned approach to this bill and I am aware that she has some amendments. I commend this bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr KNUTH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Dalrymple--LNP) (4.57 pm): The Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill has been designed to amend a couple of bills to provide natural justice provisions for drivers of public passenger vehicles, protect transport infrastructure from inappropriate development, give extended powers to Queensland Transport to suspend or cancel taxi licences, extend powers for transport inspectors over high-occupancy vehicle lanes, and allow the better management of ships and port infrastructure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075070"></A>
While the provisions designed to prevent people convicted of particular crimes from receiving an authorisation to drive a public passenger vehicle have been amended over the years, these amendments seek to align the transport provisions for public transport drivers with the blue card child protection legislation. If the offence which has prohibited the driver from receiving an authorisation to drive occurred when they were under the age of 17, they have the opportunity to appeal on the grounds of exceptional circumstances. In doing this, the chief executive must take the child commissioner’s advice into consideration. If the child commissioner advises against the granting of a licence, there should be no licence granted. It should not be up to the chief executive officer to determine the result when the advice from the commissioner is negative. I can only hope that, as it is not specific in the amendments, common sense will prevail in this regard.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075073"></A>
These amendments also extend the powers of Queensland Transport to suspend or cancel a taxi licence. This has been included to force compliance with payment of a security levy--an extraordinary amendment considering that less than one per cent of licensed taxis were noncompliant. This amendment only affects secure taxi ranks implemented in city areas. However, there is little to no public transport in rural areas. Usually there are only a few taxis available in the area, if any at all.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075111"></A>
Unfortunately, in 2007 the only wheelchair-accessible maxi taxi in Charters Towers was taken out of service. The driver did not renew his licence because a different taxi licence was required for wheelchair-accessible vehicles, considerably reducing the value of that taxi licence. Additionally, the modification results in those vehicles becoming less financially viable for the owner and the driver. Unloading and loading passengers in a wheelchair takes extra time and drivers cannot charge for that extra time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075114"></A>
 There is a need for more incentives to encourage rural taxidrivers to provide wheelchair access to elderly and disabled passengers to ensure that the independence of the disabled and the elderly is not comprised. The service should be much more heavily subsidised to ensure that it remains in areas where there are no other options for public transport available. It would be appropriate to extend subsidies and extra incentives to rural taxi licensees to ensure that adequate and suitable services are provided. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075115"></A>
A member previously spoke about non-English speaking taxidrivers. I just cannot see the logic in employing non-English speaking taxidrivers to take people from A to B. I have been caught in circumstances where I could not understand what the taxidriver was saying. Half the time they do not even know where they are going. It was previously mentioned to me that a bloke who wanted to get from A to B had to ring up another taxi bloke who he knew personally to guide the taxidriver to where he wanted to go. I just cannot see the logic in employing non-English speaking taxidrivers. It does not matter where they come from; they just need to speak English. I think that is very important. That issue needs to be brought to the attention of the parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075116"></A>
This bill contains amendments to give transport inspectors powers in high-occupancy vehicle lanes. Although I acknowledge that this change will be implemented on a trial basis, there have been too many incidents where transport inspectors have been over the top with regard to policing regulations. The most contentious issues relate to logbook regulations to combat fatigue in truck drivers. There were complaints from drivers about the nitpicking, pedantic and condescending attitude that was adopted by transport inspectors and which was enforced by the state government. For example, I can recall a truck driver was to pick up a load of cattle from a station in Einasleigh and he was to be there at 10 o’clock. By the time he left Charters Towers it was four o’clock in the morning. He was picked up for scalies at the cemetery at Charters Towers. He was there for two hours. Then he was picked up at Greenvale. He was there for two hours and then he was picked up at The Lynd junction for an hour and a half. By the time he got to load the cattle it was two o’clock in the afternoon, which took him over his fatigue management timetable. So he could not participate in that trip. All of those factors should be taken into account. I wanted to bring that to the attention of the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (5.02 pm): I rise to speak to the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. I think the amendments in relation to ports are very important. They are particularly important to my electorate as it has a major port facility. The ability for Maritime Safety Queensland to direct ships in special circumstances is critically important. We have seen a number of emergency situations--not just in terms of maritime safety or vessel fatigue but also in relation to health matters--where it has been important that the powers of the Queensland government and its representatives are clear and that they have the power to direct a vessel. The majority of the vessels that come into the Gladstone port are registered overseas. So I think it is very important that this bill makes it clear that, in the interests of the public, in exceptional circumstances ships in a pilotage area can receive direction that may contradict the intent of the captain. I commend the minister for clarifying that power and enhancing that power in those special circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075123"></A>
As other speakers have said, the bill also reclassifies category A disqualifying offences to category B offences if the offender was a child, that is, under 17 years of age at the time of the offence. I am pleased that this clause provides only a review to allow that person to apply for an exceptional circumstances exemption, because there are some acts done by younger people that are quite heinous and they do not really deserve to have that past removed from influence on their future. But there are many young ones who do stupid things without recognising, at quite a young age, the long-term implications of their actions. Whilst this provision is not going to give them a carte blanche opportunity to ignore their past actions, it gives them the opportunity for the chief executive to review those actions and, in special circumstances, to allow them to get a licence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075124"></A>
There has been much talk about high-occupancy vehicle lanes. Gladstone does not have any, but I know that one of the things that is difficult with these HOV lanes is ensuring that there is adequate signage so that drivers who visit Brisbane infrequently can understand where those high-occupancy vehicle lanes are and the requirements of those lanes. So perhaps where there are traffic lights, because people are going to be stopped at those lights at various times, a sign can be put there so that they understand their obligations in relation to bus lanes and transit lanes. As I said, some people drive around Brisbane only once in a blue moon and the rules can change. Therefore, it is fairly easy for people who are from out of town and who come to Brisbane to be caught. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075125"></A>
I note that the trial is until 31 March 2011 or it could be extended by regulation to 2012. I have to say that I have some concerns about the powers that are being given to transport inspectors. I appreciate that we had a briefing on this matter. The clarification was made at that briefing that the powers will be exercised only between 6 am and 7 pm--mainly daylight hours--and also that these HOV lanes are in high-traffic areas. From my perspective, I think those two caveats make these new powers acceptable. I was very concerned about the prospect of people, particularly women, being pulled up at night by non-police officers. We have seen recent cases of very undesirable people impersonating police officers or other officers to try to get vehicles to stop. As I said, I am very concerned about anything that would make people, particularly women on their own, vulnerable to interception. However, as I said, the officers from the minister’s department made it clear that the powers can only be exercised between 6 am to 7 pm--by which time in the winter it will be dark--because that is the peak traffic period. Those officers also reinforced to me that it is in a high-traffic area, so there are a lot of people around and, therefore, hopefully people--women in particular--are not quite so vulnerable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075126"></A>
I hope the whole trial is completed before the minister makes a decision. We had a trial period for the implementation of tasers, which occurred in the time of the former police minister. The introduction of tasers occurred before the trial was finished. So the purpose of the trial was pretty much overridden. So it will be interesting to see the results of this trial. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075127"></A>
The legislation also deals with the impact of development on ports and the impact of ports on nearby habitation and other land uses. I commend the minister for those provisions. However, my only concern is that, if you get operators or administrators of a port who become conscious of the increased power that they can wield, they can require quite significant reduction of activity around the port for questionable reasons. I think the intent of the legislative changes are good. I am only overlaying the human factor on those changes, where people can get a little bit out of hand. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075128"></A>
It will be interesting to see how this legislation is applied. In Gladstone there are a lot of problems with fugitive light from the port. The development has lit up the skies. There is no shroud on any of the lights. I believe very firmly that the city of Gladstone and its surrounds are subjected to light pollution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079025"></A>
We used to have the youth group from church come out and look at the stars from our place, because we live well out of town. It is becoming noticeable that our ability to do that is diminishing because of the light from the port. We live 30 kilometres away from the port. I would love to see the Wiggins Island development and even the existing port facility have shrouds retrofitted to reduce the impact on the community. It will be interesting to see how these changes to legislation may influence better planning in terms of illuminating the port. Because the port works 24/7, it is essential that it is well illuminated, not only for its operation but also for the safety of workers there. But there also needs to be some work done to reduce the pollution impact. I thank the minister again for the briefing that was held on this bill. I note that the opposition has several amendments. I will be interested to hear more on the intent of those. I look forward to the minister’s summation. <Hansard-Speech-End>

I wish to talk about the amendment to the Maritime Safety Queensland Act 2002. This amendment removes the need for Maritime Safety Queensland to prepare a strategic plan as it will be covered under the Department of Transport and Main Roads’s strategic planning framework. In 2008 the Service Delivery and Performance Commission reviewed the then department of transport’s planning requirements and recommended that improvements could be made to its strategic planning framework. This highlights the government’s commitment to a cost-effective and robust Public Service. The Department of Transport and Main Roads is working to ensure that its strategic planning framework provides for strong corporate governance and accountability. As part of this process, the department has identified that the existing requirement for Maritime Safety Queensland to prepare a strategic plan is unnecessary and should be removed. The requirement for the department as a whole to prepare a corporate plan and annual report ensures a single coherent planning and reporting framework for the agency. </Hansard-Body>

The bill will amend the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 to correct cross-references to the Cairns Port Authority and the Port of Brisbane Corporation to be the Far North Queensland Ports Corporation Ltd and the Port of Brisbane Corporation Ltd. These amendments simply reflect name changes for the authorities and provide consistency with other legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079032"></A>
In particular, I wish to talk about an amendment that will allow the government to manage the operation of ships in pilotage areas in exceptional circumstances when the public interest requires it. The amendments to the Transport Operations (Marine Safety) Act 1994 provide for two related powers for the general manager of Maritime Safety Queensland. The powers will allow the general manager to direct the master of a ship to navigate or otherwise operate the ship in a specified way and direct a person in charge of a place, such as a marina, to allow a ship to berth there and grant access to the ship.</Hansard-Body>

These amendments stem from the difficulties experienced by the state in dealing with the cruise ship <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Dawn</Hansard-Italic>
 when it entered Queensland waters earlier this year. Queensland Health confirmed on Thursday, 28 May 2009 that three crew members on the cruise liner <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Dawn</Hansard-Italic>
 had tested positive to swine influenza. Based on this advice, the Queensland government and Commonwealth and state experts contacted P&amp;O. P&amp;O was requested not to dock the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Dawn</Hansard-Italic>
 at Cairns or Port Douglas but to return to Brisbane and Sydney. This was a precautionary measure to minimise the risk of the virus spreading through Queensland’s tourist centres and was consistent with Australia’s national strategy of containment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079034"></A>
Currently our maritime legislation does not enable an authority to take direct action in such circumstances. The transport minister could direct the chief executive, who in turn could direct a harbourmaster to take action. However, this process does not allow for timely responses to possible emergency situations when there is no threat to marine safety. I acknowledge that if the powers were used in a similar situation there would be impacts on the ship owners, the crew, the passengers and, where necessary, the owner or operator of a place where the ship may berth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079035"></A>
The need to be able to manage such situations in a timely way and indeed in a way that minimises risks to the wider community is very real. It should be stressed that such powers would not be exercised lightly. I remind the House that these powers would only be enlivened when there was an exceptional circumstance and the public interest demanded action. This government is committed to protecting the maritime industry and the health of the community. Such powers enable us to do so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079036"></A>
The amendments will allow the government to act decisively to manage ships within the Queensland pilotage areas during circumstances such as a health crisis or natural disaster. They will also enable Maritime Safety Queensland to manage maritime operations efficiently to ensure that the public interest is protected. The minister has displayed great foresight and ability to integrate policy in putting these amendments together and I commend this bill to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

(5.16 pm): I rise in support of the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. In particular I would like to talk about the amendments to the Transport Planning and Coordination Act 1994 and the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 that are designed to protect the Queensland community from adverse impacts of noise and other environmental emissions from transport infrastructure. The amendments will also protect the operational integrity of Queensland’s transport system and clarify the government’s obligations regarding the operation of transport infrastructure. I will speak first to the amendments for amenity issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079040"></A>
Queensland is in the middle of a sustained period of population growth. This growth has placed land at a premium and resulted in increasing levels of development encroachment around port facilities and freight railways. Additionally, in urban areas the government has adopted planning strategies to manage population growth by locating housing, jobs, services and activities in close proximity to public transport to maximise land use efficiencies by achieving increased integration between transport and land use. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079041"></A>
However, transport infrastructure, in the course of its normal operation, produces environmental emissions with the potential to impact on community health and wellbeing. As development intensity surrounding operating transport infrastructure increases, so, too, does the potential for community health and wellbeing to be impacted by environmental emissions such as noise, dust and light. It is crucial that the government is able to protect landowners and the users while maintaining the operational integrity and safety of transport infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079042"></A>
The amendments proposed in this bill will allow the Department of Transport and Main Roads to place conditions on development applications to ensure that developers incorporate measures that mitigate the impacts of environmental emissions from transport infrastructure. The amendments will ensure that impacts on the health and wellbeing of a development’s occupiers or users which result from locating development on land affected by environmental emissions from public transport, freight rail and ports are adequately mitigated. For example, such a condition could include a requirement for a developer to mitigate noise emissions from an operating railway by facing living areas away from the railway and perhaps installing double glazed windows. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090281"></A>
I will now talk to the amendments that clarify the government’s obligations about the operation of government supported transport infrastructure and insert provisions to recognise transport infrastructure as a beneficial asset. The bill proposes to clarify the government’s current obligations with regard to the construction, maintenance and operation of government supported transport infrastructure and inserts a new requirement to ensure that those activities are undertaken in a manner that reduces impacts on the environment. These amendments will enable practices, management strategies and benchmarks that are developed in Queensland to be recognised as best practice approaches for the construction, maintenance and operation of transport infrastructure and ensure that such activities are done in a way to minimise the impact on the environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086235"></A>
The bill also includes important amendments to reflect that, in managing transport generated emissions such as noise from a busway, the government must balance the need to reduce environmental impacts with the need to provide an efficient transport network. These amendments ensure that transport infrastructure subject to community complaint regarding environmental emissions, such as the level of light or noise, is able to continue to operate due to the economic, social or environmental benefits it provides to the community. These amendments make an important contribution to achieving the government’s strategic plans and policies for shaping liveable Queensland communities. </Hansard-Body>

Like my colleagues, it would be remiss of me to miss this chance to mention a matter close to the heart of my electorate.

 (Mount Ommaney--ALP) (5.20 pm): I rise in support of the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. In particular, I would like to talk about amendments to the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 that are designed to protect the Queensland community from adverse noise and other environmental emissions along railway corridors. Queensland’s freight and passenger railway corridors play a critical role in supporting the economic and social wellbeing of our state. However, railway transport infrastructure, in the course of its normal operation, produces environmental emissions. Those emissions, which can include noise, dust, vibration and light, have the potential to impact on community health and wellbeing if not properly mitigated. Those emissions can give rise to public complaints, which can lead to operational limitations and loss of efficiency on our rail network. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086240"></A>
In the electorate of Mount Ommaney there are three railway stations, two of which have been recently upgraded and one is currently being upgraded. There have been many occasions when neighbours have lodged complaints with me, as their local member, regarding noise and amenity issues. I have worked with QR and TrackStar in an attempt to address those individual concerns. It is important to strike a balance between the efficiencies of the transport network, which is so important to our economy, and the wellbeing of our communities. It is also important that the government has the necessary mechanisms to protect communities located adjacent to railway corridors, while also maintaining the operational integrity and safety of railway infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086242"></A>
The amendments proposed by the bill to section 258 of the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 will allow the Department of Transport and Main Roads to ensure environmental emissions from railway infrastructure are considered during planning and development. The Department of Transport and Main Roads is a concurrence agency under the Integrated Planning Act 1997 for development proposed adjacent to railway infrastructure. These amendments mean that when a development application is triggered, the department will be able to place a condition on the application requiring the development to mitigate the environmental emissions from the railway. The amendments will ensure that impacts on the health and wellbeing of a new development’s occupiers or users that result from environmental emissions from freight and passenger rail are adequately protected. In addition to ensuring community health and wellbeing, which is very important, these amendments will also protect the operational integrity of Queensland’s railway network. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr HORAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba South--LNP) (5.23 pm): This is an omnibus bill covering a number of aspects of transport. I want to speak about the issues of transport-generated environmental emissions, the disqualification of drivers and the trial of high-occupancy vehicle lanes. Other speakers, mostly from my area, have spoken about some of the problems associated with the Toowoomba bypass road and, more particularly, the fact that there is no such road. In her second reading speech the minister talked about how often people built their homes close to public transport facilities that were handy for travelling to town. I grew up in Brisbane and I remember that most of the good homes were situated along main roads and close to tram stops, particularly on Beaudesert Road, Ipswich Road and the like. We used to admire those houses. Nowadays, people cannot get far enough away from those corridors because of the intensity of the traffic that uses them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086247"></A>
In Toowoomba, James Street forms part of the Warrego Highway. It is the heaviest freight-carrying road in Australia. Every day, 4,000 B-doubles travel down that street, carrying freight to the north and south of Australia. In recent times the volume of traffic has greatly increased because of the massive amount of coal that is being carted by road, particularly from Acland but also potentially from further west, because Queensland Rail is unable to carry it. Massive amounts of grain--up to 10,000 tonnes a day--are carted through this main east-west street of Toowoomba because Queensland Rail cannot carry it on its trains. In addition, recently Everald Compton announced the imminent start of the border railway, which will be a four foot, 8 inch line running from the Boggabilla area up to Charlton in Toowoomba. That will mean the development of a major freight terminal on the western side of Toowoomba, which will mean more and more trucks travelling through the centre of Toowoomba. One day that freight terminal could well develop into the Singapore of eastern Australia, if the dream eventuates of the Australian inland railway continuing through to Gladstone and maybe one day to Darwin. It would be far cheaper and more efficient for containers to go to either of those ports to be double stacked onto very long trains, so that they do not have to deal with the problem of bridges and so forth closer to the cities. It would be a very efficient system of major bulk cartage. Of course, the trucks also cart cattle to major processing works in the Dinmore, Beenleigh and Brisbane areas. Therefore, James Street, and also Tor Street and Taylor Street, which is mostly residential, have to cope with a massive amount of transport. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086254"></A>
However, the problem is not just the volume of transport; those trucks have to negotiate 16 sets of traffic lights and some of those traffic lights are on steep inclines. The trucks have to pass a primary school and a secondary school. The secondary school sits on an intersection where there are traffic lights. The trucks travelling from west to east are always loaded. If they stop at the lights at that intersection, they have to take off from a standing start and probably change through about 12 sets of gears before they can get up the hill. This has become a series problem. It is a social blight on our city. It makes it very difficult for people to traverse the main east-west route of the city, particularly mothers taking their kids to school. James Street is an important access road to a number of schools. If you are in a little car, jammed between B-doubles carrying cattle, grain, coal and general freight, it can be quite frightening. At any time in James Street, if you stand at the traffic lights you will see six or eight B-doubles on either side of the lights. They only make it through to the second set of lights and have to stop again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086255"></A>
In terms of the generated environmental emissions through our city, this is a big concern. Some people are also worried about Q fever, as urine can splash from the cattle trucks that stop at the lights or attempt to take off on steep inclines. It is not only a social blight. There are other issues. There is a problem with the noise caused by jay brakes. When trucks travelling from west to east get to the top of the range, they have to apply proper breaking so that they can crawl down the range at a safe speed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086257"></A>
In this parliament I have probably spoken over 30 times about this road, which is the most important road in Australia. It carries 70 per cent of the exports that go to the Brisbane port. The goods that generate so much for our state travel through the main street of Toowoomba, passing through 16 sets of traffic lights. It behoves the federal government to put forward money for this bypass road. It is a nation-building exercise, because the produce from the north and the south of this country is carried on this road. I join with my colleague the member for Toowoomba North, who spoke on this issue during the debate on this bill, in saying that this bypass is not only a Commonwealth matter. It is very important that the state recognises its importance. Under the national infrastructure fund, the state government determines the priority of a project. This road will only be built if it is given No. 1 priority. It is always in the top 10, but it never gets the money because top 10 is not enough. It will not get there. It has to be No. 1 or it will never get there. I hope that the Queensland government can make it the No. 1 priority because that is the only way that this project will ever come to fruition. </Hansard-Body>

Another important transport issue that I would like to touch on is the fact that, whilst Toowoomba is on the edge of South-East Queensland, people in Toowoomba--particularly pensioners and people who need to use public transport to visit relations or attend medical appointments in the south-east--are unable to access the go card. The go card should be extended to Toowoomba so that those people who catch the bus from Toowoomba to one of the intermediary stops, such as Gatton or Ipswich, could then use the go card to get on the train and go to where they want to go--visit relations, go to hospitals, attend medical appointments and so forth. They could also use the go card to get a bus service that connects to the Queensland Rail service that runs to Helidon. It is not actually a train; it is a bus but it goes under the generic name of Queensland Rail. So the go card would be very important to people in those circumstances. </Hansard-Body>

I mentioned the two schools that the 4,000 B-doubles go past each day. They also go past a cathedral and they go through parts of the CBD. It is very difficult for people to do business along James Street because of the sheer vibration from the trucks taking off at each of the 16 sets of lights. The road is falling apart before our very eyes. With a freight weight of that dimension, stopping and starting at lights and turning the corner from Tor Street into Taylor Street, you can imagine the damage that occurs. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1086305"></A>
Another issue in this bill is about those people who have been disqualified to hold a public transport driver authorisation because of a previous offence. A number of members have spoken about this. I certainly hope that we do not have any weakening of arrangements. It is a big responsibility to drive a public transport vehicle, particularly when very often children and families travel in those vehicles. I just wonder how many cases there are. Are we looking at just a handful of cases that bob up? Is it that important that it has to be included in this legislation? There was mention of the fact that someone who has been involved in some form of sexual offence when they were under 17 can make application to have the exceptional circumstances around that considered. But I do not want to see any weakening of these arrangements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086306"></A>
One of the things about transgressing and committing an offence, whether you do it in your youth or when over 17, is that people have to understand that there are ramifications and implications and a punishment system. It is not as though life after the offence is easy. There are these difficulties. Our shadow minister will move an amendment with regard to this so that there is not simply a reference to consulting with the children’s commissioner. The amendment provides that if the children’s commissioner advises against the public transport driver’s licence being provided in the exceptional circumstances then that licence is not given. I commend our shadow minister for that particular amendment, which I think will strengthen this issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086307"></A>
We do not want to send the message that you can commit an offence and because you have committed an offence you just run along and get some sort of absolution that will allow you to drive public transport vehicles in the future. We have to look at the heavy responsibility of driving public transport vehicles. We want people with as good a reputation and as good a past history as possible, whilst applying some degree of natural justice but under very strong and careful scrutiny. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086308"></A>
This bill also provides for a trial for public transport inspectors to undertake enforcement of high-occupancy vehicle lanes. I have a lot of personal concern about providing powers that would normally be provided to police to other people to travel the roads and pull people up. I think that sort of power should remain with the police and only the police. Very often when police pull people up for committing an offence--they might be speeding or they might be in the incorrect transit lane--they check other things as well. They might check the tyres. They might check the licence. They might check whether they are carrying anything that they should not be carrying, such as a weapon or drugs or other things. It might be matters to do with the muffler. As occasionally happens, when they check the person they find out that the person is wanted for some other reason. It might be a SPER offence payment or so forth. I have great concern about providing police powers to transport inspectors who normally are involved with heavy vehicles, with issues of the weight load that is being carried and all of the quite complex rules involved with heavy transport. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086309"></A>
There has to be some danger involved in this because multi-occupancy lanes, which are designed for cars carrying three or four people or at least more than one person, are generally in the centre of the road. So, if it is a six-lane road, these lanes are in the centre. The minister might be able to explain this. Are these transport inspectors going to be driving in a patrol car? </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1086328"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HORAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I was right, then; the lanes are in the middle. The transport inspectors are going to have to chase cars in those lanes. In the middle of peak-hour traffic they are going to have to put the flashing lights and the siren on. Someone will look in their rear-vision mirror and they will not see a blue-and-white police car; they will see a maroon or whatever colour transport car and they will be saying, ‘What the hell is this? Is it just the ambulance? Do I move over?’ They are going to be forced to move over through two lanes of traffic. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086329"></A>
I also make the suggestion that in this day and age of technology, and seeing that these lanes are in set areas on some of the busiest highways in the south-east, a camera type system would be able to do the job probably better. There are sophisticated cameras available these days. At the Sydney Olympics they were able to read the name tags on people from 2,000 feet up in helicopters with the sophisticated cameras that they had. A camera set up in the middle of the road, in the protected area where there are concrete buffers, and set at the right height that it could record vision of the number of occupants in a car--something similar to a speed camera--would do the job safely and probably more efficiently. With such a shortage of transport inspectors, they could then be freed up to do their other particular tasks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086331"></A>
I will conclude by saying that this issue of trucks travelling through the city of Toowoomba has become horrendous. No other city in Australia has to cope with it. I hope that the transport minister, along with others, can put forward the case for the Toowoomba bypass road because it is so important to South-East Queensland, to the people of Toowoomba and to Western Queensland. The No. 1 priority should be this bypass being built. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. RG NOLAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.40 pm), in reply: I thank all honourable members for this transport debate, both in terms of the quality of its content--I think members have made genuine contributions about both the broad policy issues and their local electorate issues--and the manner in which it has been conducted. I do not propose to sum up for a great deal of time, but I will run through both the broad themes of this debate and respond to the specific points which members have raised.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086368"></A>
It seems to me there was very strong support for the measures in the bill that aim to protect the integrity of the public transport network, particularly from future complaint by neighbouring residents. In listening to this debate, I heard a strong sense of frustration from members on both sides of the House about people who in many cases move next door to transport infrastructure and then set about complaining about the noise and the amenity impact of that very transport infrastructure. I think this is a frustration which all of us as parliamentarians share. It is an outrageous thing to do to move next to a railway line, a busway corridor or whatever it might be, to buy there either because you wanted access to the transport infrastructure or because the property was cheap and then set about complaining about the noise either by having a curfew introduced or by demanding that taxpayers fund some kind of mitigation measure to minimise the impact on you. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086369"></A>
It is clear to me that that frustration is by no means a partisan one. It is one which all members of parliament, that is, I think by definition people who have the public interest at heart, have genuinely expressed here. So I was really pleased to hear that strong level of support for the measures in this bill which aim to make it clear that the transport infrastructure was here first and its integrity, be it a port, an airport, a railway line or a busway, will as a matter of priority be protected.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086370"></A>
There was also strong and I think bipartisan support for the fairly minor changes that we are making to move some offences from category A offences to category B offences in order to give the chief executive of my department in some quite narrowly defined cases discretion as to who would qualify for a driver authorisation--that is, to be a taxidriver or a bus driver. All members of parliament expressed their understanding of the rationale for the changes that we are making, but there was a very strong sense that we would not want to go down the path of loosening the restrictions that are placed on people in the interests of public protection. I think there was a strong bipartisan view about that. I give notice that the government will accept the amendments proposed by the member for Maroochydore on that matter.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086372"></A>
There were two points in this debate on which I think it is fair to say there was a difference of view from the two sides of the House. The first of those related to the government’s proposed trial through which we propose to give transport inspectors the ability to monitor compliance and pull people over if they are not compliant with the high-occupancy vehicle lanes. I understand that the member for Maroochydore has flagged that the opposition will oppose that provision. I indicate that the government absolutely stands by the idea that we will trial transport inspectors monitoring high-occupancy vehicle lanes because we believe that high-occupancy vehicle lanes form an integral part of a modern transport network. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086373"></A>
The LNP in this state have not been as strong in their commitment to high-occupancy vehicle lanes as has the state Labor government. For instance, when the honourable Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Campbell Newman, was first elected to that post in 2004 one of his very first acts was to remove the high-occupancy vehicle lanes on Bowen Bridge Road, Ann Street and Coronation Drive. This government has always argued that high-occupancy vehicle lanes form an integral part of an efficient road transport network. We believe that that efficiency can be further improved by taking this further step to ensure compliance with them. I will talk about this in a little more detail later, but we believe that transport inspectors are well qualified to ensure compliance with them, and so we will test that proposition by running a trial in the next little while. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086376"></A>
The other matter in this debate on which there was some difference of view was the government’s proposal contained in this bill to collect the secure taxi rank levy by suspending the taxi licences of those people who fail to pay. I note the opposition’s view that such an approach would be ‘heavy-handed’, I think were the words of the member for Maroochydore. The government disagrees. The Labor government has established 25 secure taxi ranks across the state. We have done that to ensure the safety of taxidrivers and their patrons, particularly around drinking venues late at night. The secure taxi rank gets people into an orderly queue rather than having them fall into the cab at all points down the street in the Valley. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086378"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Reeves:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 It works well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086379"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the member for Mansfield. These secure taxi ranks have worked really effectively in ensuring orderliness in the community and public safety, but they do have to be paid for. I think it is appropriate and accepted that taxi licence holders pay for them through a levy, which currently stands at $324.10. As members have acknowledged, the vast majority of people have quite happily paid up. I think there are four people outstanding at present. The question here is: given that everyone should pay their way, how best does government recover those funds from the very small number of people who are holding out? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086380"></A>
Our aim is not to be heavy-handed. Our view is simply that we have a mechanism available to us in that we provide these people with a taxi licence, and that using the power which we propose is simply administratively not unreasonable and much simpler than pursuing people through the courts. So that is our rationale for standing up here today for the measure proposed in this bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086381"></A>
I will run through the remainder of points which were raised in this debate. The member for Maroochydore spoke about criminal history standards in the taxi industry broadly and asked that the current move to national standards should not water down Queensland’s strong criminal history standards. I assure her that we have absolutely no intention of reducing standards for Queensland taxidrivers through the current national process. This is a process in which this state has been very actively involved. The member for Gregory and a few other members also raised this issue, and so I make these points in part in response to those comments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090457"></A>
There is a degree of concern about the quality of driver standards in our taxi industry. It is a concern that has recently come up in Cairns but usually comes up in Brisbane. The complaint that I hear is that some drivers do not communicate particularly well in English and that some drivers do not know their way around very well. In response to that, some months ago I announced quite a comprehensive package of reforms in the taxi industry. Some parts of that have already been enacted. For instance, a taxi compliance unit has been established within the Department of Transport and Main Roads and we have stepped up our compliance checks around things like the roadworthiness of vehicles and checking that taxidrivers are properly authorised. Those increased inspections are already taking place.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090462"></A>
On 1 November I introduced two changes. The first is that all taxidrivers have to be 20 years or older before they can gain a taxidriver authorisation. The second and more significant of those was that from 1 November it is now the case that people have to have a year’s experience driving on Australian roads before they can qualify for a taxidriver authorisation in this state. I think that that will go quite a significant way to addressing this issue that I hear about people who are clearly inexperienced on Australian roads and in some cases do not know their way around. They will have to have a substantial body of experience in driving on Australian roads before they can be a taxidriver. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090463"></A>
The next phase of reform, which is happening at a national level and to which the member for Maroochydore refers, is that from mid next year there will be national standards for taxidriver training and national standards for English language proficiency. Those changes were discussed last week at the Australian Transport Council. I think it makes perfect sense that the standard of a taxidriver should be consistent right across the country. However, I concur with the member for Maroochydore that there should not be any move to water down our standards to reach a lower common denominator. I confirm that that is certainly not our intention. I think that the change that we will see will be a positive one for people who get around in taxis, as most of us do at some time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090465"></A>
In supporting the changes to protect the integrity of public transport infrastructure, the member for Maroochydore made some comments about similar processes for truck freight, and I want to formally respond to that. The government entirely acknowledges the absolutely crucial role that road freight plays in this state. Efficient road freight movement is crucial to industry and commercial productivity as well as the future economic development and growth of the state’s regions. In recognition of that importance, we have made a conscious decision to work with local governments through regional planning processes to strategically identify and preserve future freight transport corridors, both road and rail, and ensure better integration between transport and land use planning. For example, in the south-east the government has developed the South East Queensland Regional Freight Network Strategy to inform local area planning and land use schemes. This will enable local governments to identify and protect urban routes that support freight movements and guide development activities that support economic development adjacent to these routes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090468"></A>
In addition--and I think this is cutting to the chase of the issue of the member for Maroochydore--the majority of designated truck freight routes in Queensland coincide with state controlled roads. The Department of Transport and Main Roads is a concurrence agency under the Integrated Planning Act for development on land that is contiguous to a state controlled road. This means that development applications on land adjacent to designated freight routes will be triggered to the department and conditions can be placed on the development approval to ensure that the safety and operational integrity of the freight network is protected. The bottom line with that is that, while I am not the Minister for Main Roads, roads do have a similar process to condition development to that proposed for public transport infrastructure in this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090471"></A>
The member for Maroochydore also raised the point that, given that we are seeking to protect the integrity of airports as a form of transport infrastructure, we might consider placing some kind of notation on the title of properties which, for instance, lie in flight paths. I will also respond quite specifically to that. The answer is that the government is making some progress on this issue. Currently before the House, the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 includes amendments to the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 to enable the chief executive of my department to give the Registrar of Titles a written notice about land within a transport corridor. The explanatory notes for this amendment advise that the intent of these notices is to inform property owners and potential purchasers that a property is affected by road or rail traffic noise and may be subject to additional building assessment provisions. I think that cuts to the heart of the issue which I started on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090475"></A>
It is generally pretty unbelievable when people move next door to a railway line and say, ‘You’re kidding. There’s a railway line which is very noisy and this is really impacting on my ability to sleep.’ Rather than just expressing outrage about that, government is also taking steps to establish a formal process so that people will be aware and so that they know upfront that government has the ability to condition their development, for instance, by telling people to point the veranda away from the railway line and not towards it or to perhaps double glaze the windows so people cannot move in and complain about it later. We are taking steps to ensure that any future complaints that are made will not jeopardise the integrity of our transport network. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090476"></A>
The member for Maroochydore supported the new powers which we are creating to direct ships as a result of the swine flu incident with the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Dawn</Hansard-Italic>
 and asked that I give a guarantee that those powers to direct ships only where the direction would be both in the public interest and in exceptional circumstances will be used in that narrow way. I assure the member for Maroochydore that that is certainly government’s intention. That is why we have included a series of examples which reflect quite a narrow interpretation of the power. In drafting this it was not possible to be any more specific because, just as we did not envisage the swine flu on the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Dawn</Hansard-Italic>
, it is not possible to envisage any future circumstances in which this power might need to be used. However, it is our intention that it be narrowly used within that quite limited definition, and that is why we have included such examples. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090477"></A>
I will just run through a few members’ comments. I will not go through what everybody said. The member for Gaven, who was unfortunately shedding some doubt again on the LNP’s support for the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project today, did want to see in this transport bill provision for a second range crossing and the widening of a road at the Gold Coast and another at Innisfail. That was a big infrastructure ask from him. He also complained to some extent about the section of the Pacific Highway which the RAIN group had subsequently complained about. I would remind him, as I think the member for Gregory did in the debate, that the LNP built the road that created the noise that the people in his electorate do not like, not us. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090478"></A>
The member for Indooroopilly again raised some concerns about the Indooroopilly Railway Station and specifically the fact that there is a gap between the platform and the train. The member for Indooroopilly has been repeatedly advised but refuses to hear something that is actually quite simple, so I will explain it again. The reason that there is a gap between the platform and the train at Indooroopilly station is because Indooroopilly station is on a curve. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090507"></A>
Moving Indooroopilly station away from a curve would be a pretty serious undertaking, and we cannot make the platforms at Indooroopilly station any higher because it is also a freight route. If we did that, the freight trains or the coal trains would crash into the platform, and that would not be great in terms of maintaining the integrity and the performance of the public transport system. So the member for Indooroopilly is coming into this place continually demanding a change that, if we accepted the proposition that we have to have separate passenger platforms without curves right across the network, would cost many billions of dollars to implement. The real question here is this: is the member for Indooroopilly a rogue Barnaby Joyce style LNP member who refuses to listen when told the facts, or is straightening out every platform across the network LNP policy? It is either one or the other; it cannot possibly be both.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090510"></A>
The member for Toowoomba North raised publicly, as he has privately with me, his desire to see a bikeway to Highfields. As a keen cyclist myself, I again assure him that I am very committed to seeing bikeway infrastructure across this state. The member for Bundamba talked about growing up with transport noise and made the point, to paraphrase her, that it did not kill her. Given that I live 100 metres from a railway line, I am with her entirely. The railway line was there well before I was.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090515"></A>
A number of LNP members spoke in detail about their opposition to the high-occupancy vehicle lane trial, with transport inspectors enforcing the HOV lanes. I think the member for Nicklin responded to them perhaps as well as anyone could in that he said that he had been approached by transport inspectors who were keen to exercise this power. He said that they do a great job. As their responsible minister, I entirely agree. He made the point that it costs a lot of money to train police and therefore using alternative officers was a good idea. He noted that this was only a trial and he was very supportive of giving it a go. A number of government members made that same point, and the member for Gladstone had similar reflections on the matter. They are Independents and I will go with them. A number of government members were very actively supportive of that trial, reflecting this government’s longstanding commitment to not just building public transport and not just building active transport like the RBWH Cycle Centre, which I opened today, but also getting the best use out of our existing transport infrastructure such as HOV lanes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090520"></A>
I have already referred to the member for Gladstone, but she was concerned that a port authority might get a bit carried away in exercising a power to protect port infrastructure in future. I make the point to her that it is not the port authority itself which would have the power to condition developments near port infrastructure; it would be the Department of Transport and Main Roads. However, of course I would expect that the port--for instance, the Gladstone Ports Corporation--might make a submission arguing for the protection of that infrastructure, but that power would always be held centrally by government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090523"></A>
Finally, I note the member for Toowoomba South’s enthusiasm to see the TransLink network extended to Toowoomba so that people in Toowoomba could get into the system using their go card. Obviously the system has to end somewhere. It goes from Gympie in the north down to the Tweed and out to Helidon. I note what the member for Toowoomba South has had to say in that he wants to be in it, too. The go card is a very high-quality product, and I only wish that all LNP members had been quite so enthusiastic in their support for it.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms SIMPSON</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (6.05 pm): Firstly with regard to obligations about government supported transport infrastructure, I ask the minister to advise why the concept of beneficial assets was removed from the Environmental Protection (Noise) Policy in 1998, requiring it to be placed in this legislation? I note that in the explanatory notes there is a comment that Transport is the best place to administer this issue and I would appreciate the minister’s explanation as to the rationale.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I actually meant to respond to that in my summing-up, but there was a lot there. The thinking behind this was not, as the member suggested in her speech during the second reading debate, that there was any view on the part of the government that transport was not a public or social good. The thinking more simply was that the Department of Environment and Resource Management’s powers are better set up to deal with single-source pollution as opposed to something which comes from a broader transport network. My thinking as transport minister is similarly that we are more motivated than anyone to ensure the integrity from an operational perspective of the transport network.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (6.07 pm): In speaking to this clause, which addresses the impact of particular developments on railways, I want to particularly address one issue on the Sunshine Coast which some of my colleagues mentioned with regard to CAMCOS. This legislation before the House is looking at providing protections for impacts that a transport corridor may have, particularly where there is a pre-existing transport corridor, and also deals with conditioning on developers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090545"></A>
It is interesting to note that when the CAMCOS corridor was chosen, from Beerwah to Maroochydore on the Sunshine Coast, there was no protection of the land around the chosen station site on Plaza Parade. In fact, I would argue that some of the development options that council allowed to proceed on that location were not particularly compatible. This is not a question specifically to the minister, but I raise the issue that we recognise there have been corridors that still are not built on that did not in fact provide the appropriate protection around those station sites. As it happens, there is a proposal to change that particular location of the CAMCOS station into Maroochydore, so hopefully some of those issues will be addressed with the new corridor option which is being considered into the Horton Park Golf Club, a course which members are hoping to relocate in order to on-sell their existing golf course land which would open up the opportunity for the station site. I know that there has been a lot of work done with the department and with stakeholders involved in this issue, so I flag that as an issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094597"></A>
I also want to take the opportunity to address some wrong representations made by the government in regard to our position on CAMCOS and also the Gold Coast Rapid Transit. We have something in common with regard to the Gold Coast Rapid Transit. We support the concept of light rail in urban corridors where it is appropriate. The government copped flak over the Gold Coast Rapid Transit because it was looking at going from two urban hubs on the Gold Coast and initially in the sequencing was not linking it back with light rail directly to the heavy rail but was looking at rapid bus options and bus links back to the heavy rail. I did not criticise the government for that, because I understood that the rationale was the highest density options for light rail being sequenced first and then, when the passenger numbers were there for the other links, to then consider that. It is possible that, as that project proceeds, those who come on board may be able to bring forward those links back to heavy rail sooner--and that would be great--but I understand the government’s rationale.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094599"></A>
We used the same rationale when we released our CAMCOS initiative for the Sunshine Coast in regard to a light rail option instead of the heavy rail option between two of the hubs, Maroochydore and Caloundra. CAMCOS goes from Beerwah to Maroochydore on the map. That was intended to be heavy rail--or ultimately heavy rail in the planning options--but we put forward that there was a way to meet the needs of this region with a rapid public transport option on the Sunshine Coast to bring CAMCOS into the transport network sooner but to sequence it so that it went from the hospital, or from Caloundra, through to Maroochydore first as a light rail option with a bus link back to the heavy rail.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094600"></A>
Guess what? That is the same concept that the state government is using with the Gold Coast Rapid Transit. I know that the Deputy Premier misrepresented that plan as a railway line to nowhere. If that is the case, it is the same situation with the government’s version of the Gold Coast Rapid Transit. It recognises that light rail has a greater flexibility than heavy rail. I know that there may be some who still believe that heavy rail is the best option but, ultimately, I believe that it is important that we look at all ways of bringing on public transport in the fastest way possible, particularly in these areas that are growing rapidly and particularly in areas that also have other road transport needs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094601"></A>
In dealing with the CAMCOS issue, while I have the opportunity I will raise with the minister the proposed $6 billion worth of work in SEQIPP on the Sunshine Coast similar to the CAMCOS corridor--a multimodal corridor--and there is also CoastConnect. I believe that $6 billion to achieve what needs to occur in that area is probably unrealistic. There is a need to go back and look at the best way to achieve the public transport options. I would argue for a rapid transport option--and I certainly have a preference for light rail through that area--because we know that to try to move the numbers of people who are proposed at a cost of $6 billion is a little excessive. I want to see as much money spent in this area as possible, but I want to see it spent in a way that allows stages to be brought on and achieve the outcome of moving people to effective public transport sooner rather than having a pipedream, an unrealistic doubling up of two projects. I suspect that when those projects were put into SEQIPP they were counted twice in regard to areas that have an overlap in expenditure where they have a shared corridor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094604"></A>
So I flag that I would welcome a review of how that is delivered but, ultimately, as long as it provides an effective public transport network soon. A hospital is proposed to be built in that area. Yes, we have been critical of the construction of that hospital being pushed back by the government, but there needs to be a transport network to that site. Currently, there is a totally inadequate road network that will not provide a link. We believe that it is essential that the public transport link into the area is effective and addresses those needs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094605"></A>
I support the provisions that provide the opportunity to protect areas around the corridors of transport infrastructure. I recognise that these changes have been made because, as the minister said, there is increasing conflict with people moving next to existing corridors. But there is also a necessity to ensure that, in local government planning, we have compatible use around some of these hubs so that we get the best usage of that public transport mix, because not all development is necessarily the most compatible with public transport. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094606"></A>
I want to ask the minister a question in regard to clause 8. Could the minister provide details as to what conditions are likely to be placed on the developers under this provision? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094607"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will answer the first three points first. The member for Maroochydore made the point that we need to protect those sometimes incompatible uses next to transport infrastructure. All I can say is that, obviously, I entirely agree and I think it is something that we are getting better at, having refined this legislation now over a considerable period of time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094608"></A>
In relation to CAMCOS and Sunshine Coast issues, I am more than happy to consider the local knowledge of the member for Maroochydore and her thoughts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094609"></A>
Thirdly, in relation to the question specifically--what kind things would we ask someone who is developing property to do--the measures might be things like double glazing windows, insulation and vegetation buffers. We are obviously not going to put space-age, massively expensive requirements on developments. I used the example before of insisting that, for instance, verandas face away from the transport infrastructure and not towards it. So there would be a range of sensible requirements in relation to the colocation of buildings with transport infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094610"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I have a question in regard to the appeal provisions. Could the minister advise how that process will work and how the competing priorities of government and the private sector will be balanced? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (6.17 pm): This clause deals with the impact of particular development and port operations. I note that this clause confirms a policy that we are promoting in regard to concerns that a proposed development--the cruise terminal in Townsville--was accompanied by inappropriate development that may have impacted on the port’s ability to operate as a port. I understand from the briefing that the intention was that, with a port, a guideline will be issued and there will be subsequent plans that indicate a likely area of impact. That still has to be worked through. But it was a particular concern of ours. Townsville is a working port and even with sound amelioration, livestock ships come through there now and again and they are pretty ripe. You are going to get complaints if you allow certain types of development next door. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094617"></A>
There is also the issue that military ships come through there and explosives are unloaded. With the proposal that was previously being considered there was some talk of providing a buffer area, but the buffer area that was eventually proposed was still fudging it a bit in terms of the distances between some of those handling facilities. It was potentially not the optimum. I felt that it was difficult for port authorities. They may have private discussions with the government about their concerns, but these issues do not necessarily get expressed externally except by other stakeholders who are using those facilities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098561"></A>
It is absolutely essential that the department ensures that the public interest in the use of those facilities is maintained and not compromised by any of these potential options for development. I say on the record that we supported the concept of a cruise ship terminal. Our concern was that the mix of development that was part of the private sector’s proposal to fund that was inappropriate in relation to some of the residential components. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098564"></A>
With the guidelines that are coming through the Department of Infrastructure and Planning, I assume, what consideration will be given to the fact that some of those previous buffer zones for a place like Townsville were not rigorous enough and need to be reviewed for any future proposal for that site?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098565"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Sorry, I misled the member there. DTMR is leading the development of the guidelines with some input from the Department of Infrastructure and Planning. Obviously we will have to take into consideration pre-existing uses. We will not try to retrospectively plan out someone who is an existing neighbour. Townsville is probably the leading example in that regard. Generally speaking, though, with the ports we have an opportunity to ensure adequate buffers. Through the use of this power that is exactly what we will seek to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098566"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Further to that, I would appreciate it if the minister could outline what the process will be in regard to dealing with that. Will there be a zone that will indicate the buffer zone and what types of developments may or may not be allowed in that area? Is it a zone that is a trigger for the department to be involved as a referral agency? What will be the process going forward with some sort of buffer zone? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098567"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am advised that it will be similar to the state planning policy. As with airports, there will be zones created around the port infrastructure that will give some guidance about what can be done next door. Down the track, should someone want to build something in one of those zones it will come to DTMR as a concurrence agency. That is the point I was making in response to the concerns of the member for Gladstone. She was worried that the port would start conditioning people. That power will reside with DTMR as a concurrence agency.</Hansard-Body>

Ms SIMPSON </Hansard-Member-Up>
(6.23 pm): This clause covers a number of changes to the Transport Operations (Marine Safety) Act. In particular I refer to page 20 of the bill, subdivision 4, ‘Removal of watercraft’, and the provision that is in this amendment for the notice of intention to remove watercraft. This is always a contentious issue. I have waterways in my electorate, as do a number of my colleagues and members across the parliament. There are those areas that are fairly well controlled and if there is a hazardous watercraft then, generally speaking, the powers have been there to get rid of it. But what has absolutely been a pain in the neck and an eyesore are craft that are not necessarily a hazard but are dumped there because someone has run out of cash. They are an absolute eyesore and environmental pollution. It may not be an immediate hazard but it is in the process of breaking down. I can think of some in the Mooloolah River that have been an ongoing cause of complaint from concerned local residents. I see that this particular provision allows for an authorised person who reasonably believes that a watercraft is anchored or moored in contravention of a waterway transport management plan to give the watercraft’s owner or operator a notice of intention to remove the watercraft. Could the minister clarify that this is actually a new provision that is in addition to existing rules that strengthen the hands of transport officers to take action in these situations?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098572"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The simple answer to that is no. These powers already exist in the regulations to the bill. We are moving them into the primary legislation because that is consistent with more modern drafting practice. It is not a new power that is being created. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098573"></A>
In relation to the issue that the member raised, which does come up from time to time, about derelict vessels, it is not proposed at this time that we extend government’s power, through Maritime Safety Queensland or anybody else, to remove them. At the moment we have the power to remove derelict vessels if they are a shipping hazard or if they are a pollution risk. I am aware that there are other cases in which, as the member says, those vessels are an amenity issue. They might be an eyesore. It is not general practice at present to remove them, quite simply because doing so is very expensive. That is the bottom line. I reiterate that no extension of power specifically to deal with those cases is proposed through this legislative change. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098574"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I appreciate the minister’s clarification on this aspect. I have had discussions with some transport officers over specific vessels that have caused a lot of local angst in Mooloolaba. They are not necessarily a shipping hazard or leaching anything into the waterways but they are still an eyesore and they are abandoned. The advice that I received was that to remove them was a significant cost. I seek the minister’s advice as to whether there has been any examination of other jurisdictions on ways to better address this. If it was a vehicle that was dumped in a public park we would get rid of it. A lot of vessels are now being dumped in places where they are not an immediate hazard. They never go anywhere; they just stay there until they deteriorate and may potentially become a hazard later on. It is littering our waterways with ghost craft that have no owners anymore or owners who will not pay up to shift them. What is being done to investigate a better way to address this? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098575"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I understand the issue. I have recently asked the question about what else we can do. I am not sure what the practice is in other jurisdictions, although I would suspect that, given that we have the largest number of recreational vessels--lots more people with tinnies--it is probably more of an issue here than it is in other jurisdictions. It is sometimes the case that councils remove them and it is sometimes the case that members of the community remove them: everybody gets into it on Clean Up Australia Day. Some of these things can be removed without a professional effort. Sometimes it happens that way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098576"></A>
I acknowledge that that is not an answer to the member’s question. I have recently sought advice on this matter and turned my mind to what more we may be able to do. I would not want to give the member any kind of false hope that there is an easy solution to this. The reason we do not do it now is that, unlike an abandoned car next to a freeway, removing vessels would lead to quite a substantial occurrence of a new cost to the state. I am reluctant to do that in a way that is not fully thought through. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (7.30 pm): This clause relates to the general manager’s powers of direction for ships. It has arisen since recent issues involving swine flu, concerns about cruise ships and the powers of government to be able to direct them. I would like to raise a question with the minister relating specifically to compensation. The explanatory notes mention that compensation is not provided for ships in ports. The department advises that ships are covered by international insurance provisions. I ask: what provisions exist for ports that incur costs or losses as a result of such a direction from the general manager of Maritime Safety Queensland? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1102673"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The member is quite right: there are no compensation provisions proposed in these amendments. There are two reasons for that. The first is that, as we know from the recent <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 case, very comprehensive insurance schemes operate, something like a club, for the big shipping companies. There are pretty well established insurance provisions in their cases. The member is right: we could have sought to specify some kind of compensation scheme. As she suggested, in this case it would probably have related to ports rather than to ships. In what are essentially hypothetical cases at this stage, it would have been enormously onerous administratively to establish some kind of compensation scheme in these provisions. We certainly would not be seeking to use this power in a manner that is unreasonable. I think it would be going a little bit too far to seek to establish the provisions for a compensation scheme in cases that we have already determined are to be used narrowly in the public interest and in exceptional circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1102674"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Minister. I note the minister has said that this is to be used in exceptional circumstances and in the public interest, and that the intention is to construe it narrowly. However, it is very broadly written within the legislation. Therefore, there are some concerns that these terms could be interpreted broadly and inappropriately, even if that is not the intention of the legislation before us. I ask the minister to advise what consultation has been done with the maritime industry in regard to these provisions? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1102675"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am advised that consultation with industry on these provisions was limited. My recollection is that our frustration in dealing with the situation that arose with <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Dawn</Hansard-Italic>
 was certainly understood. That is not to say that at that time the change was flagged, but given that we expressed some frustration at our ability to manage that ship, I do not think it should come as an overwhelming surprise that the government has acted so that we have a provision should cases like that happen in the future. I genuinely do not think that there should be grounds for real concern on the part of port or shipping operators. The proposition here is that government wants to have a power up its sleeve should something pretty serious happen so that we can act in the public interest and in exceptional circumstances in future. I do not think that that is, in itself, an unreasonable proposition. Given that we do lots of stuff in the public interest, I do not think it is necessarily something around which we should establish a provision for compensation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1102676"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In relation to this clause, again I would like to ask the minister’s advice in regard to how this fits with international law and how it relates to other state jurisdictions around Australia. Has this been done elsewhere? Are there moves to ensure that there is some uniformity across Australia? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1102677"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am not an international maritime lawyer. Again as we know from the <Hansard-Italic>
Pacific Adventurer</Hansard-Italic>
 experience, there is a great deal of complexity around international maritime law and how it works. Giving you my generalist take on this, the relevant element of international maritime law is what is known as the right of innocent passage. We have sought advice as to whether this principle would breach that well-established international standard or element of international law. Our advice in that regard is no. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1102678"></A>
I cannot tell you what happens in other state jurisdictions, but it should be understood that the state’s ability to direct a ship, as I have already said, only exists in those narrow circumstances. It should also be understood that it only occurs when the ship is within our designated port pilotage areas. In a pilotage area it is not unusual for there to be very active interaction between the harbourmaster and the master of the ship. Therefore, it should not be thought that we are going to reach out the long arm of the law in some way that is totally without precedent in order to tell international vessels what to do. The power only exists within the pilotage area. Certainly it is an extension of power, but not one that is a huge overreach. I think it is fair to say that. </Hansard-Body>

 Explanatory notes to Ms Simpson’s amendments to the Transport and Other Legislation Amendment Bill [<HypertextLink>

I thank the minister for her willingness to accept this amendment proposed by the opposition. Our concern had been that it needed to be very clear that the views of the Commissioner for Children and Young People and Child Guardian were not only noted but were truly taken into account and that the chief executive officer of transport was not able to ignore them. Thus this provision seeks to ensure that the views of the Commissioner for Children and Young People and Child Guardian have that effect.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106649"></A>
There is no obligation under the bill otherwise for the chief executive to consult the Commissioner for Children and Young People and Child Guardian on exceptional circumstance decisions relating to the issue of public passenger drivers’ licences to people charged with child related crimes. Also, if the commissioner recommended that exceptional circumstances should not be granted, there was no impost that the chief executive must take this advice only that the advice should be taken into account. This amendment will require the chief executive to consult with the Commissioner for Children and Young People and Child Guardian on whether there is a case for exceptional circumstances and, further, to take that advice as being binding if the commission’s advice is that exceptional circumstances should not be granted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106652"></A>
It has been noted that there are only a few cases. I note that my colleague the member for Gregory relayed that he had struck this issue where there may be some exceptional circumstances. But I think we are in agreement across the House that this needs to be something that is very carefully monitored. We do not want people who are totally inappropriate to be driving public transport and to have driver authorisations that put them in a position of power or potentially in a position to abuse the trust of others due to inappropriate prior history. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106653"></A>
Under this amendment, if the commissioner’s advice is that exceptional circumstances should not be granted, the chief executive must take the Commissioner for Children and Young People and Child Guardian’s advice. If the commissioner does not provide advice in this matter or the advice is that there is a case for exceptional circumstances, the discretion for the decision remains with the chief executive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106655"></A>
I thank the minister for her willingness to accept this amendment and acknowledge that we share a desire to ensure that the strictest standards are maintained and that the appropriate safeguards are there. One way to ensure that is for the advice of the Commissioner for Children and Young People and Child Guardian to be binding. </Hansard-Body>

 I thank the member for Maroochydore for her amendment which, as I have said--and the member has acknowledged--the government is willing to accept. What this amendment does is take our existing matter of policy and practice, whereby the chief executive of the Department of Transport and Main Roads does seek and subsequently follow the advice of the children’s commissioner on these matters, and make that a matter of law. I think that that is a perfectly reasonable and acceptable amendment. As such, I thank the member for Maroochydore for the amendment and accept it. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (7.43 pm): This provision relates to extending the power to suspend or cancel a taxi service licence due to a taxi industry security levy not being paid. I will state up-front that we are in favour of this levy, as appropriately applied, for security on taxi ranks. It is a good policy to have security on taxi ranks. It is reasonable to have this levy in place. I know that it was an issue a number of years ago in my own area where we have nightclub districts and tourism precincts. There is a problem with not having appropriate security and so there is a need to be able to levy for this. So the principle of the security levy is one that we support. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106663"></A>
The concern that we have is whether it is an appropriate use of the government’s powers to suspend or in fact cancel a licence for the lack of payment of that security levy, considering that a taxi licence can cost $300,000 or $400,000. These are significant licences, so to suspend or cancel it can be quite an onerous measure. We have been advised by the department that there are only a few people who have failed to pay. The minister said it was about four. That may mean that more people have paid since the briefing we received. But there were seven nonpayments, totalling $2,000 out of around $2 million, referred to in the briefing a few weeks ago. Putting this recovery measure into the legislation seems to be an extremely onerous way to do it. As we have said, it is like using a sledgehammer to crack a peanut. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106665"></A>
The real problem here is with the courts and people’s ability generally to undertake debt recovery. What the government should be doing is looking at the issue of debt recovery across the broader community. What we are seeing is the government giving itself its own set of rules, which I think are over the top, when the rest of the community has to go through the court system that needs some attention to ensure that there is an appropriate debt recovery mechanism. It should not be expensive to go for debt recovery for these types of unpaid fines. That is the area that needs to be addressed. The mechanisms should be there. The courts should be enforcing it. If there is a problem there, that is what the government needs to fix, rather than having a provision where a person’s licence that they have paid $300,000 or $400,000 for can be taken off them for an unpaid fine that may amount to just over $300. Thus, we will be opposing this provision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106667"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I think we have essentially dealt with the issue of substance, but I make two points. The first is that the government is not aiming to be heavy-handed in introducing this provision. I acknowledge the member for Maroochydore’s endorsement of the Labor government’s introduction of secure taxi ranks across the state over the last few years. We agree that they are working well and improving public safety. I do not think anyone disagrees that it is reasonable that the taxi industry pays for them through the security levy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106669"></A>
There are a few hold-outs. My current advice is that four people have not paid their $324.10. What we are trying to do here is establish a simple administrative process to extract those funds from people who are benefiting from the taxi levy. It is notable that the opposition’s point is that this is an excessively heavy-handed use of a power and that government should do something else and should reform the debt collection process, which was the point that the member for Maroochydore made in her speech on the second reading. That is notable given that just a few weeks ago the government did make some substantial changes to our major debt collection process for state fines when we extended the provisions of the State Penalty Enforcement Register to allow government to suspend a person’s driver’s licence as a matter of policy for people who owed the state $5,000 or more. On that occasion, which is I think quite a clear parallel with this one, the government took action to improve the government’s debt collection processes and it applied only in cases where people had a substantial outstanding liability to the state--people who owed fines of more than $5,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106700"></A>
On that occasion what the opposition did was oppose the reform to our debt collection mechanisms. Here we are just a few weeks down the track and the opposition is saying, ‘You should do something better with those debt collection things,’ but once again in both cases it is not putting forward any mechanism to do that and, indeed, it is opposing the simple, clear-cut, no-nonsense administrative mechanism that government is proposing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106703"></A>
I appreciate the point that the member for Maroochydore is making. I acknowledge her opposition, but I would make the point that it is incumbent on the opposition, given that it would seem it so values recovery of debt to the state, to do better than to stamp its foot and say, ‘You people should try harder, and it is the vibe of the thing.’ </Hansard-Body>

Ms SIMPSON</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (7.58 pm): The LNP strongly supports both high-occupancy vehicle lanes and Queensland’s transport inspectors. However, we will be opposing this clause on two grounds. I am advised that there are no additional transport inspectors to be employed for this trial. These inspectors perform essential safety roles that should be given precedence over congestion enforcement. While we are also concerned that police officers’ valuable time is not taken on this enforcement, the shifting of the responsibility without additional resources is unacceptable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106712"></A>
It is interesting to note that we are not alone in this opinion or on what the motives of the government may actually be. The state transport union’s Hughie Williams labelled it a ‘cash grab’, and there are concerns in the community that this is just another way for the government to make a bit of money rather than direct these resources of transport inspectors to what their primary role should be, which is keeping people safe on the roads, ensuring that people are driving safe vehicles and that the freight network is safe. There are only 170 transport inspectors in Queensland, with just over 70 of these based in the south-east corner, where there are high-occupancy vehicle lanes. Stretching this even more to include another role is something that we believe is unacceptable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106715"></A>
The extension of this measure after dark means that the ability for transport inspectors to stop vehicles raises another issue. I understand also from the briefing that the guidelines are still being worked out to ensure that transport inspectors are operating on the same guidelines as the police. I might seek the minister’s advice in regard to the guidelines that will apply in this regard, but we understand that traditionally transport inspectors can only operate after dark when they have a police presence. This will mean they will be able to operate until 7 pm, when it is dark many times of the year, particularly in winter, without the presence of police. This is a serious concern. It is a matter of safety of the officers involved as to how this occurs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106716"></A>
While during the day it would be reasonable for drivers to clearly identify transport inspector vehicles, the same does not necessarily apply at night. This raises concerns for the public as to proper identification of people who are seeking to pull them over. We give police special rights in pulling people over for this reason. While transport inspectors do have this power during daylight hours for a very select number of purposes, this bill seeks to extend that even further. I believe there is not necessarily great awareness in some sections of the public as to these powers, and certainly their extension also becomes an issue. It is on these grounds that the LNP will be opposing this clause.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106741"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The government is strongly committed to the high-occupancy vehicle network because it encourages positive behaviour, it encourages people sharing vehicles, it encourages people catching buses and it is a really effective part of a well-functioning transport system. The thing with high-occupancy vehicle lanes is that people sometimes get frustrated because they see the HOV lane empty when they are sitting in a lane of traffic. There are, nonetheless, many really clear examples of high-occupancy vehicle lanes--notwithstanding that they do not look full--in fact carrying many more passengers per hour than do the car lanes because a car with three people does not take up any more space than a car with one. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106743"></A>
According to our most recent surveys, for instance, the HOV lanes on Adelaide, Queen and Wickham streets were all carrying more people than were the lanes next to them which were ordinary lanes, as were the ones on Mains Road, Waterworks Road and a number of others. Even though there is still more capacity in most of our HOV lanes, they are already working really well as part of a good public transport network. I acknowledge that the member for Maroochydore has said that, unlike everyone else in the LNP, she is supportive of the principle of HOV lanes. The question here then is: what is the most appropriate way to enforce compliance with those HOV lanes? The whole thing falls over if cars carrying one person start ducking into the transit lane. The whole system is undermined by that kind of behaviour. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106746"></A>
As I said in my summing-up, I do not think that I could say this any better than the member for Nicklin. Firstly, he said that he was confident in the skills and abilities of transport inspectors; secondly, he said--and the member for Everton made this point as well--surely there are higher order things that police should be prioritised to do; and, thirdly, both members made the point that this is only a trial and, on the face of it, it is really not a silly idea to give it a go. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106747"></A>
I appreciate the concern that some members have raised that it might seem unusual, particularly after dark, to be pulled over by a transport inspector rather than a police officer. We will be publicising this trial so that it should not come as an overwhelming shock to people. We are just trialling it for a period. We are currently looking at whether or not there is any further training that transport inspectors would have to do before undertaking this trial. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106748"></A>
However, in the debate there does seem to have been some misconception that perhaps it is a new thing for transport inspectors to pull over vehicles after dark. I want members to understand that that is not the case. Transport inspectors pull over both passenger vehicles and heavy vehicles all the time. It is not the case, as has sometimes been suggested, that they are just ‘scalies’, they are heavy vehicle inspectors and all of a sudden they are going to get a whole new role of pulling over passenger vehicles. That is not true. It is also not true that they do not currently pull over vehicles after dark. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106749"></A>
With all of those things in mind, this is not totally out of the realm of possibility. It is not that they have never done anything even remotely like this before; they will be skilled to do it. It does make for a better use of police resources and it is only a trial. This is hardly some kind of radical, adventurous move for government to take on. Given that this change will play such a fundamental role in ensuring the integrity of our high-occupancy vehicle network, I am disappointed that the opposition is choosing not to support it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106750"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The LNP opposition is not alone in its concern about this; the RACQ has expressed its concern about these provisions that the government is introducing. It has raised its concern that transport inspectors are better directed towards road safety issues than to policing such issues as congestion. There has also been concern expressed by Hughie Williams from the Transport Workers Union. We actually find ourselves in agreement with the Transport Workers Union on this issue. I think the minister was perhaps a little bit more alone in her enthusiasm than we are with regard to concern about this particular provision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106753"></A>
With regard to vehicles, the transport inspectors usually do operate with police after hours. That is not only an issue as to the recognition by the public of the role of transport inspectors and being unaware as to who is seeking to pull them over when they see the flashing lights; it is also a matter of security for transport inspectors. As has been mentioned, they have to have an understanding of safe ways of pulling people over at night and where to do that. The minister has just advised that they are looking at what training might be required for transport inspectors. The government is looking at the training and yet it has the legislation before the House and it has been announced that this trial is going to take place. If transport inspectors are going to be involved in pulling over cars after dark in areas with high-occupancy vehicle lanes, there have to be very clear guidelines to ensure that safety is maintained. It needs more than just looking at the training. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106754"></A>
In this respect, our concern remains that this is pulling transport inspectors off other higher duties that are, in fact, maintaining road safety, maintaining the safety of road users and certainly the safety of those vehicles. In fact, those concerns are shared by other august bodies such as the RACQ and, in fact, the Transport Workers Union.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HORAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As I mentioned in my speech during the second reading debate, these lanes are in the middle of the road--that is, they are on the right-hand side. We are going to have traffic officers playing the role of pursuit police. They are going to have flashing lights and sirens and everything else, and the bulk of this will happen during peak hours because the hours listed in this legislation specifically say that they are not going to do it when it is dark. Can you imagine on the M1, with six lanes or eight lanes, someone weaving in and out in the middle of the road to count how many people are in a car--whether it is two or three or whatever it is supposed to be--and then trying to draft them out by putting on their lights and get them across two or three lanes of traffic to the side of the road?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111328"></A>
This is only a trial, but it is going to have a lot of problems and it could easily cause accidents. The police are highly trained in pursuit. That is part of the expense of training police, because pursuit is dangerous and a pursuit on a motorway which has up to eight lanes where people are allowed to travel 100 kilometres an hour--when you are trying to draft out and seek people from the lanes right in the middle--is extremely dangerous. Our shadow minister is on the mark with this in that it has some serious problems. It is something that needs to be thought through more carefully. I made the comment about using electronic devices such as special cameras which can be used to detect numberplates like speed cameras. That would be not only sensible but also safer, because what we are proposing in this trial, quite frankly, is dangerous.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111331"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I think we might have gotten our wires crossed, member for Toowoomba South, in the conversation that we had across the chamber before, so let me explain how this will work. Some high-occupancy vehicle lanes like the ones on Waterworks Road to which the Minister for Climate Change referred to are on the footpath side of the road. Therefore, it is pretty easy to imagine how a transport inspector’s role would work in those cases in that they would stand to the side of the road and flag people down and pull them over. Sometimes, like on the M1, the transit lane is on the inside lane against the concrete barrier. In those cases, the transport inspectors would need to find a turnaround point, and from place to place on the M1 there are emergency vehicle turnaround points. Again, they would need to find a safe place to safely pull vehicles over.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111335"></A>
Earlier the member talked about using flashing lights and pursuing vehicles. It is not proposed that that is the kind of action that would be undertaken. So we would not have that scenario which the member outlined of the transport inspector with flashing lights pursuing a vehicle across many lanes. Instead, what transport inspectors would do and do now if they find a case that is beyond their powers--say, a vehicle takes off or they pull the vehicle over, for instance, for a roadworthiness check and then they find that they are concerned that the driver is drunk--is call police, who use all of those more mainstream police powers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111336"></A>
I would not want the member for Toowoomba South to get the idea that this was some kind of massive extension of a transport inspector’s powers. What they do now is sit by the side of the road and pull people over. They do that both for heavy vehicles and for passenger vehicles. That is exactly what is proposed in this case. The only change is that in this case it would not be for, for instance, concerns about roadworthiness; it would be that they were monitoring compliance with the rules of the high-occupancy vehicle lane. They do already have a world of training in how to pull people over safely, and of course they would exercise the training that they already have. However, it will be a little while before the trial starts and so we are conducting a review of that training to see if there is any further training that they need to do. But I have to say that this is not particularly different from what these transport inspectors do now and so I would not expect that there would be any kind of particularly significant change in the training that is provided to them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111338"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HORAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I think the bulk of these lanes and the bulk of the cars that use them would be on the M1 in terms of sheer numbers. I ask the minister to explain to the parliament how a transport officer sitting on the side of the road is going to get someone who is in the middle lane--and that could be four lanes across, because there are eight lanes or six lanes on that road--doing 100 kilometres an hour, amongst thousands and thousands of vehicles at peak hour, to pull over.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111339"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 They will use their professional judgement to examine safe and appropriate ways and means of doing this in exactly the same way as police do. The proposition that the member is putting is not that transport inspectors should not do it. If we follow the logic of what the member is arguing, he is saying that no-one should do it. I am saying to the member for Toowoomba South that we believe that transport inspectors can undertake this role as safely as police can, and that is the proposition that we intend to trial.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111340"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WELLINGTON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I want to put on the record the reason I am supporting this clause after having heard the comments made during debate on it. I want to make it very clear that at the moment when police apprehend someone they have very clear guidelines and requirements on how to undertake that action. Department of transport officers also have very clear requirements and guidelines on how they are to undertake their current enforcement action. I have no doubt that if this does become law there will be very clear guidelines for department of transport officers in how they are to act under this proposed trial of their extension of powers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111343"></A>
No-one would want to put anyone’s life at risk. At the moment department of transport officers do not act in inappropriate locations. With regard to where I have seen them undertaking their work, it is well lit and they are certainly very conscious of the need for safety for not just them but also the people using the roads, be they heavy-haulage operators or ordinary members of the public driving their vehicles on the roads. I reiterate that my support for this clause is on the basis that there will be very clear guidelines to make sure the department of transport officers who will possibly be undertaking these duties will know clearly where they are able to undertake these proposed enforcement duties and where they will not be able to.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I refer to the training of officers, and the minister has advised that the training is being reviewed to consider whether it is adequate for transport inspectors to take on this role which extends their powers with regard to pulling over vehicles in high-occupancy vehicle lanes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111368"></A>
An example has been given by my colleague the member for Toowoomba South, who raised concerns about some of the high-occupancy vehicle lanes that are in the centre lane where there is not really provision to pull people over safely to the side of road or there is a difficulty if the transport officers are on the opposite side of the road. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is right. There are very legitimate concerns about the provisions. Are the officers going to be stationary beside the road or are they going to be travelling in traffic behind vehicles and then pulling them over? These are reasonable questions to ask as to how these powers are going to be practically extended to transport officers into an area where they previously have not been operating. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111371"></A>
I have a question for the minister in regard to the training. The minister says that she is reviewing it. What money has been allocated to ensure the undertaking of this trial? What money has been allocated for officers in regard to this training? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111372"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I have explained already--and I think quite clearly--that the understanding of the member for Toowoomba South as to what is going to take place is incorrect. I have every confidence in the professionalism of the transport inspectors employed by the Department of Transport and Main Roads. This is what these people do. They pull vehicles over safely every day of the week. It is not an outlandish proposition that all of a sudden they will start pulling vehicles over. I have every confidence in those officers’ professional judgement in terms of what is a safe place to undertake this work. I am confident that this is what these guys do and they can do it in this case. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southern Downs--LNP) (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (8.31 pm): The State Penalties Enforcement and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 was introduced by the Attorney-General on 16 September, with the principal purpose to strengthen the compliance and enforcement capabilities of the State Penalties Enforcement Registry. This bill is an admission of failure on behalf of this Labor government to adequately manage unpaid fines collected in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111403"></A>
We are told that SPER has been highly successful in recovering and enforcing unpaid infringement notices and court ordered fines and penalties since the year 2000. Given that roughly 50 per cent of fines have been recovered, I find it a bit of a stretch to say that it is highly successful, particularly when now, after nine years and $250 million in outstanding fines is needing action, the government has moved to extend the powers of SPER. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115934"></A>
The Attorney-General in his new role acknowledges that tougher enforcement measures are needed to deal with the many people who thumb their nose at fines. When the original bill was introduced in 1999 we were promised that the new system would make it more difficult for offenders to avoid their fines through the new range of enforcement tools at SPER’s disposal. What we have seen is that despite existing powers to use enforcement warrants for seizure and sale of property, it has not had the resources or system in place to do so. In effect, we had spin and legislation but no effective government to actually implement the laws it introduced. What do we have now? A crackdown that is nothing more than a mad cash scramble. The government has had the tools in its kit to address these unpaid fines for the last 10 years. Instead it has let them build up and now that it is broke it is scrambling for cash wherever it can grab it. </Hansard-Body>

The proposed changes regarding cancelling of licences for non-traffic related fines have been described by the RACQ’s external relations manager, Gary Fites, as ‘inequitable’. Mr Fites said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115938"></A>
Where is the equity in that for people who don’t hold a licence or own a motor car? What do they do with those people? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1115939"></A>
Terry O’Gorman from the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties has also been critical, saying it was a harsh and disproportionate punishment. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1115943"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is very interesting that we have honourable members opposite spurning the whole notion that a civil libertarian may be wrong in their assertion on one hand yet we know that they are wracked with all sorts of internal strife when it comes to other civil liberties issues. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The more they squeal the more they admit that particular fact. What we have opposite is the Steven Bradbury of the Labor Party, the person making that particular dash for the Labor Party’s No. 1 position, getting more and more and more cocky. The member for Greenslopes is getting more and more cocky as he goes along. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I got there the first time. It didn’t take me three times. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115947"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Elected? Who knows what happened to his predecessor. That will probably never come out, will it, given some of the things that are floating around. Every court when considering whether to impose a fine should be required to consider any SPER debt and the offender’s capacity to pay and whether the imposition of yet another fine provides any deterrent to the offender. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115948"></A>
Clearly when an offender has thousands of dollars in SPER fines owing there is no deterrent in the imposition of further fines on an offender appearing before the court. Furthermore, it is vital that Queensland has an effective community services program as an alternative to fines whereby offenders can repay their debt through meaningful community work that gives back to the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115949"></A>
The bill outlines 10 objectives either to extend the intent of existing legislation as in the case of SPER or to correct drafting and other measures identified through the implementation of such legislation as the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal. The amendments in relation to unpaid fines under the State Penalties Enforcement Act 1999, whilst designed to enhance existing fine recovery methods, are an admission that certain elements of the existing fine recovery model were inadequate and failed to effectively recover unpaid fines. Many elements, such as the power to seize property, were in the existing legislation but either not used or did not extend enough to operate in practice. The amendments will allow vehicles to have their wheels clamped where debtors owe in excess of $5,000. It is said to be a last resort option. The proof as to whether this approach will actually be used remains to be seen. This government in the past has been more interested in the headline for such an initiative than actually implementing what it says. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115950"></A>
Further amendments will strengthen powers of seizure and sale of property for debtors who owe more than $1,000. The final amendments to the State Penalties Enforcement Act will allow the registry to use SMS technology to notify debtors prior to the suspension of their licence. This amendment is technical in nature and cannot be used as evidence of notification later should the debtor drive unlicensed whilst suspended by SPER. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115951"></A>
The bill amends the Industrial Relations Act and the State Penalties Enforcement Act to establish a referral to SPER for the recovery of unpaid wages. The normal civil processes will still be available to victims. This practice has already been occurring in some circumstances and this amendment formalises that process and recognises existing claims. This has a retrospective element and highlights that whilst in practice it was occurring, the legislation did not allow it and that it also may have been unlawful. Questions should be raised as to whether the retrospective nature is necessary and if it is more about the government trying to cover itself for acting unlawfully up until now on this particular matter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115952"></A>
The national exchange of criminal history information for people working with children is also covered in this bill. These amendments, whilst welcomed, are concerning in that they reveal a loophole in the current system that means some blue card holders may have attained approval when certain interstate information, if known at the time, would have excluded them. It is not clear if every single current blue card holder will be reassessed based on the new scheme or not and, if not, why not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115953"></A>
There are a number of amendments in the bill in relation to QCAT that amend the enabling legislation. I indicated when we put the QCAT legislation through this parliament only a few months ago that, given the extensive nature of it, it would not be very long before we would be back before this place to make some amendments on issues that have arisen and that is certainly what is facilitated here.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120401"></A>
The amendments will also confirm that judicial registrars can act as adjudicators under QCAT. Further amendments include conferring jurisdiction to QCAT from other bodies that were overlooked in the initial draft legislation. Further amendments to the judicial registrar program include extending the program from two to three years in Townsville and Southport, and also extending the powers of judicial registrars to hear certain matters. Registrars should not be substitutes for magistrates, but if this government continues to extend and expand its function, it could create a second class of judicial officer within the Magistrates Court. The answer to the current backlog is to appoint, on a merit basis, effective magistrates who are not factionally aligned to the Labor Party and who can perform the role efficiently to reduce the existing delays in the busiest court system in the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120405"></A>
The bill amends the Classification of Films Act in relation to the classification of film inspectors. With a machinery of government change, the Office of Fair Trading was moved from the justice department to the portfolio of the Minister for Tourism. The amendments will allow the appointment of qualified public servants to perform the role of inspectors under those acts and to facilitate the continuing use of Office of Fair Trading inspectors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120407"></A>
There are amendments to the Guardianship and Administration Act 2000. This amendment will allow persons to apply to the tribunal to review the appointment of an administrator. The bill also amends the Right to Information Act. These amendments clarify decisions that are able to be reviewed. This means that decisions to neither confirm nor deny are reviewable. The amendments will also mean that the information commissioner is not prevented from giving certain documents to parties to an external review. Recent RTI applications have proven that nothing has changed within the government. Instead of actioning an RTI application, the government--Premier and cabinet--has pushed back assessing it until January 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120410"></A>
There is an amendment to the Disability Services Act. The amendment to this section extends the transition period regarding restrictive practices for an extra nine months. Prior to the legislation allowing certain restrictive practices for people with disabilities, there was no legislative framework. By extending the transition period, this will allow service providers to meet those standards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120412"></A>
There are amendments to the Superannuation (State Public Sector) Act. Amendments will confirm that the QSuper board of trustees is within the regulatory reach of APRA and ASIC. Why is it only now that this is being done? What has occurred for this amendment to be needed? It seems ASIC has raised these concerns. The amendments state that QSuper does not have the immunities of the state. The second amendment to this section allows for the standing appointment of a deputy chairperson. </Hansard-Body>

Indeed, the State Penalties Enforcement Act and the registry that it establishes has a long and drawn-out history in the state of Queensland. Indeed, in 1999 this government’s predecessor, the first Beattie government, was dragged kicking and screaming to the alternative of a state penalties enforcement registry and the act that enabled it because of the number of fine defaulters in jails in Queensland. It was quite anachronistic that at any given time in Queensland there were up to 240 fine defaulters in jail. Those people were clogging up our jails and using up scarce resources. One could generally argue that the great majority of those people should not have been rubbing shoulders with hardened criminals. Indeed, when one looked at the cost of keeping those people in jail, albeit for a short period, it was obvious that the system was absolutely irrational. Making them pay their dues to society in that way was not necessarily acceptable in a modern society. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120416"></A>
The Attorney-General at the time, Matt Foley, only introduced the legislation in response to a private member’s bill that had been prepared by myself as shadow Attorney-General. At that time the current Attorney-General was plying his trade somewhere in the South Sea islands. If he reads <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
 from that time, he will learn of the lengthy debates about the need for the government to bring in an alternative mechanism. It was not until that happened that the government reflected on the laws that had been prepared by the then coalition and presented its legislation to this parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120417"></A>
As I pointed out earlier in my contribution, it is also fair to say that in Queensland the State Penalties Enforcement Act had very wide-reaching powers that enabled the government to do what it should have been doing, which was to make fine defaulters pay their dues to society. In recent times we have seen the ridiculous situation--and this has been alluded to even by the Police Service--where fine defaulters have gone through the court process and, in fining them, the magistrates or judges simply say, ‘We will add this fine onto your accumulating list of fines.’ You really have to ask the question: what has been done by the government to exact the opportunities that were available to it to make those people pay their dues to society? How much proper enforcement and pursuit was being undertaken in relation to the garnisheeing of wages in Queensland? How much was being done to have a seizure-and-sale order on the property? I suspect not very much at all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120418"></A>
This year on the eve of the estimates committee process, the Attorney-General did what the government always does at estimates time. He came up with a grand headline that made the government look hairy chested, as though it was going to do something. He announced the notion of wheel clamping as a way of enforcing the payment of fines. There are certain outs for people in certain circumstances. My argument is that, all the way along, if the government had properly used the enforcement mechanisms in the existing legislation rather than being asleep at the wheel, this would not have been necessary. It will be interesting to see if this will work. The government tells us that this is based on the Victorian experience. It tells us that since it has been introduced in Victoria, they have had some success in getting people who have a significant number of outstanding fines to pay them under threat of having the wheels of their vehicle clamped. Under this legislation that will happen in circumstances where an offender owes more than $5,000 in fines. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120419"></A>
The other issue--and I will go back to this--is that there needs to be some recognition of the inequity in the new amendments when it comes to non-traffic related fines and the capacity to suspend the offender’s driver’s licence. A whole range of fine defaulters are not drivers. Therefore, we have two classes of citizens and one will be treated far more harshly than the other. That has to be considered. Those issues have been raised very succinctly by bodies and organisations external to this parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120420"></A>
I also understand, and I would like the Attorney-General to put this on the record, that in Queensland there are several hundred thousand outstanding individual fines. I understand that almost half a million Queenslanders have outstanding fines. One has to ask the question: with a population of 4.4 million, how can almost half a million people in this state have outstanding fines? I concede that some of those defaulters will be from interstate, but basically one in nine have an outstanding fine. I understand that some of those people will be from interstate, but that puts it in proportion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124914"></A>
If we had a system that was working, if we had appropriate enforcement, then there is no way that this should have got out of hand. Surely the alarm bells should not have started to ring--surely the penny should not have started to drop--just in recent weeks and months. The reality is that this problem of hundreds of millions of dollars in outstanding fines has been alluded to by the recent release of information, either through questions on notice pursued by the opposition in this place or through the media in recent years, and the government basically ignored them because it did not care. It did not care about the enforcement. It did not need the cash at that stage; there were rivers of gold. Now the government has gone broke--it has $85 billion worth of public debt, heading towards $100 billion--and we have a mad cash scramble. The government is rushing in to amend legislation to rake this money in when it has not properly enforced the other provisions of this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124917"></A>
The opposition will reluctantly not oppose what is being put forward here today. It is yet to be seen whether it is going to be effective. Obviously we are going to keep a watching brief on this. Our concern relates to a number of factors (a) if these extensions are necessary, which is yet to be seen, and (b) if much of what is being said can be achieved by these new amendments could not have been achieved previously if the government had just done its job and used its existing enforcement mechanisms and options available to it under the State Penalties Enforcement Act. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (8.51 pm): I rise this evening to make a contribution to the State Penalties Enforcement and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009, which is a consolidating bill in many respects in that it amends 38 different acts.  The purpose of this bill is to extend the powers of the State Penalties Enforcement Registry to enforce unpaid moneys from fines, extend the provision to include unpaid wages and to introduce wheel clamping as a last-resort option for some fine defaulters. Mr Speaker, as per our previous discussion, I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1124924"></A>
The Bill also makes amendments to the QCAT Bill, makes MOG changes to the Film Classifications Act, corrects a drafting error from past amendments to the Guardianship Act, and seeks to extend the powers of the Judicial registrars in certain circumstances.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1124926"></A>
Amendments to extend the power of Judicial registrars is concerning in that it will give these non-magistrates the ability to determine bail when an offender is in a show cause situation. The Liberal National Party has previously not supported the judicial registrar program as they are no substitute for properly trained and merit selected magistrates.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1124932"></A>
It is said to be a last resort option, however it remains to be seen if it will ever be enacted given that this Government is more interested in headlines than actually doing anything constructive.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1124933"></A>
I am sure that residents in the electorate of Mudgeeraba would love to see wheel clamping of hoon vehicles as a method of curtailing this illegal activity which is the bane of many law abiding citizens and an issue that occurs frequently.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr BLEIJIE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kawana--LNP) (8.51 pm): I rise to add my contribution to the State Penalties Enforcement and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009, which is before the House this evening. While I support this bill, I, along with other members of the opposition, have some real concerns and reservations in relation to the extension of powers of the judicial registrars. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124959"></A>
The purpose of this bill is to strengthen the compliance and enforcement capabilities of the State Penalties Enforcement Registry, commonly referred to as SPER. In particular, the bill seeks to extend the existing powers of SPER to suspend the drivers’ licences of debtors who have outstanding fines registered with SPER; seize and sell real and personal property; grant SPER new powers to clamp the wheels of vehicles of some ‘high-value’ debtors who fail to pay their fines; and retrospectively act to validate the referral, registration and enforcement of some orders made under the Industrial Relations Act 1999. The bill will amend at least 37 pieces of legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124962"></A>
SPER was established on 27 November 2000 under the State Penalties Enforcement Act 1999 by the Beattie government in an attempt to recover a substantial amount of unpaid state fines that were outstanding. While I agree with the general principle behind the establishment of SPER, nine years after the registry was established it has failed the stewardship of successive Labor governments to recoup money owed to the state of Queensland through the powers given to it under the act. This is justified by the introduction of this bill in the House which obviously highlights certain inadequacies in the recovery process. Simply put, the government did not get it correct the first time, so this is an attempt to ensure that the registry achieves its underlying objectives. I have no problem in supporting legislation that attempts to correct the errors of Labor’s ways, but there comes a time when it just gets too much. Had we had an LNP government in Queensland, we would have got it right the first time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124963"></A>
In my opinion, the government should be actively pursuing the stance on crime by initiating watertight legislative reform that only enhances the current justice system. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1124975"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No. I have certainly got the last laugh on that. The government should also be seen to be tough on those who commit offences in the first instance and then subsequently do not pay the fines associated with those offences. While the bill enables SPER to be harsher on those who fail to pay their fines, the existing powers of SPER are not currently being exercised to their full potential. The government needs to have a strong stance against these offenders and enforce the necessary measures that would see these fines paid in the first instance. The government should ensure that SPER exercises the rights and powers that it already has to their full extent before merely appearing to be tough against crime and extending those powers under this bill that potentially could make the issue of recouping state fines harder than it is now. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124976"></A>
Due to the cost of the state’s debt ballooning out of control, we have seen in recent months this government initiate a revenue-raising program of increasing fines by up to 33.3 per cent. In some cases this might result in being a deterrent to the number of offences committed but, given the dire economic situation that this government finds itself in, coupled with the fire sale of Queensland assets, the logical argument is that this could be seen as simply another revenue-raising exercise rather than as a tougher deterrent to those who are failing to pay fines incurred after committing various acts against the law. Or, even more so, it shows a complete lack of commitment from the government to investigate further the deeper issues associated with the people who continually break these laws. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124977"></A>
Currently, SPER has the power to suspend drivers’ licences for unpaid amounts relating to motor vehicle offences only. The bill will extend the power to suspend drivers’ licences for any unpaid amount regardless of whether they relate to a motor vehicle offence or not. Not only will the bill extend the powers of SPER to suspend drivers’ licences for any unpaid amount, SPER will also be granted powers to wheel-clamp, seize and sell vehicles that are registered to ‘high-value’ debtors. The wheel-clamping process is like that of taking a mortgage over one’s property without the owner’s consent and then exercising a right of seizure and resale if the debtor defaults on their payments. But if the value of the vehicle is too low, SPER may issue a warrant for arrest and imprisonment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124980"></A>
I thank the Attorney’s staff and other departmental staff for the detailed briefing that I attended with the shadow Attorney-General where it was confirmed to me that, in the case of a vehicle being wheel clamped and ultimately onsold, the balance between the debt amount and the sale price would of course be given to the one whose car was seized. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124982"></A>
I also note that, as we move into the technological revolution, the legislation introduces the concept of SMS technology. As generation Y, I am fully cognisant of SMS technology. Offenders of this legislation can receive notifications from SPER by SMS before the suspension of their licence. I did quiz at the ministerial briefing whether this SMS or any attempt to SMS would result in being a legally constituted notice. I was advised that that was not the intention of the bill and that it would not be. As others in this House may appreciate, we often receive notices by SMS. I can admit to the House that I have received notices from phone companies that bills are overdue and so forth and, with the number of SMSs and emails we get, we often overlook them. I thank the Attorney’s staff for confirming that that will not be the case and that the appropriate notices will still be issued. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124983"></A>
While it is agreed that something needs to be done to rein in the payment of fines, this is a callous reaction by the Labor government to the lack of management of the budget bottom line. The consequence needs to be relative to the crime committed, and the suspension of a driver’s licence or seizure of a vehicle does not seem appropriate to an outstanding fine for a non-vehicle related offence. The bill will also strengthen SPER’s existing power to seize and sell real and personal property and will bring those powers into line with the powers and process for enforcing money orders made under the Uniform Civil Procedures Rules 1999. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124987"></A>
The bill proposes to use Magistrates Court bailiffs to enforce seizure and sale warrants for real and personal property against debtors who owe at least $1,000 in outstanding fines. In this year’s Australian Productivity Commission report on government services, we saw that the government’s Magistrates Court system has a backlog of a total of 70,749 matters--comprised of 36,151 criminal matters and 34,598 civil matters--making Queensland’s Magistrates Court system the most inefficient in Australia. For this government to add more cases to this already congested system shows that the government has no consideration or understanding of how overworked and gridlocked the system already is. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129878"></A>
The backlog of the Queensland Magistrates Court has increased from an already high case load in 2008 of 69,619 matters. This was with the assistance of the judicial registrar scheme that was set up as a two-year trial in an effort to ease the pressure on Queensland’s busiest magistrates courts. The judicial registrars were appointed to hear minor court matters that had previously been heard by a magistrate including matters such as minor debt claims and small claims, civil chamber applications, domestic violence adjournments, temporary orders and orders by consent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129882"></A>
Instead of looking at appropriate alternative options to recovery of the existing outstanding fines, we have a government going to the courts to impose fines on top of fines that are simply not being paid, and this is particularly the case with criminal matters. Once again, this is a government that appears to be doing something from the front but is not achieving anything at all. The situation should never have been allowed to get to this point. Successive Labor governments in this state have a history of closing the gate on matters well after the horse has bolted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129883"></A>
The fines that were owed to the state of Queensland should have been called in well before now. The government should have exercised the appropriate existing powers of recovery long before this point. Perhaps if the government started to take proper management of the funds that it is the custodian of, then we would not be in this situation and the recovery powers considered in this bill would not need to be extended. Once again, this is a complete reaction to pathetic mismanagement of Labor governments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129884"></A>
This is the second time we will extend the powers of the judicial registrars including expanding powers relating to bail applications. The magistrates already have a difficult task when it comes to granting bail, and to allow the judicial registrars the power to grant bail is a great misappropriation of power. Judicial registrars are not a cheap alternative to magistrates, and this government should not treat them as such. My concern is that we are starting to set a dangerous precedent if we continue to go down the path of granting more powers to judicial registrars to ease the workload of our magistrates. Surely the answer to easing the magistrates’ workload and the backlog of cases is to appoint on a merit basis more effective magistrates into our existing court system that can help with the busy court systems that we have in the state. The government should look for an appropriate alternative to the backlog of the Queensland Magistrates Court system and not simply appoint a second level of officers within the Magistrates Court to try to relieve the overcrowded system. I do not support the extension of powers relating to these judicial registrars proposed by this bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129888"></A>
The bill will also retrospectively amend the Industrial Relations Act 1999 and the State Penalties Enforcement Act 1999 to establish a referral to SPER for the recovery of unpaid wages--something that this government has already been doing although it is not currently permitted to under any legislation. Here we see the government once again covering up its mistakes and its unlawful practices. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs STUCKEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Currumbin--LNP) (9.02 pm): I rise to join the debate on the State Penalties Enforcement and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 brought into the House on 16 September this year by the Attorney-General and honourable member for Greenslopes. As we have already heard from the shadow minister, the honourable member for Southern Downs, we on this side of the House have indicated that we will be supporting the general intent of this bill. The bill amends 38 different acts which, amongst others, includes the State Penalties Enforcement Act 1999 to strengthen compliance and enforcement capabilities of the State Penalties Enforcement Registry, also known as SPER. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129895"></A>
The focus of my debate will be to address the changes to this act which will allow SPER to suspend people’s drivers’ licences for any unpaid fine and to wheel clamp and seize vehicles as well as sell real and personal property. While I am in no way condoning nonpayment of fines by people who deliberately break the law, I am not convinced the measures contained in this bill will provide a cure, nor are the reasons behind these amendments driven by a best interest to reduce crime approach.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129898"></A>
I note that in the Attorney-General’s second reading speech he informs us this bill brings Queensland into line with all other Australian jurisdictions except the Australian Capital Territory. Clearly this shows the level of inefficiency across almost wall to wall Labor state governments to collect fines without resorting to draconian measures under the guise of being tough on crime. Due to the laissez-faire attitude to debt collection by this Bligh government, which has embarked upon a money-grabbing, knee-jerk reaction in a desperate attempt to try to recover them, SPER will now be chasing some extra 380,000 fines totalling some $106 million. This Labor government already has the legislation and resources in place to prevent these people becoming perpetual debtors but has sat on its hands, done nothing and allowed fine to mount on fine. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129900"></A>
In a shameful attempt to recoup unpaid dues, the government is now bringing in legislation that will punish some offenders more harshly than others when other measures such as purposeful community service may well be more effective in some cases. Undeniably, tougher measures are warranted for those who ignore fines and act above the law. However, expanding the suspension of licences from just motor vehicle fines to any unpaid fine undoubtedly will significantly increase the number of people going through the courts for driving whilst disqualified. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129901"></A>
Lengthy processing times means that some people will not realise they have an already suspended licence. Our courts regularly see young people being given a further mandatory six months suspension because they did not know their licence had been suspended in the first place. A change of address and mail not being received are examples given as to why people do not receive their notices of suspension. This then results in a court ordered suspension, and if they appear again it will result in a two-year disqualification and then jail. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129902"></A>
Inadvertently, people find themselves caught in a revolving door of the courts because of the initial SPER suspension, and they then receive further fines and extended loss of licence. There are many reasons why people do not pay their fines, and not all are fine bludgers, as so bluntly put by the Attorney-General. Residents regularly visit my office seeking help for legitimate oversights, and my staff on several occasions have made ministerial representations on their behalf. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129904"></A>
In today’s tough economic climate, many citizens are genuinely struggling or are poorly educated and find themselves trapped in a never-ending cycle with SPER. I would have thought members opposite would be a little more understanding. Suspending someone’s licence can make a bad situation much worse by hindering their ability to find employment which in turn hinders their ability to pay a fine.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129906"></A>
The new initiative that permits the use of SMS messages as reminders and warning messages to debtors is a positive move and in line with society’s trend to communicate through modern technologies. I do hope there are procedures in place to measure the effect of this specifically. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129908"></A>
The Attorney acknowledges that wheel clamping is a tough new measure to be trialled in the Brisbane metropolitan area for 12 months commencing 1 January 2010. Now that is a new year’s surprise that no-one will welcome. He predicts that it will significantly increase debt recovery rates, but time will tell. The process of having a car wheel clamped is a five-step protracted exercise, and according to the explanatory notes targets debtors who have accumulated large amounts of unpaid monetary penalties and have firmly refused to try to work out ways to pay their debt. It has been said this initiative could be considered to have insufficient regard to the rights and liberties of individuals. However, justification for this is listed on page 12 of the explanatory notes. But back to the five-step process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129910"></A>
Firstly, there is the undertaking of a hardship assessment; then SPER registers an interest over the vehicle; serving the debtor a notice to pay; serving the debtor with a mobilisation warrant; then the vehicle gets clamped for five days; and then, if the vehicle is of sufficient value, it gets sold. If, however, the vehicle seized is valued at less than $5,000 it is released, and an arrest and imprisonment warrant is issued. It is important to note here that there is no right of review in respect of the registrar’s decision to issue an intent notice or an immobilisation warrant which could also be viewed as a breach of regard to the rights and liberties of individuals. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129911"></A>
As these processes of wheel clamping, seizing and sale of the vehicle are going to require services, I am wondering who will pay for this. Is this cost added onto the person’s fines, or is it paid for by the taxpayer? Is it broken down by process, value of car or some other measure? Perhaps the Attorney would be kind enough to respond in his summing-up. Another grey area surrounds people who do not hold a licence or own a car. How is the government going to ensure that their fines are paid? I agree with the sentiment of RACQ’s external relations manager, who believes that this new system is inequitable, and also with Terry O’Gorman, who states it is a harsh and disproportionate punishment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129915"></A>
The Attorney-General has stated that SPER would, in the first instance, go after corporate debtors. I am puzzled as to the reasons that corporate debtors are allowed to have their fines accumulate with SPER in the first place. Corporations should be immediately taken to court and assets sold to recover debts. If they are trading while insolvent, the directors should be prosecuted. There is no reasonable excuse for long-term corporate debtors.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134738"></A>
The government’s keen focus should be on how to prevent people from getting themselves into such situations. While fines are a deterrent for most people, it is not for those who continually rort the system and some of the younger generation who feel they have nothing to lose. The increased level of violence and underage drinking in our society must urgently be addressed. Tougher, more meaningful consequences for youth who blatantly break the law need to be implemented. Parents of young offenders should also be held accountable in some manner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134739"></A>
Underage drinking, youth roaming the streets and an increased level of violence is becoming more common than not in our communities. Every weekend we hear reports of youth congregating in the street, drinking, throwing bottles at cars, destroying mailboxes, pulling out trees and signs. Police are often called but more often than not the offenders have already moved on to another location. What is going to stop them from repeating this behaviour next weekend or the weekend after that? Police in my electorate are sick and tired of handing out SETONS liquor fines to underage youth only to be told not to pursue the matter in the Magistrates Court. This means many youth offend repeatedly as they get away with it. Apart from getting away with breaking the law, they are putting their lives at risk through binge drinking and losing control of their faculties. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134743"></A>
It is common knowledge that our road statistics are tragic, climbing each week to a total of almost 400 at present. Statistics of drink drivers who reoffend are inexcusable. Of some 29,913 drink drivers caught in Queensland last year, 35 per cent have been booked previously. Fatal crashes that were alcohol related also rose significantly. The Coolangatta Magistrates Court is filled regularly, with some 95 per cent of cases being drink drivers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134745"></A>
As we are talking about the collection of fine payments through SPER, it is fitting to address preventative methods. More focus should also be on teaching young drivers to drive safely as driving a motor car is the most dangerous and complex task the average person will ever undertake. Young Australian drivers aged 17 to 25 years have double the risk of all age groups of being involved in a fatal road accident. Drivers are generally taught how to pass a test rather than how to drive. How many more lives will be lost needlessly before people learn that speed does not improve performance? Driving is more than just knowing the road rules and not enough novice drivers get to learn this vital life-saving information. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134746"></A>
There is unprecedented interest in the community to address the issue of driver training. Very much more could be done and the government has been dragging its heels here. The LNP strongly supports the notion that being proactive with regard to prevention across all areas is better than being reactive to the consequences. The Bligh government and, prior to this, the Beattie government have a long history of being reactive. This legislation has been described as yet another example of Labor trying to find ways to fill its coffers, emptied through reckless spending and poor management, which is why Premier Bligh has chosen to sell off assets that belong to the people of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134748"></A>
No doubt these amendments will initially see an increase in the number of people going through the revolving door of our court system because if someone has an unpaid fine relating to a dog or a failure to vote they could now find themselves without a licence. As news of these new laws filters through to Queenslanders, it is to be hoped that fewer people will incur fines and fewer again will default on them. Like other members of the LNP, I shall await the reviews with interest. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms GRACE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Brisbane Central--ALP) (9.12 pm): I rise to make a contribution to the State Penalties Enforcement and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. As we know, the bill is divided into four chapters and I am primarily going to deal with chapter 2. We have heard tonight exactly what the State Penalties Enforcement Registry does in that it engages debtors in compliance and enforcement of fines. SPER, as it is known, has the unenviable task of recovering unpaid court ordered fines, court ordered restitution or compensation which is paid to victims of crime and infringement notice penalties issued by the state government agencies and authorities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134752"></A>
This bill makes a number of amendments that give SPER the ability to address unpaid fines in a number of other ways. Primarily, we know that at the moment those who do not pay their fines are given more than enough opportunity to pay them. There are flexible methods to engage people: they can pay off their fines in a manageable way; there are instalment plans; there are direct debits; there are ways to organise money to be taken from wages and Centrelink payments. There are more than enough--ample--opportunities for those who have fine payments owing to pay them and options for how those fines can be paid for those who are genuinely unable to meet the payment or are in hardship. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134754"></A>
Unlike the other side of the House, I think SPER needs to be congratulated. These officers have a very hard job and they should be congratulated on the success rate that has been achieved in the recovery of these debts. When we bear in mind that often these are fines not paid by the due date, a debt recovery rate of over 75 per cent is very high. Many debt collectors would be proud of such a record. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134755"></A>
However, there are quite a few dollars still outstanding and we know that there are a number of recalcitrant people who do owe money and do not enter into one of the many different ways that they can repay it. If we as a society accept that fines are a valuable punishment option for courts and government agencies, then we must punish the wrongdoer by way of fines for those who do the wrong thing. I believe that we cannot continue to allow those people who do not pay their fines to get away with it. This legislation gives SPER additional tools to be able to ensure that these people meet their fine repayments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134757"></A>
We know that currently SPER can make a number of orders, for example, to suspend a driver’s licence for an unpaid fine only in relation to an unpaid driving fine. This tool is a very effective way of ensuring that fines are paid. This bill extends this power to include non-driving related fines and it brings Queensland into line with all other jurisdictions except the ACT. Basically, we are doing what every other state in Australia bar the ACT has been doing, yet those on the other side of the House are carping about us extending it to those individuals. Quite clearly, this is a system that has worked successfully elsewhere. We are putting it in place in Queensland, and what do we hear? ‘Why has the government stalled? Why has it not done it previously?’ We are doing it now. I think it is a very important step. It is one that I support. If we can use whatever tools we can to ensure that these fines are paid, we should be moving on it. If we did not, we would hear the carping from the other side of the House that we did not take the necessary steps. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134758"></A>
Another initiative being introduced in this bill is the ability for SPER to immobilise, seize or sell vehicles owned by these recalcitrant high-value debtors. This is what we call wheel clamping. It is a method that has been introduced in a number of other jurisdictions including New Zealand, Victoria and South Australia. We know that this power will only be used for high-value debtors--for those debtors who owe more than the prescribed amount to SPER, and it is envisaged that the amount will initially be $5,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134759"></A>
I want to make a couple of points about this. We had some concerns about the way that this may be used--at least I did personally. However, I am more than comfortable with how this bill is now formulated. I congratulate the Attorney-General on what has been put in this bill to ensure that it is used as an option of last resort. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134760"></A>
Wheel clamping will be a successful tool that will bring in those additional fine repayments that this state requires. As we have heard, there will be a process put in place to initially allow SPER to register an interest over the vehicle on the Register of Encumbered Vehicles because this will prevent a debtor avoiding the system by selling the car before it can be seized. We know that it will initially be trialled in the Brisbane metropolitan region in both the metropolitan north and metropolitan south police regions commencing from 1 January 2010. It is a trial that will be put in place. Once it has registered the interest, SPER will serve the debtor with a notice of intent and there is a very extensive process. There will be safeguards to ensure, for example, that if a vehicle is clamped it is not done in an unsafe way. It can be done at any time. There is a number of safeguards in there so that the vehicle is not clamped in such a way that would either compromise the safety of the public or the occupants of that vehicle. I believe this is a step in the right direction. I support it. I think that it makes eminent sense that we trial this as per the legislation and that we go forward with this move. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139449"></A>
Unfortunately, the profile of these debtors who owe these millions of dollars is that 60 per cent of them are aged 34 years or under. So perhaps this is a way of ensuring that they do pay up and realise that if they break the law they have to meet the fines that are set by the courts and other jurisdictions. They also have to realise that they cannot get away with thumbing their noses at their fines by not paying them, and we have to teach them a lesson for life. The two additional tools that SPER will be given under this legislation will hopefully go a long way to ensuring the payment of those fines.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139451"></A>
I want to refer to a couple of other changes in the legislation. I welcome changes to the Superannuation (State Public Sector) Act to ensure that the QSuper board of trustees now comes under the Commonwealth APRA regulations. Obviously this is now necessary because QSuper is being offered to a broader public than it has previously been. I was previously on the board of QSuper and it is an absolutely professional and fantastic superannuation fund. This move does nothing more than legitimise or legalise what QSuper has been operating under ever since it was formed. It has always abided by APRA laws and ASIC laws, and this amendment clearly puts in place the way that QSuper has operated over many years. I also support the fact that QSuper will now be able to elect a standing deputy chairperson. I always found it a bit strange when I was on the board that that was not available under the legislation, and this amendment enables it to do that and that makes eminent good sense.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139465"></A>
I take this opportunity to commend the Attorney-General and the Department of Justice and Attorney-General for the bold initiatives and changes contained in this bill which will strengthen the capacity of our courts and government agencies to punish wrongdoers in a way that has even greater enforcement potential. I commend the bill to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr KILBURN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Chatsworth--ALP) (9.21 pm): I rise to support the State Penalties Enforcement and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. This bill makes a number of amendments to the State Penalties Enforcement Act 1999 with the aim of strengthening the compliance and enforcement capabilities of the State Penalties Enforcement Register, or SPER as it is more commonly known. These amendments aim to expand the existing powers of SPER to suspend drivers’ licences of debtors who do not pay their fines that have been registered with SPER; to provide SPER with new powers to place wheel clamps on vehicles of debtors with debts of $5,000 or more who have failed to respond to other payment options; to strengthen SPER’s power to seize and sell real and personal property; and to validate the referral, registration and enforcement of certain orders made under the Industrial Relations Act 1999.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139478"></A>
Fines are a valuable punishment option for courts and agencies, acting as an effective deterrent to offenders. They punish the wrongdoers and provide some monetary recompense for the wrongdoing by way of restitution to the community. SPER collects unpaid infringement notice fines and unpaid court ordered fines. This money is paid into consolidated revenue. SPER also collects court ordered restitution or compensation, and this money is quite rightly paid to victims of crime. Since the introduction of SPER in 2000, the collection of court ordered fines and unpaid infringement notices has increased by 600 per cent--and I see that as a sign that it is working--and in the 2008-09 financial year more than $143.8 million was collected. Some $119 million was returned to consolidated revenue, $13.5 million went to victims of crime and $11.3 million went to other agencies such as local government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139483"></A>
This is a wonderful outcome for all Queenslanders, and I have no doubt that most Queenslanders expect the government to ensure that people comply with orders issued against them and to pay the debt that they owe to the people of Queensland. Unfortunately, a number of people refuse to comply with the law and, as such, some tougher measures are needed. Whilst it is important to give the relevant agencies the powers that they need to enforce compliance, it is also important that care is taken not to adversely affect others. This government, as it always does, has been careful to craft these changes in a way that ensures procedural fairness. There are a number of safeguards built into the legislation that ensure that only the debtors who have ignored a number of opportunities to comply will be affected by the amendments. There are a number of safeguards, for example, in the provision of wheel clamping to ensure that third parties are not put at risk during the wheel-clamping procedure. The threshold amount of $5,000 for wheel clamping ensures that only serial offenders or high-value debtors will be subject to wheel-clamping sanctions and only after they have been given a number of opportunities to pay their debt or enter into a payment plan.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139484"></A>
Another amendment is to expand the existing powers to suspend driving licences. This option is only currently available for fines relating to motor vehicle offences. This bill extends the use of this option to any unpaid amount and brings Queensland in line with other states. Whilst some people may have concerns about this action, it is important to remind people that driving on the roads is not a right but is in fact a privilege provided by the community and, as such, it is incumbent upon all of us to respect that privilege and abide by the standards of behaviour expected by the community. This would include paying in full debts owed to the people of Queensland that have been legally imposed for breaking the law.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139485"></A>
It is interesting to note that the member for Currumbin mentioned concerns about the suspension of licences, as did the member for Southern Downs. I looked back at the speech of the member for Southern Downs when he introduced a private member’s bill on this issue, and the proposal in that bill was that people’s licences be automatically suspended after 56 days. He said in his second reading speech--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1139487"></A>
This is all about self-responsibility. A person has a choice--a reasonable choice--following ample notice. Further, it will immediately increase the flow of funds into the public purse from people who quite wrongly ... simply thumb their nose at the community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1139489"></A>
It is interesting to see the turnaround in that opinion over the years.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139491"></A>
Finally, in particular I commend the amendment that allows SPER to enforce orders for the payment of unpaid wages, unpaid superannuation contributions and fees charged illegally by private employment agencies. Many of us on this side of the House can tell many stories where workers have been left out of pocket without having the necessary resources to pursue action through the civil recovery process. This change will assist ordinary workers to obtain money that is owed to them. Once again, this amendment demonstrates the Bligh government’s commitment to fairness in the workplace and ensuring a fair go for all workers--a concept that we all know is completely foreign to the members of the LNP, who in the past have supported and continue to support the appalling practices under the Work Choices legislation. I congratulate the departmental staff for their work on this bill and in particular the minister for his commitment to the government’s reform process, and I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (9.26 pm): This bill is partially a bill about fines and the process attached to them. It also contains amendments to 38 acts in all, and I wish to highlight the most relevant areas of those amendments and issues relating to SPER itself. We intend to support the bill without suggesting amendments, but we do have an objection to one or two critical issues within it. I am concerned that this bill addresses as a priority issue the $243 million raised in fines in 2009. This was an 11 per cent increase on the previous year. All fines were increased as of 1 January 2009 and, as I say, the state is expecting another 11 per cent increase in this forthcoming year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139497"></A>
The minister in his speech has highlighted $143.8 million which presumably was raised in 2008. He noted that $119 million was returned to consolidated revenue, of which $13.5 million went to victims of crime and $11.5 million to other agencies. He failed to mention that SPER has unpaid fines worth in excess of $462 million, representing 1.9 million individual fines. This figure has doubled in less than three years. If that theme is to be continued, what are the problems that these salient facts would then lead to? I raise these salient facts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139500"></A>
In the Ipswich population, one in eight owe money to SPER--some $26 million. That is 109,273 fines and one in three are in default. With regard to motor vehicle fines, 50 per cent of those are derived from the Gold Coast region, inclusive of the M1 to the outskirts of Brisbane. Speeding has topped the list in Queensland and we have raised $150 million in fines from it. Red-light camera detection on the Gold Coast resulted in 22,727 fines in 2008-09, and half a million fines across Queensland are in default. The concept of SPER was to expiate funds--as that is what it is called in South Australia--from the public for offences incurring a fine in an efficient manner. The principle of SPER is to keep fine defaulters out of jail. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149044"></A>
So what is the problem with SPER? In summary terms, one, it is a government revenue raiser--a progressive tax; two, it has a higher impact in lower socioeconomic areas; three, it heavily and disproportionately penalises drivers where traffic congestion is a serious problem; and four, it is being ignored because its guiding principle is that it is to prevent defaulters going to jail.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149045"></A>
The minister’s response can be summarised as, one, the expansion of SPER’s powers to suspend a driver’s licence; two, new powers for wheel clamps, the seizure and selling of vehicles registered to high-value debtors who steadfastly refuse to pay their debts; three, SPER will serve the debtor with an intent notice that gives the debtor 14 days to pay and then enter into compliance to repay the debt; four, if the warrant is served, trained enforcement officers will then execute the warrant and wheel clamp for up to five days; five, seizure of the vehicle and low-residual value releases are mandated or then possibly arrest and imprisonment warrants for those others. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149046"></A>
These are the critical changes. There are some other initiatives that I will examine in detail. I put it to the minister that the impact of the changes will be, one, drivers will continue to drive on suspended licences and there will be a massive increase in these offences; two, wheel clamping will be much higher in lower socioeconomic areas and cause great difficulties for mothers getting children to school and for couples or individuals getting to work; three, warrant serving will significantly rise; four, traffic congestion will continue and the issue of rat-running that leads from it will continue; five, many vehicles that present for seizure will have been stripped; and six, fine defaulters will not go to jail in greater numbers because the intent of the bill is to prevent them from being jailed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149047"></A>
So we may ask: did the minister get it wrong? The verdict would have to be out at present. The minister is relying on information primarily from the Victorian and South Australian experience of wheel clamping, but Melbourne has an excellent bus and tramway system and it is very comprehensive. That city has public transport solutions to all areas and the overwhelming bulk of the population lies within the public transport coverage region. Here in Queensland we are decentralised. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149048"></A>
SPER has the power to retrieve funds for 34,000 different offences and that is way too many. The government seems to be in an indecent haste to get access to more public money to shore up its own precarious position. I do not think that the evidence that the minister is relying on is sufficient to warrant his response. He has not closely considered that the evidence supporting his position is balanced with not just the nature of the offences of the state but also the demographics of our state. I suspect the flaw is a fatal one that may apply to only 20 per cent of the fines but it will occupy 80 per cent of the efforts to retrieve those funds. This is the Pareto principle. Also, every time one agency defers to another to enforce its own laws, then the following agency has decreased ability to enforce its delegates to collect those funds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149050"></A>
I would like to give members some specific examples of where SPER seems powerless to change. In Oakdale Drive at Nerang hoons drift around a roundabout daily and excessively. The lives of the people who live in the area are a misery. Evidence is required for a successful conviction. Primarily, camera evidence is required. It is very difficult to get that evidence. A burnout is defined specifically if smoke appears. In fact, if it is wet, there is no smoke. Once fined, when the vehicles are seized, they invariably turn up effectively a very different vehicle from that which caused the offence. These laws will change none of that and these types of offences are going on daily throughout the state and throughout Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149052"></A>
Secondly, despite the government acquiring homes in Staplyton and Nerang, my electorate has no interregional corridor roads. The government has already acquired 89 homes and there are 34 to go, but the road is 20 years away and there are no plans in sight. The M1 from Brisbane is routinely blocked south to north from 7 am to 10 am every day and north to south from 2.30 pm to 6.30 pm in the evening. People, including locals, are rat-running to try to drive around the obstructing traffic. The response from the police has been to saturate the areas--north, south and in between--with mobile speeding cameras and to routinely police the areas with speed zones that change from 80 kilometres per hour to 60 kilometres per hour and then back to 70 kilometres per hour. For those Gold Coast to Brisbane commuters who are merely trying to reduce their traffic times, their lives are a misery and they are dealing with the SPER issues that go with it. These are many of the people who are currently being fined. There are local issues that spill over into SPER problems. These 20 per cent of difficulties are going to challenge our courts and the minister’s office.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149053"></A>
 Like other LNP members, I doubt that the bill’s plan to allow for the judicial registrar program to extend for two to three years in Townsville and Southport will make any difference. There seems to be an ability to undermine the roles of the magistrates and the registrars in the courts already and I really do not think--and this was summarised very well by the member for Kawana--that having a second tier, or a second grade judiciary is the way to go. The Queensland Magistrates Court is the most inefficient in Australia. It has a backlog of what has been said to be nearly 80,000 cases. This bill would seem to compound it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149054"></A>
It is clear that the LNP has opposed the judicial registrar program. The reason for our opposition is that we support fairness and not the creation, as I say, of this second grade judicial officer. The minister in his second reading speech effectively said exactly that. His justification for that is its cost effectiveness and efficiency in dealing with less complex matters. The minister highlighted that the Townsville and Southport magistrates courts are indeed the two busiest regional courts and--wait for it--he actually said, ‘That, you know, they would be happier and, you know, what might then follow, I would suspect, is that Ipswich, Bundaberg and maybe Maryborough are going to follow the same course that has occurred in both Southport and Townsville.’</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149055"></A>
 Moreover, it is proposed to widen the judicial registrar powers. This seems very risky and presumptive and it weakens our professional approach to the law. SPER is even widening the net. It is going to use SMS technology to communicate with debtors. It is going to have stronger seizure powers, but the detail is quite unclear. It is going after unpaid wages, tool allowances, unpaid superannuation and deemed illegal fees. The bill allows for referral to SPER for additional enforcement options under the Industrial Relations Act. It is also retrospective.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149057"></A>
The bill also links to the COAG agreement on sharing information on convictions pending charges or acquittals. It covers the loophole in the blue card legislation and it limits the use of information in assessing risks to the safety of children. That is to be applauded. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149058"></A>
This bill has quite a bit more to it and those issues need to be raised. Before doing so, I wonder whether it is appropriate to reflect on the government debt collection mechanisms. The government is in the driver’s seat. It is choosing its own path and it proposes a suck-it-and-see method. I do not think that will work and the initial evidence will be whether we see declining or rising court numbers. I think it will be rising court numbers. We will all lose and fine defaulters will increasingly choose the prison option if they can get it. Of course, the whole intention of the bill is not to increase the numbers going to prison. So that is amongst the worst outcomes from this case alone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149059"></A>
It is not up to the opposition to give the government the answers or solutions to problems, especially when some of the problems are the government’s entirely. It is a complete nonsense to demand that we provide the government with our alternatives to its current strategy, but there are plenty of clues as to what must be done. I doubt that the government will take any notice of what we suggest, anyway. A government that imposes fines on fines is not thinking with its head.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149060"></A>
The other amendments in the bill relate to QCAT. They empower the newly proposed judicial registrars to act as adjudicators under QCAT. As I have said, the LNP does not support the role of judicial registrars, so it will not support that amendment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149061"></A>
The bill contains a variety of amendments to everything--from the appointment of film classification inspectors to ensuring that the QSuper board of trustees are within regulatory reach of APRA and ASIC. I suspect that this legislation is rushed. I think there is an undue haste to play catch-up with other states. I sense that there is more than a smell of greed but a lust for it. Mistakes are made when one leads with their mouth rather than their head. There is that wonderful quote that sobers those lurching for the pocket. It is about the difference between education and experience. Education is what you get when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get when you do not. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr SHINE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (9.39 pm): I am delighted to speak on this debate. I express my amazement at the opposition’s stand with respect to judicial registrars. This was an inspired innovation recently introduced into our judicial system. It has eased the workload of the Magistrates Court in the areas where it has been introduced and is a welcome innovation. Members of the opposition simply do not understand the task that they do as opposed to the task that magistrates do. I urge those opposite to visit those courthouses where judicial registrars operate to enlighten themselves somewhat more. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153912"></A>
The other aspect that I find intriguing is the apparent contradiction that the opposition has exhibited tonight. On the one hand it criticises this legislation because it offends some civil libertarian notion that it has recently acquired. No doubt the member for Southern Downs is looking forward to an invitation to Terry O’Gorman’s Christmas party! On the other hand it criticises us for not taking action sooner to recover these fines.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153913"></A>
The function of SPER has been alluded to. Its function is to collect unpaid fines. In fact, over 700,000 unpaid fines are lodged each year with SPER. The 150-odd people who are employed there with a budget of $10 million have certainly produced tremendous results. Most of the common fines arise from parking, speeding, failure to wear seat belts, running red lights and also, of course, court ordered fines like those arising from drink-driving charges. It is important that SPER has a wide range of enforcement options. Why is that? It provides a meaningful sentencing option to the courts and also fosters public confidence in the judicial and justice system. Prior to SPER being established these options were not always there and, of course, the invariable result was imprisonment which, of course, is an extremely expensive option from the public point of view. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153914"></A>
SPER contributes to the safety and amenity of Queenslanders by collecting thousands of dollars in unpaid fines issued by such institutions as the QPS, Queensland Transport, local government authorities and institutions such as universities. It has very impressive results. In 2007-08 it collected $130 million which was an increase of $30 million on the previous year. I mention in passing how impressed I was with the operation of the call centre. It receives about 285,000 inbound calls each year. There are about 60,000 outbound calls. It comprises 34 officers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153915"></A>
With the collection system that operates there is no real excuse for persons not to pay fines. It is easy to pay fines. Every facility is made available for debtors to pay fines. For example, they can pay fines at Australia Post offices, by BPAY, over the phone and over the internet. They can enter into regular instalment arrangements and payments can be deducted from bank accounts, credit cards and from Centrelink benefits. For those who will not pay, the options, of course, are the suspension of their driver’s licence, compulsory deduction of funds from bank accounts and wages, and the final resort is the issue of imprisonment warrants which, of course, are options of last resort for debtors who refuse to enter into compliance arrangements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153916"></A>
Something has been said tonight about the outstanding fine pool. What has to be realised, and the honourable member for Brisbane Central spoke on this, is that whilst there are some hundreds of millions of dollars that are outstanding, what SPER inherits is those unpaid fines. Around 80 per cent of fines throughout Queensland are paid. SPER inherits the 20 per cent that are left. Of those it has a success rate of around about 72 per cent of those fines. That is a splendid result for any debt-collecting agency. I congratulate all those who work with SPER on the work that they do. In my view, the measures that are targeting the outstanding fine pool being introduced here in this bill are entirely justifiable. The measures include, of course, wheel clamping, seizure and sale, extension of driver licence suspension for non-motor vehicle offences and using SMS technology to communicate with debtors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153917"></A>
Finally, I place on record my concerns regarding the amendments to the Police Service Administration Act and the Education (Queensland College of Teachers) Act with respect to criminal history sharing. I particularly have concerns in relation to sharing of information regarding criminal charges the results of which have been acquittals and withdrawn charges, as, of course, it is contrary to the presumption of innocence that all Queenslanders are entitled to. <Hansard-Speech-End>

A knee-jerk pre-election promise by Labor to supposedly fix Kirra with $1.5 million has exposed this government as the hollow master of spin that it is. I wrote to the minister on 3 April asking to be involved and over 11 weeks later she finally wrote back and said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1153926"></A>
I appreciate your interest in Kirra Beach and your commitment to keeping the public informed. You may be interested to know I have requested a meeting with Minister Tony Kelly (from NSW) to discuss these issues. I am happy to report back the outcomes of any discussions.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153927"></A>
That was on 22 June and I am still waiting. The minister had the hide to tell an untruth on radio only last month by suggesting I have never contacted her about this. I read about plans for Kirra in the newspaper and my question on notice fails to get an answer as to dollars spent on sand excavation and community consultation undertaken with the Gold Coast City Council. An FOI, internal review and external review on behalf of local stakeholders to reveal the conditions of the Tweed project contract took six months and when completed did not disclose the required information.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153928"></A>
However, back in April this year in a reply to another of my questions on notice the minister spoke of the establishment and maintenance of an exclusion zone approximately 100 metres around Kirra Reef and also that Queensland was in negotiations with New South Wales to reduce the quantity of sand delivered to the area. Why then the secrecy in the FOI process? What is there to hide? Surely if someone has breached a contract and allowed Kirra Reef to be smothered the government would want to know--or would it? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153929"></A>
Negative press on 13 October about stage 2 to move sand to the dunes at the back of the beach being put on hold caused a backflip from the minister’s senior staff who announced that the minister would proceed with the project. This week in the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 the minister admits she has been working closely with Minister Kelly from New South Wales and they have decided to get a feasibility study underway by the end of the year. Apparently the study will consider alternative sites for the dredge and operational improvements which is what I and other key stakeholders have been pushing for these past six years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153930"></A>
In another example of this government’s arrogance, local stakeholders such as the surfing, business and residential community have not been consulted. They have not been contacted about the feasibility study or involved in any consultation as to what should be done. I am talking about hundreds of years of experience being ignored. A new outlet for the sand is also to be investigated but I cannot see what is left of $1.5 million paying for this. New South Wales and its track record for not paying for infrastructure around the border is legendary. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153931"></A>
My office has written again to the minister asking for some feedback on her discussions. I have a deep attachment to Currumbin and the people who live therein. If the government truly wants to fix Kirra it should come down and talk to the local community and to talk to me, too. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms NELSON-CARR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mundingburra--ALP) (9.49 pm): This year the Australian Parliamentary Conference was held in Perth, and Queensland members from both sides of politics attended to add to and take from a very wide range of topics that were presented and that have enormous benefit for our electorates, our state and, of course, our country. Some of the things that we considered included: how would governments legislate for the future in these very uncertain climatic and financial times; how do we take part in the media revolution; is science innovation something that Australia takes seriously; will there be enough water for the future; will we be able to fish in the future; are sporting stadiums an expensive luxury or an inner-city necessity; how can we achieve harmony and equality in a changing world, particularly as it affects Indigenous Australians; and how do we meet our future health challenges? These were just some of the issues that we were to able to discuss during the conference. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158847"></A>
I was particularly impressed with the calibre of the speakers who attended the conference, many of whom spoke in harmony and unison. When they were asked how they would tackle lots of the challenges outlined in topics that were discussed over the few days of the conference, it was heartening to hear so many speaking with one voice. We heard from Andrew Forrest, the CEO of the Fortescue Metals Group; Dr Sue Gordon AM, who was appointed the first full-time Indigenous magistrate in Western Australia; and Ben Wyatt MLA, who is the shadow Treasurer of South Australia, was previously the Director of Public Prosecutions in WA and is now the non-executive director of Indigenous Business Australia. All spoke with enormous passion about education or, more specifically, relevant education for Indigenous Australians, with an emphasis on education and training with outcomes--that is, success related. They agreed that some communities are uneconomic and, therefore, unsustainable and that regional governance is critical if we are to achieve any positive outcomes for Indigenous people. All of them spoke unanimously about self-responsibility; we must be responsible for our own actions. That in itself was very heartening. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158854"></A>
Other speakers added to that mantra including Professor Fiona Wood, who is very famous, Nobel Laureate Professor Barry Marshall, Professor Fiona Stanley and Dr Penny Flett, who all spoke about things such as aged care and the fact that first aid is being taught to children in preschool, so that we can be prepared for the tsunami of health issues that are coming to challenge our society. We need to continue to do many of the things that Queensland is already doing. Early intervention leads to prevention. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr CRANDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Coomera--LNP) (9.52 pm): I rise to commend the people of the Coomera electorate for their efforts in helping to make our area a better place to live. One case in point is the commitment of Barry Gordon and the Variety Club organisation, who are working with the Eagleby South State School. Their goal is to raise funds for a bus for the school. Funding for the bus will assist in transporting students to activities. In that area many parents do not have transport and are unable to assist in the transport of children to various venues. Principal Andrew Barnes and Barry Gordon are working together to get the fundraising moving. They are both determined to get this project up and running very soon. The good news is that, once in place, the bus will be available for other local schools as well as community groups to use. We wish them well. I will give them all the support that I am able, to help them achieve the goal of a bus for the Eagleby South State School. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158864"></A>
At the other end of the Coomera electorate in Helensvale, a park located at the corner of Cootharaba and Ridgevale drives is a no-name park. At the instigation of a local group headed by Sonia Walsh, we are planning to have the park named. Perhaps this does not sound like a big deal, but wait, there is more. Sonia is the area coordinator of the Helensvale Neighbourhood Watch and is also involved in the residents’ progress association. Following her approach to me, I contacted parliamentary Indigenous liaison officer Brett Nutley, who has suggested a name for the park adjacent to the Coombabah Lake at Helensvale. Following consultation with Aunty Carol Currie, Brett suggested the name Ballun Ballun, which loosely means ‘creek’ or ‘water’. Following on from a comment from a local group and with the support of the parliamentary Indigenous liaison officer, we are well on our way to naming this lovely little park. We still have some work to do, but with Gold Coast City Councillor John Wayne’s support, we are confident of a positive outcome. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158872"></A>
In the first seven months of my role in the new state seat of Coomera, I have attended many Neighbourhood Watch meetings in the area. I can report that Neighbourhood Watch is alive and well, and many are doing a great job. There is a mix of well-organised and well-attended groups and Neighbourhood Watch groups that are struggling for attendance. I have seen very new Neighbourhood Watch groups that are looking for ideas and guidance. With that in mind, we need to rally the Neighbourhood Watch groups in the northern region and cross-pollinate ideas between them. It is generally agreed that we have similar issues, many of which appear specific to the northern Gold Coast region. Neighbourhood Watch groups from Gaven and Helensvale in the south to Pimpama and Ormeau in the north will be invited to a summit, with a view to networking. We will include guest speakers from areas such as the fraud squad and other successful Neighbourhood Watch groups, as well as others from the surrounding area. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Year of the Blood Donor</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Mrs SMITH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burleigh--ALP) (9.55 pm): Australia’s first Red Cross blood transfusion service was established 80 years ago and 2009 is the Year of the Blood Donor. In 1901, discovery of the four main blood groups paved the way for safer blood transfusions. Used to treat shock on the battlefields of World War I, blood transfusions remained rare in civilian medicine. Originally blood was transferred vein-to-vein from the donor to the patient, until the first rudimentary blood banks were established in the late 1930s. Generations of voluntary donors have given blood to save the lives of strangers, helping Australia provide one of the best and safest blood systems in the world.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158876"></A>
I became a blood donor following the birth of my first child. Having an Rh negative blood group and giving birth to an Rh positive baby, I was given an injection to protect any future babies I might have against antibodies that could cause serious impairment or even death. When I asked about this I was told that I could thank a blood donor for the gift. At that time it was suggested that I might consider becoming a donor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158877"></A>
Blood is vital to life, and for many people blood donors are their lifeline. Currently only one in 30 people give blood, but one in three people will need blood in their lifetime. Australia has around 500,000 existing donors and we need about 26,000 donations each week. Modern processing techniques mean that a single blood donation, when separated into its components, can help at least three different patients and contribute to making up to 22 different products, including potentially life-saving immunisations for chicken pox, hepatitis B and tetanus. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158878"></A>
The challenge for the Australian Red Cross Blood Service is to attract new donors from among the least represented groups of potential donors, particularly men and women aged between 16 and 20 and those aged between 30 and 39 years, and those from different ethnic and racial communities who often have specific blood transfusion needs related to their inherited blood types. Last week I gave my 50th donation. Whilst there have been lapses in my donations for various reasons, I am always welcomed back and am never taken for granted. It is my way of saying thank you to the stranger whose donation ensured that my babies were born healthy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158879"></A>
I ask members: are you a blood donor? If you are not, is it just because you have never got around to it? Perhaps you have never thought about it or never been closely affected by someone needing a transfusion. It does not hurt, it takes about 30 minutes and you are rewarded with a cuppa and a snack at the end. In this the Year of the Blood Donor, next time you see a mobile van I encourage you to pop in, roll up your sleeve and help save a life. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr ELMES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Noosa--LNP) (9.58 pm): Tonight I rise to deliver a ‘well done’ to the Tewantin-Noosa RSL Club and the board of management that administers the club. In the 2008-09 financial year, the Tewantin-Noosa RSL Club contributed over $307,000 of audited cash and in-kind directly back into the community--an amount well above the compulsory community benefit tax collected and distributed by the state government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158883"></A>
There are 8,930 financial members who visit and are entertained by the club through functions, gaming, and food and beverage services. It has been part of my community since 1920 and has operated as a licensed club since 1981. Over 600 returned services personnel live in the area and in excess of $140,000 was given to help them either directly or by way of a variety of other services, including courtesy buses, workshops and, of course, funding for commemorative RSL events such as Remembrance Day tomorrow. Local sporting groups including rugby league, AFL, soccer, touch football, cricket, softball, basketball and water polo are also beneficiaries of support from the Tewantin-Noosa RSL club to the tune of almost $66,000 over the last financial year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163942"></A>
What I really appreciate and commend are the efforts of the community support committee and their endeavours to support individuals in our community. They have helped out with requests for specialist medical equipment for individuals and groups which have included a special walker for a five-year-old cerebral palsy sufferer and the installation of air conditioners for a six-year-old sufferer of West Syndrome to help prevent seizures he experiences during hot temperatures. Some $7,800 was donated to help individuals and a further $37,500 has been spent on members of our community who require medical equipment or other assistance to improve their quality of life. A further $50,000 was donated via the Salvation Army to help out with the Victorian bushfires and the floods in northern Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163946"></A>
The Tewantin-Noosa RSL club can justifiably claim to be the hub of our community. It is well run, it is proactive and I, like thousands in our community, am very proud to be a member of it. To those who gather at cenotaphs in Tewantin-Noosa and across the state tomorrow I say, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr HOOLIHAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Keppel--ALP) (10.01 pm): During October people recognised some facial hair appearing on my face. I got ribbed about why I grew a moustache during October. Well, I made a mistake because I was really doing it for Movember. I would like to tell the House about Movember. Before doing so, I would like to echo one thing from the member for Burleigh. I am also a blood donor and I endorse her remarks about people becoming blood donors. I think it is part and parcel of being a public figure. Those people who have been in this House since before 2006 will remember my head being shaved, and at one stage I think my hair was coloured gold and I could not get it out of my hair. That all contributed to research for different types of illnesses that beset our community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163952"></A>
In relation to Movember, members will also notice that the Speaker has started to grow a moustache, as well as the member for Ipswich West, the member for Morayfield, me and members of staff--Rob Hansen of committee fame; the Deputy Clerk--I have not seen the Deputy Clerk’s effort yet--Joe Begley from the Speaker’s office; and James Robertson from finance. I think that is about all I can find. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163957"></A>
For those people who want to know about Movember, they can go to movember.com and have a look at the style guide. I will not table it, but this is what it looks like. People can choose what sort of moustache to grow. I would like to suggest that we in this House, our staff, our chamber staff and our parliamentary staff try to make this the biggest fundraising effort of any group. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163958"></A>
We know historically that the number of women who die from breast cancer has been reduced, but we do not as yet have any reduction in the number of men who die from prostate cancer. I think it is that macho thing where men believe they are invincible--that they are nine-feet tall and bulletproof. As they get a bit older, they find out that they are not quite that tall and that they are not quite bulletproof. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163959"></A>
This really comes back to raising funds for research. If people go to au.movember.com and then go to ‘Mo Space’, they can find out who has a moustache and they can make donations via the website. I encourage everyone to find a person of their choice or have a look at the style guide and decide which style they would like to support and make a donation for Movember and for prostate cancer. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Liquor Licensing</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Speech-Start>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (10.04 pm): This evening I would like to raise concerns related to the liquor licensing process in this state. From the outset, let me place on the record my abhorrence of excessive alcohol consumption, of the resulting socially unacceptable behaviour of some individuals--including the clear increase in incidents of glassing--and the tragic consequences of binge drinking.  </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163965"></A>
There is no doubt that nominees or what are now known as approved managers have a role in ensuring the responsible service of alcohol. My fear though is that we are now tying these individuals and businesses up in so much red tape and slugging them with ever-increasing fees and charges to the extent that we are putting large parts of the hospitality industry at risk, particularly the cafe and restaurant market in small local communities. My fear is that we are penalising the wrong party. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163966"></A>
Instead of slugging the overindulgent individual and taking them to the cleaners, we are hogtying economic development in the hospitality industry. Let me give the House some examples of this excessive red tape. A restaurant, say in a town like Maleny or Palmwoods, is hit with a liquor licence fee of $516 per annum for a five-year licence. For some pubs and clubs, this amount can rise to five figures, more than $10,000. The approved manager is now required to be on site or reasonably available during ordinary trading hours. ‘Reasonably available’ means the ability to be readily contacted by staff and the capacity to attend the premises within one hour of being contacted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163968"></A>
For small town restaurants, to allow the approved manager some respite, an owner often has to designate a second or even a third approved manager. But at what cost? As of 1 January this year, all approved managers must complete both the responsible management of a licensed venue training as well the responsible service of alcohol training programs. The responsible management of a licensed venue training program costs between $400 and $500 per person. Even though the liquor licence is for five years, approved managers must repeat this training every three years. Each individual must also pay an accreditation fee of $375. And this is on top of the responsible service of alcohol training that every staff member, including the casual hands, must complete at a cost of between $65 and $95. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163969"></A>
So let us add it all up. For a restaurant with three approved managers and 10 staff all up, the owner is looking at $516 for a licence, $1,500 in responsible management training, $1,125 in accreditation fees and $950 in responsible service training. That is a total of nearly $4,100, and that does not even factor in the staff costs associated with attending the training, completing applications and other paperwork. No wonder hospitality small business owners in the electorate of Glass House are getting cynical. They are questioning whether the liquor licensing arm of the government has been told to fund itself. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163970"></A>
There is no flexibility in the system--no recognition that a one-size-fits-all approach is inappropriate. It is clear that there is a policy-on-the-run approach. It is time that a moratorium was placed on the liquor licensing issue. Let us take a collective breath, assess how much is being raised in fees, determine if we have the balance right between the licensee and the individual, and formulate and monitor a new industry-wide approach. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms STONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Springwood--ALP) (10.07 pm): It is well known that communities with an active Neighbourhood Watch program have helped to reduce crime, reduce the fear of crime and have improved personal and public safety for their areas. Internationally and domestically it is well respected as a successful community based crime prevention program. Neighbourhood Watch has been a part of our communities for over 20 years, providing the opportunity for the community to play an active part in working with their local police to improve their safety, promote safe suburbs and reduce crime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163974"></A>
In the Springwood electorate we have a number of very active Neighbourhood Watch groups that have been proactively working in our communities, alongside our local police officers, making their areas a better place to live. One such group is Brentwood Downs Neighbourhood Watch Slacks Creek 10, coordinated by Mr John de Vaus. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163975"></A>
At a recent AGM, Mr de Vaus ensured his team received some well-deserved thanks and acknowledgment for their hard work. Officer in charge of the Slacks Creek Police Station, Senior Sergeant Geoff Thomas, Councillor John Grant and I were extremely happy to attend the AGM and present awards to the worthy recipients. I am pleased to inform the House that the following people received a silver award for five years service: Robyn Russell, John Leinonen and Peter Marriott. For three years service, a bronze award went to Kerri Lee Pattison, Iris Chiles, Rae Chiles, Marcus Jensen, Valma Jensen, Delma Thomson, Sylvia Render, Clive Render and Carol Greenfield.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163976"></A>
I take this opportunity to thank Mr John de Vaus for the work he has done for many years in leading this Neighbourhood Watch group and making sure that they remain dedicated and committed. His leadership of this Neighbourhood Watch has also ensured that the group remain relevant by keeping up to date with new challenges and they often have guest speakers come along to the meetings. The meetings also allow opportunities for members to participate and ask questions of interest to them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163977"></A>
The local police have always worked alongside our Neighbourhood Watch groups and I was extremely pleased that Senior Constable Steve Shipman from the Springwood police beat recently was awarded the Neighbourhood Watch Police Community Liaison Award at the Neighbourhood Watch State Conference. Many people in the Springwood community know Senior Constable Shipman through his work with Neighbourhood Watch groups and also in the local community with schools, youth groups and the Logan East Community Neighbourhood Association.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164018"></A>
I also want to take this opportunity to mention Senior Constable Tom McKinnon and his family from the Springwood police beat who have recently transferred to Hervey Bay. Tom will be very missed in our community. He was extremely well known in schools. He was instrumental in the successful running of our men’s group. He worked hand in hand on many occasions with LECNA and brought joy to our senior citizens at Christmas time, when he took them on a carols and lights tour. He is certainly a big loss to our community. I wish Tom and his family all the very best in Hervey Bay. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164021"></A>
I also want to thank Assistant Commissioner Paul Wilson, Superintendent Alistair Dawson, and Senior Sergeant Geoff Thomas for their hard work in ensuring that the Slacks Creek Police Station at Daisy Hill was able to find suitable accommodation as the upgrade of the M1 takes place. I believe that the location is a win-win for our community. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Kennedy Highway Upgrade</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr KNUTH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Dalrymple--LNP) (10.10 pm): On 4 August this year I tabled a petition calling on the minister to urgently upgrade the Kennedy Highway from the Evelyn Road-Kennedy Highway junction to the intersection of Kennedy Highway and Tumoulin Road so it could be designated a permanent B-double route. There were more than 1,100 signatories to the petition, such is the depth of concern of road users and the community. The minister’s response to the petition was nothing short of pathetic. While it acknowledged that safe and efficient freight transport operations are vital to support primary producers in the Ravenshoe area, it offered little in the way of fixing the serious problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164030"></A>
A key factor here is to ensure that produce transported by B-doubles is fresh. This requires the fastest transport times to the market to ensure that freshness and potential sale price are not compromised. Another key factor is a safe highway, and B-doubles are designated to the Kennedy Highway to ensure that the township of Ravenshoe is free from B-doubles and prime movers. This is all common sense.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164032"></A>
Currently a permit system is utilised, but this is not suitable as permits do not provide certainty. If a local producer does not have a permit, their produce is double handled, increasing the time to access the market and affecting the freshness of the produce. One load is sitting by the side of the road awaiting transport. The trucks have to do two trips to take a double load to the markets, increasing the volume of traffic on this section, causing damage to the existing road structure and increasing the risk of accidents for all road users. During this time the fruit and vegetables are on the back of the truck while many times in that area it is raining. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164033"></A>
Add to this the constraints due to fatigue management requirements and the impact on the transport of fresh produce is compounded. Any delays in the transport of produce could result in the loss of the entire produce. According to the minister, investigations to determine the cost and scope of works involved to upgrade the intersection have been carried out. However, the minister failed to find any funding to upgrade the intersection, despite his assurances that the safety of all road users is the department’s No. 1 priority.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164034"></A>
While the government accepts the necessity for safe and efficient freight transport and maintains that the safety of all road users is paramount, it is not willing to provide a solution to the problem that is the scourge of all primary producers, local residents and road users utilising this intersection. By upgrading the intersection and adjacent road sections, the road will be safe for all road users and provide a suitable and permanent B-double route away from the centre of town that is safer for all residents and satisfactory for farmers and truck drivers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1164035"></A>
Unless funds are allocated to improving and upgrading this road, all industries will suffer. This region produces millions in gross revenue yet has an access road that is described as a billygoat track. I call on the minister for the benefit of all to take a trip north, provide a few crumbs and fix the problem once and for all. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms van LITSENBURG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Redcliffe--ALP) (10.13 pm): This Saturday is World Diabetes Day, marking the relentless rise of this chronic disease that appears to be mild but is currently the fourth leading cause of death globally. One person every 10 seconds dies of diabetes related issues. Diabetes is a complex disease. The secondaries include blindness, loss of feeling in digits, loss of digits or limbs, heart attack and stroke. </Hansard-Body>

My electorate of Redcliffe is one of the diabetes hot spots in the state, so it is vital that they have effective education programs and access to healthy living programs. Only under this Labor government do my constituents have the opportunities they need to get medical and community based support to manage their diabetes. The Bligh government is actively working to improve the lives of all Queenslanders through our Toward Q2 targets for Queensland to become the healthiest state. This strategy works to reduce the growth of diabetes. </Hansard-Body>

The Queensland government has a variety of practical programs to action this strategy including Smart Eating for a Healthier State, which set a 10-year goal to improve Queenslanders’ health through good nutrition. The Eat Well, Be Active program brought allied health, community groups, professional associations and Queenslanders together to set up programs and find solutions to obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases. </Hansard-Body>

The Healthy Food and Drink Supply Strategy for Queensland Schools has delivered better nutritional solutions for students. The Healthy Queensland Awards challenged Queenslanders to find their own healthier, more active solutions. Redcliffe pulled together to produce a community based eight-week program of activities for families and individuals to participate in and enjoy together. Exposing Diabetes seminars help Queenslanders living with diabetes to understand their disease and learn how to manage it. They are very popular, and both seminars held in Redcliffe recently were attended by over 400 people. Because we are planning for positive futures for Queenslanders, stopping diabetes in its tracks is vital, so all of these strategies are pieces of the solution. </Hansard-Body>

These initiatives are a preventative part of an effective health system. The Bligh government works with the community to find practical solutions to sedentary, fast-food lifestyles which lead to obesity and diabetes, giving people ownership of the solutions. Together this Labor government and Queenslanders can make the changes that will lead to healthier futures for all Queenslanders. <Hansard-Speech-End>
