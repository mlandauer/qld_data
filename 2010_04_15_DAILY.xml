Health Funding Reform</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998564"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.33 am): Our government has been working very closely with the Prime Minister, the federal health minister and representatives of the federal government to ensure that the proposed Commonwealth health reform package delivers real benefits for Queenslanders. At the last COAG meeting held here in Brisbane in December last year, Queensland highlighted the following areas that must be addressed to achieve a better health system. We outlined the need for more funding for hospitals to match growing demand, the need to fix aged care to take the pressure off our hospitals, tackling the disconnect between GPs, hospitals and community health, the need to tackle workforce shortages and the need to have a much greater focus on disease prevention. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998701"></A>
For the first time, the Prime Minister has recognised that the federal government needs to do more and not less in meeting the costs of providing hospital services around Australia. States have carried this burden for too long with much lower revenue raising capacities than the Commonwealth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998758"></A>
Queensland therefore welcomes the Commonwealth becoming the dominant funder of our hospital systems. While we as a state will have to give up some GST revenue for this to occur, it will help secure a more sustainable financial future for the health system as a whole and for all of us as taxpayers. Why? Simply because the Commonwealth has accepted responsibility as a 60 per cent funding partner in the hospital system for funding growth. I also said that I would not be signing up unless there was extra money to meet the growing demand for hospital services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998870"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Horan:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 It’s just taking it out of the GST. What’s the difference?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998879"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The Commonwealth’s recent announcements regarding additional investments in elective surgery and emergency departments will also assist in treating more patients and reducing waiting times in Queensland public hospitals. I also expressed a number of concerns to the Prime Minister and through officials that the proposed model for activity based funding could seriously disadvantage small, rural and regional hospitals throughout Queensland. I have demanded that any agreement will have to include specific protections for such hospitals and the Commonwealth has agreed that those hospitals can and will be block funded. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998979"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Horan:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 And big hospitals, difficult cases will get shoved over to them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998989"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I note the interjections from the former health minister under the Liberal National Party whose contribution to health was to introduce a tax on hospitals. I also called on the Prime Minister to take pressure off our public hospitals by addressing the Commonwealth’s own areas of responsibility: aged care, primary care and health workforce shortages. I am pleased that the Prime Minister’s recently announced additional funding initiatives recognise the need to do more in these areas. States can only get on with the business of running public hospitals if the Commonwealth makes sure that its own parts of the surrounding health systems are functioning effectively. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000644"></A>
On any given night there are around 340 aged-care patients occupying expensive acute public hospital beds due to the lack of available alternatives. Under the Commonwealth’s reform package, Queensland’s hospitals will get about an extra 400 flexible aged-care places to help offset the costs of elderly patients in public hospitals. Around $56 million will be available to Queensland to especially deal with these patients. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999186"></A>
We know that our health system can do better in terms of coordinating care for people who are frequent users of the system. Queensland welcomes the Commonwealth’s new primary health care organisations and the $436 million investment in coordinated care for people living with diabetes. These new organisations will need to work closely with the new local health networks to improve the integration of hospital and community based services for patients, particularly the chronically ill and the elderly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999279"></A>
One of the great difficulties experienced across a regionalised state like Queensland for many years has been the insufficient number of GPs in rural, remote and regional Queensland. This is an issue that I and the health minister, the Deputy Premier, have repeatedly pushed with the Commonwealth. The increase in the number of GP training places, including a doubling of the number of GP training places in rural and remote communities, by 2014 is welcome. It will assist in improving access to services in Queensland communities that are currently missing out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999386"></A>
Without doubt stopping people from becoming ill in the first place is key to relieving pressure on our health system and improving health outcomes. This has been recognised by the Commonwealth with the new primary health care organisations also delivering health promotion and preventative health programs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999444"></A>
Australians and Queenslanders want reform of the hospital system. They want to see a better deal between the levels of government and, in my view, they want to see levels of government working together in their interest. Queensland will be heading off to COAG on Sunday and at the meeting on Monday looking for a good deal for Queensland, a better deal, and a deal that is right for our state. </Hansard-Body>

People’s Question Time</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001877"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.38 am): The first two people’s question time sessions of this year on the future of education and the challenges and opportunities of growth have been a success. Thousands of Queenslanders have taken up the opportunity to take part in people’s question time, watching live online or submitting their questions and ideas for discussion. So successful has this new initiative been that it seems that even the UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, is following in Queensland’s footsteps, holding his first people’s Prime Minister’s question time session just last week. I do not know about our UK counterparts, but Queenslanders certainly have not been backwards in coming forwards so far, with tough questions and thought-provoking suggestions about the topics that we have covered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001878"></A>
I am pleased to announce today that Queenslanders will have their next opportunity to be involved in people’s question time on 27 May. Instead of having a specific theme, this session will be a general session open to questions about anything and everything that Queenslanders want to ask about. I look forward to discussions on any topic, whether it is job creation, law and order, assets sales, our health system, daylight saving and everything else in between. As always, I do not see any of the questions before the session and those that get asked on the day will be chosen by our independent moderator. Questions can be submitted online. Just go to the Queensland government website and click the people’s question time link. I hope Queenslanders take this opportunity to again raise their concerns with their government. </Hansard-Body>

Ballet Nacional de Cuba</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<A ID="pgfId-1001883"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.40 am): On a more cultural note, it is with pleasure that I inform the House that later this year Queensland will welcome to Brisbane one of the world’s most acclaimed performance companies, the Ballet Nacional de Cuba, which will perform in Brisbane from 24 September to 3 October. The Queensland Performing Arts Centre will be the only venue in Australia to host this magnificent company--another in a string of significant cultural coups for Queensland. This extraordinary company will present its production of Don Quixote, one of the most famous ballets in the world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001887"></A>
The Ballet Nacional de Cuba was created in 1948 and has toured in more than 58 countries, drawing on its vast repertoire of both the classics and modern ballets. This exclusive presentation follows in the footsteps of last year’s exclusive to Brisbane season for the Paris Opera Ballet and is again part of the ongoing collaboration between QPAC and Queensland Events. The Ballet Nacional de Cuba will feature in the Brisbane Festival and coincide with another international blockbuster also taking place at the cultural centre, and that is ‘Valentino, Retrospective: Past/Present/Future’, which will be presented at GoMA from 7 August to 14 November. It will be a cultural smorgasbord in that part of the year. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As the Minister for Sport has just interjected, there will also be that other great cultural event--football finals. So people will have more than enough to satisfy every taste. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001894"></A>
I am also pleased to inform the House that QPAC will offer specially discounted tickets to dance schools and school groups to ensure that young people have access to this very rare opportunity. Last year’s sell-out season of the Paris Opera Ballet attracted 25,000 people, 5,000 of whom travelled from other parts of Australia to be part of it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001896"></A>
These major productions mark a new era for QPAC, with last year’s $34 million refurbishment funded by our government. The Ballet Nacional de Cuba presentation is also a great coup for QPAC when it is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. This is an exclusive opportunity for Brisbane. These performances by the Ballet Nacional de Cuba will further cement Queensland’s profile as a cultural destination of growing international renown. </Hansard-Body>

Queensland Health, Payroll System</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001902"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (9.43 am): I rise to update the House again on the ongoing efforts to resolve the Queensland Health payroll system difficulties and determine what went wrong. As I set out in parliament yesterday, there is a range of steps in place to provide support to staff who are facing hardship from the payroll transition. From payroll 1, 1,800 people have been identified as receiving no or little pay. All 1,800, I am advised, have been subsequently processed. From payroll 2, as at 5 pm yesterday I am advised that 879 staff have been identified as experiencing hardship and all 879 are being case managed. Yesterday an additional 134 staff were identified as experiencing hardship, and all 134 are being individually case managed and offered support to meet their particular circumstances. These numbers do not include the numbers of other workers with required variations to their pay. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001903"></A>
To fix this problem we need to be clear about what went wrong and why. As I advised the House yesterday, it has long been a matter of public record that the development of Queensland Health’s new payroll system faced significant technical hurdles that delayed the project prior to ‘go live’ sign-off. The project was delivered by a project board, including a representative of IBM, which was responsible for tailoring the software, the chief information officer of Queensland Health and CorpTech. I described in the House yesterday the numerous delays the project faced before delivery. Each one of these delays represents a decision by the expert members of the project board that the system was not ready for use and further work needed to be done on it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001904"></A>
In July, September and November 2008 and in May, June and October 2009, the board determined that the project was not yet ready for go live and more work needed to be done. This is a matter of public record. I table a copy of a document that has been referred to in the media today which was drafted as a brief to me in June last year describing problems in the system as at that time.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Paper-Heading>

 Briefing note, dated 6 July 2009, titled ‘Interim Payroll Replacement--QHIC’.</Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003235"></A>
The document is apparent on its face that it was not signed and approved by the relevant executive director or the deputy director-general or the director-general. Nor, am I advised, was it sent to my office at that time. But the fact that the payroll system development had very significant issues at the time was well known. I stated as much in the House yesterday. The fact is that when the document was drafted in June 2009 the payroll system was still in development. That is why the project board decided not to go live at that time or indeed for another nine months. The <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 this morning on its front page included a tear-off of the top of the brief. If it had added the very next part of the brief--that is, the act of recommendation--it would have clearly shown the words--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001908"></A>
That you note issues in relation to the IBM contract with CorpTech and that both CorpTech and Queensland Health are working to obtain a solution to the issues. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001909"></A>
As a result of the issues identified in that document, the system ‘go live’ was delayed in June 2009 and again in October 2009. In late 2009 my office was advised--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001911"></A>
The ... Project Board met on 19 October 2009, to assess the progress of User Acceptance Testing. The Board agreed that the criteria defined to allow for exit from UAT had not been met. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<A ID="pgfId-1001912"></A>
...</Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001913"></A>
The Board has extended UAT so that the criteria can be met. The consequence of this decision is that a system Go Live is not possible in 2009. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001914"></A>
It also noted the significant issues with the current payroll and rostering systems Lattice and ESP. It was returned by my adviser for further action. I table a copy of that brief.</Hansard-Body>

So there were issues. A decision was made not to proceed with go live until they were fixed and a commitment was given to fix them. In February of this year, some eight months after the issues were raised in the June document and one more month before go live, the same officer--the same officer--signed off a briefing note to project board managers stating that all outstanding issues were ‘manageable risk’ and can be completed on time for go live.

Ultimately, on 14 March 2010, the project board--made up of the four most senior IT officers involved in the project--certified that the project was ready to go live.

KPMG has been engaged to review what went wrong. I want very clear answers about how this happened. It is simply not good enough. As I have stated very clearly, Queensland Health staff and indeed the taxpayer are entitled to rely on IT and payroll executives who are well paid to get their job done properly. When senior people certify that the payroll system is approved for go live, we are all entitled to expect that to be an accurate assessment. But my immediate priority is to get the problems rectified and get our hardworking staff their money. Our staff did nothing wrong. We need to fix this. </Hansard-Body>

Health Funding Reform</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001925"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (9.48 am): I join the Premier in recognising the benefits for Queensland of the Prime Minister’s proposed health reforms. In the short term, over the current forward estimates period from 2010-11 to 2013-14, the Commonwealth government has recently announced a range of initiatives to support the establishment of a new way of funding health into the future. The announced Commonwealth investment across critical areas of hospital services, GP and primary care, workforce training and aged care, like any investment in health, is welcomed by this government. I note that no-one in this debate is arguing for less funding for the health system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001928"></A>
Of the almost $3 billion earmarked nationally over the next four years, approximately $600 million will be to the benefit of health services in Queensland. That is around $150 million per annum against a health bottom line that already stands at $9 billion. In reality every bit helps. Voters and patients do not want a debate about funding splits. They want to see a health system that has the capacity to meet current and future demand. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001966"></A>
Critical to the Prime Minister’s health reform plan is a longer term commitment for the Commonwealth government to become the major funder of hospital and primary healthcare services. Forget about the here and now of the debate--the colour and light and the posturing--what this debate should be about is the longer term future of health funding.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001967"></A>
The Bligh government is unashamedly pro reform. We know that the proportion of the population aged over 80 years will quadruple in the next 35 years, that the proportion aged over 65 will double and that the proportion of those supporting this population will halve. We also know that health costs are accelerating, year on year, at around 10 to 11 per cent, while the GST grows at around six per cent. Our health budget has accelerated from $4.6 billion in 2003-04 to $9 billion this year. The reality is that, at this rate of growth, the future demands of the health system bring into question the financing capacities of the states under current state-federal financial relations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001968"></A>
Eighty per cent of tax revenue in this nation is collected by the Commonwealth. That is the starting point for why reform that sees it become the dominant funder is, without question, the only course of action open to those who are truly acting in the long-term interests of the nation and the people who rely on our public health system. My counterparts in other states who missed this point also missed the point about the future needs of our nation’s health system. The federal government has estimated the additional funding contribution that it would make to Queensland over the six years from 2014 under the new system at around $3.4 billion. That is a fair way off, but this is also about the challenge that our ageing population presents us. Our demographic destiny is clear, and we need to act now. While this represents a model, there is no doubt that there will be real benefits in the long term from utilising the GST revenue for a Commonwealth funding commitment to meet 60 per cent of hospital funding and 100 per cent of primary healthcare services.</Hansard-Body>

Natural Disaster Resilience Program</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (9.52 am): So far this year cyclones, storms and flooding have caused more than $500 million in damage to communities across the state, and this figure will continue to rise. With the changing weather patterns, it is likely natural disaster events in Queensland will be more regular and more severe in coming years. That is why the Bligh government has partnered with the Rudd government to provide $44 million in funding over four years through the Natural Disaster Resilience Program to help minimise the impact of natural disasters in Queensland communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001973"></A>
While this government continues to boost community resilience against natural disasters, the National Party continues to undermine public confidence in our disaster response system. Last week, the member for Mirani circulated a media release making ridiculous claims about the government’s response to the flooding situation in Burketown and surrounding communities. What he was actually criticising was the commendable efforts of the Local Disaster Management Group under the leadership of the acting mayor with support from Emergency Management Queensland. While the member for Mirani typed up his whingeing media release, Emergency Services staff and volunteers, local council staff and members of the Burke Local Disaster Management Group were proactively responding to their community’s needs. I was also receiving regular advice from local member Betty Kiernan, my new Parliamentary Secretary for Emergency Services, along with the acting mayor and Emergency Management Queensland. Activities on the ground included resupply of food and essentials, helicopter rescues and evacuations, and forward planning for the recovery phase.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001974"></A>
Communities in the region are still affected by flood waters, and I commend the Local Disaster Management Group and EMQ for the support they have provided. This is just another example of how the government is getting on with the job while the National Party continues to whinge and whine. I just note that, under the National Party’s promised three per cent cut to departmental expenditure, initiatives such as the Natural Disaster Resilience Program would have been under severe threat. </Hansard-Body>

 Today I will be announcing the successful applicants for the program’s first round of funding. The Department of Community Safety received 58 applications for this round valued at more than $14 million. Applications were assessed by a group including representatives of the Local Government Association, Emergency Management Queensland and Queensland Fire and Rescue Service. Thirty-seven projects valued at $7.1 million were recommended and I have approved that funding. Some of the funded programs include: a community disaster preparedness and education program in the Fraser Coast area; a flood plain management strategy for the Fitzroy River in Rockhampton; an evacuation plan for Gold Coast city and the Cairns region; a local area natural disaster risk assessment in Toowoomba; a flood mitigation program for the southern section of the Cairns CBD; an early warning system for Mount Glorious; and a coastal erosion investigation and mitigation in the Whitsundays. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001980"></A>
Projects funded in this round and subsequent rounds will ensure communities across the state are better placed to respond to, and recover from, future natural disasters. The Natural Disaster Resilience Program is just another demonstration of the government’s commitment to emergency services and community resilience. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. TS MULHERIN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland) (9.55 am): Today I have been granted leave from parliament to represent the Premier at the Central Queensland Leading the Way Regional Summit in Dysart. The Central Queensland regional summit will include representatives from local, state and federal governments, industry and business. I will be very interested to hear what they have to say about growth in regional Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001984"></A>
At the recently held Queensland Growth Management Summit, attendees gave a strong message--that we need greater regionalisation for Queensland. At the Queensland Growth Management Summit, the Premier committed to developing a Queensland Regionalisation Strategy for consultation by the end of the year. The discussion at today’s Central Queensland regional summit will feed into the policy development of that consultation paper. The strategy is aimed at managing regional growth for the benefit of the regions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001985"></A>
The message was clear from the Queensland growth summit: more people will be attracted to live in regional Queensland if the infrastructure is in place to support them. This means not only jobs but also housing, schools, health care, transport and lifestyle requirements need to be met. Central Queensland contains some of the most valuable mineral resources on earth, with vast reserves of coal and coal seam methane gas. Over the last 50 years, the Bowen Basin has become the world’s largest exporter of seaborne coal. At the same time, we are witnessing the creation of the new liquefied natural gas industry, with an estimated $40 billion to be invested in the next decade, creating 18,000 jobs. Our challenge is to ensure that this extraordinary economic and population growth over coming years leads to attractive lifestyles and secure communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001986"></A>
The recent Queensland growth summit was a great platform to discuss the issues of economic and population growth and how it can be managed to be liveable and sustainable. The Central Queensland regional summit aims to follow on from this success and give a voice to those in the regions to discuss how they see the future management of population and economic growth working in their area. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. D BOYLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships) (9.57 am): Today I am releasing the Queensland Treasury Corporation’s report into 25 council submissions regarding the cost of their local government amalgamations. Twenty-four of the 25 councils are included in the report, with the Torres Strait Island Regional Council subject to continuing review. The report will be available online this afternoon and on the department’s website. This is the summary report prepared by QTC. Each of the 25 councils will also receive individual reports prepared by QTC responding to their submissions and detailing the costs and the benefits of amalgamation and each council’s liquidity and financial sustainability position.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001992"></A>
At the time of amalgamation, it was signalled by the Local Government Reform Commission that North Burnett and South Burnett regional councils had financial sustainability issues. Further review by the QTC has confirmed the need for assistance for these two councils. The report identified that North Burnett and South Burnett regional council forecasts indicate ‘that sustainability remains a significant issue for these local governments’. The QTC report identified a further three local governments that, while having access to adequate liquidity, also have weak forecast operating positions. I quote from the report--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001997"></A>
However, the reviewed cost of amalgamation, while contributing to the operating deficit, is not the prime reason for the deficits. These deficits are predominantly structural in nature as the cost of ongoing service provision exceeds the revenues available to the local governments through rates and utilities income, fees and charges etc.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003342"></A>
These three councils are Southern Downs, Toowoomba and Whitsunday regional councils. Southern Downs Regional Council, in line with the recommendation, will receive funding. However, in relation to Toowoomba and Whitsunday regional councils, recent events have led to both of these local governments already having received a considerable financial boost. The Bligh government committed $112 million to Toowoomba Regional Council for the huge Toowoomba pipeline project, and Whitsunday Regional Council has received a commitment of $15.6 million toward sewage treatment plant upgrades and another $7 million for the upgrade of the Whitsunday coast airport.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003348"></A>
Another two councils will also receive funding. The QTC individual reports identified financial liquidity and sustainability issues for both Scenic Rim and Isaac regional councils, and accordingly they too will receive government assistance. A preliminary assessment of sustainability issues for Torres Strait Island Regional Council recommends further assistance for that council also. In summary, then, a total of $18.3 million will be provided as follows: North Burnett Regional Council, $348,524; South Burnett Regional Council, $1.127 million; Scenic Rim Regional Council, $2.79 million; Southern Downs Regional Council, $2.38 million; Isaac Regional Council, $4.06 million; and the Torres Strait Island Regional Council, $7.58 million.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003358"></A>
While those other councils that put in submissions may be disappointed to not receive top-up funds, the QTC report is nonetheless good news for them because the independent adjudicator has examined their financial position and confirmed their financial sustainability. The department will work with those six councils receiving this funding to ensure that satisfactory proposals are in place to address operating deficits and other transitional tasks. </Hansard-Body>

Hotel Gaming Machines, Moratorium Extension</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003361"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PJ LAWLOR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southport--ALP) (Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading) (10.02 am): Today I am announcing the extension of the moratorium on hotel gaming machines for two years. In 2001 hotel gaming machines were capped at 18,843 and increased to 20,000 in 2005 due to population growth, with the increase to be made available over five years. In 2008, the progressive increase in the cap was put on hold by the Queensland government to slow the growth of gaming machines. At that time the cap stood at 19,310. The two-year moratorium was due to end on 16 April 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003363"></A>
The release of the Productivity Commission report on gambling is imminent, and it is appropriate that the government give thorough consideration to its recommendations before making further decisions that may affect the availability of gambling. Also, it is unlikely that the hotel industry will be significantly disadvantaged by the extension of the moratorium as the demand for gaming machines has slowed significantly in the last couple of years. We understand community concern over poker machines and need to ensure that they are distributed throughout Queensland responsibly. A cap on poker machines results in an inevitable hit to gaming revenue, but it is action that we are prepared to take in the interests of community safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003364"></A>
In addition to the cap on hotel gaming machines, the Queensland government permanently capped club gaming machines at 24,705 in 2008 and put an end to gaming in pubs and clubs before 10 am throughout the state. As a result of these harm minimisation measures, the most recent household gambling survey indicates that problem gambling affects only 0.37 per cent of the adult population in Queensland, but of course one problem gambler is one too many. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003365"></A>
The Queensland government provides funding to community groups and non-profit organisations that are derived from gambling. In the 2008-09 financial year more than 2,250 community groups throughout Queensland received over $42.2 million from community benefit funds. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. KL STRUTHERS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Algester--ALP) (Minister for Community Services and Housing and Minister for Women) (10.04 am): The Bligh government has entered a new era in social housing. We are in the middle of the biggest housing investment by the Queensland and Australian governments that this state has ever seen. The former Howard government starved the states and territories of funding for social housing. We are building a range of new housing integrated into communities where it is needed, and where children and families get the best possible life opportunities. The high concentration of public housing on the fringes of towns is a legacy we want to leave well in the past. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003369"></A>
Social housing is needed on the Gold Coast, so we are building it on the Gold Coast. It is needed in Cairns, so we are building it in Cairns. It is needed in inner-city Brisbane, so we are building it in inner-city Brisbane. People who register for social housing live in all of these communities, and usually want and need to stay in these communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003371"></A>
Yesterday I joined federal housing minister Tanya Plibersek to officially launch a groundbreaking homeless accommodation and support service at South Brisbane for up to 145 people. The development will bring hope to the new tenants who will call Hope Street home on the former Gambaro’s Seafood site. The development is modelled on the highly successful common ground model first introduced in New York in the 1990s. Under the common ground concept, long-term accommodation for people caught in a cycle of chronic homelessness is coupled with on-site support. The building will be developed in line with Brisbane City Council’s vision for the area. It will be a positive addition to the street, with ground level retail areas and 24-hour concierge style security. Brisbane not-for-profit organisation Micah Projects has been funded with almost $2 million for support and street-to-home services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003377"></A>
The federal government is providing around $40 million for construction and land under the nation building stimulus package. The project is expected to create around 300 jobs for Queenslanders. Around 300 people sleep rough in inner-city Brisbane each night. A safe place to live and appropriate help will offer tenants a real chance at sustaining accommodation and getting back on their feet. The Bligh government is helping people who are doing it tough to find a roof over their head. We are achieving this through a number of initiatives from the biggest social housing investment ever to initiatives to help people in the private rental sector like Rentconnect and the National Rent Affordability Scheme. All members ought to get behind this new era in social housing. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. A PALASZCZUK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Inala--ALP) (Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs) (10.06 am): I have great news for Queensland about disability housing. The Bligh government will invest $9.1 million this financial year to provide more accommodation for Queenslanders with a disability. Queenslanders with a disability need a helping hand, and that is what we are giving them. Delivering better accommodation for Queenslanders with a disability is one of my key priorities, and these funds are targeted at people with special accommodation needs. It will give them access to modern accommodation appropriate to them. This is about helping Queenslanders to live independently in their own homes. It will particularly benefit ageing carers of children with a disability and those with an urgent need for accommodation support.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003383"></A>
Where is this new disability housing? It is in Ingham, Rockhampton, Bundaberg, Maryborough, Kingaroy, Sunnybank, Regents Park, Alexandra Hills, Mitchelton, Capalaba and Emerald. Today I am announcing even more new housing for people with a disability: $3.4 million will go towards housing in Pine Rivers, in Innisfail, in Ipswich and in Gladstone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003384"></A>
We are also committed to the $430 million Home and Community Care Program in partnership with the Commonwealth. This initiative is also helping frail older Queenslanders and younger people with a disability live independently for longer. Funding home modifications that make life easier is one of the best ways to keep people living independently and to prevent them entering residential aged care. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003386"></A>
Last week jointly with the Commonwealth we announced an extra $672,000. This will go to 28 Queensland organisations to carry out important home modifications for Queenslanders with a disability--things like handrails, ramps, emergency alarms and easy-to-use tap fittings which do not cost a lot of money and which can make a world of difference.</Hansard-Body>

He was a well-respected president of Poland, and I know that members will join with me and members of the Polish community in mourning his passing. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. KJ JONES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ashgrove--ALP) (Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability) (10.09 am): As an energy and water saving program, the ClimateSmart Home Service has been one of our government’s biggest success stories and Queenslanders continue to sign up in droves. To date, more than 165,000 Queensland homeowners have taken advantage of this service, collectively saving up to $75 million on their power and water bills. The ClimateSmart Home Service is currently achieving a customer satisfaction rating of 96 per cent and the response has always been strong. We have seen up to 5,000 homes being completed in just one week. It is a program that has had bipartisan support from those opposite and from the Brisbane City Council. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004861"></A>
The Bligh government’s commitment is to reach 260,000 ClimateSmart homes and we are well on track to get there. We will deliver the remaining 95,000 services to Queensland homes by the end of this year. The Department of Environment and Resource Management has a contract with Local Government Infrastructure Services to deliver this successful program. I can advise members that LGIS is transitioning to a new supplier at the end of next month, Service Stream Infrastructure Services. This will have no effect on Queenslanders who have either booked a ClimateSmart Home Service or are intending to. It will be business as usual. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004864"></A>
Homeowners will continue to receive the same level of service and advice from fully qualified electricians. LGIS is working with both private sector subcontractors--Fieldforce and Service Stream--to ensure a smooth transition period for both customers and service delivery staff. Additionally, every effort will be made to ensure that staff currently involved in the ClimateSmart Home Service will have the opportunity to transition their employment with the new service provider. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004866"></A>
Service Stream’s call centre is based in Geebung and Service Stream already employs more than 700 full-time and contract staff in Queensland. Service Stream currently manages logistics and call centre contracts for Telstra, Optus, Vodafone and over 20 of Australia’s major electricity, gas and water distributors and retailers. I look forward to seeing the successful completion of the ClimateSmart Home Service initiative--one of the largest residential energy efficiency and behavioural change programs to ever have been undertaken in this country. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (10.11 am): On Tuesday the Premier and I announced the new Queensland government Solar Hot Water Rebate Scheme. Straightaway we got the thumbs up from industry, which knows that solar is a logical choice for the Sunshine State. They are pleased that this new scheme will continue to drive consumer uptake of solar and strengthen the solar industry in Queensland. They know we want to make Queensland the solar state, and they are right behind us. But so are ordinary Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004872"></A>
They know the Queensland sun shines hot and bright every day, in every corner of our state. They understand that our sun is one of our greatest resources and understand the environmental benefits of going solar. They also know a good deal when they see one. Getting an additional $600 or $1,000 off the government is a good deal in anyone’s language. With other incentives, people can save up to $3,300 on the purchase price for switching from electric hot water to solar, plus there are ongoing savings on every single electricity bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004874"></A>
On Tuesday, the Premier and I met Brett Gillespie and his wife, Elizabeth. They are ordinary Queenslanders doing the bright thing, and have shown us the benefits of switching to solar. They have cut around 25 per cent off their power bill by switching from electric to solar hot water and by installing solar power panels to tap into the sun’s energy. They are being more energy conscious too by doing easy things like switching to low energy light bulbs and using more energy efficient appliances. Not only have they cut their electricity bill; they have had the pleasure of being paid the state government’s solar bonus for the solar energy they have fed back into the grid.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004875"></A>
The good news is that there are many more who want to follow their example. As at close of business yesterday the application pack for the new solar hot water rebate had already been downloaded over 700 times. It is an encouraging start and shows Queenslanders are keen to save with solar. </Hansard-Body>

Next week the much anticipated upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway from Wacol to Darra will be open for business. This upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway is one of the biggest road projects currently underway anywhere in the country. It is a $2.5 billion project and a big jobs generator. All up it has created around 10,000 jobs for road workers. We are giving road workers jobs and job security and we are building a safer and more secure road network for motorists and other road users.

The pressures of rapid resource development, particularly in coalmining areas, has resulted in the use of temporary buildings of a poor standard that fail to adequately provide for the health, safety and general comfort of the workers who reside in them. While many providers of temporary accommodation deliver an outstandingly good product, current building regulations do not address minimum standards for temporary accommodation buildings, particularly those in mining regions. As far as I am concerned, that is just not good enough. Those in the industry work hard and deserve better. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004896"></A>
After extensive consultation with key stakeholders, the Bligh government has created a new code under the Queensland Development Code which will be delivered state-wide. This new code will apply wherever temporary accommodation is provided for rent or as part of a workplace agreement. It will also apply to other temporary accommodation buildings such as granny flats or where a person lives on site while a permanent building is being constructed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004897"></A>
The changes will: create a limit of 24 months for the definition of temporary accommodation; require compliance with the relevant provisions of the Building Code of Australia; and improve the health and safety of the occupants. The state government is aware the Queensland Resources Council has concerns about the changes, which are estimated to cost the mining industry approximately $18 million per year. However, given the thousands of Queensland workers directly impacted and the potential expansion of the industry across the state, improving conditions is imperative. The Bligh government is committed to improving conditions for mine employees who work hard and deserve better. </Hansard-Body>

Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
 after it grounded on Douglas Shoal, had washed up on a nearby island. On North West Island more than 25 people worked to clear oil from a stretch of beach. Small globules of oil about the size of a 50c piece were removed and crews filled and removed five bags of oil mixed with sand. There was significantly less oil on Tryon Island, with around half a bucket full of oil and sand removed. While the amounts of oil removed may have been small, this remains a serious issue. Crews will conduct further inspections today so that any oil that does wash up can be identified and cleaned up as quickly as possible. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (10.19 am): The Bligh government has been consistently tough on crime across the full spectrum of the criminal justice system. We have increased police numbers, we have toughened up penalties for serious offences and we have introduced laws to dismantle criminal organisations. Another important aspect of our ongoing campaign against crime is our proceeds of crime legislation. This legislation allows the Crime and Misconduct Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions to seek court orders restraining and forfeiting proceeds of crime and tainted property, including cash, possessions and even people’s homes. The incentive to become involved in crime is reduced when criminals face the prospect of losing their ill-gotten gains, as well as any other penalties a court may impose.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006230"></A>
The impact of our legislation was highlighted last year when the CMC reached an important milestone--the $100 million mark for the value of proceeds of crime collected. Last year we passed amendments to the Criminal Proceeds Confiscation Act 2002--amendments that have now been in place for almost 12 months. During the development of the Criminal Organisation Bill last year, the government made a decision to review the effectiveness of these changes, and I can inform the House that this review has started. A working party has been convened by the Department of Justice and Attorney-General and key stakeholders will be asked to make submissions to the review. In particular, the review will look at how last year’s amendments are working, along with recent developments in other jurisdictions in relation to unexplained wealth and the sharing of proceeds of crime between jurisdictions following successful cases. The review will also consider any changes that may be required to further strengthen and improve the act. If the review finds that we can do more in relation to cracking down on criminals, particularly those involved in organised crime, then the government is prepared to consider further changes to this legislation. The Bligh Labor government is determined to continue its tough-on-crime stance, and this latest review will help identify and investigate any further areas to ensure that crime does not pay in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (10.21 am): Just before Anzac Day last year the Department of Public Works launched the online Queensland War Memorial Register website. One year on, there are now some 1,100 war memorials listed on the online register, with more going up every week. The War Memorial Register helps to further honour Queenslanders who served and often died for their country. In the past year the standout addition to the Queensland War Memorial Register has been that of the <Hansard-Italic>
Centaur</Hansard-Italic>
. As members would be aware, the <Hansard-Italic>
Centaur</Hansard-Italic>
 was attacked and sunk off the coast of Queensland during World War II, killing 268 people. The <Hansard-Italic>
Centaur</Hansard-Italic>
’s final resting place was found in December last year, some 56 kilometres east of Moreton Island, and is now one of Queensland’s most well-known war memorials.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006243"></A>
That is one of the most significant war memorials in Queensland’s history, but the register covers memorials big and small across the state. The Department of Public Works’s Community Memorials Restoration Program is providing funding to help restore many of those war memorials across the state. Since 2004-05 the program has contributed more than $3 million towards restoring more than 290 memorials and icons. The latest and final round of funding is helping to restore some significant war memorials. Restorations will be carried out on the Maryborough Cenotaph, Cunnamulla Memorial Fountain and Esk War Memorial, along with memorials at Stanthorpe, Yeppoon, Weipa, Thangool, Tambo and on the Julia Creek War Memorial. In Mapoon, a Second World War Japanese anti-shipping mine will be the centrepiece in a re-established community war memorial. On Thursday Island, the Torres Strait Veterans’ Memorial will be restored to enhance the greater recognition of local service personnel. All are great examples of the Department of Public Works helping to help others to reflect on and honour those who served our country.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006245"></A>
As a history buff, I am pleased to announce that the Department of Public Works has another informative project in the development stages as we speak. The Queensland World War II Historic Places website is being built along the same concept as the War Memorial Register. It will identify and acknowledge historic places in Queensland from the Second World War and include historical content and images. The World War II Historic Places website will be developed progressively and will be up and running by the end of the year. This unique project is part of a commitment by our government. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1006254"></A>
Grey nomads are those older tourists who have taken to a road travel lifestyle, frequently visiting Australia’s rural and regional sights. Defined by their active and social lifestyles, grey nomads tend to visit these rural and regional areas in off-peak periods. Not only do grey nomads like to get off the beaten track, providing important economic benefits in regional Queensland, but grey tourism can be less prone to the peaks and troughs of the tourism market. The committee recognises that grey nomads are an important part of Queensland’s tourism industry, particularly in rural and regional Queensland. The committee is calling for public submissions from all over Queensland on what grey nomad tourism contributes to Queensland and what this tourism market needs. The committee’s inquiry will consider the issues and challenges in responding to the needs of grey nomads to ensure that Queensland continues to provide the first-class tourism services that draw this group to Queensland. I commend the committee’s issues paper to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008086"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.30 am): My first question without notice is to the Premier. The last Labor health minister who claimed his department did not warn him about pending disasters was Gordon Nuttall. The Premier leapt to Gordon Nuttall’s defence and exonerated him, and I ask: will the Premier do the same thing for the current health minister, who, just like Gordon Nuttall, claims his department never warned him about impending disasters? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008088"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. Like so many of the honourable member’s questions, it is founded on a false assumption and is a gross dishonesty. What we have seen in the Deputy Premier and health minister for a number of weeks is, firstly, a minister who has taken full responsibility, as he should, for the issues involved in the implementation of a new pay system in his department. Not only has he taken full responsibility; he is someone who is driving every effort to ensure this is rectified as quickly as possible and who has put in place a comprehensive and independent review of the circumstances that has led to these matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008089"></A>
Secondly, at no stage has the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health indicated that he had never been advised or warned of problems in the system. Quite the contrary: if those opposite had listened to the Deputy Premier’s ministerial statement yesterday they would have heard him advise this House of the issues over a number of months whereby the original planned implementation date to go live on the new pay system was, in fact, put back and delayed because of concerns about possible implementation issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008090"></A>
So far from denying that he was aware of problems, it is a matter of public record--not only from the Deputy Premier but from a range of media outlets--that the implementation of this system was put off on a number of occasions because, being such a large and complex project, implementation issues were not sufficiently settled to allow it to go ahead on the scheduled dates. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008091"></A>
So the assertion made by the Leader of the Opposition that the Deputy Premier has in some way denied that he was advised of these problems is not only completely and utterly false but also a matter of public record. Not only did the Deputy Premier know that there were issues; these issues were in the public arena for a number of months. As usual, I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he get out of the hammock, that he get up early enough in the day to do a little bit of work--to go and do some homework. If he does, he will find the facts. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My second question is to the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health. When Gordon Nuttall claimed that his department had not warned him about pending disasters, Queensland Health bureaucrats were allowed to be questioned to see if they would validate Mr Nuttall’s claims. Will the minister allow Queensland Health staff to now be questioned under oath to see if they agree with his claim that the minister was never advised about pending disasters with Queensland Health’s payroll system? Or does the minister have something to fear and something to hide? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 If the honourable member has any evidence to suggest that anyone has undertaken anything improper, he knows where he can go with those suggestions. He can take those suggestions to the Crime and Misconduct Commission, or indeed anywhere else, where they have the full powers that are granted to standing royal commissions. That is what he should do. </Hansard-Body>

Let us have a bit of a talk about honesty and deputies. I am reminded of report No. 103 in relation to a matter of privilege referred by the Speaker on 25 November 2009, which the member’s deputy was required not long ago in this House to stand up and apologise for. This is someone who was elected to parliament in 1989. The report states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1008099"></A>
The committee finds it difficult to reconcile Mr Springborg’s statements in his submission with his extensive experience as a Member of the Legislative Assembly and his experience on previous ethics committees including deliberating on Standing Order 209 matters. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008100"></A>
That is what the members of that committee said about the member’s deputy--a committee involving not only members on this side but also members of his own side. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008101"></A>
It is a matter of public record that there were issues with implementation, and that is why its implementation was delayed. It is very clear from that brief that it was not signed by other people up the chain well before ministerial officers--crystal clear. Additionally, people in this state--Queensland Health employees and taxpayers--are entitled to assume that these matters, which are in the custody of people to deal with and resolve on the basis of their expertise, are dealt with. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. I know her very keen interest in health issues generally and particularly in the effective and good operation of our public hospitals. As I have said on a number of occasions, I will be heading to Canberra on Monday, along with the Treasurer, to get the best possible deal for Queensland. We have already seen significant increases in the Commonwealth’s offer as a result of lobbying from Queensland and a number of other states. We unashamedly want to see the Commonwealth government make a much bigger contribution and take a bigger share of the cost of running the hospitals of this country. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008111"></A>
For too long, frankly under both sides of politics, we have seen the states bear the lion’s share of the burden of funding for health and funding for hospitals in particular. But be under no illusions: it was the Howard years that left the worst legacy of Commonwealth absence in this area. What is the legacy of the Howard government? How do we fund hospital costs now? The states fund 65 per cent and the Commonwealth funds 35 per cent. That is the legacy of the Howard years. That did not used to be the case. It used to be the case that the Commonwealth went 50-50. And John Howard walked backwards out the door, aided and abetted by those opposite.</Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is right--exactly where he should be. I believe that, on balance, the deal that is on the table, with some further detail refining over the next couple of days, is a good deal for the states. But the states are right to be careful about this prospect. The states are right to be asking questions, because this signals potentially quite a big shift in the nature of the Federation. What we will be looking for is a guarantee that Queensland will be no worse off financially and in terms of service delivery; protection for the small rural and regional hospitals of Queensland; a much better deal on aged care and the relationship between our public hospitals and the aged-care sector, for which the Commonwealth has always been responsible; and for funding to be maintained over the long term. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008116"></A>
This is a very serious issue, but it is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for us to change the relationship between the Commonwealth and the state and to get a better deal for our hospitals. That is what we will do. We will not impose a hospital tax, like that side of politics did. </Hansard-Body>

Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 last night; he did not give it to everyone else in the media. He accessed it under RTI. This government and this Premier have provided the broadest coverage of RTI of any government in the history of Australian Federation. I have made it clear that we know that there were issues with the implementation of this system as far back as 2008--in fact, before my time in the portfolio. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Why? Because the expert people, and indeed the person who was referred to in the document that was referred to in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 this morning, on 1 February 2010 himself certified that it was right to go. Then the project board, consisting of a representative from IBM, one of the largest companies in the world, Queensland Health, CorpTech and the chief information officer of Queensland Health, certified it. Imagine asking a member of parliament to certify a software system. It is about getting the expert people to do that. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 There is a very legitimate question about what went wrong. That is why it is being investigated. That is why KPMG will look at it. They will have a look at the software system because clearly it did not work and people have been inconvenienced as a result of that and that is an awful situation. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for her question and her interest in solar energy. I note that those opposite do not have an interest in solar power. I believe that Queenslanders are enthusiastic about solar energy and we see that in the data about the take-up of the solar hot water rebate and solar panels and the data about the access to our Solar Bonus Scheme. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009773"></A>
As I said on Tuesday, we have a very clear goal for Queensland. We want to double the rate of solar energy use from 250 megawatts to 500 megawatts within five years. What I am announcing today is that we are taking another step forward. It is not just the occupants of the homes of Queensland who are enthusiastic about this agenda; the University of Queensland at its St Lucia campus is investing in a 1.2 megawatt solar photovoltaic project on one of the buildings at UQ. This is equivalent to 800 standard household PV systems and it is the largest rooftop solar panel installation in Australia. So the largest solar panel rooftop installation in Australia will be at the University of Queensland, here in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009774"></A>
It is not just a rooftop panel; this will be a panel that will be on top of a globally significant research effort providing researchers with real-life data on energy management and the impact of solar on our electricity network. Not only will it be generating 1.2 megawatts of power--and be the largest in Australia--this will be part of a globally significant research effort into the use of solar power. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009775"></A>
I congratulate the University of Queensland. This is, in fact, the University of Queensland’s centenary year. In its 100 years of operation it has earned a well-deserved international reputation for groundbreaking research and academic rigour and excellence across a range of disciplines. One of the reasons it has earned that reputation is that it has, throughout its history, constantly sought to be at the cutting edge of new and emerging areas of endeavour. Solar energy is one of those areas of endeavour. I want to see every one of our universities being part of the cutting edge of research in that area. The more research they do the more affordable, achievable and widespread solar energy can become, not just for householders but in large scale solar plants across a state like Queensland so abundantly blessed with sunshine. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009776"></A>
We will continue as a government to be great champions of solar energy and continue to make it affordable and accessible for Queenslanders, whether in their schools, their homes or their businesses. Unfortunately, I know that we will continue to hear nothing more than moaning and whingeing from the other side on this as well as other issues. We will deliver while they dither. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No, it did not. There were articles in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 in December showing that it did not. Of course, one of the things that the honourable member for Caloundra knows about is compliance, because we have had discussions about who should sign off things. We know where his signature was. We have had someone who has been asked to withdraw by the privileges committee for misleading the House, we have had the Leader of Opposition Business who did that as well and now we have the member for Caloundra who dares ask anyone about these things when his signature, rolled gold, is on a Boyce Garrick mortgage scheme saying Mark McArdle is responsible for compliance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009787"></A>
One thing is for sure: this has to be sorted out. One thing is for sure: when there is an implementation as complex as this and someone picks a point in time prior to the decision to go live, it is misleading and false. On the first line of the document from last year, signed by that individual, it states--</Hansard-Body>

Health Funding Reform</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011438"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CHOI:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health. Could the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health inform the House of the importance of national healthcare reform? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011441"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. The statistics show that Australians have the second longest life expectancy on earth. This is about making a good system even better. At the same time, it is a system that has ever-increasing demand, growing well in excess of our population rate. Not that it is a state responsibility but, for example, with the population increasing by 11 per cent, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme increased by 31 per cent. The nature of the health system--increased success in medical conditions, ageing population, rising demand and more expensive treatments--dictates it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011443"></A>
The number of people aged 65 to 84 years has more than doubled and the number of people aged 85 years will quadruple by 2050. Rising expectations and demands on our hospital system are ever increasing and those ever-increasing demands then again drive further demands. If one has a look at kidney replacement therapy figures for people aged 70, 20 years ago essentially they did not present themselves in any number at all. So health is like a running race where you always want to set the next target in front of you. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011444"></A>
As demand for health services also grows, we need to employ more people to deliver those services. Since 2005, we have employed an extra 12,500 doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. Correspondingly, in 2003-04, Queensland Health provided around 8.8 million occasions of service. In just five years this figure has skyrocketed to 10.8 million--a 22 per cent increase in occasions of service under Queensland Health. Simply we have had to employ more people, pay them more and do more surgical and medical treatments against a state budget limited in its capacity to collect revenue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011448"></A>
The member for Clayfield always likes to parrot on about John Howard putting more money into health. He did grow the dollar funding for health, but it nowhere near matched state increases. That is one thing we do agree with John Brumby on--nowhere near did federal Howard funding increase it. In fact, it was responsible for the worst public health policy decision ever--the Mersey Hospital takeover. For the first time, the Commonwealth government has committed itself to funding growth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011449"></A>
So what are the areas that we see as important? The Premier’s contribution to aged care has simply been outstanding. We do need--and I note that a number of members have raised this--more money for aged-care funding. We welcome the low-interest loans, we welcome the support for doctors to do more treatment in nursing homes, but more needs to be done. Critically, critically, critically, outpatients--for which Queensland is $240 million worse off without patient specialist clinics--need to be addressed. The additional funding for training positions will assist but Queensland needs not to be penalised compared to other states. Rural and regional training I think is very, very exciting. One of the things that we need more of is more people in those regions.</Hansard-Body>

Queensland Health, Payroll System</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011455"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Health and Deputy Premier. Minister Schwarten says that the health payroll system has no problems. With reports that Queensland Health staff are receiving payslips for as little as 1c and as much as $2 million, does the minister still agree with his Labor cabinet college that ‘nothing that has come to light has suggested a breakdown in this system’? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011458"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The Minister for Public Works has made his position very, very clear in relation to this and he joins with me in wanting this sorted out. I do not think either me or the Minister for Public Works have any reputations in this place for being blushing violets or accepting things as they are with some fatalistic attitude. What we both agree on is that this needs to be investigated and investigated properly. Frankly, the Minister for Public Works and I are not interested in squabbles between SAP, Queensland Health, CorpTech, Workbrain or anyone else. Our motivation is to get this sorted out. That is what we want to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011460"></A>
That is why KPMG has been appointed to do a number of things. First of all, KPMG is there at the moment supervising what we are doing--supporting what we are doing to make sure that the next payroll run is as hiccup free as possible and other matters are attended to. I might say parenthetically that any payroll system that Queensland Health has, being such a complex payroll, would require adjustments due to late changes in shifts, meal allowances and all those sorts of things. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011463"></A>
Secondly, KPMG will look at issues surrounding the assessment and the rollout of this software. Frankly, I do not care who wants to cover themselves and protect themselves in relation to it. I want it investigated and it will be investigated independently by KPMG. </Hansard-Body>

 Thirdly, and also very critically, we will need to roll out new payroll systems across the Queensland government from time to time. What we want KPMG to do is to assess the appropriate procedures in relation to doing them. We cannot let this happen again. Queensland Health staff have been let down. They have been let down badly. It is not good enough. They have not only been let down badly and not been paid. But when you pay big money for a system and when you have people there to assess and implement systems, they have every reason to expect as taxpayers, as does anyone else in Queensland, that that would happen. The Minister for Public Works and I are not qualified IT professionals. We are there making sure that there is an investigation into this so it can be sorted out into the future. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Kallangur for her interest in the aviation sector, for her interest in the fact that it delivers jobs in Brisbane and for people on the north side. The aviation industry has been a policy priority for this government and it is an industry that now sees 16,500 Queenslanders employed in that industry. It has been an industry that we have supported. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011484"></A>
Over the last 30 days I have seen firsthand three businesses that are creating jobs in this area. On the south side in the electorate of the member for Chatsworth is Ferra Engineering, working with Lockheed Martin, producing and manufacturing components for the joint strike fighter--an aircraft that will be the new standard for air forces around the world. At the Brisbane Airport we have the joint venture between Airbus and Qantas Defence Services, converting four A330s into flying petrol tanks to support the Royal Australian Air Force for the future. Finally, last Friday, with the CEO of Qantas, I was there to launch the plans for heavy maintenance of the A330 fleet right here in Brisbane, securing the future of another 450 jobs. That is our support for the aviation industry--delivering jobs, delivering jobs for the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011491"></A>
Speaking of take-offs, we are now inside the last 14 days until the launch of the opposition leader into the flight of fancy that is his attempt at policies. At T minus 14 this would have to be the most anticipated shuttle launch in recent times. Of course he announced that he would be on the launch pad nearly 360 days ago, and it is more than 300 days since the shadow Treasurer lit the fuse underneath him and put him on the spot and said that he would be delivering in the budget reply. You can imagine the questions that are out there as we head towards the next 14 days. You can imagine the count down. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011492"></A>
Here we are at T minus 14 and the count down will get there. You can imagine at T minus 7: what is the opposition leader going to do about the balance sheet? At T minus 6: what projects will he cut? At T minus 5: what is the status of their previously stated pro-privatisation policy? At T minus 5: what is the status of this document? At T minus 4: will he repudiate once and for all their plan to slash three per cent across the public sector? At T minus 2: will he repudiate once and for all his pledge to cut 12,000 jobs out of the public sector? At T minus 1: will he set a jobs target of above zero? What we know is that, while Queenslanders will be tuned in, while they will be on their BlackBerrys, while they will be lining the streets, while the member for Warrego will turn on the crystal set waiting to hear the policies that come from the opposition leader, the people of Queensland want to know what the opposition leader stands for, what his policies are. Is it just fury and light and smoke and steam? Or does he actually stand for something other than just another whingeing opposition leader without a policy and without an idea?</Hansard-Body>

 My question without notice is to the Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology. In relation to Queensland Health’s bungled payroll, the minister yesterday said ‘nothing that has come to light has suggested a breakdown in this system’. After 24 hours, I ask the minister to ponder his statement and these facts: some workers have not been paid overtime, some workers have not been paid at all, some workers are receiving gross overpayments, and the health minister cannot guarantee the next pay cheque to workers.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Nothing has come to light, and that is exactly what I had been told by IBM yesterday. I have been told about the IT system, which is different from an overall payroll system--I did not say the payroll system. People are not getting paid--blind Freddy can see that--and that is happening in my electorate, and I am well aware of that. But it is my job to drill down and get the people in the Department of Public Works to engage with CorpTech and IBM to determine what those problems might be. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013288"></A>
I have been told that they are not IT related. However, we have then said, ‘Okay, that’s all very well. We want to run the ruler over those statements. We want KPMG to get to the bottom of those.’ As far as all of my investigations have gone, every single person, from IBM down to CorpTech, has said to me that this is not a problem in IT, that this is a problem elsewhere. I am responsible for that and I have never ducked that responsibility. Indeed, neither has the Minister for Health in his regard. We have spoken with IBM. I got the director in yesterday, and he assured me that they welcomed the KPMG report but he was confident in his advice to me. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013291"></A>
Also, the director-general went down to the ASU this morning and met with them. These are the poor people who are trying to pay these people, and we wanted them to ask it there was any issue with the actual IT system. The feedback I have received from them this morning is they would like it to be quicker, so we are going to get into that. The reality is that KPMG is being hired to do this--</Hansard-Body>

About 5,800 Queenslanders live in these communities. They use about 28 million litres of diesel fuel for their electricity generation each year. This releases about 80,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases every year. It is expensive for both those residents and of course the environment. We think we can do better by doing the bright thing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013303"></A>
What we are doing as a government is investing 200 kilowatts of renewable energy in four different isolated communities in Far North and Western Queensland. Thursday Island, Horn Island, Bamaga and Boulia are the communities that have been selected as the first four communities to trial renewable energy alternatives. They have been selected because together they represent over a third of the total residents who live in isolated communities, but there are also different solar radiation levels in the three areas selected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013308"></A>
Just over $1 million in solar systems will be installed on rooftops in these four communities beginning from June this year. They are not just getting solar; they are also getting energy efficient programs to cut overall electricity use, like audits, efficient lighting and water heating, and efficient shower heads. We hope that they will be saving up to $300 a year on their electricity bills by adopting these energy efficient technologies. Ergon Energy will be installing solar PV systems on the roofs of strategic community buildings like hospitals, schools and local council owned facilities and housing. We hope that the experience from these four communities will help us roll this program out to other communities. It would be indeed the bright thing to do. This just gives a further indication of how innovative our government owned corporations like Ergon Energy are in terms of exploring opportunities to reduce the load from diesel power generation and adopting renewable energy alternatives that will also help with the hip pocket. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CRIPPS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology. The minister has always insisted that he is a champion of workers rights. Does the minister stand by the claim he made yesterday that the SAP system driving the bungled Queensland Health payroll was not a failure? Will the minister finally admit that his head-in-the-sand attitude demonstrates an arrogant disregard for the rights of Queensland Health workers who are suffering due to his incompetence? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013316"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Again, we have a question that has no basis in fact, because what I said yesterday was that all the advice that was given to me had said that this SAP system was working. That remains the advice that I have. Certainly there are people who have not been paid, and every worker is entitled to be paid. Every worker is entitled to be paid regardless, and I have never, ever suggested otherwise, and nor would I. No-one on this side of politics has ever done that. You are the party that took away people’s superannuation rights, so do not start lecturing us about what working class people should have. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013317"></A>
The reality is--and I stand by what I said--that every piece of advice that has come to me on this IT system tells me that it is functioning appropriately. But we have not accepted that at face value. I have drilled down. I have spoken to the individuals concerned in this as hard as I can. I have done that consistently. The answer has been consistent. So what are we doing about it? We are not just accepting that at face value. We are getting a third party to go in there and dig around and find out exactly why people are not getting paid. That is what we are doing. It is not as though we are sitting here blindly doing nothing about it. We are acknowledging there is a problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013318"></A>
We have drilled down and asked questions, and the questions I have asked have been answered by people whose signatures appear on the document to say to go live. They have told me that the system they signed up to is working. That is what they are saying. We are saying it is not working in that it does not pay people in certain cases. They are saying to me that the majority of people are getting paid and so on. Those conversations have been held. I have gone as far as I can go with it. I have talked to these people and the advice remains the same. We have talked to the people at the coalface, and now we have an inquiry that will rapidly, I hope, report to us on just what is the nature of the issue.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013320"></A>
If it is an IT issue then there will be some serious ramifications for IBM, I can tell you that. No-one from that side of the parliament has yet produced any evidence of IT failures. I have not seen anything that says that. I have asked all the questions, as I said. I am not sitting here with blinkers on or trying to pretend that the issue is not there. I have asked all the questions of the people who were there and I have got the same answers consistently. As I said, this morning we talked to the people who are implementing this. They are saying that they would like it to be quicker. We are addressing that issue, but in reality no-one has come forward to me and said that this is an IT failure. But KPMG will tell us that.</Hansard-Body>

 I am pleased to also have an opportunity to talk about the solar initiatives of my department.

There are a number of solar initiatives that I would like to outline to the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015094"></A>
With respect to the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service, solar hot-water systems have been installed at new stations--and this will be an ongoing matter in terms of new developments--at Kippa-Ring, Burpengary, Redland Bay and Cairns. The Queensland Ambulance Service, similarly, with its new developments, new stations and refurbishments, has installed solar hot-water systems recently in Julia Creek, Duaringa, Mount Morgan, Clermont and South Brisbane. The QAS Kowanyama field office has solar panels installed on its roof as well. In addition, both the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service and the Queensland Ambulance Service have repeater stations which have solar panels that support those as well.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Some of the police facilities with solar hot water recently installed include Wujal Wujal, Laura, Burpengary, Sippy Downs, North Lakes, Crestmead, Yeppoon Water Police, Springfield, Cooktown, Julia Creek and Marian--and the list goes on. The QPS has solar panels supporting its repeater stations throughout the network.</Hansard-Body>

While I am on my feet, yesterday during question time the member for Mirani asked me a question relating to 000 call centres. He made a claim that over 4,000 Queenslanders have had to call 000 up to four times before they got through. I indicated to the member for Mirani that that was a problem which was news to me, and I gave him an opportunity to present the evidence to me. Did he do that? No, not at all. Do you know why, Mr Speaker? Because his claim was a complete fabrication. It was a deliberate and dishonest misrepresentation of data that was provided to him through right to information. What he was referring to was that when people call 000, if the call centre is busy it is re-presented to either the same call centre or another one. Those were the statistics that he dishonestly took to the community and said that they represented people making 000 calls. </Hansard-Body>

 More tactical dishonesty from the master of it. There is no minister who has denied that there is a problem with the Queensland Health pay system. The problems are self-evident.

Mrs MILLER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning. Could the minister please update the House on what the state government is doing to help skill plumbers for a brighter solar future? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017175"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HINCHLIFFE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Bundamba for her question. The Bligh government is doing the bright thing and helping to upskill plumbers as more Queenslanders switch to solar hot water. Plumbers are being offered face-to-face training from registered training organisations like the Master Plumbers Association of Queensland and simple online courses to ensure that they are solar skilled. While the skills of plumbing might date back to Roman times, it is a trade that is highly responsive to changing needs and the application of this in this 21st century trade. Solar hot water is an excellent example of this continuing adaptation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017177"></A>
From 1 January 2011 plumbers and provisional plumbers will need to have an endorsement on their plumber’s licence to install, commission and test solar and/or heat pump installations. As mentioned, registered training organisations, including the Master Plumbers Association of Queensland and SkillsTech Australia, are already providing an accredited course to ensure plumbers have the skills and endorsements to do the bright thing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017181"></A>
In addition, administered through the Department of Infrastructure and Planning, a Plumbing Industry Council online assessment option has been established for licensed plumbers unable to attend the training course to do the bright thing. Approximately 200 plumbers have already undertaken the training and passed the requirement with a further 64 currently enrolled. They are all doing the bright thing. This initiative will reduce the administrative burden on local government, speed up the approval process and provide Queensland plumbers with invaluable professional development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017184"></A>
My department is currently conducting a state-wide roadshow to inform plumbers and other stakeholders of the latest opportunities for training around the licensing requirements and provide support to them. This roadshow is being run in centres from Cairns to Coolangatta until June. It follows on from the Bligh government’s generous Solar Hot Water Rebate Scheme. It again highlights the state government’s commitment to deliver on solar and do the bright thing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017186"></A>
With support from this government, plumbers will play a key role in doing the bright thing, helping Queensland householders reduce their energy consumption and cut their electricity bills. We can see that Queensland households can, on average, reduce their carbon footprint by about two tonnes per year with initiatives like the installation of solar hot water. This is part of taking Queensland homes further into the 21st century. Plumbers will play a key role and the Queensland government will play a key role in supporting them to do the bright thing. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs PRATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Treasurer. Mining companies are currently acquiring properties in the Darling Downs area which have been sold by the registered titleholder and have the added bonus of coming with a private royalties agreement. It has been estimated that over the 20-year life of the Felton mine alone the royalties lost to the Crown will be in the vicinity of $560 million. This would supply much needed state infrastructure. Treasurer, when mining entities purchase private properties with these private royalty agreements is the government considering implementing legislation which automatically returns these royalties to the Crown? If not, why not? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017191"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Nanango for her question. It may come as a surprise to some members of the House and indeed to some members of the community that, for reasons of history, there is a minority of Queensland where governments of yesteryear--not this government or its immediate predecessors--did provide for land to be sold into the marketplace that uniquely also included the rights to the minerals contained underneath. This is a matter of history. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017192"></A>
I think it is fair to say that there would not be any appetite on either side of the House for such divestments to occur into the future. But it is the case now that, given that those private property rights exist, it would only be under the relevant legislation and under the Constitution possible to resume those property rights as they now are by paying the full compensable value of the minerals contained underneath. So it is a false economy that is being proposed by the member for Nanango. There is no ability to secure the private royalty rights of the minerals that lie on that land without paying the full compensation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017193"></A>
There is no ability, therefore, for this state government or indeed its predecessors or those into the future to otherwise acquire those private property rights and therefore gain access to an additional income stream. The value of those royalty rights that exist in that minority of land that exist for historical reasons is the exact equivalent of what we would have to pay them in order to acquire it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017194"></A>
I think this is best described as an accident of history. It is not a policy that is pursued by this government nor I expect will it be pursued by governments into the future. But I do note that, for reasons of history which are on the record, a good many of the properties in question do in fact reside in and around the townships of the Nanango electorate. I am sure that is why this matter has been brought to the member’s attention. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017195"></A>
When it comes to royalties, the Henry taxation review is on foot. We expect that it will be in the public arena in accordance with the commitment of the federal Treasurer. These are matters that will be resolved in the context of the Henry taxation review. Our government’s resolve in the first instance is always to protect the sanctity of the state’s revenue base. That is our starting position. We also recognise that the constitutional capacity exists within the Commonwealth to make other policy proposals. The position that we will be putting forward is that we will not be dealing with these issues one by one; we will be dealing with the arrangements proposed and ensuring that when it comes to taxation reform, royalties and otherwise, that the deal for Queensland is a good one. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017201"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Murrumba for his question. As we all know, public transport is already the green way to travel, but now Queensland Rail is doing the bright thing too. At all of its new railway stations Queensland Rail constructs solar panels as part of the design and those solar panels feed into the electricity grid creating clean, green solar energy for all Queenslanders to consume. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017203"></A>
When Indooroopilly Railway Station was upgraded in 2008 that redesign included solar panels. The new Varsity Lakes Railway Station, as part of the Labor government’s commitment to extend rail back to the Gold Coast, includes solar panels as part of its sustainable design. Now the new Richlands Railway Station, which is currently under construction and due to open next year, also includes solar panels generating clean, green electricity as part of its design. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017206"></A>
Public transport is already the green way to travel. For every kilometre travelled on public transport each passenger generates on average 30 grams of carbon dioxide. If that same person were travelling in a car 250 grams of CO2 would be generated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017207"></A>
Queensland Rail is not stopping there. In addition to doing the bright thing with its solar panels on new stations, new stations also include other elements of sustainable design. Varsity Lakes Railway Station, for instance, has an airy, subtropical design with natural air flows and lighting and a tremendous use of glass. Queensland Rail is in the process of rolling out a major recycling program with 250 recycling bins being established across the Queensland Rail network. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017209"></A>
Queenslanders want to go green. They want as individuals to do the right thing. That is why they are in increasing numbers choosing public transport, and Queensland Rail--not just in providing sustainable ways to travel but also doing the bright thing and creating sustainable stations as part of its new design--is helping Queenslanders every day to make the green choice. </Hansard-Body>

 Great! Firstly, native title legislation is federal legislation. One would expect the shadow minister to know that.

They then asked me to wind back the protection in Moreton Bay, home to over 800 dugong and thousands of turtles. The LNP’s record shows that this is mock outrage from the shadow minister for the environment. If the honourable member truly cared about dugongs, then he would vote with our government to protect their habitat.</Hansard-Body>

 (Dalrymple--LNP) (11.31 am): The Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to amend various acts in order to enhance safety and health measures, streamline and simplify the government’s mining lease application process in order to it speed up, improve credit support arrangements for electricity retailers, and improve customer service obligations. Our state’s wealth and growth are due largely to the strength and diversity of our resources industry. It contributes around $30 billion a year to the Queensland economy and employs thousands of people, with estimated flow-on effects showing that the sector accounts for more than one in every eight Queensland jobs. It provides funding for programs in Queensland such as school based activities, sporting donations and sponsorships, welfare initiatives, and improving access to education and training and medical services. Even going back six years before the mining boom, a Queensland Resources Council survey showed that the resources sector spent $4.2 billion on goods and services sourced in Queensland, more than $1.3 billion on wages and salaries and over $22 million on community and Indigenous programs in which Queensland generally and regional communities specifically were major beneficiaries.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023382"></A>
The contribution of the resources sector to employment, infrastructure and services in rural and regional areas cannot be underestimated, and it is our responsibility to ensure that further development of the sector is not impeded. We must do everything we can to drive this viable and environmentally sustainable use of our resources and ensure that the benefits flow back to Queensland. Exports of lead, copper, zinc, gold, silver, bauxite, tin, oil and gas provide the income that stimulates the investment we rely on. The export of coking and high-quality thermal coal in particular is vital to the Queensland economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023385"></A>
In his second reading speech the minister said that this bill would enhance health and safety measures, and nothing is more important in the mining industry than health and safety. It is important that we closely monitor mining companies’ compliance with safety requirements and the reporting of injuries. Mining is a hazardous industry, and this is demonstrated by the fact that there have been a number of deaths in the mining industry, including in my electorate. It is vital that everyone involved in the industry is focused on ensuring the safety and health of mineworkers. It is paramount that the Queensland Mines Inspectorate is adequately resourced and funded.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023388"></A>
I now turn to the issue of improved credit support arrangements for electricity retailers and improved customer service obligations. Since full retail competition electricity prices have gone up by 40 per cent. Before deregulation it was promised by the government and the minister of the day that electricity prices would be competitive and that there was even a chance that prices would come down. Obviously that has not happened. For example, an electricity bill of around $600 before deregulation has now increased to around $1,000. This is not a great example, especially given the impending sale of our profitable assets. People in rural and regional Queensland never had the opportunity to advance from full retail competition because it was not viable, but that really did not make any difference because electricity prices have gone up by 40 per cent. As I said, given the upcoming sale of our profitable assets, this is not a great example of what is to come.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023389"></A>
We acknowledge the value of our great coal industry, the push for clean coal technology and the further need to meet electricity demand. There are many warnings of the coming demand/supply imbalance and urgent need for a baseload power station in North Queensland, and there is much talk about upgrading the high-voltage network between Townsville and Mount Isa. This will help and will support investment in the mining belts of those western areas of regional and rural Queensland and into North Queensland. However, there is no use expanding the high-voltage network if there is no baseload power station to transmit the power, because mining development and investment in North and Western Queensland have been put on hold because of the lack of a reliable power source. The further you transmit power, the more costs are associated with that transmission.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023394"></A>
It is logical to identify--something we on this side have pushed on many occasions--Pentland as an alternative site for a clean coal baseload power station. Major stakeholders have already done extensive investigations into the feasibility of building a power station at Pentland, including a $2 million drilling program completed by the owners of the Pentland coal reserve, Xstrata, which confirmed that the ore body is of good enough quality for an economically viable 600 to 800 megawatt power station for the next 35 to 40 years. This site makes common sense because it has one of the biggest river systems in Queensland. There is plentiful water supply, a nearby rail facility, a rural environment and a potential power station that sits on unlimited coal reserves, and Pentland is a vital link to North-West Queensland. This proposal has the support of federal and state members of parliament, the Charters Towers Chamber of Commerce, the city and shire councils, Townsville Enterprise, visitors and investors. </Hansard-Body>

Mr HOBBS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Warrego--LNP) (11.37 am): I am pleased to rise today to speak to the Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill. I commend the contribution by the shadow minister, who went into great detail about those issues in the mining industry that are important to us, particularly the coal seam gas industry. I want to talk about electricity generation, in particular coal seam gas electricity generation, and the resource that is used for that generation. I also want to speak about the issue of pipelines, which are significant in this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023409"></A>
One thing we need to get our minds around is the new technologies. It is wonderful to see the enormous development that is happening in the Surat Basin in my electorate. However, there are some serious impacts because of that. Some changes have been made in recent days that will go some way towards helping understand some of those complications, and I refer to the fact that there will be something like 40,000 coal seam gas wells in the Surat Basin in the next three to 10 years. With that number of wells being put down, there will be something like 196 gigalitres of water annually brought up from those coal seam aquifers. While we welcome the development, there is a concern about the diminishing water supply for those aquifers below and above.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023441"></A>
A lot of the towns in my area rely entirely on the Great Artesian Basin--towns such as Dalby, Roma, Charleville, Tambo, Blackall, Mitchell and many others--as the major water source for their urban development. There are something like 2,700 bores in the artesian basin and 15,000 sub-bores as well. They come in at different levels. This enormous amount of water going out of those coal seam beds means that the pressure drops--the head drops--and the Santos EIS has indicated that that may be as much as 65 metres. If that happens, you can get leakage from the other aquifers into that vacuum, so to speak. Therefore, urban water users and farmers who use bores may find that their pressure drops--their levels drop--and that there is a significant impact on them. That is the unknown. There is a lot of concern out there--and there has been for a long time--that there will be this impact.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023442"></A>
Now we have a starting point, I guess. I raised the issue last year that, when the companies were putting down the wells, they were not doing the monitoring. That is occurring now. We need to ensure that the benchmarking is done so that if those 15,000 bores or the 2,700 sub-bores reduce in volume, there can be an investigation to determine whether there has been an impact by the coal seam gas industry. So we need to be able to monitor that. It is a difficult situation, but it is one that we have to manage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023443"></A>
The use of the water needs to be considered as well. Certainly, urban water use is a potential use. I think we have to look much more seriously at reinjecting that water, once it is cleaned, back into those aquifers--and as much as possible into the right aquifer. I know that that process costs a lot of money but, then again, we are generating gas at the surface. So I think some more serious thought needs to be given to what we do with that water. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023444"></A>
In relation to the pipelines that obviously crisscross the area, we need to have better corridors in which to utilise these pipelines. I know that is difficult to do when there are so many wells being put in, but I think providing better corridors needs to be considered. Also, in a lot of cases the state government does not allow the pipelines to traverse state forest or state owned land. It is okay to put pipelines across farmers’ land but, in doing that, they always take the cleared paddock as it is easier because there are no trees to clear. The companies take the easy route. But I think the state government and the landowners should be sharing this responsibility equally. The state government should certainly be pulling its weight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023445"></A>
Another concern--and this was shown in the Santos EIS for the Gladstone pipeline--is that there is the possibility of subsidence in some areas, and there was mention of up to five inches in subsidence in the Injune area and maybe two inches in the Roma area if the enormous pressure goes off those lower aquifers. It is hard to believe that there would be much drop from that distance, but there seems to be that possibility. So there is certainly a need to monitor that, because landowners do not want to have any significant impact, particularly on the good farming areas. I guess it does not matter so much if it is on the grazing areas rather than on the farming land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023446"></A>
As I mentioned before, some of those pipelines are significant. There have been some difficulties and some heartache between landholders and the companies in relation to access. I believe the situation is improving but, when you get into the smaller farming areas and most certainly into those prime agricultural land areas where, for a start, there should not be any mining at all, if pipelines have to traverse those areas the companies need to be very careful about how they do it because the black soil particularly moves. If you get wet seasons, it is not hard to push down to almost the same level as where some of those pipelines are laid. So there needs to be a lot of consideration given to that issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023447"></A>
Another particularly serious issue relates to the management of prime agricultural land. Although this government has released a paper on this issue that talks about having different categories of land, I do not think that it has looked seriously enough at the issue. Over 12 months ago we announced that we would protect prime agricultural land. I think that that needs to be done sooner rather than later.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023448"></A>
This legislation is important. Once again, I do not want to repeat what others have said. The shadow minister has summed it up fairly well. I hope that the issues that I have raised, particularly in relation to the coal seam gas areas, are taken into consideration. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind) (11.45 am): I rise to participate in the debate on the Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill. I will follow on from the comments of the member for Warrego and say that I also do not intend to repeat the matters that have been raised, but simply put on the record my support for the bill and my congratulations to the minister on trying to find ways to remove the red tape in the application process that sometimes chokes our courts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023453"></A>
It makes a lot of sense to remove the mandatory requirement for the Land Court to assess mining lease applications when there have been no properly lodged objections. The bottom line is that we should not allow people to abuse the court process, or whatever the process is. I think that is a good move. It demonstrates that the government is trying to remove unnecessary red tape. I believe that it is an attempt to try to free up the Land Court system. Quite frankly, if someone has an objection, it is incumbent upon them to substantiate that objection and not just simply use a legal technicality to draw out a process for ulterior purposes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023454"></A>
I congratulate the minister on trying to close down this legal loophole. I thank him for trying to remove that unnecessary red tape. I understand that this bill is being supported by the opposition as well. I look forward to it proceeding to the consideration in detail stage. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs PRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nanango--Ind) (11.47 am): I rise to speak to the Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. I can understand the reasoning behind trying to shorten the application process--to take it out of the court system when there are no objections et cetera--but I have one qualification and that relates to emerging new technologies, which are coming through all the time. When I say that, I am talking about UCG--underground coal gasification--which is going on my area at the moment with a pilot plant. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023458"></A>
Recently I was talking with the CEO of the company involved, Cougar Energy. He was involved in a pilot plant at Chinchilla and is now involved in one just on the outskirts of the Kingaroy township, very close to a densely populated area. He told me that when he was in Chinchilla there was absolutely no objection to the project. Nobody said anything. Nobody raised an issue. But in Kingaroy it is a totally different situation. He was very unprepared for the amount of community sentiment that arose in this area. I explained to him that the reason there is such a sensitivity to this new technology is not just that it is new but that for the past 10 to 15 years there has been much land acquisition for mining purposes going on in the area and that it has been a very long and painful process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023460"></A>
I have concerns about new technology like UCG. I am not talking syngas; I am talking UCG. I can assure members that the concerned citizens group has avidly searched the net and everywhere possible for information about UCG production. No-one has been able to find a successful operation that has been going for any length of time--not even for a short time--but they can find so many negatives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023494"></A>
As was mentioned by the member for Warrego, a lot of the concern is around soil quality and the structure of the land. One might say it is very unstable land. I will go into a bit of technical detail here so that people can understand why there is such concern in the Kingaroy area. The pilot plant is on top of a hill. I can see it from my own house, which is on top of the neighbouring hill. They are not very big hills because it is not very high country. The coal seam that they are mining is down very low in a very low water table. There is water running through the coal seam. There is also an aquifer on top that most, but not all, farmers in that area access for their water. It was revealed last Monday night, at a meeting of concerned citizens with DERM and Cougar Energy representatives, that some people actually take water for livestock and private purposes from the coal seam stream. This has been going on for quite some time in our area, but the company and DERM have only just discovered that people are accessing water from the coal seam stream. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023495"></A>
People want to know whether some time down the track--maybe not tomorrow but in five years time when the pilot is finished or in 50 years time--any of the contaminant will come out as the water flows very slowly through the coal seam. A major issue is where it will have an effect in the future. We all know that there will be contaminants from the burning of the coal underground--the company knows that and so does DERM. The people are concerned where it will come out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023496"></A>
The other issue is whether there will be subsidence on the top aquifer which alters the flow of that water. Officers from DERM say that it is unlikely; representatives from Cougar Energy say that they do not believe it will. It is all right to say that, but what if there is subsidence? Livelihoods and farms are ruined if there is any subsidence at all. We know the aquitard, which is above the mine and below the water table, is very stable and very strong, but this kind of pilot has not been conducted in this area before. We know that it had to be conducted somewhere. The questions being asked are: why was it put so close to the town and why is any risk at all being allowed to occur without pre-research? Only after the pilot program is completed will DERM be looking at the information and the data. People are asking why, with a new technology, was there not a lot more research done by the government to ensure that there is no detriment to the people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023497"></A>
We are talking about safety in this bill, but what about the safety of the people. There are all these questions and people just want answers. I have spoken with Minister Kate Jones about this and she is going to find out a lot of information for me. I am very grateful to her, as is the community. Once concerns were raised she acted very quickly to get DERM personnel to the area. When there is new technology why is there not a lot more thought put into it by government? Why was a lot more certainty not asked for? The government says that we have a lot of rules for mining. Open cut mines have been going on for many years in this country and there are many successful mines, but find me one UCG program that passed the pilot and is good and safe and can guarantee people that they will not be affected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023498"></A>
Another issue with regard to this relatively new technology is that the company, a small company, has a cap of $600,000 if any damage is caused. I look at things differently and I think to myself that if they do not think there will be any damage why would they need a cap. They must expect some sort of damage down the track to have a cap. The amount of $600,000 would not cover one property if it was damaged. We are asking who will pick up the rest of the tab if anything goes wrong with this new technology. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023499"></A>
I have to say that the majority of the people in the area think this is great technology if it reduces greenhouse gases, it is great technology if it works well and can be proven to work well, and they would not be averse to it going ahead with assurances that it will not be detrimental to our particular area. On the other hand, if they are not convinced that it will be beneficial to the area and will do no damage they will fight it tooth and nail because, as I said, the community has been so sensitised to mining in our area that it will take a lot to satisfy it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023500"></A>
Whenever there is new technology the government needs to ensure the safety of the people--not only the workers who work there but also the people who live there. It needs to ensure that there are no contaminants and there will be no impact on the farming community in any way, shape or form. The other good thing about this technology is that it does not disturb the topsoil like open cut mining. It has a lot going for it. People just need to be sure it will do no damage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023501"></A>
I do support this legislation. I will not go into the other things that people have talked about. The issues I have raised are particularly relevant to my area and the concerns of the people of my area. When ventures are relatively new and have not been carried out before in Australia, perhaps a lot more has to be done to ensure that no damage is done before any licences are issued to a company. It is a bit like buying a bull, putting it in a fenced paddock with only four wires in it and saying, ‘Well, if he gets out we will put two more wires on the fence and make it a bit higher’. It is a bit late when the cows are pregnant to the wrong bull. That is the kind of analogy that people in our area use. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs PRATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 They all know about the birds and the bees, I am sure, so I do not need to go into graphics. The truth is that there a lot of concerns when one lives in the country. The quality of the land is important. The value of the land does drop when mines come into an area. People worry about being able to sell their properties. It is a real issue for people on the land. It should not be pooh-poohed and thought that it is not a big issue because there are not that many people out there. As other members have said, these are the people who put the food on our table. They need a lot more consideration. As is often said, every family needs a farmer. At the rate we are going there will not be one farmer for every family, a whole city will get one farmer. We must value the assets we have. We have to be 99 per cent sure that nothing will happen. For some people 100 per cent sure would not be enough. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023506"></A>
I will be supporting this bill. I have those reservations and I ask the minister to seriously think about requiring a lot more information to be given when new technology comes in before permission is given for the pilot to go ahead.</Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(12.00 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. This bill before the House is the next step in the Bligh government’s commitment to develop an environmentally sustainable and economically prosperous LNG industry in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023533"></A>
After the Premier announced the world’s biggest liquefied natural gas contract for Queensland on 24 March, we saw nothing but the usual negative banter from the opposition. The most insightful comment the LNP spokesperson for mining could muster up was a suggestion that the government played absolutely no part in securing the contract worth $60 billion in export activity for Queensland. Of course he would say that. This could not be further from the truth. I take the opportunity to highlight some of the innovative ideas and forward thinking from the state government to promote Queensland as an environment which encourages and creates business investment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023534"></A>
We are on the front foot, building strong foundations for the industry and clear guidelines for investors to secure the validity of the sector in the future and achieve the balance between economic prosperity and environmental sustainability in the emerging CSG and LNG industry. In September 2009, the Bligh government released its blueprint for Queensland’s LNG industry which included a number of commitments in relation to environmental and natural resources management. The LNG blueprint is the basis of the Queensland government’s policy platform and aims to provide investor certainty and guidelines for environmental impact assessment processes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023535"></A>
The blueprint included a commitment to the current flat royalty rate of 10 per cent of wellhead value. This will provide a clear and stable royalty regime that will support and encourage investment in the LNG projects. To provide further investor certainty we will allow certain components of this wellhead valuation to be determined prospectively where necessary. This will be particularly important in ensuring that royalties are calculated correctly for LNG projects, which are often characterised by high degrees of vertical integration or joint venture arrangements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023537"></A>
In terms of managing environmental impacts and in keeping with the government’s blueprint, the government engaged with the CSG industry through the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association water working group to develop trigger thresholds for impacts on private water bores affected by CSG water extraction. We also led development of a cumulative management regime for groundwater impacts where the Queensland Water Commission will be the agency responsible for modelling, groundwater management and government reporting where CSG operators’ impacts overlap. We also developed industry guidelines which outline for industry the information needed in an environmental management plan for CSG activities under the EPA. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023542"></A>
The Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to amend various acts administered by the mines and energy portfolio to achieve three key outcomes for Queensland and build on the strong foundation set by the abovementioned initiatives. It will simplify the regulatory process to achieve savings for business and government. It will improve safety and health measures--which is of utmost importance to this government--in Queensland mining, explosives and gas industries. It will also improve electricity retailer credit support arrangements and customer service obligations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023543"></A>
The first point is in line with the Bligh government’s moves to create an environment which encourages and creates investment in the emerging Queensland LNG sector. The amendments will improve efficiency of regulatory and other approvals processes for mining projects while maintaining a balance with strict environmental and land use approvals. A new industry means that new checks and balances are necessary, and these amendments are part of the Bligh government’s response. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023545"></A>
Amendments to the Mineral Resources Act 1989 will streamline the processing and assessment of mining lease applications by removing the current requirement for the Land Court to hear mining lease applications where no objections have been lodged. The applications will instead be assessed by the minister administering the act, thereby cutting red tape and reducing the waiting time by up to six weeks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023548"></A>
This bill will also make amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1992. Currently this act applies to the state’s internal waters as well as its territorial waters. Queensland’s internal waters are the waters between the mean low water mark and the territorial waters, which covers the area three nautical miles seaward from the territorial sea baseline. Because of the interaction between the Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004 and the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1982, companies wishing to construct pipelines between Queensland and the islands located within Queensland’s internal waters would currently be required to apply for and obtain pipeline licences under both the PG(PS) Act as well as the P(SL)A Act. This would also mean that companies intending to do this would be subject to two safety and health regulatory regimes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023550"></A>
The proposed amendments to these two acts are intended to simplify the approvals process for pipelines that traverse both the mainland and Queensland’s internal waters. This means that pipeline proponents will only need to comply with the safety and health obligations under one act, that being the PG(PS) Act. This dovetails with the goal of streamlining the approvals project by lessening the administrative and regulatory burden on the proponents and thereby encouraging resource investment in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023551"></A>
This is an exciting time for Queensland. I can remember that some four years I joined the Speaker, the then the Minister for Trade, on a trip to PNG to investigate the possibility of a major gas pipeline from the highlands of PNG all the way to Queensland and then to South Australia. Four years ago as a state we had a desperate need to find new resources to support the growing economy of our state. Four years later, today not only do we not need to import gas from other countries but we are becoming an exporter of gas in our own right. This emerging CSG and LNG sector has the potential for huge economic and social development in Queensland by creating thousands of new jobs and adding tens of billions of dollars to our economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023553"></A>
Foresight and leadership from the Bligh government have allowed us to get on the front foot and lay the foundations for this growing industry, and this bill is a continuation of that work. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs MENKENS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burdekin--LNP) (12.06 pm): I am happy to give this contribution to the Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2010, and I certainly offer my support to the bill. Many facets of these amendments attempt to enhance Queensland’s position and provide the mining and energy industries, and the personnel who are involved, with increased certainty into the future. Mines and energy related industries have been the backbone of the Queensland economy for many decades. There is a reliance by the industry on government to get the right balance of legislation to ensure that these reserves are utilised in an environmentally responsible manner, a sustainable manner and a very safe manner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023556"></A>
There is also a very great need for legislation to keep pace with emerging industries. Currently we see that those emerging industries are in the sustainability and the technological sectors, and in recent years those emerging industries have included clean coal, solar energy, wind, geothermal and hydroelectric energy. This government is beholden to legislate in keeping with the prudent advancement of industry, and these amendments before us that we are discussing today are certainly an attempt to reflect this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023558"></A>
Streamlining of the mining lease application process is to be welcomed. This will occur by removing the current requirement for the Land Court to hear mining lease applications where there are no objections. The time, effort and frustration involved in carrying out a process for the sake of it have no place in today’s government and the business area. I have no doubt that this will be an improvement in the process. To simplify and clarify the compliance requirements under the Clean Energy Act will address some of the shortfalls encountered in the original legislation that related to the Smart Energy Savings Program. This applied to medium and large businesses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023589"></A>
In relation to the clean energy and smart energy areas, I would like to make members of the House aware of the very tangible potential for this resource in North Queensland. In my area, there is already a co-generation site at Pioneer Mill that feeds electricity back into the grid. I also understand that Stanwell and SunWater will once again be investigating a proposed 30 megawatt hydro power station at the Burdekin Falls Dam. As most members in the House are aware, the Burdekin Falls Dam is the largest in Queensland and has an enviable reliability with regard to storage holding compared to some of the more southern storages.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023594"></A>
The development of hydro-electricity is a key driver of the Queensland government’s Renewable Energy Plan. That plan aims to have 2,500 megawatts of renewable energy installed by 2020. I would suggest though, from the perspective of the Burdekin Dam, that raising the dam wall would significantly increase the potential of this hydro-electricity generation. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1023597"></A>
In addition to this, a report has been commissioned by MITEZ, the Mount Isa to Townsville Economic Development Zone, with the input and support of Townsville Enterprise, the local councils that link this corridor and the Queensland Resources Council, titled <Hansard-Italic>
Future Development of Queensland’s Carpentaria Minerals Province</Hansard-Italic>
:<Hansard-Italic>
 Developing a Resources Corridor--Clean Energy and Minerals</Hansard-Italic>
. This report was released last month. It has special relevance to this section of the amendments as it provides a tangible link to the future clean energy potential to North Queensland in particular. This document is strategic in nature and shows the potential for this project to be harnessed for the benefit of North Queensland and also naturally for Queensland as a whole. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023603"></A>
The energy potential derived from this would complement the recent announcement that the Premier made during the Queensland Growth Summit in relation to growth in regional Queensland, and Townsville in particular. Townsville is being groomed to play a very large part of that plan. Infrastructure planning is a large element of this, and electricity provision to act as a catalyst for sustained growth is paramount. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023604"></A>
I would like to share some of the salient points from that report with members of the House. The renewable energy projects would provide economic opportunities for the towns along the clean energy corridor between Townsville and Mount Isa. As many members are aware, it is a long distance and it is very sparsely populated, and some of those towns and communities along that corridor are really struggling. Small mines that have got the capacity to start along that area would be able to access electricity at a lower cost than through their own diesel or gas-fired generation, and that of course would encourage more investment into the north-west minerals province. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023606"></A>
The co-location of sites suitable for large scale solar, wind and geothermal generation with a grid connection avoids the problem of remoteness associated with many potential renewable sites in inland Australia. Once enabled through a transmission line, this clean energy corridor would provide a significant contribution to the Commonwealth government’s renewable energy target and of course the state government’s emissions reduction target as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023608"></A>
A transmission line to North Queensland would traverse the northern Galilee Basin, dramatically improving the economics of establishing a baseload power station around Pentland. There has been quite a lot of talk about the establishment of a potential baseload power station there.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023611"></A>
Three renewable energy projects positioned along the route of the proposed AC transmission line were presented at the North Queensland renewable energy roundtable forum in November last year. I will share with the House those projects that were at that roundtable: Windlab Systems Pty Ltd’s proposal for a 600-megawatt wind farm at Hughenden; Australian PhytoFuel Company’s proposal for producing biodiesel feedstock and using the waste biomass to generate power around Hughenden and Julia Creek; and Samsung’s presentation of a solar/biomass project at Pentland. All three projects would require the AC transmission, so this would require the transmission line from Mount Isa to Townsville to access the electricity grid. The location of these projects is too far from either the proposed HVDC line to Central Queensland or the existing grid in North Queensland to make connection at these points economically feasible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023622"></A>
By 2015-16, there is a potential for up to 900 megawatts of installed renewable capacity to be connected to the grid through the AC transmission line. So 300 megawatts of this installed capacity would be baseload power, biomass and solar thermal with a further 600 megawatts coming from wind power. Adjusting for the low factors for solar and wind power, potential renewable generation of around 400 megawatts could be available by 2015-16, which I understand would be equivalent to the projected demand of the north-west minerals province. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023625"></A>
But of course here again we have the chicken and egg problem for the clean energy corridor. The renewable energy projects, along with the clean energy corridor, cannot proceed without a transmission line. However, the cost competitiveness of a transmission line to Townsville depends on there being sufficient generation in North Queensland to offset the additional load in the north-west. There is a risk that the major users will dismiss the option of a transmission line traversing the clean energy corridor on account of it not being the initial lowest cost option. However, by the end of the decade, North Queensland could be a net exporter of renewable energy to Central Queensland, and this would be a major positive for North Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023631"></A>
There is a major opportunity currently for North Queensland’s major energy users, not only to secure reliable competitive energy for future use but also to foster development in both the north-west minerals province and along the proposed clean energy corridor. For the clean energy corridor to proceed, the proposed renewable energy sites would have to be connected to the electricity grid, and only the AC transmission line to North Queensland would be able to connect the majority of the renewable sites currently under investigation and have the additional benefits of providing development opportunities for the towns along the corridor, and of course enabling the smaller mining operations to access the affordable grid electricity. </Hansard-Body>

Returning to the Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill, I note the implementation of the two recommendations from <Hansard-Italic>
Brokering Balance: A Public Interest Map for Queensland Government Bodies</Hansard-Italic>
, the Weller review. The findings of that review are supported within this legislation. The Weller review recommended the current Coal Mining Safety and Health Advisory Council and the Mine Safety and Health Advisory Council be retained and renamed as committees. It is actually a very broad review. The public interest map was actually applied to 459 government bodies that were within the scope of the review, and these were just two of those government bodies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023636"></A>
Other bodies that came within the scope of that public interest map were the category 2 water boards. Two of those were the north and south Burdekin water boards. On the advice of the public interest map, category 2 water boards should be abolished and their responsibilities transferred to local government jurisdiction. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs MENKENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As we know, the Weller review does apply to a large number of category 2 water boards which do use a great deal of electricity and are definitely involved with the electricity business. I see that the minister does not agree with me on this particular case. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023678"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs MENKENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Well, there we go. However, they are a very important part of the Burdekin district, and it is very disappointing to see the changes being brought about to the water boards as a result of the Weller review. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023679"></A>
The section of the legislation which results from the Weller review relates to the enhancement of safety and health measures in Queensland’s mining, explosives and gas industries--which is perhaps the area that you would prefer me to talk about, Mr Deputy Speaker--and it is one of major importance. Requiring smaller mines to now implement the development and maintenance of a safety and health management system will come at some financial impost, but the safety of all mine ventures, whether large or small, is definitely to be supported. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023680"></A>
The mining industry is one of major importance in Queensland, and the importance of it must never be underestimated. In my electorate of Burdekin it is an essential industry. It is an essential industry that creates major employment. From the perspective of smaller mining ventures, Conquest Mining is poised to begin mining its gold, silver and copper deposits. This mine is situated behind the township of Gumlu. I know there are many people in the area poised for the commencement of that mine because they are aware that it is going to generate potentially quite a lot of employment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023684"></A>
Gold was historically mined at Mount Coolum earlier last century with a very colourful history as well. There are certainly gold and mineral deposits that still create various levels of interest. Stringent legislation, albeit often necessary, puts significant imposts on smaller mining companies, but the safety of all personnel is paramount.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023685"></A>
Coalmining, of course, centres around Collinsville and it has done for many years. The original Xstrata mine and the newer QCoal mine are there. It is very exciting that Drake Coal, which is a subsidiary of QCoal, is set to open a second mine in Collinsville. In the electorate we also have the Xstrata mine at Newlands. When it comes to workplace health and safety, the mining industry in the Burdekin area is no stranger to mining fatalities. Very sadly, Collinsville was the scene of a mining tragedy in 1954 when seven miners perished in an outburst of gas in the underground mine. This was a huge tragedy. Most of the families of those men are still living in the town and mourn their loss.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023691"></A>
As the ambitious plans of Waratah Coal and Hancock Prospecting in the Galilee Basin work toward fruition, safety is a present-day necessity. These mines will require massive rail infrastructure to move this coal to Abbot Point, where an equally major upgrade will be required to meet the increased demand for stockpiling prior to a very buoyant export shipping demand. Amendments in this legislation affecting the gas industry include changes to the certification of gas devices to provide national consistency. In the last decade it would be fair to say that technology has gone ahead in leaps and bounds when it comes to extracting gas from the earth. Australia and Queensland are leading that charge. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023694"></A>
Those people who were able to attend the briefing by Carbon Energy yesterday on underground coal gasification would no doubt have been as impressed as I was to learn so much about that process. It is exciting times in gas extraction when we see what is happening, particularly with the extraction of coal seam gas and the UCG process. The environmental implications of this form of energy production are certainly at the forefront.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023696"></A>
Associated with gas is the allied piping of the gas and the associated industries that can be and are being developed as a result of that. The approvals process for pipelines that traverse both the mainland and Queensland’s internal waters ensure pipeline proponents only need to comply with the safety and health obligations under the Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004. This amendment is intended to make a significant reduction in unnecessary regulatory burden. It is to be hoped that this really does achieve its purpose.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023698"></A>
There is also an amendment to improve electricity retailer credit support arrangements and customer service obligations. This amendment is supported as there has been a history of customers negatively affected from regional areas. It is to be hoped that there will be very positive outcomes from this particular amendment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023699"></A>
The legislation encompasses a raft of amendments. As the shadow minister has outlined, the opposition will be supporting this legislation. The mining industry is a very important industry for Queensland. It is also important that we acknowledge the efforts that companies within the mining industry are making to make their workplaces safer, healthier and more environmentally friendly areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023701"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (12.26 pm): I rise to speak to the Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. In addressing this legislation I acknowledge, as other speakers have, that mining, in particular, is a major generator of jobs, of income and of royalties to this government. It is an important player in the financial stability of the state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023702"></A>
On the converse side of that, there is also a need to recognise that mining impacts on landowners and the right of landowners to retain security of their rural pursuits. Where that security or the tenure of their land has to be taken from them, adequate compensation needs to be given to them in recognition not only of the rural value of the property but also of the loss of income and displacement that is caused.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023705"></A>
This bill is proposed to enhance safety and health measures, and that is always welcome. I think it was the Queensland government that ran a series of ads on and off at various times about workers returning home to their families safely. I think it is an important message. It is one that can be validly reinforced in all workplaces. With mining, in particular, there are areas of high risk. The enhancement of workplace health and safety measures in particularly high-risk work sites is critically important.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023706"></A>
The second tenet to this bill is to streamline and simplify government processes. It is probably in this area that I wish to speak in more detail. As I said, there has to be a balance in streamlining the process. There has to be a balance between recognising the investment of mining companies that invest significantly in preliminary investigation and in mining as a result of investment decisions and the rights and freedoms of landowners who are impacted. Invariably, mining--whether it is coal or gas mining--will impact on landowners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023709"></A>
The member for Capalaba talked about LNG and royalties. In my electorate, there are many people who are very welcoming of LNG as an industry and the jobs that will be created in both construction and in operation but there are also those who are concerned about the placement of LNG on Curtis Island, which is a greenfield site. Their concerns are valid and need to be listened to. There are also landowners affected by the pipeline process. I have had several landowners very concerned about the process come to my office. Previous speakers have mentioned--and I am sure the minister will too--the responsible attitude of mining companies in relation to their obligations to the government and to the community. Overwhelmingly, I would say that that is true. That is a statement that is made by all companies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023737"></A>
The reality is, however, that landowners do not have to deal with the company but with the individuals. Those individuals can be company representatives and they can be government department representatives. Depending on the attitude and manner of those representatives, the dealings of landowners with the government and with the companies can be either productive and positive or absolutely hellish. There have been instances--and, sadly, more than I would have cared to occur--where landowners in my electorate have been dealt with very poorly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023738"></A>
This bill intends to simplify the approval process for petroleum and gas pipelines that traverse both the mainland and Queensland’s internal waters and ensure pipeline proponents need to comply with the safety and health obligations under only one act. It also deals with the approval process in relation to the mandatory requirement for the Land Court to assess mining lease applications. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023739"></A>
We have been dealing with the concerns of a constituent of mine, Mr Jim Reynolds, through the department. His current concern relates to access--that is, the ability of the company and government representatives to access properties without the permission of the property owner. This matter relates to the LNG pipeline. Jim told my office that an excavator went through Des Dingle’s place--that is another landowner--and through his land on a Saturday. Jim said that he came home from work on Saturday evening and the excavator was in his front yard. The company, in this instance Santos, organised for the excavator to go through the land. Jim rang Santos and complained and also contacted the Mount Larcom police because he was pretty irritated by all this. There was talk of charging the owner of the business that operated the excavator with trespassing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023742"></A>
There is another story to all of this that does not relate to this bill. The incident highlights the fact that landowners are significantly disadvantaged. There are access obligations, notification obligations and procedures under the mines and energy legislation that should be adhered to. Very often in reality those processes are not adhered to and the loser in the end is the landowner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023743"></A>
This bill is proposing to remove the mandatory requirement for the Land Court to assess mining lease applications where there are ‘no properly lodged objections’. Where there are no objections at all I have no problem with the Land Court process being dispensed with. I do have some concerns--and I would seek the minister’s response on this--about the statement ‘no properly lodged objections’. That phrase could be applied pedantically. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023744"></A>
When landowners lodge objections they usually lodge them with the best intentions. If one wanted to be pedantic or if one wanted to be difficult, some objections made with the best of intentions on the part of the landowners could be ruled to be ‘not properly lodged’ because maybe they were on the wrong form or the wording was incorrect. It could be an unintentional error on the part of the landowner or an error that was not vexatious. Or a lack of experience may have caused that objection to be not properly lodged. I seek from the minister a comment about specifically how the department and the Land Court will look at these objections and whether genuinely made objections will be ruled out of order because technically they were not properly lodged. The landowner should have the right to make an objection and have minor errors accepted as human error. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023745"></A>
My fundamental concern is for those people who are suddenly impacted by mining projects. Even though there are a lot of landowners in my electorate who have been affected by mining projects, there will sometimes be new landowners who are affected and for them it is a whole new process and a whole new dilemma. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023746"></A>
In relation to pipelines, there are issues in my electorate--and my electorate is not unique; there would be issues when it comes to the pipeline coming up from the Surat--that need to be carefully monitored. Issues around pipelines are ones that rural property owners bring up all the time. I am sure that for some people and even some councils this is an old chestnut that they would rather not deal with. Most councils are very responsible and the government needs to be, too, and not just pay lip-service to things like weed control and the protection of waters. People who have what has historically been a spring fed dam or a water supply on their property may not have the engineering but they know anecdotally that that water has not failed in long, protracted dry spells. They have to fight tooth and nail to keep government departments from approving gas line corridors through waters that have historically been reliable for stock and domestic use. These are the practical problems that landowners face. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023747"></A>
In reality, an objection can be funded by the department but not an appeal. If somebody feels that their objection has not been properly heard--I am not talking about legally--or that certain matters have not been given enough weight and they want to appeal that objection, they actually have to pay for the appeal process themselves. Often that means that they are not legally represented. I believe that funding should be there for reasonable appeals as it is there for reasonable legal costs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023748"></A>
I do have concerns about the need to retain Land Court oversight of any mining leases that have objections, whether they are properly made or not. I understand that there would be times when individuals, but more particularly entities, would put in vexatious objections. We have seen that with legislation that has been brought before the House. Large companies can afford to be litigious over a long period. Most rural landowners cannot afford to be unnecessarily litigious. They have to get on and try to make a living and survive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023749"></A>
I am concerned that landowners at all times are treated properly and with respect and that their concerns are properly dealt with and not dismissed out of hand. I am also concerned that the streamlined process will not in any way disadvantage landowners who have usually invested a great deal of time, effort and soul into their properties and at times feel that they are treated very shabbily. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023750"></A>
In relation to the issues around electricity retailers and improved customer service obligations, people in my electorate are very concerned about the increasing cost of energy. I believe that we as a legislative body have to take care to protect the ability of all Queenslanders to access affordable energy. I look forward to hearing the minister’s comments. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs SULLIVAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Pumicestone--ALP) (12.39 pm): I rise to support the Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. I find it amazing that while the opposition supports this bill it still finds a lot to criticise. As the chair of the Environment and Resources Committee I was concerned about the level of criticism regarding my committee’s first report into energy efficiency tabled in parliament on 25 February this year. I find it typical of the opposition to say one thing and do the opposite.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026405"></A>
The committee is a bipartisan committee and its report was supported unanimously. That means that even members of the opposition voted for it in its entirety. However, they still included--at the last minute--a dissenting report which, quite frankly, was dismal. In fact, their first recommendation was very similar to the one in the report. It appears that they either did not read the report in its entirety or did not understand it fully. The opposition spokesman, the member for Callide--and I acknowledge his presence in the chamber--was also very critical last night of government agencies like the Office of Clean Energy and the Office of Climate Change. Of course he would be, because the opposition does not believe in climate change and therefore does not think we have to do anything about our energy usage and, more importantly, our wastage of it. Those opposite sit on their hands oblivious to what is going on around them. However, I want to place on record my thanks to all agencies involved in assisting the committee with information that helped us finalise our report. I also appreciate the input from members on the committee, particularly the members from the government side and the member for Maryborough, who did see the real value in the committee’s work. Yes, we are all very keen to hear from government in the near future about the recommendations that are in the report, and I hope that the government will take our recommendations on board and adopt them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026412"></A>
As I stated earlier, I am pleased to support this bill introduced into the House by the Minister for Mines and Energy, the Hon. Stephen Robertson, earlier this year. It assists in streamlining and simplifying those processes about savings, not only for the government but for business as well. It also addresses improvements to credit support arrangements for electricity retailers, resulting in improved services for electricity consumers. This bill amends a number of acts, including the Clean Energy Act 2008, and provides enhancements to safety and health measures in the state’s mining, explosives and gas industries, and I wish to concentrate my remarks on these enhancements. Mine safety is paramount. We have seen the devastating effect mine incidents have on workers, their families and fellow workers, and there have been several disasters televised just recently. Every mine, whether underground or open cut, must be safe to all workers in and around the mine site. Our mine safety in this country must be the envy of other countries. Queensland is leading the way in Australia with regard to mine safety but, as we all know, there is always more we can do.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026415"></A>
The 2008-09 Queensland mines and quarries safety performance report statistics reveal that deaths in mines have been greatly reduced but there were still four deaths during that time. The bill’s reform ensures that the health and safety management system which currently applies to mines with more than 10 employees will now apply to those small mines with less than 10 employees, and I welcome this change. It is only fair that miners have the best protection irrespective of the size of the mine workforce. The government is not only implementing these changes; it is assisting those mines in implementing their safety obligations. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--LNP) (12.42 pm): The Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 amends a number of acts, as we have heard from other members this morning. It amends 11 acts in total, and I will not run through them. However, I want to address one of the key areas of this bill--that is, the safety and health measures of Queensland’s mining, explosives and gas industry, and this bill aims to enhance those safety and health measures in small mines. The minister in his second reading speech said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1026421"></A>
A 2006-07 Queensland Mines Inspectorate review into metalliferous mine and quarry fatalities over the previous 10 years found there was a decrease in the number of fatalities at large mines but an increase trend in fatalities in small mines.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026422"></A>
We are worried about that, and I want to take the opportunity to commend the mining industry on its health and safety work. There are many people in the Burnett electorate who work in the larger mines to the north and to the west of the Burnett, and those mines produce a lot of wealth for our community. In speaking with the mums and dads who work at those mines, they tell me about their world-class occupational health and safety standards. They have very stringent records and safety mechanisms such as drug testing and occupational health and safety tests. I was told by one gentleman that if they do not use the hand holes on a dragline as they ascend and descend the draglines they can be sacked--they can be put off just for that breach of that occupational health and safety record--and that is appropriate. They know that if they break the laws in the mining sites then they are liable to be kicked off the site. Those high standards should be copied in other industries as well.</Hansard-Body>

 In the mining industry we always talk about life and death issues, and there are many of us here in this parliament, especially on this side of the parliament, who talk about saving lives and life and death issues, and the lives of small children are very, very important to those on this side of the parliament.</Hansard-Body>

In bringing smaller mines with 10 or fewer workers into line with larger mine safety and health systems under the Mining and Quarrying Safety and Health Act 1999, the existing laws have not addressed small mines’ safety operations and therefore have not required them to actually maintain safety and health management systems whereas the larger mines have had to maintain these systems for the past nine years. There is a community in my electorate that is very interested in mining and specifically quarry safety. There is a proposition for a quarry at South Innes Park. Holcim Australia Pty Ltd is preparing a development application to open a new quarry to be located in the Burnett at the corner of Elliott Heads Road and Barolin Homestead Road. It is anticipated that this quarry would produce 350,000 tonnes per annum and have an estimated life as a mine of 20 to 30 years. An increase in traffic from trucks is estimated to be between 70 to 90 trucks per day along Elliott Heads Road. That is 140 to 180 trucks each way per day.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026437"></A>
I have received overwhelming and significant opposition towards this new quarry from the residents of the region. In fact, one community survey found that 95 per cent rejected the proposal. Members of this community stress that they are not against progress. We must have mines and quarries to increase the wealth of our community and of our state. However, they are against putting this quarry in suburbia, which is where this quarry will be located. This quarry will be located, as the crow flies, about two kilometres from the coastline and a marine park. So there are significant environmental concerns as well. One of the other major concerns relates to the council. If the quarry is approved and it goes through the development process with the council approving it, there are then overriding departmental officers and different regulations applying to this quarry. The council may put in place a development exclusion zone around this quarry. That development exclusion zone is up to the discretion of the council. It can be anywhere between 200 metres and 1,000 metres, or a kilometre, from the site. That exclusion zone from this quarry will have a massive impact on landowners and residents of Innes Park. The exclusion zone could stop housing development and could therefore limit economic development for the next 20 to 30 years in an area that is significantly residential. The exclusion zone will immediately and significantly devalue land without the chances of compensation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026438"></A>
As we heard earlier, with the addition of a quarry in a suburban area, there will be damage to roads, creating unsafe conditions, and major intersection upgrades will be needed. There are also concerns around air pollution, dust and noise created by the quarry and the trucks. There is already dust and noise from the existing quarry in the Burnett, and another quarry would create more noise and dust and more respiratory problems caused by that dust. There are also other environmental concerns. There is the problem of waste products going into the estuaries and the ocean and the quality of the water in rainwater tanks. The coastal areas are pristine and my residents say that these areas are not the place for quarries.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029169"></A>
There is also the problem after the quarry has exhausted its life. There are massive scars left behind on the landscape after a quarry has been closed. There is the problem with blasting that occurs in quarries and the digging. There are concerns about further development of an existing quarry. If the area is allowed to be changed, it could hinder the ability to move stormwater away from a place at Innes Park called Reid Crescent in an estate on Back Windermere Road. There is also possible damage to underground water supply that has to be considered. It would then threaten farm sustainability. These are all issues that must be taken into account. </Hansard-Body>

My call today in this place is for the company proposing this quarry, Holcim, to genuinely listen to the community, find a win-win situation and relocate its proposed quarry to one of the other six sites, which are located within 100 kilometres of Bundaberg, but so far the company has refused to divulge the details of their location. I will be meeting with the company this weekend at a community meeting and I look forward to talking it through and finding a win-win situation for my community, which is situated in one of the best places in the world, and also for Holcim, because we both recognise and realise that the material that comes out of quarries is essential for building roads and, once again, for creating wealth. There are concerns, too, from workers of the existing quarry about their job security. Those workers do a great job in the quarry. Every day they risk life and limb so that we can have the quality of life that we now enjoy. </Hansard-Body>

The Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill also amends the Clean Energy Act and the Electricity Act. This morning--indeed, this week--we have heard from many ministers and the Premier about the government’s commitment to clean energy, specifically solar energy. I think every member of this place has a genuine commitment to clean energy. In relation to clean energy, I have a constituent who has highlighted to me a problem with the costs that he has incurred on upgrading to clean energy. I will write a letter to the minister about this issue on his behalf. I have been approached by Mr Bob Collinson of Childers seeking my assistance with regard to the charge by Ergon Energy for the removal of his load control unit owing to him changing to solar power--he wants to upgrade to solar. I am advised by Mr Craig Harris from Ergon Energy that the charge for the removal of the unit is currently $179.99. I am at a loss--and so is Mr Collinson and many of my other constituents--to understand why this charge is allowed. Previously, I have received complaints from constituents with regard to this issue and I now have concerns that those residents who are doing the commendable thing and saving energy by changing to solar power are being penalised by having imposed on them what I believe is a ridiculous charge. So now that the minister is here and is able to listen to these concerns directly, I would hope that he would make inquiries about this charge for those units. </Hansard-Body>

Although the opposition and other members of this House support this legislation in a bipartisan way, the member for Pumicestone made a comment in her speech that I just cannot let pass without challenging it. The member for Pumicestone said that the opposition does not believe in climate change. From my perspective that is untrue. Of course there is climate change. Climate change happened 110,000 years ago, when the average world temperature increased by five degrees--from 14 degrees to 19 degrees. Of course, 110,000 years ago there were no man-made carbon emissions. So those on the other side of the House have failed to explain why there are those cyclical changes in climate. What we on this side do not believe is that by paying money to politicians in Canberra--$20 billion worth of tax--we can stop climate change. That is what we do not believe. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MALONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mirani--LNP) (12.54 pm): It is with pleasure that I rise to speak to the Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill. The shadow minister has spoken in depth on this bill. Certainly, it is wide-ranging and covers quite a considerable area of resource management legislation. I would like to raise a number of issues that relate to the legislation and the direction that it takes. I also want to talk a little bit about the progress of mining in my electorate and its surrounds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029184"></A>
Initially, I would like to refer to a win-win situation that can be achieved if the Mount Morgan process goes ahead whereby Norton gold holdings will move in and reprocess most of the slag that was left from the previous goldmining operation. I understand that currently the company is waiting for finance to enable it to do that. That would certainly be a huge step forward for the community of Mount Morgan, which has gone on to the backburner over the past 30 or 40 years since the mine closed down. It will be a huge opportunity for the young people of Mount Morgan to achieve gainful employment at the mine.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029186"></A>
Norton gold holdings is talking about not only extracting the gold out of the slag pits but also generating sulphuric acid out of the pyrites, which is a big part of some of the ongoing environmental problems with the operations at Mount Morgan. If that can happen, it would certainly take away some of the risk that is currently inherent in the toxic dam at the original site of the Mount Morgan mine. So there is a real benefit from this proposed mining operation, particularly in terms of the financial liabilities of the Queensland government, if it indeed goes ahead. I would implore the minister and his department to be supportive of it and to look at all opportunities for this mining operation to go ahead. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1029188"></A>
In terms of the major ports at Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point and their possible expansion to Dudgeon Point, which is an approximately 600-acre land resource alongside that area, there are some environmental issues in terms of the people who live around the area. It is important that that environmental process is taken to the nth degree in terms of satisfying people’s concerns about dust and noise. As many people would realise, some years ago the Ports Corporation of Queensland had to virtually buy out the small community of Louisa Creek simply because of dust and noise issues. Of course, it is very obvious as we move forward and shipping increases through Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point that there are constraints on QR in its endeavours to move the coal down the coast. That is becoming more and more of an issue. Over many years there has been talk of a second access for QR down Connors Range. Quite frankly, I believe that until that second access is progressed, QR is always going to be a bottleneck in terms of moving increasing amounts of coal from the hinterland down to the coast. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1029193"></A>
As has been spoken about in the House earlier, we also have the development of the Galilee Basin and the proposal to have a standard gauge rail line from that area through to Abbot Point. That line will certainly have an impact through my area and other areas through to Abbot Point. There is also the possibility of having a spur line down to Dalrymple Bay. Under normal circumstances, standard gauge rail will carry almost double the amount of coal per train set as can be carried on narrow gauge rail. I think that, as we move forward with increasing amounts of coal, we should be thinking clearly about how we develop our rail network throughout Queensland. One of the big impacts--and other members have spoken about this issue--of coalmining in Queensland is the impact that it is has on small communities and the provision of housing.</Hansard-Body>

Before the lunch break I was speaking about the impacts of mining on smaller communities. I pointed out the cost of housing in some of the smaller communities. For instance, around Dysart where the Saraji mine operates, a four-bedroom house a little while ago was going for $1,800 a week. Even though there are mining camps in the area there are other people who live in the community who have to access accommodation as well. The Minister for Infrastructure has become aware of issues around Blackwater. There are some real issues in communities such as Middlemount, Dysart, even up in Glendon, where there are police officers, teachers and workers in the community who are finding it difficult to find affordable housing under those conditions. When the Minister for Housing stands up in this House and talks about affordable housing and the communities in which she is building it, maybe she needs to look at building affordable housing in areas that are covered by the mining industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033915"></A>
One of the biggest impacts of mining throughout Queensland is in terms of infrastructure and roads. The old Bruce Highway from Sarina through to Marlborough was taken back to a state road. There are a number of single-lane bridges on that road. Currently as a result of the mining industry we are finding a lot of people using the old Bruce Highway to either go through to Rockhampton or come back from Mackay. I can assure members that those single-lane wooden bridges are very dangerous. The quality of the road is becoming pretty ordinary as well. There is a real issue with the state government lifting its game in terms of maintaining those state roads and hopefully improving the state roads that service the mining industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033916"></A>
One of the issues that I am finding as I move around the electorate is the impact of corridors. I am particularly talking about the corridors that have been set aside from the Fitzroy River through to Gladstone for mainly water but quite a lot of other industries are looking at utilising the same corridor. There seems to be a real move to put those corridors through private land. I cannot for the life of me understand why they do not follow the corridors that are already set aside for roads et cetera. These are having major impacts on people’s lives. It is not just about the corridor going through and the disruption to their services or lifestyle; it also has an impact in terms of weed management and a whole lot of things that go along with that. It would seem so much simpler--to me, anyway--for those services, such as the proposal for a gas pipeline and a nickel slurry line coming through from Marlborough, to be legislated to enforce that those sorts of services should be run parallel to roads and be contained within the gazetted road corridor. There are many people living in those areas who would totally support that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033917"></A>
The legislation also makes changes in relation to the gas industry. I am a person who has played around with air conditioning and refrigeration a little bit--very much in an amateurish way. When fluorocarbons were banned because of the greenhouse gas effects, there was a push at that time to use hydrocarbons for the refrigerant. It is good to see that we are moving along those lines with this legislation. Although I have not consulted with refrigeration mechanics, hopefully it overcomes many of the problems that have been around for quite some time now. That is a step in the right direction. </Hansard-Body>

In terms of renewable power, I heard the member for Burdekin talking about sugar mills in the Burdekin producing green power. Mackay Sugar has announced an upgrade of its boiler. I will quote some of the facts in relation to that upgrade--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033919"></A>
The Cogeneration Project at Mackay Sugar’s Racecourse mill involves: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1033920"></A>
•	the construction of an efficient high pressure boiler on the Racecourse mill site to replace the existing No. 1 Boiler. The boiler has been designed for firing on Bagasse, coal and a combination of both Bagasse and coal; and </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1033921"></A>
•	an STG designed to supply steam and electricity to the mill and the adjacent refinery and electricity to the North Queensland grid. The anticipated average output of the generator is approximately 36kW. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033922"></A>
The Cogeneration Project is being managed by Mackay Sugar with the cogeneration plant delivered under the EPC Contract and other major associated works will be delivered under separate contracts. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Centred>
<A ID="pgfId-1033923"></A>
...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Centred>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033924"></A>
The Cogeneration plant will be fuelled by Bagasse during the crushing season and for part of the non-crushing season. In a normal year there will be surplus of Bagasse at Racecourse mill and additional tonnage of Bagasse which can be trucked from Mackay Sugar’s other mills. It is expected that there will be sufficient Bagasse stored at the end of the crushing season to operate the cogeneration facility for approximately three months after the end of the crushing season. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033925"></A>
When the Bagasse supplies have been deleted, the boiler will then be fuelled by coal. Coal is currently purchased from Blair Athol Coal Pty Ltd and Mackay Sugar is extending this contract to receive coal from Blair Athol Coal Pty Ltd’s new Clermont mine in the future. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033926"></A>
That is a real step forward and cements again the green credentials of the sugar industry on top of the trash blanketing system that it has in place. It has been interesting to be in the parliament in the last couple of days while the state government has made much of its solar power project. We all believe that solar power is a step forward. The interesting claim that it will save the building of one power generator in Queensland I think is a bit over-the-top. The fact of the matter is that solar power is a great source of green energy but at the end of the day when the lights go out and the sun goes down there has to be a back-up power source. The bulk power source that we currently have is mostly coal fired. Right through Europe there is a reliance on solar power and wind generation and it does not go well in the middle of winter when there is no sun and very little wind. I would be a little cautious in the claims that are being made by this government in terms of its solar power projects. With those few words I support the bill. </Hansard-Body>

Reviews of the Local Government Act 1993 and the City of Brisbane Act 1924 were initiated when I was the minister for local government in 2006. So it is with pleasure that I inform the House the new Local Government Act 2009 received assent on 12 June 2009 and will commence on 1 July 2010. Today I introduce a bill for the City of Brisbane to parliament. Both these new statutes provide for contemporary governance for the councils of Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033979"></A>
The new City of Brisbane Bill 2010 is the result of hard work by officers of the department’s Local Government Services and Brisbane City Council. Through this hard work I believe we have got the balance right between Brisbane City Council as Queensland’s largest local government and Brisbane City Council as a major corporation providing infrastructure and services for over one million people. This bill will strengthen and support the council and provide it with greater capacity and flexibility to serve the people of Brisbane. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033982"></A>
The current City of Brisbane Act is 86 years old, so it is clearly out of date for a progressive and fast-growing city in 2010, especially one that seeks to be Australia’s new-world city. Though Brisbane was proclaimed a municipality on 6 September 1859, Brisbane owes its status as Queensland’s capital city to custom rather than statutory authority. This bill gives formal legislative acknowledgement to Brisbane as our Queensland capital, appropriately so as it is the largest local government in Australia and so warrants this stand-alone legislation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033983"></A>
Though modelled on the Local Government Act 2009, this bill also contains updated provisions from the old City of Brisbane Act which are unique to Brisbane City Council, such as the City Botanic Gardens and Brisbane River crossings. Important provisions in the Local Government Act 2009 that will also apply to the Brisbane City Council in the bill include a principles based approach, a chief executive officer with defined responsibilities, and requirements for long-term financial planning and reporting. The principles based approach gives Brisbane the flexibility to develop its own policies, operational procedures and processes, and it also makes the new legislation more user-friendly for council practitioners, residents and ratepayers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033984"></A>
Brisbane ratepayers today rightly expect high standards from their elected representatives. From time to time, Brisbane residents want to understand how council processes work and they also want to know who is accountable. As a result, the bill before the House today clarifies the responsibilities of the mayor, councillors and the chief executive officer. The existing 1924 act was written for its time. Brisbane is now a totally different city. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033985"></A>
Where powers and responsibilities of the mayor and councillors were once poorly defined, they have now been spelled out and strengthened. The mayor’s responsibilities include leading and controlling the business of council, preparing and presenting the budget for adoption, managing the strategic direction of the council and, with the chief executive officer, achieving a modern, responsive and sustainable administration. Importantly, the City of Brisbane Bill 2010 supports the wider community’s expectation that its elected representatives will look after the interests of all residents in an open and transparent manner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033986"></A>
To ensure a continuation of the highest standard of transparency and accountability by councillors, the bill retains provisions and serious penalties relating to the misuse of information to cause detriment to the council. Detriment here is not about political embarrassment, or disagreements between councillors; neither is it about matters that are and should be in the public domain. It is right that there is public debate about the positives and negatives of council’s projects, plans and policies. This is in the public interest and this will not trigger the misuse of information provisions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033987"></A>
To cause detriment to the council has been clearly defined in the bill to include: to sabotage a lawful process of the council, including adopting a budget or conducting a tender process, for example, or; to cause the council to suffer a loss in its lawful performance of a function or commercial activity, including the loss of a future contractual arrangement, for example. I am advised that Brisbane city councillors are currently able to view commercial-in-confidence material such as tenders and contracts. This is continued in the new bill. </Hansard-Body>

Apart from senior executives, the chief executive officer is responsible for appointing council staff and can direct and take disciplinary action against workers. When and what type of disciplinary action may be taken will be prescribed by regulation. A regulation will also cover employee discipline appeals.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033989"></A>
The Department of Infrastructure and Planning will continue to work closely with stakeholders to develop a regulation that protects the rights of council employees whilst recognising the needs of the council. The bill recognises the importance of councillors being able to access council information relating to their own ward and supports councillors in their representation of constituents. This bill makes it clear that councillors have rights to access information. However, with those rights come responsibilities about the use of this information. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036625"></A>
By empowering the chief executive officer to decide what requests for information and advice are reasonable, councillor access to information has been balanced with the need to ensure the administration is not overly burdened and confidential information is not released. Acceptable request guidelines will be adopted by the council to support this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036632"></A>
Following a request from the Lord Mayor, Brisbane City Council will be exempted from requirements under the Right to Information Act 2009 for documents created in the course of local government budget deliberations. During the budget process, council considers a range of options and possible projects as they work towards reaching a balance between income--with its impacts on ratepayers--and expenditure, capital works programs and employment generation. Though this issue was brought to my attention by the Lord Mayor in relation to Brisbane’s budgetary processes, the provision under RTI will apply to all local governments in Queensland. This provision is endorsed by the Local Government Association of Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036633"></A>
The bill recognises the Brisbane City Council’s Establishment and Coordination Committee. This is a reflection of the unique size and status of BCC. The bill also amends the RTI Act given the recognition of the Establishment and Coordination Committee. Committee information will be exempt for 10 years after its relevant date. Exempt information includes the committee’s submissions, briefing notes, agendas and minutes. In balancing these exemptions, the public will have access to information through an amendment to the Right to Information Act 2009. This will allow for the development of publication guidelines about available information of or about the council’s Establishment and Coordination Committee.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036634"></A>
At the end of the day, the performance of the local government system remains the state’s constitutional responsibility but the complexity of the Brisbane City Council, its party political nature and its continuous strong performance over many decades mean the Minister for Local Government requires few powers of intervention. The minister may, however, require Brisbane to provide information to monitor and evaluate council’s compliance with its obligations and legal responsibilities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036635"></A>
The local law-making process includes a state interest check and new local laws will have to be approved by the minister prior to gazettal. This is also reflected in an amendment to the Local Government Act 2009 to ensure sound local laws across the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036636"></A>
To reduce and streamline the legislative burden, the City of Brisbane Bill repeals the Brisbane City Council Business and Procedures Act 1939, the Local Government (Chinatown and the Valley Malls) Act 1984, the Local Government (Queen Street Mall) Act 1981 and the Australian Estates Company Limited, Hastings Street, New Farm Viaduct Authorisation Act 1962. Any relevant, continuing provisions from these repealed acts that apply only to the Brisbane City Council are covered in the new legislation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036637"></A>
Electoral provisions contained in the repealed City of Brisbane Act 1924 and electoral provisions relevant to the Brisbane City Council in the repealed Local Government Act 1993 have been continued and will apply to Brisbane City Council elections. These operate with the Electoral Act 1992 and provide for elections, 26 councillors and a directly-elected mayor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036638"></A>
Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to let you know that following discussions with the Local Government Association of Queensland, an amendment will be made to the Local Government Act 2009 to clarify the parameters of the material personal interest provisions. This amendment makes it clear in the definition of an ‘ordinary business matter’ that a person does not have a material personal interest merely because they are a member of a non-profit, charitable or religious organisation involving no personal financial gain or loss to the person.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036639"></A>
In response to concerns about what constitutes family in relation to material personal interest declarations, the legislation will now stipulate that this is a parent, child, sibling or partner and should therefore only very occasionally require the councillor to withdraw from participation in council business. The bill presented today provides for a new, modernised statutory local government framework for the City of Brisbane. This is an important step forward for Australia’s premier growing capital city. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1036660"></A>
That the bill be now read a second time.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036661"></A>
The bill primarily implements key measures for the second stage of the Queensland government’s swimming pool safety improvement strategy. In the five years from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2009, 35 young children drowned in Queensland residential swimming pools. All, except one, were under five years of age. It is also estimated that 50 young children present to emergency departments each year due to immersion injuries, some of whom suffer permanent brain damage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036662"></A>
In 2008 and 2009 the Queensland government conducted a review of its swimming pool safety laws. An independent swimming pool safety review committee, including representatives from Kidsafe Australia, the Queensland Master Builders Association, Housing Industry Association, Australian Institute of Building Surveyors and the Swimming Pool and Spa Association, was established and provided a report to the government with 23 recommendations--all of which will be put in place.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036663"></A>
Following extensive consultation, and to allow pool owners and local government time to adjust, the government has adopted a two-staged swimming pool safety improvement strategy to implement these recommendations. Stage 1, which applies to new pools, commenced on 1 December. Stage 2, which affects existing pools, is expected to be brought before the House later this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036664"></A>
This bill amends the Building Act 1975 to facilitate a new swimming pool safety inspector licensing system and establish a Pool Safety Council to oversee the administration of that licensing system. The licensing system needs to be in place by mid-2010 to ensure a smooth transition for the draft stage 2 measures that include mandatory inspections at the point of sale or lease. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036665"></A>
Coronial findings on the pool drownings of young children have repeatedly found defective fences at fault. Many of these children have gained access to a fenced pool through a gate or door including instances where a pool gate has been propped open, an automatic latch found to be defective, or via a door that forms both part of the house and the pool barrier.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036666"></A>
Tragically many of these incidents occur shortly after families with young children move into a new and unfamiliar environment. This is why the state government has proposed pool owners who want to sell or lease a property will first need to obtain a pool safety certificate. We want to ensure residential pools are safe before a new family moves in.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036667"></A>
In order to facilitate this requirement, the bill creates a swimming pool inspector licensing system and a new class of licensed pool safety inspectors. Under the amendments, licensed swimming pool safety inspectors will be empowered to conduct pool safety inspections on swimming pools controlled by state law. Inspectors will issue a pool safety certificate only if a pool meets the prescribed standard. Organisations such as the Local Government Association of Queensland and the Royal Life Saving Society have voiced their support for this new pool safety inspector licensing system. A licensed pool safety inspector will also be able to carry out ‘minor repairs’ prescribed under the Building Regulation 2006. This is expected to help reduce costs for pool owners by reducing the need for multiple inspections.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039514"></A>
Under the bill an independent Pool Safety Council will be established to oversee the swimming pool safety licensing system. Council’s role will include approving pool safety inspector training courses, licensing inspectors, responding to complaints and imposing disciplinary sanctions on inspectors. To ensure pool safety inspectors receive high-quality and relevant training, amendments under the bill provide that registered training organisations and other approved training organisations deliver approved courses. Guidelines to specify the required content for these courses will be published.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039518"></A>
The bill also provides the authority to create and maintain a state based swimming pool register. The pool register will contain information gathered by licensed swimming pool safety inspectors, building certifiers and local governments. Owners of regulated pools will be required to register, and an offence will apply to owners who fail to register their pools. These amendments are necessary to ensure a smooth transition to the mandatory point-of-sale and lease inspection system. This will allow owners preparing to sell or lease their properties time to obtain a pool safety certificate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039519"></A>
The bill also includes amendments to the ‘ban the banners’ provisions under the Building Act 1975. Following the passage of the ‘ban the banners’ amendments through the parliament last year, I made it clear that I was keen to listen to concerns from the property sector based upon its practical experience of the legislation’s operation. As a consequence of subsequent extensive consultation with key stakeholders and the community, the decline in industry confidence in the wake of the global financial crisis was identified as being put at further risk by some elements of the amendments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039520"></A>
For this reason, the government proposes to amend the ‘ban the banners’ provisions to ensure legislation does not hamper confidence in the residential property sector. However, the government remains committed to its election pledge, and the bill provides that covenants relating to house orientation remain valid when they require an orientation for energy efficiency purposes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039521"></A>
While there will be no changes to the current prohibitions relating to minimum floor area, covenants will be able to require a minimum frontage to preserve street amenity. This will be allowed except where imposing a minimum frontage would result in the construction of less energy efficient housing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039522"></A>
The bill will have no effect on the existing prohibitions on solar hot-water systems, photovoltaic cells, dark coloured roofs, energy efficient windows and the minimum number of bathrooms and bedrooms. Other elements of these provisions are proposed to be removed. However, it is important to note that it is in the interest of industry to deliver a diverse product suitable to the needs and desires of Queenslanders. To help industry help provide certainty to the residential property sector, the ‘ban the banners’ provisions will start at the commencement of the act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039523"></A>
The bill also amends the Urban Land Development Authority Act 2007 to enable the authority to approve a proposed development if it is consistent with either a previous preliminary approval, obtained from local government, or the land use plan prepared by the authority. The amendments also provide certainty as to the process the authority is required to undertake to seal plans and will support the authority’s primary function of bringing land to market quickly.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039524"></A>
Finally, the bill also amends the Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association Act 1971 to provide the Governor in Council the power to approve of the association selling land and for the Governor in Council to attach conditions on any such approval. This amendment will ensure the proposed redevelopment of the Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association showgrounds can proceed without undue obstacles, thereby preserving the future of the RNA and one of Brisbane’s most iconic events, the Ekka, into the future. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

This bill will deliver three significant reforms. First, it will better facilitate the development of infrastructure to deal with the challenges of a growing population. Specifically, it will deliver a clear legislative framework for the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project--a project that will literally transform the Gold Coast. Second, the bill will strengthen protection of the marine environment by providing tougher powers to Maritime Safety Queensland. Particularly, we will increase penalties for marine pollution.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039540"></A>
Third, the bill will amend legislation to create a robust port planning regime for the future, maintain Queensland Rail as a passenger focused government owned corporation and establish QR National as a proud, Queensland based company. In addition to these significant reforms, the bill also includes a range of amendments designed to improve the clarity and effectiveness of legislative requirements.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039541"></A>
The government has a proud record of investing in infrastructure to improve the public transport system. The increasing complexity of projects, advancing technology, complex urban footprint, and the scale of capital investment means that legislation needs amendment to facilitate delivery through, for example, public-private partnerships. We are on the threshold of engaging in a public-private partnership for the delivery of the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project, which will transform the city of the Gold Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039542"></A>
The Gold Coast Rapid Transit light rail system is expected to take 75,000 cars per day off the coastal strip by 2016. Consistent with the government’s commitment to reducing emissions from household fuel consumption by one-third by 2020, the Gold Coast Rapid Transit is projected to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions by 114,000 tonnes within the first 10 years of its operation. </Hansard-Body>

The <Hansard-Italic>

 incident and <Hansard-Italic>
Shen Neng 1</Hansard-Italic>
’s grounding east of Great Keppel Island highlight the importance of robust national and state marine pollution legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039548"></A>
The bill amends the Transport Operations (Marine Pollution) Act 1995 to provide greater protection for Queensland’s marine and coastal environments. Given the magnitude and complexity of such incidents, legislation will be strengthened to ensure Maritime Safety Queensland is empowered to respond effectively and that penalties are appropriate. Penalties already apply where a ship has spilled oil, oil residue, noxious liquid or jettisoned harmful substances, such as containerised cargo, into Queensland coastal waters. However, they do not adequately reflect the potentially catastrophic consequences for Queensland’s economy or marine environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039549"></A>
The bill increases penalties for these offences to a maximum of $500,000 for an individual and $10 million for a body corporate. These financial penalties are the equal toughest in the country. They reflect the government’s commitment to protecting Queensland’s pristine marine environment and send a message to the thousands of ship crews who pass through Queensland waters that nothing but the greatest attention to safety and care will be tolerated.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042367"></A>
Authorised officers will have greater powers to act when a pollution risk is identified, and to ensure that appropriate action is taken to address risks before a ship is allowed to operate again. The bill will improve Maritime Safety Queensland’s access to corporate information when investigating the causes of marine pollution incidents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042371"></A>
The Transport Operations (Marine Safety) Act 1994 will be amended to give shipping inspectors powers to direct ships with non-compliant safety equipment to return to port or to an area for which their equipment is compliant. The bill facilitates the framework into the future for the commercial restructure of the Port of Brisbane, Abbot Point Coal Terminal and QR Ltd’s above-rail coal and freight business and below-rail coal network. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042373"></A>
New provisions will be included in transport legislation to protect Queensland’s interests following the divestment of these entities. Specifically, the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 will be amended to require QRNational to maintain its headquarters in Queensland. A 15 per cent shareholding cap will be imposed on any one person or entity or their associates owning shares in QRNational. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042375"></A>
For the Port of Brisbane, major amendments in the bill relate to setting a solid planning regime under the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 applicable to the port. Port operators have a range of statutory powers under this act. This bill amends the existing regime in relation to port charging and control powers to take into account that the Port of Brisbane will be managed by a private sector entity. Currently, the Transport Infrastructure Act provides a planning regime for strategic port land. The bill will establish a modified framework for the Port of Brisbane to reflect that the port operator will not be a government entity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042376"></A>
The amendments also include provisions relating to state toll road corridor land declarations. Recent transport legislation amendment bills have introduced nationally consistent transport legislation for heavy vehicles, including legislation for driver fatigue, speeding and overloading. This bill introduces a wider range of enforcement measures and court based orders for heavy vehicle offences, based on the national heavy vehicle compliance and enforcement reform package approved by the Australian Transport Council. The new measures and orders will provide more options to transport inspectors and police officers when enforcing heavy vehicle laws. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042377"></A>
Combined with existing penalties and demerit points they are designed to help reduce the number of offences committed by heavy vehicle drivers and other parties in the chain of responsibility, and improve road safety for all road users. These amendments are supported by the transport industry, transport union and freight customers and will play an important role in ensuring professional and efficient road transport. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042378"></A>
There are many important amendments in this bill that are vital for managing growth in our state. I commend this bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.12 pm): I rise in support of the Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill. I reluctantly support this bill due to the amendments to the Coal Mining Safety and Health Act 1999 and the Mining and Quarrying Safety and Health Act 1999. In my view, it is a shame that the Weller review recommended that the current Coal Mining Safety and Health Advisory Council and the Mining Safety and Health Advisory Council be retained but that they be renamed as committees and that the membership should not be remunerated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042388"></A>
Whilst I am aware that the government has accepted these recommendations, I am personally saddened that the public administration semantic seems to have been played here. If the coal industry is to be respected and if coalminers themselves are to be respected and valued in our community I am concerned that these councils have been downgraded in terms of status from councils to committees. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042389"></A>
I believe that Queensland rides on the coal industry’s back and there are many people in my community who believe the same thing. Therefore I cannot fathom at all why these two important councils have been downgraded to mere committees whose members are not to be paid, and I do not care who recommended it or why. The coalminers that I have spoken to both in my local area--most of whom are retired--and in Central Queensland cannot understand it either. Therefore I ask the minister: is their contribution not to be valued? Are coalminers’ lives to be valued? Was there any consultation with the coalminers at the coalface? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042392"></A>
Last year at the Miners Memorial Day, which I attended on the minister’s behalf, the miners wore red T-shirts. They did this because they wanted industry specific legislation and they also wanted industry specific bodies to look after their health and safety matters. They wanted the councils kept. They did not want them downgraded to committees. I agree with them. But I also acknowledge that it is better to have committees than nothing at all--but it is not much better. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042394"></A>
I would also like the minister to outline in his summing-up to this parliament whether or not the resourcing of these committees will be the same as it was for the councils. I want to know whether there will be the same budgets supplied to the committees as there were supplied to these councils. I want to know whether there will be the same number of public servants there to support these committees as there were to support the councils. I hope that in future this will not have to be reviewed again--and certainly not if there is another mining disaster or another serious accident in the coal industry. Only in the last week and a half we have seen major coalmine disasters in the United States and China. Coalmining is a dangerous industry and we need to accept that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042396"></A>
Everyone in this House should attend the Miners Memorial Day. Once a year they gather to remember those who have been killed in mining accidents. It is an extremely sad day. It affects me enormously personally as my great-grandfather was killed in an Ipswich coalmine. My father was injured many times in the Ipswich coalmines. He was on workers compensation for months on end and our family income suffered immensely. We worried whether or not he would come home and what state he would be in when he came home. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042398"></A>
Only mining families understand this. Only in this chamber do people like me understand what it is like to hear and watch their father wince in pain and agony as my mother poured Condy’s crystals onto his back as he recovered from being pinned down on the floor of a coalmine with coal embedded in his back. To this day he still has a black scar running down his back. As I have said, he was on workers compensation for many months after this. But he went back down the mine as that is what coalminers do. They trust their mates to dig them out as that is what their brothers in the mining union do automatically. They protect each other and look after each other. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042400"></A>
The coalminers and their families believe, rightly or wrongly, that these industry safety councils have been downgraded and that they are mere committees, and I understand how they feel. I never want to see the day where the next step is to get rid of these committees. Again, I ask the minister to provide advice on this in his summing-up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042401"></A>
I want to comment on some of the issues that the member for Mirani pointed out to us, particularly in relation to mining camps. I believe that there is no place in the coalmining industry in this day and age for mining camps. I believe that mining camps are disgraceful. Mining towns should be established in new areas where mines are being built. Mining towns where men and women miners have their families with them and where communities can be formed and developed are, in my view, the way to go. These camps sicken me. Hot bedding sickens me. Camps with raw sewage sicken me. This is 2010; it is not 100 years ago when people like my great-grandfather and my grandfathers were fighting for these sorts of conditions to be scrapped. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042402"></A>
I also come from the mining industry. Many people in this House do not know this but I spent four years in the mining industry. I worked for Curragh. When I worked for Curragh we built two construction sites. We had a dragline camp and another construction camp. We also had a caravan park on site with individual ensuites. The workforce, our miners, were housed in the town of Blackwater in state-of-the-art houses that were built specifically for them. These houses are still at the forefront of the mining industry in Australia today. I can remember in 1982-83 when we first opened houses in Blackwater that we invited the then minister, Minister Terry White, to come up and open the first 27 houses that we built--as the member for Gregory would be aware--around the town centre in Blackwater. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042440"></A>
I can remember Terry White saying to everyone in Blackwater at the time that they were not coalminers’ houses--they were too good for them; they were actually Mater prize homes. I make no apology for building those types of homes for the workforce in Blackwater at the time. Nothing is too good for our coalminers, especially where I am involved. In fact, I pay tribute to the mine manager at the time, Tom Kuzman, and Barry Golding, a senior civil engineer. The fact is that we employed architects like Noel Robinson and John Hockings to design the homes in Blackwater, and they were state-of-the-art houses. To this day right across Australia they are still at the forefront of coalmining housing architecture. I believe that there should be no coalmining camps and there should only be communities for families, and I ask the minister and the shadow minister to take my views on board. I am speaking from the heart here. I believe that in 2010 we should be better than this in this state. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr JOHNSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gregory--LNP) (3.20 pm): Well, isn’t it a breath of fresh air to hear somebody standing up for what she believes to be absolutely right when it comes to the coalmining industry, and I congratulate the member for Bundamba. I also congratulate the shadow minister for mines and energy for his speech last evening, because he gave a precise and accurate assessment of what is and should be happening in the coalmining industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042460"></A>
To carry on from where the honourable member for Bundamba left off, Blackwater is a coalmining town. It is a town 100 per cent associated with the coalmining industry. Everything that town does is relative to coal. Regardless of whether it is an open-cut mine or an underground mine around Blackwater in the Central Highlands, these mines are dangerous environments. When we talk about coalmining we are not talking about draglines, longwalls, scrapers and bulldozers, power or water; first and foremost we are talking about the human lives behind these operations on a 24-hour basis. These men and women are at the forefront of an area where safety is the No. 1 factor. I do not think we can put enough emphasis on safety. There was a tragedy at Blackwater last year, and that was an unfortunate situation. We cannot take our eye off the ball for one half of one minute.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042469"></A>
The Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 is an important piece of legislation which covers many aspects, but there is only one aspect I really want to touch on--that is, coalmining safety. The explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1042471"></A>
The Weller Review recommended that they be renamed as ‘Committees’ and that membership should not be remunerated. The Government has accepted these recommendations.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042472"></A>
Change is good and change is always something pretty special, and during the 20 years I have been in this place there have been many changes in metalliferous mines and quarries. Over the last 10 years the Mines Inspectorate has examined fatalities in Queensland mining. The explanatory notes go on to state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1042474"></A>
Large mine fatalities dropped from 24 in the 1990s to eight in the 2001-2009 period, while small mine fatalities increased from five in the 1990s to eight in the 2001-2009 period. This trend is reflected in statistics for other Australian jurisdictions.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042475"></A>
Regardless of whether it is a large operation or a small operation, safety is paramount. It again comes back to that human factor. The BMA mine at Blackwater is hoping to lift productivity over the next few years. No-one denies the fact that we have to lift productivity, but we have to ensure the safety of those workers. Many people think that safety in mines relates to the mine site. They forget that it is about driving to and from work. They also forget that mine workers work 12-hour shifts. Many of them go home and go to bed, but some do not. Rather, they will get into a car and drive to Yeppoon, Rockhampton, Mackay, Gladstone or wherever their loved ones and families are who they have been displaced from over the period of that shift. That puts a safety factor into effect that has also contributed to some of the work going on in mining operations. I cannot emphasise enough the dangers of this great industry. It is an industry that is at the forefront of the wealth generation capacity of this state. The safety of these workers, regardless of whether they are travelling to or from work or whether they are at their workplace, is paramount.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042477"></A>
I want to come back to what the member for Bundamba touched on earlier, and that is the mining camps in Blackwater--these absolutely disgraceful places where these people live, where these men and women who work in this great industry live. There are about 1,500 or 1,600 people housed in that accommodation at Blackwater. I have to congratulate the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning, the Hon. Stirling Hinchliffe, for visiting Blackwater in recent weeks and viewing firsthand the disgraceful, despicable state of this accommodation. This morning in the House the minister made reference to that deplorable housing situation. He was aghast when he saw it, because I looked at his face when he was touring the area with the mayor of the Central Highlands Regional Council, Peter McGuire. The minister was genuinely aghast when he saw that area, and he told the local media what he thought, too. It is very rewarding to see that he is putting measures in place to correct that situation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042482"></A>
There is certainly a long way to go in that regard, and in the past there has been too much blame passed on to the former Duaringa shire council. The amalgamated council, the Central Highlands Regional Council, incorporates those four Central Highlands councils. The Minister for Infrastructure and Planning, the Minister for Mines and Energy and the government as a whole can work in conjunction with the local authority in the Central Highlands to bring about a remedy to correct this unfortunate situation. I note that the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning has come back into the House, and I thank him for visiting Blackwater a couple of weeks ago.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042488"></A>
The infrastructure associated with the coalmining industry is of paramount importance. At this point in time the government has Queensland Rail’s coal and mineral division up for sale. If I was trying to sell property I would make sure that that property was mickey mouse, that it was up to scratch, that everything was there and that it looked pretty good. There would be people travelling around Queensland now looking at that infrastructure unbeknown to Queensland Rail and the Queensland government to see exactly how they would be gauging their platform for sale. One only has to drive from Blackwater to Rocky and see the Pacific National crash site. On the side of the line there is twisted steel and twisted wrecks of railway wagons all over the place. How much longer are we going to see this mess lying around? Those people would probably think, ‘This must be a pretty good show this. The railway infrastructure has probably decayed and fallen over. We’ve got a twisted wreck of a train here.’ This does not paint a good image. I trust that the Minister for Transport will take stock of this situation in conjunction with her shareholding minister, the Treasurer, to ensure that we paint a better image so that, if Queensland is going to sell this operation, we get the best price possible. Given the situation up there now, which is not painting the best picture, we are not going to get the best price possible.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045577"></A>
Another aspect of the coalmining industry I want to talk about relates to strategic cropping land. In February the government put out a paper for comment in relation to strategic cropping land. The shadow minister, the member for Callide, made reference to this matter last night. He canvassed it very well in his address. The LNP has a paper that our leader will be making reference to in the next couple of days. I have asked a question of the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning in relation to this issue. As I see it, we are talking here about pristine agricultural land--I call it black alluvial soil--in the Central Highlands region. I know that that type of soil is also on the Darling Downs area as it is in other parts of Queensland. They do not make this land anymore. Open-cut coalmines will render this country absolutely worthless. I believe that there is a power of country in Queensland that coalmining operations can take advantage of. We can use that type of inferior land for coalmining purposes. That does not mean to say that those rural aggregations are not worth the money that this prime land is worth, but over many years we have witnessed all of that beautiful area of the Redlands, which was once beautiful farming land where vegetables were grown, become residential estates. If that is going to continue to happen in this great state, we will see the guts torn out of that Central Highlands country and see it turned into coalmines. I hope that does not happen. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045581"></A>
As the honourable member for Callide said, we have to have the mining industry work in unison with the agricultural industry. It is not about saying, ‘No, you can’t go there,’ or, ‘You can go there,’ but we have to make certain that that mickey mouse black alluvial soil is protected for all time. That land cannot be returned to its natural state by draglines, bulldozers and scrapers. That soil has developed scientifically over thousands of years to be in the state that it is in today. I hope that, through the government’s strategic cropping land planning framework discussion paper, there will be a recommendation to cement the foundations of what we in the LNP have been saying, too. As the shadow minister said yesterday, there is room for both industries. We cannot have a one-way street that will have long-term ramifications for our agricultural industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045582"></A>
Today I heard the member for Mirani make reference to the cost of housing. That is certainly an impost on these rural areas in question. Time and time again we have seen that as soon as you mention mining, or coalmining in particular, the price of housing doubles or trebles. I do not believe that is fair, because there is a social divide in the wage structure of people who work in the mining industry and people who work in businesses in rural towns. I say to the government that it is very important that affordable land is made available in mining towns so that people can buy land at a reasonable rate and build their homes, so that they can relocate their families to those towns and see their children go to local schools--so that families can function in a social environment. I know that there is catch-up to be done in some of those Central Highlands regional towns in relation to mining operations, but at the same time I beg the ministers responsible to take stock of the situation so that we can remedy what is happening there now. I am absolutely fed up to the back teeth of the blame game. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045583"></A>
The people of Blackwater have formed an action group. That group is trying to work with the local authorities, the government--all of the people in question--to put in place viable, responsible initiatives that will be advantageous to the growth of that town and the growth of that community. I believe that Blackwater can again become the great town that it was--it still is a great town--in parallel with Emerald. Owing to the recent flooding, Emerald is certainly choking itself with land--although there is a fear factor there with the flood. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045584"></A>
We need to encourage businesses to set up in these rural towns. The Premier talks about decentralisation on a daily basis--getting people away from the south-east and living in other areas. In our rural towns we have high schools and all of the things that go with them. The issues of population and jobs growth in rural areas are going to be around for a long time. This is a grand opportunity to get the equation right. If we get the equation right now, I believe that the long-term gains after the short-term pain will be things for which we will salute ourselves forever and a day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045585"></A>
That group in Blackwater is not anti council or anti government; it is very pro trying to get outcomes. Many of the people involved in that group are coalminers themselves. Some of them are small business people. Some of them are just ordinary mums and dads who want to make a difference. I appeal to the ministers when they go to Blackwater to meet with this group and listen to what they have to say and the ideas they are putting forward, because they are certainly very worthwhile ideas that are going to take Blackwater forward and create an environment that is very different from what is there now. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045586"></A>
As we progress into the next decade, I believe that many issues relating to the coalmining industry have to be weighed up and addressed. At the same time, the mining industry in this state is worth $3 billion in royalties to the Queensland government. Not much of that $3 billion goes back into those mining areas. I see the member for Mount Isa in the House. She would know about the dollars that are generated by the extractions from the north-west minerals province. Those dollars are no different from the dollars that are generated by the agricultural industry, which works in parallel with the mining industry. Not many people live in these regions, but I think it is time we saw some of that money that is generated come back into the South Burnett, the Burnett, the Callide, the Central Highlands, the Bowen Basin, the Surat Basin and now the Galilee Basin.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045589"></A>
A huge mine is about to be put in place in the Galilee Basin, which is just north of Alpha. When that mine starts production it will feed into the Abbot Point port. Five hundred and ten kilometres of standard gauge railway line has to be built from there to Abbot Point. Water has to come from somewhere and power has to come from somewhere. All of that planning has to be done properly, in conjunction with local authorities. There is talk of 6,000 jobs being created in the infrastructure stage of the development there. Just where those people will come from never ceases to amaze me. Do we have that type of personnel in Australia in the mining industry? We are at capacity now in terms of that type of personnel. For too long the emphasis was on academia rather than on hands-on tradespeople such as mechanics, diesel fitters, plumbers, refrigeration mechanics, boilermakers and so on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045591"></A>
The road infrastructure that is needed in association with the Kevin’s Corner coalmine at Hobartville is something else. The road between Alpha and Clermont just barely carries the traffic now for the cattle industry, let alone the coalmining industry. Over the next few months we are going to witness those sample B-doubles--46 a day--travelling from Alpha through to Jellinbah at Blackwater for the wash plant there for processing. All of this will be a further impost on the road infrastructure that we have in the central region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045594"></A>
It is not plain sailing; we are talking about mountainous roads through the Drummond Range. It is unfortunate that this product cannot be carried by Queensland Rail. There is so much development occurring in this region and there are exciting times ahead for the Central Highlands and the Central Queensland region. I have not even touched on the gas industry--I know that the honourable member for Callide has--and the untapped potential there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045595"></A>
Queensland certainly has a huge goldmine on its hands in relation to the mineral industry. I appeal to the government to use a fraction of those royalties to build up those towns and make them great places to reside. I ask the government to upgrade the road and rail services, the hospitals, schools and other associated infrastructure that makes communities great. I hope my words have not fallen on deaf ears. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DOWLING </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Redlands--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.40 pm): This afternoon I rise to contribute to the debate on the bill before the House, the Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 and the 11 acts that it seeks to amend. Before I continue can I recognise some visitors that I had today who I was very pleased to host for lunch and to tour around the precinct: Mat Samson, Deputy Principal of the Victoria Point State High School, and Tomas Partington and Kate Jenkin who are the school leaders and very much interested in this bill before the House, surprisingly enough. During the tour I was able to show them all around the place and talk to them about some of the legislation and some of the procedures that we go through. Obviously having been in the House just on a year now, I was interested to get their comments and thoughts on how legislation worked. They will be watching this bill quite closely in the coming days and I will be following it up with them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048474"></A>
We will be supporting the bill. I note in the minister’s second reading speech that he has set out to achieve three outcomes with this legislation. Firstly and primarily it seeks to achieve enhanced safety and health measures, which is commendable; it seeks to achieve a streamlined and simplified government process--again an outcome to be supported and acknowledged; improve credit support arrangements for electricity retailers; and improve customer service obligations. Again all laudable, aspirational steps forward within those respective areas within that industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048475"></A>
Let me comment firstly on the safety and health aspect. It is vital, and it was touched on by so many other speakers here this afternoon, that any workplace needs to be as safe as it possibly can be. In what has always been historically a high-risk and a dangerous work environment, it is even more critical that we place a high value on the work that they do and on the safety around the work that they perform. It is important that we strive to continuously improve.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048476"></A>
Looking at the statistics that have been quoted by both the minister and in the briefing notes, I reiterate that fatality rates in large mine facilities dropped from 24 in the nineties to eight in the 2001-09 period, whilst fatalities in small mine facilities actually increased from five in the nineties to eight in the 2001-09 period. It is a trend, tragically, that is being reflected, as we have heard, through other jurisdictions and other Australian states and territories. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048477"></A>
Quoting from the minister’s second reading speech--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1048478"></A>
The amendments proposed will make it a requirement for small mines to develop a safety and health management system. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048479"></A>
Again that is to be applauded and should be and obviously will be addressed in this legislation. It comes out of the findings in February 2009 of an inquest into a death in a small mine where the coroner, Mr Scott Luxton, recommended the legislation be amended to require that mines with 10 workers or fewer have an SHMS in place, which again is absolutely commendable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048480"></A>
I caution the minister, if I could, that when we focus on the numbers they can be misleading. They can paint a wrong picture if we do not have all the information. I trust that the minister has gone through this quite comprehensively. When one looks at the numbers--at the moment on the page they do tend to be numbers but they are not just numbers--in the period of the nineties--and when they refer to them as the nineties I am operating on the presumption that it is 1992-99--there were 29 facilities, 24 in the large mines and five in the small mines, and that trend actually changed so that through the 2000 period from 2001-09 there were eight fatalities in the large mines and eight fatalities in the small mines, which was an increase. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048481"></A>
The information that we do not know here, and I was not able to dig it out, was whether there are more small mines operating now as compared to the numbers in the previous period. What we need to not lose sight of is the fact that over 20 years 45 Queenslanders lost their lives--45 people went out to work but did not come back. We do need to ensure that this legislation actually targets the incidents rather than the statistical deviation that may be contained within those numbers. Again it is about ensuring that case-by-case we get the relevant information and, if there are lessons to be learned from them, that they are learned and they are heeded. We do not have that specific information and it can be difficult drafting legislation in those broader terms. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048482"></A>
Safety and health issues have also been ongoing in my electorate around a quarrying or an extractive industry. My community has raised health issues arising from things such as dust, noise and flyrock activity through the blasting process. This legislation does not consider the possibility of the wider impacts for the surrounding or the receiving environment. I heard the member for Gregory reference the fact that it is not just the mine site that we need to be mindful of, it is the journey to and from home; it is also the receiving environments around those areas and the freight handling from there on through the ports. We have had the ship run aground, which is part of that whole chain of transport that we must not lose sight of. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048483"></A>
The second issue that came out is the streamlining and the simplification of the government processes. Again I refer to the minister’s second reading speech in which he says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1048484"></A>
We are now introducing legislative amendments that will speed up mining lease approvals. The proposed amendments to the Mineral Resources Act 1989 will streamline the approvals process for mining lease applications where no objection has been lodged. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1048485"></A>
He goes on a little later to say in a dot point--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1048486"></A>
... to reduce the regulatory burden on participating businesses in the Smart Energy Savings Program </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048487"></A>
What concerns me--and these will be my closing comments--is that obviously time is money and it is important that we have efficiencies and gains where we can, but whenever we entertain short cuts, whenever we look to streamline or fast-track processes, we run the potential risk of environmental impact, personal impact and harm in the wider community. We also expose ourselves to the risk of systemic failure where these checks and balances are watered down or are cut short. We have seen time after time examples in very recent history how quickly things can go wrong. There was the insulation debacle where things were streamlined and expedited; there was the Building the Education Revolution where money was well intentioned and in the vast majority of cases it did go to the right place but there are too many instances where things went wrong; and then, of course, we had the minister for IT telling us how fantastic it was that the new payroll system was able to go live so quickly and pay the health workers. That clearly went tragically wrong. It is those pay issues for the healthcare workers that could again be repeated when these programs are streamlined and accelerated. We will be supporting the bill. </Hansard-Body>

(3.49 pm): I rise to speak on the Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The bill seeks to amend various acts administered within the Mines and Energy portfolio to achieve three outcomes for Queensland. It sets out a simplified regulatory process to achieve savings for both business and government. It seeks to ensure better safety and health measures in Queensland’s mining, explosives and gas industries and also address improved electricity retailer credit support arrangements and customer service obligations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051353"></A>
I would like to briefly comment on the two areas which address the enhancement of safety and health measures and the petroleum and gas safety and health amendments. Coming from the electorate of Mount Isa where mining is our No. 1 industry, I have to say that mine safety is a very high priority in all mines across my electorate. We have seen a great deal of work done in the last few years particularly when the responsibility of safety on mine sites is paramount. It is good to see that all of our companies have embraced it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051357"></A>
Since the Mining and Quarrying Safety and Health Act came into force in March 2001, Queensland’s large mines have been required to develop and maintain a fully documented safety and health management system. As I said before, the industry at large I believe is doing this very well. Small mines with 10 or fewer workers were exempt from this requirement because of the significant resources and skills needed to develop a safety and health management system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051358"></A>
In 2006-07 the Queensland Mines Inspectorate conducted a review of Queensland’s metalliferous mines and quarry facilities over the previous 10 years. The review found a decreasing trend in the number of fatalities at large mines but an increasing trend in fatalities at small mines. Fatalities at large mines dropped from 24 in the 1990s to eight in the 2001 to 2009 period. At the same time, unfortunately and sadly, fatalities in small mines increased from five to eight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051359"></A>
In light of this, the amendments proposed will make it a requirement for small mines to develop a safety and health management system. This amendment was also recommended by the coroner following an inquest into a fatality at a mine site. To assist small mine and quarry operators to manage this change, the Mines Inspectorate, in conjunction with the Institute of Quarrying Australia, has conducted 26 training seminars throughout the state on risk management techniques and development of a safety and health management system. The small mines industry has responded very positively to this initiative. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051361"></A>
The petroleum and gas safety and health amendments, which relate to the Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004, seek to enhance safety and health measures in the gas industry, particularly in relation to the certification of installations and appliances including clarifying gas compliance certificate requirements and introducing an offence provision in response to issues arising from cases of falsification of appliance approval labelling. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051362"></A>
The proposed amendments will also change the licence type for hydrocarbon refrigerant gas--that is, the gas used in small refrigerators--from the current requirement for an organisation authorisation to an individual occupational licence. This change will better reflect that an individual is required to have particular trade qualifications before undertaking hydrocarbon refrigerant gas work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051363"></A>
This amendment also prepares Queensland regulations to potentially align with the Council of Australian Governments’ agenda to establish a national licensing scheme for various trade occupations by 2012. Further, amendments to the safety and health provisions of the petroleum and gas act aim to correct unintended consequences of certain definitions, such as the definition of a type B gas device--that is, industrial gas devices such as small boilers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051365"></A>
Currently, the definition of a type B gas device includes a device used for ‘refrigeration for which fuel gas is the refrigerant’. As the liquefied natural gas, LNG, process as a whole uses natural gas as a refrigerant, the entire LNG facility would be captured under this definition. This means LNG proponents would be subject to duplicate approval possesses--firstly, under the type B approval and gas work authorisation processes and, secondly, under the major hazard facility safety case process. Amendments proposed to the definition of a type B gas device will exclude LNG plants from the definition, eliminating this duplication. Amendments to the definition of a type B gas device will also clarify that gas flares require approval in the same way as other gas burning devices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051366"></A>
I would like to congratulate the minister, his staff and certainly the department for their continued efforts, care and due diligence for this massive mining industry that I have in my electorate. On that note, I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (3.55 pm), in reply: First of all, I thank all honourable members for their participation in this debate. I thank the member for Callide, as the shadow minister, for his and his party’s support. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051370"></A>
The Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill was introduced with three main aims: to enhance safety and health measures in the state’s mining industry; to streamline and simplify government processes; and to improve credit support arrangements for electricity retailers and improve customer service obligations. One of the fundamental aims of this bill is to create an environment which promotes Queensland as a destination for mining investment and the benefits to Queenslanders that flow from that investment. While Queensland has one of the safest mining industries in the world, the Bligh government has a plan to ensure this burgeoning industry achieves a balance of sustainable development and economic prosperity. This bill is the next step in that plan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051371"></A>
To reaffirm the Queensland government’s commitment to improved health and safety of workers in the mining industry, the bill proposes amendments to complement existing legislation which requires large mines to develop and maintain a fully documented safety and health management system. The proposed amendments will also make it a requirement for small mines employing 10 or fewer people to develop a safety and health management system. I am pleased to advise that the small mines industry has responded generally positively to this initiative. This bill also proposes amendments to enhance safety and health measures in the gas industry, particularly in relation to the certification of installations and appliances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051372"></A>
Turning now to the elements of the bill that relate to streamlining and simplifying government processes, which is the key to promoting Queensland as a destination which welcomes investment, the bill implements the government’s commitment to streamline processes including legislative amendments to remove unnecessary delays to mining lease applications. The proposed amendments will streamline the approvals process for mining lease applications where no objection has been lodged by removing the mandatory requirement for the Land Court to assess mining lease applications to which there are no objections. Instead, these applications will be assessed by the minister administering the Mineral Resources Act 1989. This can shorten the mining lease approval process by up to six weeks. Other amendments include amendments to simplify the approvals process for petroleum and gas pipelines that traverse both the mainland and Queensland’s internal waters and ensure that pipeline proponents only need to comply with the safety and health obligations under one act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051374"></A>
In relation to some issues raised by the member for Bundamba, I take the opportunity to assure her that the two new committees--the Coal Mining Safety and Health Advisory Committee and the Mining Safety and Health Advisory Committee--will function in exactly the same way as the two previous councils did. It is essentially a name change only. The act remains otherwise unchanged except for the aspect of remuneration. Members of the committee will be able to claim for travel and accommodation expenses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051378"></A>
On the reason members should no longer be remunerated, the Webbe-Weller report sets out the rationale for the proposed changes. But, broadly speaking, it is not a prerequisite that members are to be professionally qualified experts. Therefore, there is no presumption of an entitlement to remuneration. The committees will receive the same level of secretariat support that the current councils do. I am advised that all current members of the councils have indicated that they are enthusiastic to continue their participation with the new committees and continue to provide valuable advice to government on the important topic of mine safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054367"></A>
The bill will also introduce improved credit support arrangements for electricity retailers and improved customer service obligations. The proposed amendments will improve electricity retailer credit support arrangements and customer service obligations for electricity supply in rural and regional Queensland. The proposed amendments will enhance the regulatory framework relating to retailer credit support by requiring the Queensland Competition Authority, as an independent regulatory body, to prepare and publish credit support guidelines. The guidelines must meet the needs of distribution entities in terms of minimising credit risk, while also ensuring the required credit support arrangements are fair and reasonable for retailers so as not to create an unreasonable barrier to entry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054371"></A>
The amendments proposed to the Electricity Act aim to ensure large market customers in rural and regional Queensland can secure access to electricity. The proposed amendment will require the retailer responsible for the premises to offer supply to these customers on fair and reasonable terms. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054372"></A>
Whilst I was pleased to hear that the member for Callide and the LNP are in support of this bill, I cannot help but comment on just one or two comments made by the member for Callide. To paraphrase the member for Callide, it behoves me to respond to just one or two points.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054373"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Seeney:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 I’d be disappointed if you did not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054374"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection because I would hate to disappoint the member for Callide. I have been provoked by the member for Callide’s somewhat unkind observation about this government’s relationship with the coal seam gas industry in this state. As he took a somewhat negative position, I think it is only fair that I remind him and place on the record once again that it was this government that put in place the 13% Gas Scheme in this state and that that 13% Gas Scheme was opposed by the Liberal and National parties. Having now corrected the record, I shall return to my position of appreciating the member for Callide’s ongoing support for this legislation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054375"></A>
I would also like to assure all members that the Bligh government has a plan to ensure we achieve the balance between environmental sustainability and economic development. Queensland’s emerging LNG industry has the potential to rival Western Australia’s, with a number of Gladstone based LNG projects already well advanced and on track for exports to commence between 2011 and 2014.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054376"></A>
On 17 September, the government released its <Hansard-Italic>
Blueprint for Queensland’s LNG Industry</Hansard-Italic>
, providing industry and the community with a clear understanding of the policy platform we have developed to support the world’s first coal seam gas to liquefied natural gas export industry. The blueprint includes commitments to create certainty for potential investors by retaining the current flat royalty rate of 10 per cent of wellhead value, upholding our commitment to allow certain components of this wellhead valuation to be determined prospectively, where necessary, and ensuring there are clear and comprehensive guidelines set out for environmental impact statements.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054377"></A>
Furthermore, in order to secure the availability of gas for Australian users, the government has decided to implement a process to monitor the operation of the gas market in Queensland and, if necessary, to set aside and release prospective gas land for domestic supply. This measure will only be taken if supply constraints warrant such an action.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054378"></A>
In relation to comments by the member for Callide and other LNP members on sovereign risk, it is important to place on the record the expenditure on exploration in Queensland, which has increased by over 80 per cent from $354 million in 2005-06 to a new record of $640 million in 2008-09. This is even up on the $563 million invested in 2007-08 at the height of the resources boom, and this clearly means jobs. These figures clearly demonstrate that the exploration industry is continuing to invest and that the initiatives of the Bligh Labor government to help attract resource investment dollars are actually working.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054379"></A>
In terms of concerns around CSG water, the Queensland government recently released new guidelines to ensure the burgeoning CSG energy sector contributes to a sustainable future. I might add that I respect all members who have contributed to this debate on this particular issue. It is an important issue, and one that we do need to get right. We are taking a precautionary approach to these issues, but I welcome the ongoing interest of all members from both sides of the House on this vitally important issue, because if we do not get it right it can have significant impacts right across the landscape and on landholders. I place on record today my determination to do whatever I can to ensure that we do in fact get this right now and into the longer term.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054381"></A>
The laws introduce new trigger thresholds for aquifers. If thresholds are exceeded, coal seam gas operators will be required to investigate. These arrangements will allow us to detect and respond appropriately where large scale CSG extraction may be impacting on groundwater to minimise the impact on the environment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054382"></A>
I should note that just last week I released further guidelines on how we will assess the potential impact on nearby acquifers from the extraction of coal seam gas and water from coal seams. Importantly, a specialist scientific panel will assist the department in the work that it will be doing in oversighting that. The panel will be made up of experts from outside the department to provide that necessary academic oversight. It will also be assisted by an advisory group made up of representatives from industry. Importantly for many members in this House, it will also contain representatives from agricultural industries, the grazing industry, broadscale agriculture and the community. We believe that by establishing those bodies we will provide a level of oversight in terms of the work that is done not just by the industry in the first place but also by my department. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054383"></A>
I recognise the member for Callide’s comments about balancing the concerns of the agriculture and resource sectors and resource exploration and development. I can assure him and all members that the Bligh government is working with all parties to achieve this balance.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054384"></A>
The Land Access Working Group was established in May 2008 and comprises relevant state agencies and the agriculture, mining, and petroleum and gas peak bodies, including AgForce, the Queensland Farmers Federation, the Queensland Resources Council and the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. The Land Access Working Group developed a land access policy framework that was endorsed by government in November last year, and legislation is currently being drafted to give effect to the new policy. Mining, particularly the emerging industry of coal seam gas to LNG in Queensland, presents unique challenges along with the potential for significant economic prosperity for this state. Achieving this balance is not a task that should be taken lightly, and the Bligh government recognises this. That is why we have a plan to create an environment in Queensland which encourages investment whilst securing the rights and interests of landowners and the agricultural sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054388"></A>
I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge everyone in those areas of the Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation that administer the mines and energy portfolio who have contributed to the development and coordination of this bill. The mining industry has the potential to provide the Queensland economy with a huge boost, and the Bligh government has a plan to ensure this happens. This bill is part of that plan and better positions Queensland as a location which welcomes and encourages such investment. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Callide--LNP) (4.10 pm): I am quite pleased to have an opportunity--an unexpected opportunity--to make a contribution to the consideration of the Architects Amendment Bill 2010. I am very pleased to have an opportunity to engage in a debate with my honourable colleague the member for Rockhampton, because it somewhat bemuses me that he has carriage of a bill that seeks to regulate activities in this area. I am not sure who would make the most unlikely architect--the member for Rockhampton or me. I think between both of us we would be flat out drawing a mud map on a rainy day. However, it behoves us to recognise the skills and talents of architects in the great job they do in designing the built infrastructure in Queensland. Increasingly there is a growing importance of design in addressing a range of issues that are becoming more current for people everywhere.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057477"></A>
From my portfolio perspective, energy efficiency and energy conservation have become very important. A lot of the objectives that are worthwhile pursuing in terms of achieving those greater levels of energy efficiency and effectiveness can be achieved by design--by designing buildings in the right way from the start. So I certainly do have something of an interest in this bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057479"></A>
The objectives of the bill have been outlined by the minister in his second reading speech. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1057484"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Come on, pay attention! The bill before the House seeks to introduce a simplified registration scheme which adopts procedures approved by the Architects Accreditation Council of Australia and adopted by architect registration boards in the Australian states and territories. The amendments will simplify the procedural framework for registering architects by recognising the AACA requirements for Queensland registration. The qualifications and experience required to be registered as an architect will not change as a result of this bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057486"></A>
The whole area of registration is something that is important for professionals. With the increased mobility of professionals across state boundaries, I think in all such professions there is a need to--</Hansard-Body>

 I can assure you that I do not need assistance from you either, my honourable friend. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057491"></A>
Madam Deputy Speaker, as I was saying before I was rudely interrupted, the first objective of the bill is to simplify the registration scheme and adopt national procedures. National registration schemes are important because I think while there is not a lessening in the relevance of state borders there is an increase in the mobility of people across state borders. I am referring not only to the professionals themselves who are so registered but also to people who generally move from state to state. An architect who is registered in Queensland needs to be assured that it means the same thing to be registered as an architect in Victoria, Western Australia or another state. It needs to be a standard registration that they are comfortable with and have confidence in.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057492"></A>
The second dot point in the explanatory notes that sets out the objectives of the bill states that the bill seeks to broaden the fitness to practise provisions to enable the Board of Architects of Queensland to request that a registered architect undergo a health assessment if the board reasonably believes that the registered architect is unable to competently and safely practise as an architect because of their mental or physical health and to ask the Commissioner of Police for a criminal history report providing details of convictions for offences in Queensland or elsewhere in Australia relating to an applicant architect. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057494"></A>
The bill also seeks to permit a registered architect to register as a non-practising architect in circumstances where they do not intend to practise. It also seeks to introduce a range of miscellaneous amendments in relation to matters such as the powers of the board in the registration process, restoration of registration, staffing of the board, disciplinary and penalty provisions, and disciplinary provisions relating to formerly registered architects. As can be seen from those dot points which set out the objectives of the bill, the bill deals with pretty much administrative procedures and processes--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057495"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Wells:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Will you support the bill? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057496"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Seeney:</Hansard-Member-Down>
--and, as such, it is fairly simplistic. It should come as no surprise to honourable members that of course we will support a bill that seeks to simplify and streamline the registration procedures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057498"></A>
However, while the provisions of the bill themselves are reasonably straightforward and simplistic, the legislation I believe deserves the respect of this parliament. The profession of architecture certainly deserves the respect of those who sit in this parliament and those who understand that a lot of the work that architects do is sometimes not well recognised and taken for granted. I think like a lot of other professions it only becomes absolutely apparent to most people when they get it wrong. That is the case with a lot of things that are about design. When anything is designed properly and works well, then the design just about remains unnoticed. But when they get it wrong and whatever it is does not work properly, then it is very noticeable and very marked. And so it is with the work that architects do. In designing the built environment, they have a challenge to get those elements of the built environment right and to ensure that the lifestyle and living spaces that we all enjoy serve the purposes for which they are designed and for which we believe they should be designed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057499"></A>
I guess the challenge for architects is to deal with the long-term consequences of the decisions they make in that the decisions they make are certainly around for a long time. It is interesting to see the changes in architecture over the years. </Hansard-Body>

If we look at the built environment in Queensland we can see the range of architectural styles that have become part of the Queensland lifestyle that we enjoy today. In the parliament this morning the Speaker tabled the conservation plan for Parliament House. An important part of that conservation plan is to recognise the architectural skills involved in designing this place where we all work. As I sit here listening to some of the more boring speeches that we hear in this parliament I am always intrigued by the Corinthian columns at the front of the chamber. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am sure that the provisions in the bill before the House this afternoon will ensure that architects in Queensland can continue to provide great input into ensuring that the built environment in Queensland is one that will serve Queenslanders well for many years to come.

 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.20 pm): Before I commence my contribution to this debate, I commend my colleague the member for Callide for his broad expose on the Architects Amendment Bill. I think every architect in Queensland would be very proud to know how much he thinks of them. I was enjoying some of the architecture in this building a few minutes before this bill was actually brought on. I can tell members that there are some nooks and crannies here that are certainly fine pieces of architecture. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060744"></A>
As I rise to speak in the debate on the Architects Amendment Bill 2010, which was introduced into the House on 9 February by the honourable Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology, I would like to say from the outset that the LNP will be supporting this bill, as members have heard from my colleague. I extend my appreciation to the minister for offering myself and the opposition a briefing on this bill and the anticipated provisions within it last year. The departmental staff were most helpful, Minister, and I wish to record my thanks on the public record of this House this afternoon. </Hansard-Body>

The Architects Act 2002, known as the act, regulates the registration of architects and the practice of architecture in Queensland. First regulated in Queensland by the Architects Act 1928, provisions are currently controlled by the Architects Act 1985. Some members may be wishing to have the member for Callide back as I take them through some of these facts.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060749"></A>
The Board of Architects of Queensland, also known as the board, which was established as a result of changes to the 2002 act--an act that dissolved the board established under the Architects Act 1985--presently administers the act. The board has experienced difficulties over the years in implementing this scheme, evidenced by the actuality that the transitional provisions of the 1985 act are still being used. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060750"></A>
The proposed amendments in this bill feature a simplified registration scheme for architects, as the honourable member for Callide has already espoused. This will be achieved through the recognition of national procedures approved by the Architects Accreditation Council of Australia. Other provisions contained in this bill consist of extending the fitness to practice provisions through a health assessment in addition to the Board of Architects of Queensland’s assessment; broadening the board’s powers to apply for a criminal history in considering applicants for registration; extending the registration of an architect to include a non-practising architect presuming they meet the required provisions; and providing further grounds for the board to cancel the registration of an architect and implementing greater disciplinary processes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060752"></A>
A simplified registration scheme is a key platform of this legislation and competencies will no longer be prescribed by regulation. People will instead need to satisfy two criteria, those being holding an academic qualification in architecture or a pass in the national program of assessment recognised by the AACA and proven competencies in the practice of architecture. If passed, which looks most likely, these amendments will make it unnecessary to have assessment entities as before and will bring Queensland into line with other Australian states and territories. </Hansard-Body>

Released by the National Competition Council in May 2001, a staff discussion paper titled ‘Reforming the regulation of the professions’ recognised that the primary objective of regulating a profession is to protect the welfare of consumers and to protect the public. This bill has been introduced to rectify areas of the Architects Act 2002 that fall short of providing for the best interests of the profession and the public as consumers. It appears the overall aim is to bring the legislation into line with similar legislative standards regulating professions such as was the case with changes to the Professional Engineers Act 2002 that were made in April 2008. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060755"></A>
Stated policy objectives of the 2002 act were to protect the public by ensuring architects’ services were delivered in a professional and competent way and that standards of both practice and service were upheld. The bill before us today seeks to improve upon those objectives, and this is to be applauded. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060756"></A>
Gaining adequate information about the skills of various practitioners is often difficult for consumers. More often than not, word of mouth referrals prove a frequently used and reliable method when in search of the services of various professional practitioners, and architects are no different. In some instances, potential customers may be lured by large advertisements or other marketing strategies but how do they know the service provider is honest and competent? Protection from uncertainties such as these are valid reasons why legislation needs to be updated and amended for the society we live in now. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060757"></A>
Whilst this bill is not raising any contentious new laws I still wanted to make sure the industry did not have issues with certain aspects of it and that the value of design will not in any way be eroded by the implementation of this legislation. To this end, I consulted with key industry bodies such as the Australian Institute of Architects’ Queensland chapter, the Association of Consulting Architects, the State Architect Mr Phillip Follent and former government architects. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060760"></A>
For the most part, industry groups are happy with these amendments, stating they are pretty much what they expected. Some general reservations as to the regulation and processes for criminal history checks and health assessments were expressed and the comment was made that there appeared to be an overly strong emphasis on criminal activity. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1060761"></A>
These abovementioned mature former government architects remember the glory days when Queensland was making a name for itself as a progressive modern city. Hosting a successful Commonwealth Games in 1982 was indeed an honour. The Brisbane games are still held as one of the very best achievements of our previous architects. Everything went so well from the moment Matilda, a 13-metre mechanical kangaroo, helped out with the opening ceremony until the finale on 9 October. I note that Matilda was in the media again recently. A service station in Tugun wanted her to be displayed on the Gold Coast. It looks like poor old Matilda lost out as councillors determined she was too large to be on view. Interestingly, the Premier is launching a bid for the Gold Coast to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Perhaps she should use Matilda to improve our chances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060762"></A>
Six years later the games accomplishment was to be surpassed by the unforgettable Expo 88. I do ask for a little latitude to share a few key facts from that wonderful Expo. As the first free enterprise funded World Expo the exposition was a considered yet calculated risk for us here in Queensland. Some 7.8 million persons needed to have visited Expo over the six months for it to have been a successful exercise. That is an average of 42,000 visits per day over the 184 days of the Expo. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060763"></A>
Hosting Expo in Australia and in Brisbane, with a local population of just over one million persons and getting a six-month figure more than seven times that figure, was by no means a fait accompli. Not only was World Expo 88 a success in goodwill and diplomacy, it put Brisbane on the global map. It managed to pay for itself many times over with no public debt or liability and reversed an alarming trend that had occurred in previous World Expos. Thanks to the government’s foresight for this Expo and the leadership of Sir Llew Edwards and his team, the final statistics for the six-month Expo, including VIPs and staff, came to 18,574,476 visits--that is more than the whole population of Australia at the time. </Hansard-Body>

Queensland experienced huge periods of growth during the seventies and eighties, yet due to the sound economic management of the government of those times--which I might add was not Labor--it did not get into debt as we see today. The ABC program <Hansard-Italic>
Keeping the Faith</Hansard-Italic>
 asked a panel to come up with a single word to describe architecture. Their summation produced a sentence: it can delight or disturb, change our lives and finally outlive us. So with a leap of faith, we put our trust in the mind of the architect. It is interesting to note that one of the amendments focuses on the status of the mind of the architect and their fitness to practise in their chosen field, and I shall elaborate on that point later.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060804"></A>
I had the pleasure of speaking recently with a long-serving government architect who informed me that architecture is a lifetime profession, which is why we need to streamline the regulations that are before us today. Together with engineers, he said, architects have always been the responsible party to get projects done. The language with which he spoke was emotive and inspiring, much like the architectural feats that have shaped our nation and our state of Queensland. Architects are responsible for designing our houses, hospitals, universities, schools, courthouses, churches and community buildings, our museums and public spaces. Almost everything we see in our modern society has been gauged at some level by an architect who has shaped the vision, the design and the time and made a mark in history.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060806"></A>
When one mentions ‘architecture’ and ‘Queensland’ together, it is impossible not to acknowledge the iconic Queenslander. Compatible with our unique climate, the broad verandahs, stumps and breezeways of the first Queensland homes were practical applications that soon typified our home-grown architecture. Modern trends have of course imparted their influence on the traditional Queensland dwelling. However, the sense of openness and relationship to the land are ongoing features attributable to these origins. The relatively young Gold Coast has experienced its share of design mistakes along with a neglect of infrastructure planning to cope with our rapid growth. Our long stretch of picturesque coastline lends itself to a smorgasbord of architects’ ideas. Talks of statues of giant bronzed Aussie lifesavers positioned in the Broadwater reveal the boldness such a vibrant and youthful destination breeds.</Hansard-Body>

One of Queensland’s history-making buildings is located a mere 30 minutes drive from my electorate, visible from the sandy beaches of Currumbin and piercing the skyline with unmistakable presence. I speak of course of Q1--not Q2--the Sunland Group’s record-breaking high-rise accommodation tower. Inspired by the Olympic torch, the design, construction and engineering of the world’s tallest residential tower were awe inspiring to say the least. From a sustainability aspect, though--and the minister may be interested in this--the maximum use of glass skins is probably not practical and has proven to be a magnet for lightning.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060816"></A>
In a truly benevolent gesture, Soheil Abedian, the architect who founded Sunland Group and gave us the world’s first Palazzo Versace hotel, recently announced he would provide funds for a new architecture school at Bond University in February 2010. The school is due to open in January 2011 and the degree will take three years and four months to complete. This is exciting news for nascent designers and for Queensland, as expanding opportunities for education in architecture will allow the future visionaries of our state to develop. At a time when sustainable planning is critical for our exploding population, we must nurture and encourage the young and not-so-young minds to design wisely as living space becomes a premium. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060820"></A>
The Architects Accreditation Council of Australia currently only recognises two educational institutions in Queensland for accredited qualifications, so it is fantastic to see the efforts of successful architects like Soheil giving back to the community. In Queensland there are 2,572 registered architects. To obtain a Bachelor of Architecture from QUT takes five years full time. At UQ a Bachelor of Architectural Design takes three years full time as an undergraduate plus one year full time for a professional Master of Architecture.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060821"></A>
I move now to some of the changes that this bill will make. As mentioned previously, the proposed amendments are designed to update the regulations to current industry practices and are similar--but not the same--as the Professional Engineers Act. While this is a bill that is designed to bring provisions into line with national standards, it raises the substantial question of whether the new provisions create situations that can be exposed to abuses of process. The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee’s <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert No. 2</Hansard-Italic>
 of this year draws the attention of the parliament to a number of amendments within this bill which may affect rights and liberties of individuals, including rights to privacy of personal information and to gain a living by work of a person’s own choice. Section 7A deals with types of registration as an architect and the provision allows the registration of an architect under the act as a practising architect or a non-practising architect.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060824"></A>
‘Architect’ is a controlled term and clarifies how a person can be identified as such and offers a degree of consumer protection. The term ‘architect’ is protected under the Architects Act 2002. Section 113 finds that a person who is not an architect but claims or holds themselves to be an architect is liable for a maximum penalty of 1,000 penalty units. Likewise, a person who is not an architect who uses the title ‘architect’ to promote or advertise their services will be liable for the same penalty under the act. These strict penalties are important to maintain the professionalism associated with qualified architects in the digital age, where website designers are calling themselves ‘information architects’ and offering courses to train others as such.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060827"></A>
Non-practising architects are those who do not intend to practise during the current registration year--that is, they are academics or those not fulfilling practice requirements but still wanting to be identified as architects. It did seem unreasonable in previous legislation that if an architect chose a career path of academia they were not allowed to identify themselves as an architect, and I can see the minister is agreeing with me here. After all, they would have undergone the approved training. But there does appear to be no provision introduced to require those registered as non-practising architects to identify themselves as such, and I would ask the minister to address that in his summing-up, or we can deal with it when we consider the clauses.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060828"></A>
As I have already mentioned, consumer protection is at the core of these amendments. An article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 of 6 November 2009 saw the Board of Architects of Queensland fine a Brisbane developer for falsely claiming that some of its homes were architecturally designed. This fine of $17,500 against Paradise Homes was the first in Queensland. In addition, an employee was fined $9,000 for the offence of ‘holding out’ using the title of architect. As with other professional bodies, there is a certain image and prestige in calling oneself an architect. People using this title offer reassurance to those who employ their services that they have undertaken study and reached a level of expertise. I might say that a particular Premier who is now living on the public purse in the US had a fondness for titles and the image they created. He collected doctorates as some collect footy signatures, and I do hope the minister does not have such lofty plans.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Mr Schwarten:</Hansard-Member-Down>

<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs STUCKEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Section 16 in clause 9 deals with registration requirements. I am actually almost speechless at that comment from the minister, so I will just take it on board. With regard to registration requirements, essentially these amendments remove the current regulations that control registration and simplify the process by prescribing national standards for registration. To qualify for registration under the existing act, an architect needed a qualification identified under the relevant regulation. Under these amendments, they will need a qualification recognised by the Architects Accreditation Council of Australia and to successfully complete the AACA architectural practice examination or a similar examination as approved by the board. This is bringing Queensland into line with other states and territories in Australia. According to the explanatory notes--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1060836"></A>
The qualifications and experience required to be registered as an architect will not change as a result of this Bill ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1060837"></A>
I am sure there is a lot of relief in that for many students.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060838"></A>
If this bill is passed, the board will have greater control over continuing registrations. With the passage of this bill through the parliament, the board will take over the responsibility from competency assessors. A registered architect will no longer need to comply with continuing competency requirements but with continuing registration requirements which will be controlled by the board. It will be the responsibility of the board under these amendments to decide if an architect has maintained competency to continue their registration.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064339"></A>
New section 28 deals with extending the grounds by which a board can cancel a registration, that is, if the architect’s registration to practise in Australia, another state or foreign country has been cancelled for disciplinary reasons under the relevant jurisdiction’s law; or if the architect’s membership of an association of architects in Australia or a foreign country has been cancelled for disciplinary reasons; or if the architect has contravened a condition of the architect’s registration; or if the health assessment report given to the board under proposed section 35F finds that the architect is currently unable to competently and safely practise as an architect. No doubt it is in response to the influx of incompetent overseas doctors and other professionals who have caused bungles that have affected the lives of Queenslanders that this government is applying such conditions in this legislation. The board will now have the power to cancel an architect’s registration if their registration has been cancelled in another state or territory in Australia owing to disciplinary reasons or if a health assessment denies their ability to competently and safely practise as an architect. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064343"></A>
A new section is proposed in this amendment bill, placing the onus on the architect to advise the board of any disciplinary action taken against them by another state or territory of Australia, or a foreign country, within 21 days of the action or they face a penalty. Clause 17 carries a maximum penalty of 50 penalty units, or $5,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064344"></A>
Another area covered in this bill is criminal history checks. This provision allows the board to ask the Commissioner of Police for a written report about the criminal history of a relevant person. This provision is part of the attempt to broaden the fitness to practise provisions, that is, whether the applicant has a conviction other than a spent conviction where the rehabilitation period of 10 years for an adult and five years for a child has lapsed without further conviction. Another provision states that a relevant person is an individual applying for registration, an architect applying for renewal of registration, or an individual applying for restoration of registration. There appears to be no other restriction, limitation or criteria set for when the board may exercise this power, which may well lead to issues regarding privacy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064347"></A>
Proposed new section 35D, titled ‘Health assessment’, allows the board to request that a registered architect undergo a health assessment if the board reasonably believes that the registered architect may be physically or mentally impaired. The board must give the subject architect an information notice about this decision. The board may immediately suspend an architect’s registration if the health assessment is not undertaken, or the architect does not cooperate with the doctor selected by the board. The health assessment report may be used only for the purposes of the act and must be destroyed as soon as practicable after it is no longer needed. If the health assessment proves that the architect is unable to practise in a safe and competent manner, then that architect may have to pay out of their own pocket for the reports, assessments or whatever else is required. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064348"></A>
We can be thankful that here in Queensland indemnity insurance was set up with the Institute of Architects and the standard here in Australia is second to none. In China, with over 400,000 practising architects, there were no such standards of education in order to be registered. Just five years ago, China finally adopted the US standards to qualify students to be registered in order to access indemnity insurance. The board’s role here in Queensland is now extended to advance educational and professional standards for architects, but, as I have said, they are already some that we can be proud of. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064350"></A>
More transparency is required in the tendering process for major projects. Having made that comment, it is of note that Labor’s track record on big projects is pretty hopeless. Take the North Bank experiment, where we saw people in this government wanting a concrete metropolis, wanting to spoil our river views by treating the river as a sewer and trying to build over it. We have not heard much about that proposal for some time and I would be very keen to hear what the latest update on it is. Another amendment proposes to increase the maximum penalty for disciplinary procedures from 40 penalty units to 200 penalty units, which will reflect the penalties within similar regulated professions, such as engineers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064353"></A>
I would like to close by adding my congratulations to Lindsay and Kerry Clare, who in March were awarded Australia’s biggest architecture prize--the 2010 gold medal for architecture--during a ceremony hosted by the Australian Institute of Architects. This talented couple have combined work and home life in a 30-year professional and personal relationship. Their public works include the Gallery of Modern Art and the chancery building at the University of the Sunshine Coast. With those few words, I once again give the LNP’s support to this bill. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr CHOI</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Capalaba--ALP) (4.44 pm): I rise today to speak in support of the Architects Amendment Bill 2010, which is designed to amend the Architects Act 2002, which regulates the registration of architects and the practise of architecture in Queensland. As an engineer by trade, I have had a lot of opportunities to work with architects. I would have to say that when I first started as a junior engineer I used to think that all architects do is make buildings look nice but they spend far too much time and money in the process of doing just that. To me, all we needed was a square building with a roof, and windows are optional. Nothing is more economical than that--a typical engineer.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064359"></A>
Over the years I began to appreciate that well-designed buildings are not only pleasing to the eye but also create a sense of joy and comfort for the occupants. Architecture can also define a city as major cities around the world are known for their architecture. I came to appreciate architecture and architects so much that I married one. As if one in-house architect is not sufficient to ensure my continued appreciation of form over function, my eldest daughter, Priscilla, this year has just graduated from UQ in architecture. So my appreciation of architecture and architects is now on the public record. None of my above statements were made under duress or out of concern for my own personal wellbeing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064361"></A>
Good architecture adds beauty and functionality to a city and the high standards demanded of professional architects also help ensure that public safety is protected. In this age of increased environmental awareness, we can also expect our professional architects to design buildings that not only are energy efficient in their structure but also incorporate environmentally friendly building materials and techniques. Without our professional associations of highly trained architects, our cities could soon deteriorate into unimaginative, unhealthy and inefficient conglomerations of concrete and steel buildings.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064362"></A>
As Queensland’s population continues to grow--with growth in South-East Queensland among the highest in this nation--we need appropriate regulations and standards to ensure that our cities and suburbs, including our towns in regional areas, are environmentally friendly and functionally sound. We need to ensure that our future dwellings, commercial and industrial developments will not only accommodate a growing, ageing and culturally diverse population but that they will do so in safety and in style. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064363"></A>
The Queensland government is aware of the need for some clarification and standardisation with regard to the registration of architects in this state. It has become evident that Queensland needs a simplified registration scheme to replace the current prescription for qualifications and competencies of architects by regulation. At present, our registration laws for architects are not in sync with those of other Australian states and territories. The proposed amendments will protect the public by ensuring that architectural services in Queensland are provided in a professional and competent manner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064364"></A>
This bill clarifies and standardises Queensland law in relation to the registration and accreditation of architects. It will formalise what has become current common practice, because, although some of the new requirements are not set out in the current act, they are already in use in Queensland as they are in use in all Australian states and territories. In that regard, the bill will provide that applicants for registration will need to have an academic qualification in architecture recognised by the AACA or a pass in the national program of assessment conducted by the AACA and competencies in the practise of architecture based on a period of training followed by the successful completion of the AACA architectural practice examination, or another examination arranged or approved by the Board of Architects of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067736"></A>
In addition, the Board of Architects of Queensland has faced some difficulties in determining the proficiency, competency and the physical and mental health of some architects. It is also proposed to introduce a further ground for cancellation of registration in situations where a registered architect has been removed from a register in any other jurisdiction in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067739"></A>
In a similar situation to other states and territories, Queensland architects are registered by the Board of Architects of Queensland in accordance with the 2002 act. This bill will introduce a simplified scheme by adopting procedures approved by the Architects Accreditation Council of Australia. In future the registration framework for Queensland architects will recognise the AACA requirements already adopted by other states. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067740"></A>
This bill includes important provisions to protect public safety by broadening the fitness to practise provisions. This will enable the board to request that a registered architect undergo a health assessment should it reasonably believe he or she is unable to competently and safely practice as an architect because of their mental or physical health. To further protect public safety, the board will also be enabled to ask the Commissioner of Police for a criminal history report with details of convictions for offences in Queensland or elsewhere in Australia relating to an applicant. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067741"></A>
Provisions in the bill will also permit an architect to register as a non-practising architect in circumstances where they do not intend to practise and also introduces a range of amendments in relation to matters such as the powers of the board, staffing of the board and penalty provisions, even in relation to formerly registered architects. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067742"></A>
The board will be provided with a broader and more comprehensive range of options for dealing with disciplinary matters enabling greater flexibility in the resolution of matters once they reach the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal as well as providing a greater range of penalties and enforcement options. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067743"></A>
The government has consulted all government departments and the Board of Architects of Queensland in the preparation of this bill. We have undertaken industry consultations with respect to amendments to the act and with the Australian Institute of Architects which has indicated its in-principle support for the proposed amendments to this bill. This bill is an important amendment to current legislation and, in the interest of public safety and clearer legislation, more in line with other states and territories. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067744"></A>
As I said earlier, good architecture defines a city. It is true that beauty is in the eye of the beholder so I am not going to name the best designed building in Brisbane but ugliness is almost universal. For the worst looking major building in the capital of Queensland one cannot go past, in my view, the disgraceful, ugly, appalling Transit Centre of Brisbane. The irony is that this horrible building is the first building many visitors see when they arrive in our beautiful state. Now that I have said my piece, I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

 And the member is not. This coincides with the 150th year of the Queensland parliament. Rather than paraphrase the Speaker, who is responsible for this magnificent building, I would like to include something that may give another insight into this truly magnificent building. The bill presented is proposing to simplify registration of architects in Queensland in line with procedures approved by the Architects Accreditation Council of Australia and all Australian boards. It is already used in Queensland. It is also broadening the issue of practice provisions to include health assessments and criminal history checks. It also increases regulations and provides for stronger punitive and disciplinary provisions. In doing so, it provides more definition for paths to penalty provisions and also paths to restoration of registration for previously registered architects. </Hansard-Body>

As I wrote this I was listening to the member for Algester describing her vision of community housing which throughout the state is delivering accommodation with often too little parking, very poor access and densities that are unacceptable. They do so by virtue of exempting themselves from council planning regulations or public campaigns, deriding reasonable requests to provide modern acceptable accommodation standards. Architects have major roles in delivering Queenslanders not only housing accommodation solutions but proposing innovative methods that might just make modern domestic and commercial construction viable and energy efficient. The last point is a buzz word that this Labor government publicly states ad nauseum but in practice it is not always doing what is best or financially efficient. My best example currently would be the shocking example of the federal government insisting on a wasteful program of bats, paper, wool--really anything that could have been put in a ceiling--to enable a claim for a government rebate to be made. If they had consulted any architect or builder they would have told them that a whirlybird or its equivalent correctly parked in the roof under the tiles with adequate room ventilation and window glazing where appropriate is far more efficient and far cheaper. It also does not start fires, but helps to reduce the risk of them. </Hansard-Body>

In Queensland architects have long championed the desire to alter the public’s feelings and mindset about the absolute desire for brick veneer, four bedrooms, concrete on grade to ground with little regard to issues of fire, flood and weather--a point elegantly made by the member for Capalaba. </Hansard-Body>

Queensland history is littered with names that have become synonymous with national history. It takes eight years to become a registered qualified architect in Queensland. It is very tough indeed and this bill will make it even harder by requiring health assessments to be undertaken, including a mental health assessment. It seems very uncertain who will do this, how much it will cost and how often it will have to be done. Architects have to do three years of design studies, one year of work experience, three years of architecture and two years or 2,000 hours of practice. In that time they must complete a logbook and then do a written and oral examination to become a qualified registered architect. For some it is just not worth it. When they graduate they still have to use hydraulic, structural and electrical engineers and consultants under the direction of a licensed builder. Some of these only require four years of work and study. The demands are excessive and this adds another layer of regulation that is potentially unnecessary. </Hansard-Body>

Architects run small businesses and are part of the 1.233 million small businesses employing half of our private sector workforce across Australia. We have to support small business because they are creating jobs and serving our community. We need lower taxes and smaller government. We need to not create regulation because red tape strangles business. Architects are struggling with the new rule for safety and design. Architects are now being made more liable for everything from people falling over in their own homes to some realistic problems. It is causing indemnities to significantly increase. The checklist is exhaustive to document. It is very time consuming. It does not make much sense and it is a massive cost to architects and their clients. It was passed into law over 12 months ago and it increases the architect’s liability. Work that one out!</Hansard-Body>

Wherever we walk, look, read and dream we can see the timeless work of colonial architect Charles Tiffin, the architect of Parliament House; JJ Hennessy, who designed the university; Robin Dodds; Wilbur Smith, who was an adoptee, an American; Robin Gibson; Geoffrey Pie; Eddie Hayes; Conrad and Gargett; Gabriel Poole’s sail houses; Noel Robinson’s open houses; Cottee Parker; Brett Saville and Todd Crighton who designed the Q1 building and the Vision tower that is coming out of the ground at the moment. There are myriad newer architects, names that members probably have never heard of, such as Hamilton Wilson, who did the library across the river; Elizabeth Watson-Brown; Barry Lee; Paul Uhlmann; Baden Goddard; Brian Donovan; and Tim Hill who did the magnificent Gallery of Modern Art, which is a spectacular building. </Hansard-Body>

The legacy that we have by virtue of their collective inspiration has left us not only with enduring monuments to that vision but practical buildings that we Queenslanders can all enjoy. Not everyone loves them, some do not even notice them, but many do grow to love them. We all notice when some of the buildings change or their removal is threatened. These architects are largely locally trained people. Many have travelled and we are fortunate that they have returned to share their dreams with us all.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074388"></A>
I only know a little of what architects endure, but I know how seriously they take their profession. I support the comments made by the shadow minister with regard to the issue of architects who are teaching. My cousin Tim O’Rourke teaches at the university. He has passion and skill. He actually did medicine and then went back to teach architecture. He shares a great passion for it and he enjoys it. There are plenty of other people doing exactly the same thing. These changes to the law reflect the fact that they remain architects and that is wonderful for our teaching environment. There are wonderful courses at QUT and Griffith in landscape architecture. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1074392"></A>
I know that architects see themselves firstly as artists, secondly as professionals, thirdly as technicians and finally as managers. This really is quite a challenge. Most people would be content with only one of these jobs. Architects do this in an environment of competition, budgets, building and credit cycles, the vagaries of market pressure, deadlines and maybe even ignorance. The greatest architects have been in equal measures the most withdrawing, humble and subtle people to the most bombastic, aggressive, loud, self-interested and demanding ones. In fact, that was highlighted by the member for Capalaba--interestingly, his daughter has gone into architecture--and I think that goes to show the sort of people who do this and the passion they have. Occasionally the scale of the projects may require some or all of these traits. I wonder whether the great architects are the true chameleons of our public art and construction industry. </Hansard-Body>

I had the great privilege of being in Korea with two of Queensland’s outstanding architects who have had input into our latest visionary buildings. Brett Saville and Todd Crighton have designed arguably the most amazing building in Q1 and they proposed the Vision tower here in Brisbane. Hopefully it will be built. I saw a presentation to a global audience that electrified that audience, not only with what they had done but also with what they were currently doing and what they were further proposing to do. They not only clearly showed how it could be done efficiently from a base here in Brisbane, on time, within budget and affordable, but delivered us all to a better place. It demonstrates that we do not need to copy anyone. We have something great to offer, and Queensland trained architects have done this and they have done it all over Queensland--Brisbane, Gold Coast, Townsville, Cairns, Rockhampton--and taken it to the world stage. </Hansard-Body>

The story of the University of Queensland is as interesting as the history of the Queensland parliament. It might assist the minister to understand what has happened in our own environment. The University of Queensland is actually based on Trinity College in Dublin. For those who might not know, Christopher Wren and Swift were involved. TB Beirne commissioned John Hennessy, his son-in-law, to conceive, propose and design a plan on the site provided by James Mayne and his sister at St Lucia on the Brisbane River. The sandstone construction, set in an ellipse with a centre green, is quite spectacular. The gargoyles, which people have wondered about over the years, on the facades were placed there because that is part of the original design. It is truly a magnificent testament to vision and benevolence and true benevolence for the whole of Queensland to enjoy for the rest of time. TB Beirne was my great-grandfather. He started here as a penniless Irish immigrant. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074407"></A>
Similarly, Tiffin was asked to build a parliament house after a competition which he either won or did not win. Arguably, the design was a combination of Tiffin and Backhouse and it was finished by FG Stanley, Tiffin’s former assistant. He completed this grand dome that is French inspired, based on the Louvre and the Tuileries, which are wonderful French buildings--a little baroque. When one stands on the verandah here looking down to the botanic gardens to the north-east, if one imagines smaller trees and looks down towards the fountains one can only truly appreciate the magnificent result Tiffin, Stanley and maybe Backhouse have achieved for all of us and the whole state. This is living architecture because this is a living building, with offices, halls, the red chamber, which was the upper house, the green chamber, which was the lower house, the Speaker’s Green, the Strangers Dining Room, the members bar built from the old <Hansard-Italic>
Lucinda</Hansard-Italic>
 and wide verandahs that mark Queensland as unique. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1074414"></A>
The parliament was never really committed to the south-west in its original design. This was the Colonial Secretary’s office and the Treasury’s office. The Annexe was built to face the south bank. Doug Watkins, under the supervision of Peddle Thorp and Harvey architects--another wonderful Queensland firm--gave us the equally imposing, practical and very useful building that we use today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074419"></A>
Maybe we have seen the correct link that can be achieved between buildings 100 years apart, which is what happened here. Both buildings are a testament to foresight and determination, and the parliament in no short means actually delivered this. Public Works had a great role to play. I have the book here which I will talk about in a second. I have the great privilege to be a fourth generation politician, and I really see what leadership can do over time when people come together. For those members who are unaware, I urge them to obtain their own single copy which is available from the Table Office downstairs. I congratulate the authors, Jinx Miles and Judith McKay. There is a box of them available and members might be able to take one home. </Hansard-Body>

What comes of this is a pride in our state that shows who we are, where we come from and what we stand for. Whilst a building or a structure is merely something that over time will gradually fade, corrode and fall into disrepair, the statement made by former Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen in the then coalition government in the eighties to totally rebuild Parliament House and link it to the Annexe is without parallel in a modern democracy. Even in Victoria, its magnificent parliament building is falling into partial disrepair and unfortunately is not being maintained to the standard it was originally built as a result of gold rushes in Ballarat in Bendigo.</Hansard-Body>

Dr DOUGLAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, he is an engineer. The member for Keppel may not know that the internal dome is based on Christopher Wren’s great dome of St Paul’s Cathedral in London at Ludgate. It is the highest point in London. Basically it was a statement of thanks to God made in 604. It was rebuilt for the fourth time after the Great Fire. People do not build and forget. They do not take short cuts. They do not vacillate. They do all of the ordinary things as well. They watch the budget and they show great vision. Many years ago I had the great privilege of seeing Leonard Bernstein take the orchestra in City Hall from the cloisters. We are going to have this inspired opera house vision delivered here in the city. City Hall is not a bad second to the Opera House in Sydney. I truly wish to see it regain its grandeur. </Hansard-Body>

Equally, on the Gold Coast I do hope that residents, by virtue of careful planning, under the stewardship of the careful and independent Gold Coast City Council, will be delivered an inspired cultural precinct at Evandale for all to enjoy. It is a magnificent community driven process, with all sorts of designs submitted and considered. The current centre is much loved, used and in great need of expansion. Sadly, a discontented rump of former failed political candidates have sought to deride, abuse, letter-write, falsely accuse and influence local residents to oppose any and all of the current initiatives. They will not succeed, and I ask local journalists to champion the needs of the great city of the Gold Coast. For those who do not know, technically a city actually requires a cathedral to be considered a city. But I wonder whether in this case we can build a group of public arenas, with links to our local council, to fully state that the Gold Coast is no longer emerging--to say that it is a true city in its own right. Of course, my electorate of Gaven is part of the Gold Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074439"></A>
My electorate of Gaven is one of Queensland’s oldest habitats, for those who may or may not know, and it was settled mainly around providing timber, primarily to England but also to the rest of Australia. Most of the township has not really survived architecturally. There are a few memories of its once grand places. The names of the streets have survived. We have a wonderful group of local architects--Frank Smith, Craig Hope, Design Imagery, Steven Woolard, Myles Parching, Richard Mason and Paul Wilson. Between them their output is prolific, as one would expect. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1074440"></A>
This bill needs to reflect something of the debt of gratitude for the contribution architects individually and collectively make to all of our lives. I sincerely hope that the changes are embraced warmly. The difficulties that have been raised should be considered for the attention of everyone, and we need to reflect on their inappropriateness or harshness. We can only hope that all of these tests do not actually make these ‘artists beyond canvass’, as they describe themselves, prevail in such a way that they withdraw from the profession and they lead us to a generic age and to a state where things are probably not quite as bright, not quite as happy, not quite the living environment that we want to live in. Architects tend to improve all those things. They are part of the professional arsenal to build our communities. They are small businesses. They need to be fairly dealt with. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074441"></A>
Labor has a tendency to overregulate when times get tough and there is no money in the bank. This puts pressure on working families, with increases in costs of living and when there is no money in the bank for it. Small business needs to be rewarded, not penalised for having a go. The massive Japanese modular home buyers are considering entering the Australian home building market, and if that happens we may see a major change in the role of architects and building suppliers. We may see generic homes that might reflect even less of Australia’s unique built environment. Without passing judgement on the appropriateness of these Japanese environments, I do not think it is what we need here but the budget might dictate it. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms NELSON-CARR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mundingburra--ALP) (5.09 pm): I am very pleased to be able to address the amendments to the Architects Act 2002, which is a very riveting piece of legislation, made by the Architects Amendment Bill 2010 concerning the introduction of a new category of registration for non-practising architects. Currently, the Architects Act 2002 only provides for the registration of practising architects. The act will be amended to provide that a registered or formerly registered architect in Queensland or an equivalent jurisdiction in Australia may apply to the board to be registered as a non-practising architect if the board is satisfied either that the architect has retired from the practise of architecture or that the architect is not likely to practise as an architect within the next 12-month registration period. The new category of registration will allow architects moving into retirement or otherwise ceasing practise for at least 12 months to continue to use the title ‘architect’ and not be subject to the board’s continuing registration requirements. Non-practising architects will not be entitled to offer or provide architectural services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074488"></A>
The introduction of this new category will also harmonise the registration process with most other states of Australia, such as New South Wales and Victoria, where non-practising or retired categories already exist. Non-practising architects will be required to pay an annual registration fee which will be a percentage of the annual registration fee for practising architects. If a non-practising architect wishes to commence practising again, they will need to satisfy the board’s continuing registration requirements. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1074490"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms DAVIS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Aspley--LNP) (5.11 pm): I rise to speak briefly to the Architects Amendment Bill 2010 which was introduced into the House on 9 February by the honourable Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology. As the member for Currumbin has indicated, the LNP will be supporting this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074493"></A>
Here in Queensland there is an ever-increasing demand for buildings that are efficient, functional and, importantly, sustainable, and that is why we need to support the profession in achieving these goals. I have spoken to various local architects since the tabling of this legislation, and they tell me that the life of the architect is both full and satisfying. As a profession, architecture offers widely varying opportunities and challenges that can be both artistically creative and at the same time technically demanding. As artisans, they tell me that the resolution of the tension between creativity and technology can bring a great sense of achievement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074494"></A>
Architects are trained in all aspects of building and advise on and carry out the design of new buildings and the extension, repair, preservation or rehabilitation of old buildings from initial feasibility studies through to the completion of the final project. Therefore, the training of an architect has to be exceptionally comprehensive, including aesthetic, practical, technical, economic and contractual aspects of construction. The confluence of these skills is the reason why it is important that we achieve appropriate registration of this profession at its very basic level, and that is what this legislation seeks to do. As the minister stated in his second reading speech--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1074496"></A>
One of the key initiatives of the bill is to introduce a simplified registration scheme using procedures approved by the Architects Accreditation Council of Australia ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074497"></A>
Other provisions of the bill include: extending the fitness to practise provisions through a health assessment, broadening the Board of Architects of Queensland’s powers to apply for a criminal history check and extending registrations to include a non-practising architect. The amendments will simplify the procedural framework for registering architects by recognising the AACA requirements for Queensland registration. The qualifications and experience required to be registered as an architect will not change as a result of the bill. This simplified scheme means that qualifications and competencies will no longer be prescribed by regulation. Applicants will instead have to hold an academic qualification in architecture or a pass in the national program of assessment recognised by the AACA and have proven competencies in the practice of architecture. I note that the minister in his second reading speech indicated that--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1074499"></A>
Although not set out in the act, these requirements are already in use in Queensland and are used in all Australian states and territories.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074500"></A>
Amongst other things, the policy objectives of the Architects Act of 2002 were to shelter the public by guaranteeing services were provided in a professional and proficient manner. Yesterday in this House I spoke about the importance of consumer protection in relation to credit facilities, and I am pleased that the amendments in this bill seek to provide further consumer protection mechanisms--in this case, in relation to the services of architects.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074501"></A>
I wish to briefly touch on two aspects of this legislation--namely, matters surrounding criminal history checks and health assessments. The new section 35B will allow the board to ask the Commissioner of Police for a written report about the criminal history of a relevant person--a relevant person being an individual applying for registration, an architect applying for renewal of registration or an individual applying for restoration of registration. I do note that in the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee’s report, it is highlighted that--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1074503"></A>
... in Queensland the <Hansard-Italic>
Criminal Law (Rehabilitation of Offenders) Act </Hansard-Italic>
established a general rule that after the expiration of a ‘rehabilitation period’ ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

• 	a person need not disclose past criminal convictions; </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

<A ID="pgfId-1074505"></A>
• 	other people were prohibited from disclosing the criminal convictions; and </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1074506"></A>
• 	officials considering the person’s fitness for a profession or for any other purpose had to disregard the conviction.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074507"></A>
Although there is always merit in identifying the criminal history of individuals in particular workplaces--for example, those who work directly with children and the disabled--the new provisions under section 35B could be seen as a little heavy-handed for architects. I am also concerned that there might be possible breaches of privacy, particularly as there is no requirement to give notice to the relevant person regarding the criminal check. I see in the explanatory notes that in section 35D the board may--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1074510"></A>
... request that a registered architect undergo a health assessment if the Board reasonably believes that the registered architect is unable to competently and safely practise as an architect because of their mental or physical health... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074511"></A>
Whilst it is appropriate that the board give the architect an information notice and that the report must be destroyed as soon as practicable, I question why such a requirement is necessary for this particular profession at all. I am interested in knowing what kinds of indicators would lead the board to proceed with a request for health assessment and how many cases have been presented to the board in the past that make it necessary for this provision to be included. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074512"></A>
The built environment is one of the most visible of man’s achievements and it provides a tangible link with our successes of the past and our directions of the future. Late last year, I was fortunate to be invited to the launch by the Italian Federation of Aspley and Geebung of the English version of the book <Hansard-Italic>
The Italians of Brisbane</Hansard-Italic>
, where I learnt of the remarkable achievements of architect Andrea Stombuco. At least 20 of his buildings survive in South-East Queensland, including Palma Rosa, St Patrick’s Church in Fortitude Valley and the Moreton Club. His contribution and that of many other architects past and present ensures that Queensland continues to advance a rich architectural legacy. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1074516"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (5.17 pm): I rise today to make a contribution to the Architects Amendment Bill 2010. The objective of the bill is to amend the Architects Act 2002 which regulates the registration of architects and the practise of architecture in Queensland. The proposed amendments are designed to update the regulations to the current industry practice and to improve consumer protection.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074518"></A>
The introduction of a simplified registration scheme adopts procedures approved by the Architects Accreditation Council of Australia and brings Queensland’s registration in line with the registration boards in all other Australian states and territories. Whilst the qualifications and experience required to be registered as an architect will not change, the bill will have the effect of broadening the fitness to practise in these provisions. It will also enable the board to request that a registered architect undergo a health assessment if the board reasonably believes that the registered architect is unable to competently and safely practise as an architect because of their mental or physical health. It also gives the Commissioner of Police the ability to request a criminal history report which provides details of convictions for offences in Queensland or elsewhere in Australia relating to an applicant architect. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074520"></A>
The legislation has provisions to allow a registered architect to register as a non-practising architect in circumstances where they do not intend to practise, and it introduces a range of amendments regarding registration and disciplinary and penalty provisions applicable to former registered architects. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074521"></A>
The bill seeks to also introduce an alternative simplified registration scheme without the need for assessment entities. The board will continue to assess fitness to practise requirements, register architects, carry out disciplinary processes, enable criminal history checks and request that an architect undergo a health assessment if again the board reasonably believes that the architect is unable to competently and safely practise. Whilst one would assume there would be adequate checks and balances from an engineering perspective to ensure that no substandard architectural plan slips through the rigours of building codes, this legislation would provide a further safety mechanism for the public. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (5.19 pm) I rise to speak to the Architects Amendment Bill 2010 and to put on the record my appreciation for those who work in this field. I think in more recent times some of the flair has gone out of architectural design when we look at the style of buildings now as opposed to the style of buildings in years gone by. However, it is a very cyclical process and I believe that some soul and aesthetics will re-emerge in a lot of the long-term building projects. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074561"></A>
This bill proposes to bring a nationwide focus to the qualifications of architects. I think the member for Callide, in his wide-ranging contribution, mentioned the portability of these skills. It is very true that the awarding of contracts can be done quite far afield. I think where there is national recognition--although I cannot recall that it is national scheme legislation--of similar skills, it will make the portability of these skills and abilities in terms of tendering for projects much easier.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074562"></A>
There are a couple of issues on which I seek clarification from the minister. Normally when criminal history checks are required it is in areas where there is contact with children and therefore people being in a position of trust. I am assuming that the criminal history checks in this legislation are in relation to their fitness to practice. I seek a clarification as to the specific reason for the criminal history check. I certainly do not have any problem with a criminal history check of anybody working in any field, but I would seek clarification on that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074563"></A>
The other area I seek clarification on is the fitness to practice area in relation to health assessments. It says that it is a test of reasonability. I seek clarification on that reasonability test. Who can bring that concern forward? I also ask about protections against vexatious or malicious reporting that could bring about a requirement for a health assessment. I know that the minister has a great eye for shape and I am sure that this legislation will be beneficial to the people of Queensland, but I look forward to his response on those two issues as a matter of clarification. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WENDT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich West--ALP) (5.22 pm): I am pleased to make a short contribution to the Architects Act 2002. I would particularly like to discuss the role of the Board of Architects of Queensland under the new arrangements proposed by this bill. Later I will touch briefly on the issue of health assessments and criminal history checks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074567"></A>
These amendments will introduce a simplified registration scheme which will adopt procedures approved by the Architects Accreditation Council of Australia, the AACA. These procedures have already been adopted by architects registration boards in other Australian states and territories. As such, it is considered that these amendments will simplify the procedural framework for registering architects by recognising the AACA requirements for Queensland registration. However, it is important to note that the qualifications and experience required for registration as an architect will not change.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074568"></A>
Under this proposed simplified registration scheme, the qualifications and competencies for the registration of architects will no longer be prescribed by regulation. Instead, the act will provide that applicants for registration will need to satisfy two criteria. Firstly, applicants will need an academic qualification in architecture which is recognised by the AACA or a pass in the national program of assessment conducted by the AACA. Secondly, applicants will require competencies in the practice of architecture based on a period of training, followed by the successful completion of the AACA architectural practice examination or another examination arranged or approved by the Board of Architects in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074570"></A>
Although not currently set out in the act, these requirements are already in use in Queensland through transitional provisions and are used in all other Australian states and territories. Further, I am pleased to advise that the Board of Architects of Queensland will continue to assess fitness to practise requirements, register architects and carry out disciplinary processes. As such, the board will also continue to have a significant role in ensuring that the high standard of architectural services in Queensland is maintained. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074572"></A>
I also want to touch on the issue of health assessments and criminal history checks for architects. In order to further enhance the public protection provisions already in the act, the bill will require registered architects who by reason of any physical or mental capacity are unable to competently and safely practise for six months to notify the Board of Architects of Queensland. Once the board receives such notification, the proposed amendments will allow the board to suspend registration during any period of incapacity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074574"></A>
Circumstances may arise where registered architects do not advise the board of their incapacity. In these circumstances the bill introduces an amendment which entitles the board to direct a registered architect to attend a health assessment if the board suspects that the architect is suffering from a physical or mental condition which affects their ability to practise. In addition to the above, the act currently allows the board to take into account whether an applicant for registration as an architect has a conviction for an indictable offence in deciding whether that applicant is fit to practise. However, if the board wishes to inquire into the criminal history of an applicant, it would be required to write to the Commissioner of Police requesting such information, and the provision of the information would be at the discretion of the Commissioner of Police. As such, this bill introduced a provision which allows the board, if it considers it appropriate, to ask the Commissioner of Police for a criminal history report relating to an applicant. This will allow the board to ascertain, with the assistance of the police report, which convictions may be relevant to the application for registration being considered. However, any report provided to the Commissioner of Police may be used only for the purposes of the act and must be destroyed as soon as practicable after it is no longer required. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074575"></A>
It is understood that such requests to the Commissioner of Police for criminal histories would be rare and likely to be no more than one or two a year. As such, the amendment is also consistent with provisions in the Professional Engineers Act 2002 and, importantly, the Legal Profession Act 2007. I firmly believe these provisions will further enhance the public protection objectives of the act. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (5.26 pm), in reply: I commend all who have participated in this debate, particularly the member for Callide who stepped into the breach while the shadow minister was busying herself getting ready to speak and made a very good commitment to something that he knew nothing about. Like everything, he had a view on it, like we all do. I commend the shadow minister for the effort that she put in, even though she did not manage to get here on time. When she did get to her feet, she made a very good contribution and I thank her for the effort she put into that and for the consultation she has made with the industry, which indeed we have done along the way.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074580"></A>
I noticed that the member for Capalaba went back to the age-old ridicule of architects that engineers like to do, but it is only very minor ridicule compared to the industry that I came out of originally, the building industry. All architects and engineers originally came out of the building industry. They always like to think they are a bit better than the building industry, but in reality they are an integral part of it. While the member for Callide was commenting on Corinthian columns and so forth, I could not help thinking he is a revival Renaissance man. This building is an example of revival Renaissance. The Louvre is a very similar building. The Zwinger building in Dresden also has very similar architecture. Architecture has played a very important part in our history, as many members have pointed out including the member for Gaven, who gave us a history lesson on some aspects of it. I particularly thank the government members who were solidly relevant in their comments on the bill. I do not think there was a great deal of relevance from the member for Gaven, although what he had to say was very interesting.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074584"></A>
The members for Aspley and Gladstone asked whether or not it was a bit heavy handed to have police checks. I think the member for Gladstone was suggesting there could be some exploitation in terms of asking people for a check on a person’s health.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074613"></A>
I will share a little illustration with members. This provision applies to engineers as well. We put our trust in architects and engineers. The idea that we put our trust in somebody who is found to be mentally unsound and the board is not able to do something about it is a situation that has existed. We had a person who was deemed to be of unsound mind and took somebody else’s life when he was of unsound mind. He was put into Wolston Park. He put his address down as Wolston Park. Papers to renew his membership as an architect were sent to Wolston Park. This was done while he was under the care of the Mental Health Act. Clearly that person could not participate in this industry yet could have lawfully held himself out to be an architect. That person has since been rehabilitated back into society and he has been given his registration back. There has been some controversy over that. This does happen. For example, we could have a person who has dementia in charge of a major project and the family knows about it but nothing can be done about it. That is why these provisions are in this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074617"></A>
Going to the other extreme, we could have somebody who is guilty of fraud project managing, as an architect does, a job and using their trust account to put a person’s money into. That person could be paying them a lot of money. It is a consumer protection issue. It is something that is not objected to by the industry because, after all, they do not want the industry tainted by people who drag the industry down. Quite frankly, from a regulation point of view, I know that the board was very uncomfortable about not having the power to take somebody off the register when they were made aware that that person was of unsound mind. That is the reason for these provisions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074618"></A>
When this issue was first raised with me with respect to engineers I raised the very same question that members are raising now. They are legitimate questions to raise. I think the shadow minister was questioning--and I might have missed it--whether or not someone could hold themselves out as an architect--</Hansard-Body>

They can still call themselves an architect but they are nonpractising. It will be prohibited under the law. Those persons cannot hold themselves out as practising architects. Is the shadow minister suggesting that we should put some further qualification on it? </Hansard-Body>

Mrs Stuckey:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 I was going to address that in the clauses, but we can do it now. It seems to be an area that still needs a little bit more tightening. How are they going to identify themselves as non-practising architects if they are now included, which we agree is a sensible thing to happen? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074622"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is a fair point. I know in the military they say ‘major general retired’. They cannot advertise themselves as an architect. They cannot practise as an architect. They can still call themselves an architect but they cannot hold themselves out, as the act says, as an architect--in other words, they cannot advertise their services as an architect. I could be known as Robert Schwarten, architect, but I could not practise in that regard. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is. I do not have any problem with that. I can understand where they are coming from in that regard. If they are an engineer they want to stay an engineer and be recognised as an engineer but they just cannot practise. This is a consistent approach. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1074625"></A>
I do not intend to take any more time of the House except to say that these provisions freshen up the 2002 act. I said when we brought the act in in 2002 that we would continue to be vigilant and continue to be guided by the profession and the board as to the amendments required. This simplifies the practice when people are applying to be architects. That is the crucial issue. The regulations were cumbersome. Trying to put a national focus on that was proving to be a challenge for the board. I think this has modernised it eight years down the track. What will be required in another eight years, who knows? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.36 pm): I am mindful of time as well so I will try to be fairly brief. I did want to ask the minister about clause 17 as it inserts a new section. This clause places the onus on the architect to advise the board of any disciplinary action taken against them by another state or territory of Australia or in a foreign country within 21 days of the action or face a penalty. That penalty is some 50 penalty units or $5,000, which is quite significant. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074637"></A>
I am very interested to hear from the minister how these new rules will be advertised. Is there a plan for it? How can the government ensure all architects know about this? It is a fairly short time frame for people who are moving here from interstate to become aware of it. I am wondering how this new rule will be circulated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074639"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I think the member is suggesting that we need to ensure that everybody knows about these penalties. As I understand it, they will be put on the board of architects website. Is that the question? I understood the member to be saying that when a penalty was enforced against somebody we need to know that it had been enforced. Have I got the bull by the horns there? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074641"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs STUCKEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am referring to the fact that there will now be a law where the onus will be on the architect to advise of a disciplinary action--and they only have 21 days to do so--before a quite severe penalty is imposed. I am wondering whether it is fair for people to be expected to find out about this new law in that time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074642"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I think they will all know about it. I have never met more informed people than architects in these sorts of situations. I think 21 days is the legislative standard. I do not have any fears about 21 days being a problem for notification. There has been a lot of discussion with the architects themselves. They do not have any problems with this and neither does the board. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs STUCKEY</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (5.39 pm): This clause deals with the criminal history check. The LNP did say that it had some issues with this, as did some sections of the industry. In the current legislation--not the bill before us today--there is an obligation for the board to obtain written consent from the person undergoing the check or the investigation. Section 44 of the 2002 act relates to an investigation by the board of conduct in providing professional services as an architect, but this is not the same as considering their past criminal history in determining their eligibility for registration. What we have in this new legislation is that the board must give the subject architect an information notice about the decision. I am wondering what the need was to strengthen this. Perhaps it is in line with the Professional Engineers Act and is part of streamlining across-the-board. I know the minister has also mentioned specific cases as to reasons for disciplinary action. Is this the same reasoning behind this amendment, or is there another reason?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074678"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No, the member has got it in one. That is basically it. The only area of contention when we raised it was what would happen to that information once we got it. It is to be destroyed after that so it does not get put into other people’s hands. So that was the only area of contention.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074679"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs STUCKEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am glad that that was the case. The other question I have is how the board is going to assess those criminal accusations, and really it is a matter of seeking some clarification from the minister. Under fitness to practise the board may regard whether the applicant has a conviction other than a spent conviction for an indictable offence, an offence against this act or an offence relating to the practice of architecture in another jurisdiction. After the expiration of the rehabilitation period, I understand that the person need not disclose their past criminal convictions and officials considering the person’s fitness for a profession have to disregard that conviction. However, this is subject to specific legislative provision like that included in this bill, enabling an official to request a copy of a person’s criminal history from the commissioner of the Police Service. Is this proposed amendment going to change the prescription of the existing 2002 act to include them by way of this legislative provision requesting that history from the police? If that is the case, is that not greatly suppressing their rights and liberties?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074681"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>

Clause 20--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074686"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs STUCKEY</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (5.42 pm): Clause 20 relates to the health assessment which is another area that we had some concerns with. There are quite a few sections under proposed section 35, so I will include a couple here. I refer to allowing the board to request that a registered architect undergo a health assessment if it reasonably believes that they may be physically or mentally impaired. I know the minister gave an example of this earlier, but I am wondering what indicators would lead the board to proceed with the request for a health assessment. Also, the board can suspend registration if the architect does not undergo the health assessment or cooperate with the doctor. I am just wondering whether the minister could perhaps explain cooperation a little more, because in a lot of these cases in the real world where people do not get a choice to see a doctor they may not, for some reason, get on because of personal clashes or other different reasons. I wonder if the minister would address that issue.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074687"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I could give the member the circumstance where say, for example, the person has dementia. The member asked how the board would act on it. That would probably come about by a complaint. It may be a complaint from their work colleagues. It may be a complaint from a consumer. It may be a complaint from their immediate family. It would generally tend to be on a complaint basis. It would come to the board’s attention through that process. There is not any intention to go around and peer into all of the architectural practices looking for people with dementia or anything like that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074688"></A>
Having done that, we then need to give the board the power to enforce it. If we give the board the power to do it, we then have to give it the power to carry it out. If someone does not want to cooperate, we have to find a way to ensure that they will. I guess the only way we can do that is to say, ‘If you don’t go and have a medical assessment then we will presume you to be a person who is not fit and proper.’ That is basically what the effect of this will be. I know it is a bit harsh and it rattled me a bit when it came to my attention, but I can see no other way really of saying to somebody, ‘This is fair dinkum.’ We cannot make it optional for them. There has to be some causal circumstance after it. In my view, the only way to do that is to say, ‘If you don’t treat this seriously, if you don’t cooperate, if you don’t see this doctor of our choosing nominated by the board’--and the board would take advice on who that doctor might be--‘we’ll suspend your registration.’ If we did not do that, basically we would have a part of this bill that could not be acted upon. I just do not see how we would enforce it otherwise.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074689"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs STUCKEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the minister for that, because the circumstance that he just outlined is valid. However, not all cases would be a case of dementia, and they are very sad indeed. Often those people do actually have glimpses of normality and they do not realise when they are perhaps not in the moment and they have lapsed. But I guess what I am really interested in is if there is a choice of doctors. If there really was a personal clash, is there the opportunity for the board to have more than one doctor? I also have a couple of other issues I want to ask about while I am on my feet. I was also interested in the appointment of the health assessor, and this is to do with the board choosing that doctor. It only needs to be satisfied that the chosen doctor does not have a personal connection with the subject architect. I am wondering what other criteria are employed with the board’s appointment of this person given the fact they have this power to decide the future of this person. Does the board have a preferred list? Is it a specialist? What is required? Can it call a psychiatrist if it needs to? I thought that a power that was invasive on an individual and that could perhaps permanently affect their work would have some tighter guidelines.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074691"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The member makes a good point. The board has to make that decision, but its decision is then appealable to QCAT. So there is a handbrake there, if you like, to stop any of those excesses. If somebody believes they were being victimised or being unfairly treated, they have the power to take that to the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074693"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs STUCKEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Minister. It is an area that I would ask the minister to look into more. I am not sure how many instances happened in the Professional Engineers Act or how many will happen under this bill, but to the person involved and their family it could be very meaningful for them. The other issue I wanted to ask about in this clause is that if the health assessment does prove that the architect is unable to practise in a safe and competent manner the architect may have to pay for the reports and the assessment et cetera. I am wondering what sorts of costs we are talking about here. How broad is this assessment? How expensive could it be? Could this go on for months? Could it result in being referred out to other people? After the initial consult with the doctor, does it then go on to other referrals if that is required, because we would hope there is a degree of speciality here if someone’s career is being terminated.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078658"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I concur with the member’s view on that. My understanding of it is that the board would be as extensive as it needs to be. So in other words, if you have to involve other specialists--if the doctor concerned was of the view that they were not in a position to do it--they could refer it to somebody else who has a specialty in a certain area. I am comfortable that all of the checks and balances are in this system to allow people to get a fair assessment and are as intrusive as they have to be to satisfy the board. In other words, if someone has to go before a psychiatrist, for example--</Hansard-Body>

But our big problem is that we have never had the power before to say that somebody can be referred under these circumstances and it is very important that we do that. </Hansard-Body>

 (Dalrymple--LNP) (5.52 pm): In fewer than three weeks the small township of Mount Garnet will come alive for its annual and iconic Mount Garnet Races and Rodeo. This is one of the supreme events on the country calendar throughout Queensland, if not Australia. This iconic event started more than 75 years ago and now has the reputation of being the bush version of the Cairns amateur races. The rodeo is also priding itself on the celebration of 40 years of rugged, tough competition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078686"></A>
The Mount Garnet Races and Rodeo is where the city meets the bush to renew acquaintances and friendships and for country people to share that social interaction that is lost through the tyranny of distance. This May long weekend provides an enormous financial boost not only for the region but also for Far North Queensland and has been an important fundraiser for the Royal Flying Doctor Service, sporting clubs, the School of Distance Education, local P&amp;Cs and the list goes on. Praise must go to the continuous commitment and efforts of the hardworking members of past and present committees and supporters of the race club and the rodeo association who have made this event what it is today.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078689"></A>
Unfortunately, a raft of problems loom arising out of issues to do with Queensland Racing and the Licensing Commission. These issues have come out of left field. Unreasonable demands and red tape seriously threaten the continuation of this iconic weekend event. New laws have created massive costs of at least $60,000 alone to meet licensing laws that enforce heavy security measures and which are no more than overkill in the bush. Other requirements imposed are to provide street lighting to camping areas. Part of the ambience of camping is to sleep under the stars, cook a good feed and boil the billy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078690"></A>
On top of all that, Queensland Racing has forced country race clubs to erect inside and outside running rails, amounting to an extra cost of some $30,000, as well as tens of thousands of dollars for special amenities. Licensing laws have forced heavy security measures. This is an overkill in the bush. These excessive rules and massive costs will overburden the clubs and could plunge this successful club into financial ruin. I believe that all agencies must sit down every year and thrash out workable and realistic solutions to prevent the demise of these rural events. The same rules that apply in Brisbane do not fit with country racing. It is a totally different environment. It is paramount that the minister for racing venture out and have a look at the uniqueness of the bush and the difference between it and the city. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078691"></A>
Queensland Racing needs an overhaul. It does not recognise or understand the importance of country race days to small communities. It has prioritised TAB meetings at the expense of non-TAB meetings. Queensland Racing needs to be held accountable for its decisions. Country clubs are continually being kicked in the guts by the hierarchy of Queensland Racing. Rural communities need to be allowed to stage special race events, which were time-honoured traditions for many years before Queensland Racing took control. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078692"></A>
Country racing and rodeos are the lifeblood of these rural communities. The government needs to protect their survival for future generations and not be responsible for their decline and ruination. The focus should be on fixing the issues and not being intent on working against the hardworking efforts of the race committees in these rural communities. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (5.55 pm): Netball is Australia’s most popular women’s team sport. For many Australian girls and women of all ages, it is their first sport of choice. This is no different in the Greenslopes electorate, with the Metropolitan Districts Netball Association, based at Wembly Park at Coorparoo, giving southsiders the opportunity to play and participate in this fantastic sport for more than 35 years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078698"></A>
On Sunday, 28 March 2010, I was delighted to be able to officially open the association’s annual representative carnival. The 2010 carnival gave the opportunity for players from 135 teams from 34 associations, as well as their friends, family members, supporters and spectators from the Sunshine Coast, Caboolture, Pine Rivers, Redlands, Ipswich and northern New South Wales and all points in between, to participate in, or otherwise be part of, a wonderful day of competition. More than 1,500 people participated in or attended the annual carnival. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078699"></A>
The carnival competition included 12 years teams all the way through to 17 years teams and some senior teams. I am pleased to report that the Metropolitan 14 years team went through the tournament undefeated. I want to pay tribute this evening to the hardworking members of the association’s executive, particularly the association’s president, Trish Jachimowicz, for their efforts in making the carnival such a success. Each week people such as Trish, vice-president Geoff Moloney, treasurer Christine Gould and others such as coaching and development convenor Sue Maidment and volunteers such as Mal and Kay Kelly, who sit on the desk at Wembley Park each and every Saturday, give the opportunity for literally hundreds of girls and young women to experience fun, excitement and team sport at its very best. Mal and Kay Kelly’s daughter played for Metropolitan and now their granddaughter enjoys the fun of netball. I want to thank them for their volunteer work for the club. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078705"></A>
I also wish to recognise the wonderful work of other volunteers, such as umpire Hayden Lenz, and coaches Jamie O’Connor, Camille Dowling and Amanda Stag, among others. They represent the hundreds of mums and dads, family members, friends and helpers who make volunteer sport happen in the Greenslopes electorate and in other parts of Brisbane’s southern suburbs each week. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078711"></A>
It was also wonderful to see one of Australia’s all-time netballing greats, Vicki Wilson, who coaches the association’s 15 years team, urging her players on in one game that I watched. I know that Vicki has at times described herself as a ‘Metro girl through and through’ and to see her giving back to the sport at a grassroots level was remarkable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078712"></A>
The Metropolitan Districts Netball Association is a community focused sporting club. It strives to do whatever it can to be a good neighbour to local residents and fully supports the community use of the club’s grounds. I thank the association for letting me be part of an important day in their annual sporting calendar. I look forward to doing what I can to support them as their local state member of parliament. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms DAVIS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Aspley--LNP) (5.58 pm): I rise to speak about an issue that is of increasing concern across Queensland and one which affects a number of people in the Aspley electorate and that is the closure of caravan parks and its impact on long-term residents who reside in them. Although the Aspley electorate is primarily represented by stand-alone residential housing, town houses and villas, around 800 residents live in caravans or manufactured homes within the three caravan parks located in the suburbs of Aspley and Carseldine. It is expected that two of the three caravan parks, Aspley Acres and the Alpha Accommodation Centre, will be closed in the next few years as preliminary approval has been granted by the Brisbane City Council for 780 units to be built on the two adjoining sites. Although within the unit complex there will be around 120 affordable housing units, the reality is that the majority of residents in those two caravan parks will not transition into this new development.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078718"></A>
Caravan parks play a vital role in Queensland’s housing stock and have provided a safety net of low-cost housing in Queensland for the financially and emotionally vulnerable. Indeed, half of caravan park residents earn below $500 per week as compared to 21 per cent of households across the state, and 20 per cent of caravan park residents earn less than $250 per week as compared to 8 per cent state-wide. I can advise the House that the residents in both Alpha and Aspley Acres certainly fall into those categories.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082924"></A>
But the reality is that park owners, having had to contend with escalating costs associated with public liability, utilities and massive land tax bills, have either sold out to developers or have opted to develop the land themselves. As a result, over 40 parks across the state have had to close. Members would have heard about the Alpha Accommodation Centre at various times in the House and rarely in glowing terms. It could be described as hotpot of dysfunction and disadvantage and very often violent. However, it has provided accommodation for individuals who have been institutionalised or who suffer from mental illness or alcohol or substance abuse. Many of the residents have been listed with TIKA or have been banned from charitable shelters for behavioural issues. It has filled a void in the housing sector that has not been able to be met otherwise.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082927"></A>
It is important that we understand that there are also residents of manufactured homes who are long-term residents of the caravan parks. These are good, honest community members who simply made a lifestyle choice to reside in a park community. They have worked hard to purchase their manufactured homes, but are now finding that options for long-term leases in metro caravan parks almost impossible to secure. Indeed, once these parks are shut in my electorate, the closest parks to relocate to are in Esk and Gympie.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082928"></A>
The closure of Aspley Acres and Alpha Accommodation must be viewed in the context of the significant loss of housing options on the north side of Brisbane. I call upon the Minister for Communities to ensure departmental readiness for the closure of these parks as it is estimated that up to 600 people could be seeking high-priority social housing assistance, which I am advised by the department will be the largest relocation ever undertaken. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr MOORHEAD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Waterford--ALP) (6.01 pm): I am sure members will join me tonight in acknowledging the enormous contribution of Ray Goodey and his wife Frances to the Beenleigh and Logan community. Ray Goodey is a newspaper man through and through. In 1962 at the tender age of 17 years Ray started in the newspaper industry working for a daily newspaper in New Zealand. Ray’s distinguished career in the newspaper industry has seen him work in New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Chermside and, for the last 21 years, in Logan and Beenleigh. Ray’s career has outlasted many of the changes in this fast-changing industry including the loss of hot lead, the computerisation of printing, computerisation of journalism and the introduction of online news.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082932"></A>
Ray has been an integral part of the Quest Community Newspapers group, in particular in Logan, for the last 21 years but is best known to me and others as the editor of the <Hansard-Italic>
Albert and Logan News</Hansard-Italic>
 for the last 12 years. Ray is renowned for his love of the job and the newspaper game. Most people thought that he would never retire, or at least that Frances would have to physically remove Ray from the office of the <Hansard-Italic>
Albert and Logan News</Hansard-Italic>
. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082933"></A>
Ray’s commitment to his wife Frances and his four daughters is well known. That is why Ray, at the young age of 65, is retiring as editor of the <Hansard-Italic>
Albert and Logan News</Hansard-Italic>
. Ray has been battling his own personal health issues in the last 12 months. At the launch of the Beenleigh Cane Festival this year, Ray was telling me just how torn he was between his love of the newspaper game and his work and his desire to spend some quality time with his family while he battles cancer. As well as his colleagues at the <Hansard-Italic>
Albert and Logan News</Hansard-Italic>
, Ray will be missed by the Logan and Beenleigh community. Ray saw his responsibility as going beyond simply writing the news to being a community leader. Ray has, for many years, been a judge for the Beenleigh Cane Quest, the key event on the Beenleigh calendar. Ray has been a judge for many years, seeing many Beenleigh young people grow and mature through the Cane Quest.Ray has also been seen as an honest broker within our community, chairing many local mayoral debates in Logan--many heated debates at that. Ray’s contribution to the business community has also been recognised with life membership of the Logan Chamber of Commerce.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082934"></A>
As we here know all too well, politicians need newspapers more than newspapers need us. Ray had a great understanding of what the people of Logan and Beenleigh wanted to know. Ray never gave credence to political point scoring, but was always prepared to put the local into local news. I know every member of this House, both past and present, who know Ray and Frances will join with me in wishing Ray well in his battle with cancer and wishing them well in his retirement. While the <Hansard-Italic>
Albert and Logan News</Hansard-Italic>
 will continue to be a strong voice in our community, he will be sorely missed by us but warmly welcomed by his family. </Hansard-Body>

Suicide</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr DICKSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Buderim--LNP) (6.04 pm): I rise to speak in support of all the members in our communities who have been touched by a most disturbing statistic released two weeks ago on 31 March 2010. Data, compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, reveals that across Australia 2,191 people took their own lives in 2008 and the ABS has revised upwards by 173 the number of suicides in 2007, bringing that total to 2,054. For 2008, 37 per cent of coroners’ cases have not yet been concluded, meaning the suicide rate could rise even further, with experts believing the final 2008 figure could reach 2,500.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082938"></A>
These statistics are an inexplicable waste of life, the catalysts for which are many and varied, including breakdown of relationships, financial and employment pressure, drug and alcohol dependency, depression and other mental illness. The figure of 932 suicides registered for men aged 44 or younger was more than double the 450 road fatalities in that same age group for the same period but received much less attention. There has regularly been much media coverage and systematic action in attempting to stem the road toll. Rightly so, across Queensland, and indeed right across Australia, we see an almost never ending tsunami of initiatives to lower the road toll, whether they be education, legislative or law enforcement. Just imagine, however, if that road toll figure I mentioned of 450 suddenly became the other figure of 932. There would be, justifiably so, an outcry from all sections of society. Yet unless one has a vested interest, for example as a clinician or a person touched by suicide who are in themselves victims, discussion generally about the incidence of suicide is almost inaudible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082939"></A>
Every year there are tens of thousands of people who are unexpectedly taken from their loved ones in the most tragic of circumstances. Others, whilst not unexpected, tragically die from illness. These deaths are mostly unavoidable. I do not pretend to have an answer to the problem of suicide but we as members of the community and members of this parliament need to constantly remind ourselves of the need to be vigilant in offering all available resources to clinicians, community groups, schools and families in trying to combat the incidence of suicide. I wish for a time when all the efforts and initiatives come into alignment and the incidence of suicides has been greatly reduced in this state. I call upon this parliament to do whatever it can as a united group to help people in this situation. Those statistics are real. Double the number of people killed in car accidents are killing themselves. I think we need to pull together on this one and do whatever we can do to help. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs SCOTT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Woodridge--ALP) (6.06 pm): There are many ways for the unemployed to gain skills, confidence and experience that will lead to employment. Apart from the many training opportunities such as those offered under the Skilling Queenslanders for Work program, there are individual social enterprises that have a positive community benefit far beyond the primary focus. Established in 2008, the Social Enterprise Hub in Logan City, with coordinator Andrew Hamilton, has assisted in setting up a number of social enterprises which are showing great promise. Tasty Fresh Community Catering was established at the Logan Women’s Health and Wellbeing Centre. With a very well-established network of organisations and a commercial kitchen, the catering service was a natural option. Team leader Elizabeth Loughlin has a great background and vast experience in food preparation as well as her considerable leadership and people skills. This business is giving employment opportunities to the women of Logan and spreading the message of healthy food choices. The hub offers support in many areas such as training workshops, developing a business plan, matching with a business mentor, market research and assisting with training of a new employee.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082943"></A>
The Rock Indoor Climbing and Adventure Specialists operate out of The Spot at Browns Plains and offers adventure based activities from indoor climbing to overnight camps, particularly for marginalised young people. The activities provide mental, social, emotional and physical benefits to the participants. Blueprint Distribution Centre offers employment and training and intends establishing a distribution centre providing safety equipment and clothing to community based workplace and training programs. CityCare Technology employs people in its program to recycle computers which, of course, has great environmental benefits. It refurbishes the system and sells second-hand computers, as well as giving IT advice and repairs at discount prices to those on low incomes. It also supplies computers and parts to the overseas market. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082944"></A>
MultiLink Community Services, which runs programs for people from culturally diverse backgrounds, has established interpreting services and is at present building up its clientele. The latest social enterprise is one which I spoke of in this place recently, the Style It Up Hairdressing and Beauty Salon at Career Keys which will give juniors experience in a real-life salon thus ensuring they are work ready and able to step straight into the workplace.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082945"></A>
These examples of local, targeted small enterprises show that a local community is able to offer sufficient support throughout local networks to be able to sustain jobs and grow a small business. I would like to commend Andrew and his team and those who are guiding these enterprises through their establishment phase. The aim of these enterprises is to develop them so they are self-sustaining and are able to offer employment to local people, particularly those who have found it difficult in the past to gain employment. </Hansard-Body>

Gold Coast Rail Line</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086868"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr CRANDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Coomera--LNP) (6.09 pm): It appears that the transport minister is relying on frustrated Gold Coast commuters abandoning the ‘Bombay Express’ as the solution to overcrowding on Gold Coast trains. The latest TransLink Tracker data confirms that Gold Coast commuters are giving up in frustration. The Gold Coast rail line, or the ‘Bombay Express’, could have lost as much as, indeed more than, 20 per cent of commuters since March 2009 when comparing the latest figures available. But even on these reduced numbers, Gold Coast trains are still the most overcrowded trains on the TransLink network during peak times.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086870"></A>
The latest TransLink Tracker was released by the minister just before Easter. It shows that, although there was no increase in train services to the Gold Coast during the period, the number of overcrowded trains in morning peak hours has dropped from six out of seven in the March 2009 survey to just four out of seven in December. On afternoon peak services, overcrowding has dropped from five out of eight in March 2009 to four out of eight in December. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086871"></A>
The minister could point to a few other possible explanations for the reduced commuter traffic. An increase in unemployment of Gold Coast commuters is one possibility, but that is not something this government would want to suggest. It would mean unemployment had increased by up to 20 per cent on the Gold Coast, and clearly that is not the case. The reduction in overcrowding during a period when an estimated 8,500 new residents have moved in to the Coomera area in the past nine months can only be put down to one thing. The real answer is that commuters are walking away from Gold Coast trains because they are sick and tired of standing for over an hour every day just to get to work and then experiencing more of the same in the afternoon. Standing for two hours every day to get to work and back is just not on. Is it any wonder locals call it the ‘Bombay Express’?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086872"></A>
Commuters deserting the train is bad news for traffic congestion on the M1, too. We see entry onto the M1 heading north becoming gridlocked every morning and it is repeated in reverse every afternoon. It is all-round bad news for everyone living on the northern end of the Gold Coast when it comes to getting to work in Brisbane. The choice is between standing up for two hours every day or fighting to get on to the M1 and then heavy traffic all the way to Brisbane and back.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086873"></A>
We have got the Coomera Town Centre planning proceeding on schedule, but there is no plan from this minister or this government to fix the already overcrowded trains. What I fear is that this could become a deal breaker for the developers. What is the point in developing the Coomera Town Centre as a transport hub around the Coomera Train Station and encouraging the use of public transport if there is no plan to fix the already overcrowded trains?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086874"></A>
The transport minister admitted to me that Gold Coast trains are the most overcrowded in the TransLink network, but she said that she does not have any answers to the overcrowding problem. I call on the minister to get serious about this--get a plan together and show the people of the northern Gold Coast that she does not consider them second-class citizens. </Hansard-Body>

Queensland Tennis Centre, Davis Cup</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086877"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr FINN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Yeerongpilly--ALP) (6.12 pm): In early May the focus of national tennis will again be on Brisbane as we host a Davis Cup tie for the first time in a decade. The last Davis Cup tie in Brisbane was in 2000, when we played Brazil and won the tie 5-0 in what was the semifinal round. Unfortunately, we went on to lose to Spain that year. In 2000 Australia’s Davis Cup team was spearheaded by Patrick Rafter and Lleyton Hewitt. This year I am certainly hoping that Lleyton will be out on centre court at the Pat Rafter Arena again representing Australia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086878"></A>
When this government announced that we would build a State Tennis Centre in Tennyson, our vision included Brisbane again being able to host Davis Cup ties and ensure that the people of Brisbane can enjoy the best of Australia’s tennis talent. Hosting a Davis Cup tie is about delivering on the vision for tennis in Brisbane but also about building the inspiration for local children to play tennis and go on to represent their country on their home court in Tennyson.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086879"></A>
This Davis Cup tie comes about as a result of a partnership between the state government and Brisbane City Council, through Queensland Events and Brisbane Marketing, putting together a bid with Tennis Australia to secure the event. One of the challenges of hosting the event comes with the playing groups preferring a clay playing surface. Whilst there are clay outer courts at Tennyson, centre court has a hardcourt surface. In order to host this event, centre court Tennyson will be transformed into a clay surface, with a world standard clay court built on top of the existing centre court. This bumping in of an alternative surface demonstrates the flexibility of the venue and the initial planning of the centre to enable the stadium to be used for a range of tennis demands.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086882"></A>
World-class tennis at Tennyson has so far been showcased at the annual Brisbane International for the last two years. These events are known for their accessibility, with outer court ticket prices starting at $9.90. The Davis Cup tie continues this accessibility, acknowledging of course that there are no outer court matches. A Davis Cup tie consists of two singles matches on day 1, doubles on day 2 and reverse singles on day 3. Adult ticket prices for the days of singles games are under $40, with a series ticket for all three days costing less than $100. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086883"></A>
Local residents also need to be assured that traffic movements will be managed for the event, with the three days--7 to 9 March--dedicated as event days. Yesterday I met with Queensland Events to be briefed on aspects of the event and also sought information relating to traffic and parking. I am advised that ticketing will include public transport costs, that additional train services will stop at Yeerongpilly station and that event days will include local parking restrictions. Once a clearer indication of expected patronage is known, local residents will be written to. Local Quest papers will also include event information, and I have also requested that local Councillor Nicole Johnston be briefed on event management plans.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086885"></A>
This Davis Cup tie will be a great tennis event for Brisbane. It will showcase our stadium and our local area, and many local people will have a great opportunity to see world-class tennis on their doorstep. </Hansard-Body>

Springbrook, Restoration Agreement</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (6.15 pm): For the second time this week I rise in this place to seek answers for concerned residents of the Springbrook Plateau over Labor’s plans for this small hinterland community. On 27 June 2008, some two years after the buy-up of land in Springbrook commenced, a restoration agreement was signed between the state of Queensland and the Australian Rainforest Conversation Society Inc., otherwise known as ARCS. I refer the minister to point 12.4, ‘Regular reporting’, on page 17 of the agreement which states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086891"></A>
Within 14 days after:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1086892"></A>
(a)	the end of each calendar year during the Term of this agreement; and </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1086893"></A>
(b)	termination of this Agreement,</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086894"></A>
the Licensee must provide to the Licensor a progress report which details the status and progress of the activities to be undertaken in accordance with the Property Management Plans and the Approved Works carried out by the Licensee during the year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086895"></A>
I note that in response to a question on notice regarding these progress reports the minister expects the report ‘soon’. Under the terms of the agreement, the minister should have received the 2008-09 report at the end of the calendar year--on 31 December 2009--with the 2009-10 report due on 31 December 2010. Given that ARCS has been entrusted with $40 million of taxpayers’ money, will the minister now demand that the overdue report be tabled in parliament immediately and launch an investigation into why ARCS has been non-compliant under the terms of the agreement and what penalties apply?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086896"></A>
A further breach of the agreement pertains to section 7 of the agreement which clearly enunciates the establishment of a ‘Springbrook Rescue Steering Committee’ before the commencement date of the agreement and that this committee be maintained. The committee was to be made up of five people, which included two from the licensee, ARCS, and three from the licensor, the government. The committee was to meet at least twice in a calendar year. My questions to the minister on this section of the agreement are: who are the members of this steering committee? On what dates in the period 2008 to 2010 did this committee meet? Where are the minutes of these meetings? The community of Springbrook has a right to know what, if any, progress has been made in the area and how $40 million of taxpayer funded money requires no accountability or transparency to the public. </Hansard-Body>

The silent majority on the mountain will no longer be silenced by the vocal minority. ‘Wanted’ posters are springing up all around the mountain by the Save Springbrook group and will continue until the thick veil of secrecy which shrouds the mountain like thick clouds is finally lifted and in the bright light of day all questions are answered. </Hansard-Body>

Mr KILBURN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Chatsworth--ALP) (6.18 pm): The Gateway Upgrade Project is a fantastic project running through my electorate that will provide great benefits to all of the residents of Chatsworth, indeed to all Queenslanders. I am very happy to announce that tomorrow I will see another step in the Gateway Upgrade Project being completed, with another length of road being upgraded to six lanes. I am very happy about that. </Hansard-Body>

Any infrastructure project of this size is sure to cause some inconvenience to residents. Some residents who live along the roadworks have been inconvenienced over time and I would like to acknowledge them and thank them for their patience and understanding as this has gone on. However, there are a number of areas alongside the Gateway where I have sponsored petitions by residents who have asked the minister to look at increasing some of the noise barriers to assist them with reducing the noise impact from the upgraded Gateway. I am very happy to say that the minister has come out a number of times--and I thank him for that--and has met with the residents. We are having ongoing talks with Main Roads and the Gateway Upgrade Project team to try to fix that.</Hansard-Body>

One of the issues that has been raised is the LA68 standard that we use. The LA68 standard is a measurement of noise over time. Whilst I understand it is an internationally recognised level, I have some concerns about measuring noise over a period of time. The fact is that it is measured over an 18-hour period in a day. Whilst that background noise has been reduced--particularly by the asphalt which has been laid and which has reduced the noise by three decibels--the residents are concerned about the fact that the noise is measured over time. Under the LA68 system, if I came into your room and rang a bell every 10 minutes for six hours, the noise averaged out over 18 hours would be perfectly fine, but we all know that we would be very tired. </Hansard-Body>

The noise of a bell is obviously not happening, but what is happening along the Gateway Bridge is that there is significant noise from exhaust brakes from heavy vehicles throughout the night. The main issue that has been raised with me is what we can do to try to reduce that. I have spoken to the minister on behalf of the residents of the Chatsworth electorate and I have asked him to talk to the heavy vehicle industry and try to find some way to reduce the noises coming from the heavy vehicles which are using the Gateway Arterial so as to improve the quality of life for the residents of Chatsworth. </Hansard-Body>
