Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.32 am): People like Rhonda Miller are part of the vital pulse of our capital city. Rhonda is part of a team of close to 5,000 people who work within what amounts to a small city within our city--the Princess Alexandra Hospital--at a time when the great majority of us are tucked up in our beds with work the furthest thing from our minds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998492"></A>
Rhonda is a wards person working the graveyard shift at the PA, and has been doing so for close to 30 years. Last Thursday night I clocked on with Rhonda for her 11 pm to 7 am shift, as we commenced our government’s new program, ‘Walk a day in my shoes’, which will give each and every one of us on this side of the House the opportunity to connect with working people within our individual communities by actually going to work with them and performing their jobs alongside them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998578"></A>
This is not a program that simply involves tagging along and observing; it is a program that involves getting down in the trenches and doing the jobs that millions of Queenslanders undertake each and every day, as I found out last Thursday. This is about going to the coalface and carrying out those jobs that keep our cities and our towns and our regional communities moving along--those critical jobs that are often the unseen lifeblood of those communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998660"></A>
Over the coming months people can expect to see our government’s ministers and members getting out and about performing a variety of these jobs. They will see them walk a day in the shoes of shop assistants, abattoir workers, restaurant waiters, teachers aides, roadside traffic controllers--across the gamut of workplaces that they intend to visit. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998721"></A>
Not only was it a fascinating and eye-opening experience to walk a night in the shoes of Rhonda Miller, it was also a privilege. There is nothing quite so valuable as experience, and Rhonda has it in spades. As I said, she has worked at the PA for 28 years as a wardie and it shows. It shows not only in the fact that she knows every inch of this major hospital--and indeed seems to be on first name terms with most of its staff members--but it shows in the dignified, caring, dedicated way in which she goes about what can be at times a difficult and confronting job. Rhonda and her work partner, Mark, do the rounds of the hospital in the emergency department, intensive care as well as the PA’s rehabilitation wards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998870"></A>
As I worked alongside them last Thursday night I quickly came to realise how hardworking this pair and their colleagues are and how hard their work can be. I also came away with a renewed appreciation for people like Rhonda and Mark and their team who keep public facilities like the PA working around the clock while the city around them sleeps. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998934"></A>
I also had the opportunity to talk with nurses, doctors and other hospital staff. We talked about the tough issues like payroll and asset sales but we also chewed the fat about general issues of life such as the Titans football team and adult children living at home.

Our government’s ministers and members will be walking a day in the shoes of Queensland workers across the state over coming months. I expect to undertake my next opportunity alongside a Queensland worker before the end of the month. As I said when I announced this program, I know there will be cynics and knockers. It is my experience in life that you always learn something when you take the time to walk in the shoes of another person. </Hansard-Body>

(9.36 am): She is without question an international superstar whose influence is such that with a single endorsement she is able to turn books into bestsellers, films into box office blockbusters and help people choose a holiday destination. So it is huge news today that Oprah Winfrey has announced that she will bring her internationally syndicated television show Down Under. I am pleased to advise the House that she will visit Queensland to film a separate television special that is destined to reach literally hundreds of millions of viewers across the globe.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999136"></A>
This is all thanks to a unique partnership between <Hansard-Italic>
The Oprah Winfrey Show </Hansard-Italic>
and Tourism Australia and Tourism Queensland. It will involve the talk show host staging her show from the Sydney Opera House and visiting Queensland as part of an Australian special--Oprah’s Ultimate Australian Adventure.This is a phenomenal opportunity for Queensland--an opportunity to show millions why we are arguably the best holiday destination on the globe. As our crucial tourism industry continues to claw its way back in the fallout of the global financial crisis, this is an opportunity for a massive boost in international visitors to our state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999160"></A>
This project began last year when Ben Southall--the winner of our phenomenally successful Best Job in the World competition--appeared on <Hansard-Italic>
The Oprah Winfrey Show</Hansard-Italic>
 in a live cross from the Great Barrier Reef. Ben spoke about his Queensland adventures and invited Oprah and her viewers to come and visit. We are thrilled that Oprah Winfrey has taken up the invitation to visit Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999175"></A>
Regardless of the future benefits that Oprah Winfrey’s international broadcast will bring, her visit will be in itself a big boost for our tourism industry. Ms Winfrey will bring 300 of her most loyal viewers on her eight-day, seven-night trip to Australia, including Queensland. The details are yet to be finalised, but the Queensland episode is likely to be filmed in Cairns and on the Great Barrier Reef. In fact during Ms Winfrey’s promotion of this project on her show yesterday she featured footage of the Great Barrier Reef. That is now showing on the <Hansard-Italic>
Today</Hansard-Italic>
 program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999186"></A>
 <Hansard-Italic>
The Oprah Winfrey Show</Hansard-Italic>
 is seen by more than 40 million US viewers every single week. It is broadcast in 145 other countries, picking up many tens of millions more. Additionally, Oprah Winfrey has 2.3 million Facebook fans and holds the No. 8 ranking on Twitter worldwide, with 4.1 million followers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000655"></A>
Once details are confirmed, Tourism Queensland will work with Tourism Australia and other partners to develop Queensland packages that mirror the destinations and experiences featured in the show so that viewers can have their own Oprah Queensland experience and adventure. As I mentioned, Oprah Winfrey with such innovations as her Oprah’s Book Club has the capacity to influence what people read, what they pay to see at the cinemas and where they choose to go on holiday. Her enormous influence and reach across the globe is a great shot in the arm to our tourism industry, particularly in Far North Queensland, when it needs it most. I congratulate everybody, particularly Tourism Queensland and the Minister for Tourism, Peter Lawlor, for their involvement in pulling off this major logistical exercise. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.40 am): The impact of asbestos on the lives of Queenslanders living with asbestos related disease is both painful and, for many, devastating. Asbestos and mesothelioma are diseases that are on the rise nation-wide and, on current estimates, are unlikely to peak until 2020. As many members of the House will be aware, mesothelioma, for example, can carry between a 10- and 70-year lag time and on average will not manifest itself until 40 or 50 years after contact with the asbestos product. In the 10-year period from 1998 to 2008 over 1,000 Australians were hospitalised with asbestos, and the rate of diagnosis continues to grow. In the last two decades the rate of Queenslanders diagnosed with mesothelioma has almost tripled. That is why I am very pleased to announce today that our government has approved through the Minister for Health an allocation of $533,000 in funding over the next three years to the Queensland Asbestos Related Disease Support Society.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001981"></A>
This funding through Queensland Health will enable the society to employ a full-time social worker and two support workers to provide a level of service continuity and support to people who are affected by these diseases and their families. I am sure many members on both sides of the House will be aware of the very good work that is done by the Queensland Asbestos Related Disease Support Society. It is a not-for-profit organisation founded in 1992 to support people affected by asbestos related diseases and their families. The society has for nearly two decades provided support to hundreds of people and the more than a thousand members who rely on it. Sadly, since its founding year, more than 300 members have died from asbestos related disease, but for every one of those members the support provided by the society has been invaluable. This society helps its members feel less socially isolated and offers emotional support as members deal with common issues like ensuring a future for their wives, their husbands and their children while they battle with conditions which are both life limiting and terminal.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001983"></A>
It is our hope that this funding will enable this great organisation to expand the great work that it does and the support that it provides to asbestos disease sufferers throughout Queensland. I would like to acknowledge the many volunteers who work for the society, but in particular I note the great work and leadership of Helen and Ray Colbert, the president and secretary of the association, who I am reliably informed are one of the finest husband and wife leadership teams Queensland has. I also want to particularly thank and acknowledge the member for Bulimba, Di Farmer, and the member for Waterford, Evan Moorhead, who have championed the work of the society and advocated on behalf of its members for this support to continue to provide the important services it delivers. Well done! It is the support provided by people like the dedicated volunteers at the Queensland Asbestos Related Disease Support Society that fosters the optimism that Queenslanders carry with them each and every day. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.43 am): It is with delight that I congratulate the Gold Coast Titans on winning their first finals series game in what can only be described as a physically and emotionally tough encounter in front of a packed Skilled Park last Friday night. The Titans will now host a preliminary final at Suncorp Stadium on Friday, 24 September. Titans fans travelling from the Gold Coast for the game will be able to catch one of three additional express services scheduled specifically for the game. Two additional services will leave Varsity Lakes at 4.30 pm and 5.15 and run express from Beenleigh to Milton and an additional service will leave Varsity Lakes at 5.45 and run express from Robina to Milton. All other scheduled Friday evening trains will run as normal on the night and there will be three additional return services back to the Gold Coast after the game.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001995"></A>
This is a significant boost to the Gold Coast to Brisbane service, and for game fans we hope it will make all the difference in getting to the stadium on time. Queensland Rail will be showing its support for this great Queensland team by decorating the trains’ interiors in Titans colours and I encourage all Gold Coast fans to come to the match and of course to get on board and come by Queensland Rail. I urge all Queenslanders, no matter what team they generally support, to get behind the Titans for this historic match. As that great Broncos supporter the Treasurer of Queensland said to me, ‘We’re all September Titans now.’ As we have seen with previous Broncos premierships and regular State of Origin games, when Queensland gets behind a team we give them the competitive advantage on the field. There is nothing like a hometown crowd to spur a team on and get them over the line, and that is what we all look forward to on 24 September. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1002011"></A>
Last week I had the opportunity to visit both the Fraser Coast and Sunshine Coast to announce a boost in services and a more localised focus in the delivery of services. In November last year I committed to a review of Fraser Coast health services. This review confirmed that the Fraser Coast’s rapidly growing and ageing population means renal services are a core priority for the community. This issue was first highlighted by the member for Maryborough, and I thank him for his continued advocacy on behalf of his community. I gave my commitment to have a snapshot review into services, particularly at Maryborough Hospital.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002012"></A>
There has been a lot of scaremongering around the future of Maryborough Hospital. I have put it on the record before and let me put it on the record again: the Maryborough Hospital has a solid future on the Fraser Coast. That is why last Friday I was pleased to announce a new $3 million satellite renal unit at Maryborough Hospital. This will deliver a six-chair renal unit to the Maryborough Hospital and means that Fraser Coast residents will be able to receive their dialysis at Maryborough or Hervey Bay hospitals from mid next year. Further, I was pleased to announce that Maryborough Hospital will become the centre for first-class rehabilitation and subacute care. A new $1.8 million, 22-bed rehabilitation unit at Maryborough Hospital will not only provide first-class services for those patients requiring care but will also free up acute beds at Maryborough and Hervey Bay hospitals for patients who need an acute bed in hospital.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002015"></A>
This was further reinforced through the review, which outlined Hervey Bay Hospital would continue to provide the majority of acute services for the Fraser Coast while Maryborough Hospital will be developed and enhanced to provide the majority of elective day surgery and become a rehabilitation hub. This means some services, such as the intensive care unit, maternity services, paediatrics and neonatal care, will continue to function from Hervey Bay Hospital and it means the Maryborough Hospital has a very important future in the development of safe and sustainable health services on the Fraser Coast. Today you would not build two hospitals there, but they are there. Taxpayers’ dollars are tied up in them and I want to give them both a meaningful role. The review also highlights the development of a new $8 million, 13-chair oral health facility to be built near the Hervey Bay Hospital, more than doubling the capacity of the current six-chair facility. There is also the $4.27 million pathology lab planned for the Hervey Bay Hospital which is expected to be completed mid-2011.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002016"></A>
As part of my visit I was also pleased to announce that from 1 November this year the Sunshine Coast and Wide Bay health service districts will commence operation as individual districts--a further sign of our commitment to regional Queenslanders. These will be locally run by a CEO and senior clinicians who will be solely focused on local Sunshine Coast and Wide Bay health services. No longer will these growing regions have to share a district CEO. I am pleased that Sunshine Coast-Wide Bay CEO Kevin Hegarty will stay on as CEO for the Sunshine Coast. Mr Hegarty’s focus will now be on driving the expansion of health services on the Sunshine Coast and the new $1.97 billion Sunshine Coast University Hospital in one of Queensland’s fastest growing regions. It also means our Wide-Bay CEO, whom we are in the process of recruiting, will be able to focus on the expansion of health services in Wide-Bay--for example, the $45 million Bundaberg Hospital expansion and the new services at Maryborough. What is more, the new district structure matches our and federal Labor’s commitment to localising health service delivery. The Hervey Bay and Maryborough hospitals--half an hour apart--work closely to provide the community with a broad spectrum of care for a growing and ageing population.</Hansard-Body>

Queensland is the most decentralised state in Australia. We have over 150 hospitals spread across an area six times the size of Victoria. The importance of our hospitals working together as networks to ensure that all Queenslanders have access to high-level health care cannot be understated. That is why initiatives such as the national broadband network are so important--to ensure that we can continue to provide our nation-leading telehealth program. As well, investing in training more rural and regional specialists and GPs and investing in rural and regional hospitals is vital because, more than any other state, Queensland is a story of regions. That is why the Bligh government is committed to securing their future. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (9.49 am): At the last election we said we stood for building a stronger economy and creating Queensland jobs. We stood up for jobs, not job cuts, and that is exactly what we are delivering. The ABS labour force data for August, released last Thursday, showed job creation in Queensland for the 13th straight month. We are now more than halfway towards meeting our commitment to delivering 100,000 net new jobs and we are still less than halfway through the term. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002059"></A>
However, it should not go unnoticed that the August figures reveal a more subdued labour market than in recent months. This softness, however, remains in line with Treasury’s budget forecast of a year-average unemployment rate for 2010-11 of 5  per cent. In those figures is a message that we must not turn away from: that the recovery is not complete and that the challenges still remain. It is a reality other economies are experiencing. Over the weekend the OECD forecast that growth across the G7 would slow down to 1.5 per cent in annualised terms for the second half of the year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002060"></A>
The resilience of the Australian economy, and Queensland within it, continues to defy the forces crippling other developed economies. That does not mean that we should down tools and stop working to protect the jobs of those in the workforce and create new ones for those who are trying to break into the workforce. Our plan is to build a stronger economy and deliver jobs, just like we said we would. However, critical to our economic plan is delivering our reforms of the state’s balance sheet. That process is well underway.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002061"></A>
In June this year, the government completed the Forestry Plantations Queensland transaction at value for $603 million. We are in the binding bids phase for the Port of Brisbane, where a number of consortia are in the data room and we are on track to complete by the end of the year. Preparations for the initial public offering of QR National remain on track. The government is in a position to begin preregistration by the end of the month, paving the way for a float later this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002062"></A>
The public float of a vertically integrated QR National has long been the government’s preferred sale model. Providing for an integrated above-rail and below-rail company--keeping the coal track with the trains--will build a stronger, more efficient and truly great national company headquartered here in Queensland. It is the best result for the workers who helped build QR--a strong company with a strong balance sheet to grow into the future. The listed QR National will hold a lease for 2,300 kilometres of coal track, with 7,800 kilometres of the track, including the suburban network, the regional network and the north coast line all remaining in the publicly owned Queensland Rail. QR National will obviously utilise the north coast line between Rockhampton and Gladstone under arrangement with the publicly owned Queensland Rail, which will see it responsible for the maintenance and upgrades of this part of the network. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002063"></A>
Vertical integration--keeping the tracks with the trains--is the model pursued by the class 1 railways of North America. It is the model that is utilised by many of the world’s largest resource companies both around the world and in other parts of Australia. QR has been a vertically integrated company throughout its history and, in this next chapter of its future, will continue as a vertically integrated entity.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002064"></A>
I acknowledge that some do not support integration. Members will recall that in May a group of coal companies sent the government a letter which outlined an unsolicited, non-binding offer to purchase the Central Queensland coal network, that is, the coal tracks. The government said that it would engage with the coal companies constructively and in a genuine process. That is exactly what we did and that is exactly what the coal companies have acknowledged, both on the public record and in my subsequent discussions with them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002065"></A>
Between May and September, the state spent a significant amount of time and resources working with the consortium. For the record of the House, in July the state and the consortium agreed on a deadline of 31 August for the consortium to lodge a non-conditional, binding bid for the tracks. The state subsequently agreed to extend that deadline to 10 September at the request of the coal company group. This included a month of due diligence, in which the state formally answered over 350 questions put to it by the consortium in the data room. For the record of the House, on 9 September the consortium chairman, Mr Nick Greiner, telephoned me to advise that the consortium was not in a position to lodge a binding bid. The issues around the position of the consortium are now a matter of public record. The government and industry have reconfirmed their commitment to an open, competitive and efficient export supply chain from mine to port. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002067"></A>
Improving operational and investment efficiency is good for our mining companies, good for jobs in regional Queensland and good for the state’s and, indeed, the nation’s economy. Our plan remains exactly the same: reforms to the balance sheet, restoring our fiscal position and building a recovery--jobs, not job cuts, just like we said we would. </Hansard-Body>

Christmas-New Year Penalty Rates</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002070"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (9.53 am): The Christmas-New Year period is a special time of the year, with a number of public holidays allowing families to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ and to spend valuable time together. The importance of this period to families is reflected in the penalty rates that apply in many occupations. For the inconvenience of being separated from their families, particularly on Christmas Day, workers have been eligible to receive extra financial reward through penalty rates. But in the past this benefit has been denied to workers when Christmas Day and New Year’s Day have fallen on a Saturday. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002071"></A>
The Bligh Government is moving to right this wrong and will introduce legislation today to ensure that Queenslanders working on these special days and who are required to be away from their families will get the penalty rates that they deserve. The only person likely to object to workers being paid their proper entitlements on Christmas Day would be Ebenezer Scrooge himself. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002073"></A>
The Holidays Amendment Bill 2010 will allow the government to declare extra public holidays on Christmas Day this year and New Year’s Day 2011. In adopting this position, the Queensland government will ensure that Queensland workers will be treated the same as their counterparts interstate. Workers in New South Wales and Western Australia already have this entitlement for Christmas Day 2010 while workers in New South Wales, Western Australia and Victoria will receive it on New Year’s Day 2011.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002074"></A>
This move is good news for those seven-day occupations where workers have to work over the Christmas-New Year period. This includes many health workers, firefighters and ambulance officers who sacrifice so much of their family lives for their communities. These changes will also benefit the hotel and hospitality workers who work at numerous Christmas Day functions throughout the state, bus and train drivers who provide public transport, staff at fast-food outlets and even workers at suburban medical centres. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002075"></A>
In a busy world, when so many people are trying to balance work and family commitments, it is important to ensure that families are given the opportunity to spend important occasions such as Christmas Day and New Year’s Day together. This decision, which has been well received by the unions and Queensland workers, corrects a substantial inequity in our public holiday regime and ensures that workers in Queensland will have the same entitlements as their interstate counterparts over the Christmas-New Year holiday period. </Hansard-Body>

 Mr Turner is recommending that home builders employ unlicensed tradespeople and he is encouraging unlicensed tradespeople to accept work and break the law--and endorsed again by the member for Burnett on his program.

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002139"></A>
Mr Turner is putting his listeners in a potentially ruinous financial situation. Homeowners who use an unlicensed contractor have no idea of the contractor’s qualifications, experience and financial stability. They have no way of checking the contractor’s work history and, more importantly, they cannot benefit from the BSA Home Warranty Insurance Scheme which is the best scheme of its type in Australia and, as far as I am concerned, in the world. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that endorsement from both sides of the parliament. I particularly want to thank the shadow minister who went on that program recently and did not agree with those sentiments at all or the sentiments of Mr Turner in calling the BSA corrupt. In Queensland anyone doing building work worth $3,300 or more is breaking the law if they are not appropriately licensed by the BSA. I have written to 4BC requesting that it repudiate Mr Turner’s very reckless and unprofessional comments of 4 August. I note that builders in Queensland advertise on 4BC and I would suggest to builders that they review their advertising package in light of what 4BC seems to have as its official policy, which is that unlicensed builders are the best people to deal with in Queensland. If I was a licensed builder I certainly would not be advertising on 4BC. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002142"></A>
I have also demanded that Mr Turner set the record straight and apologise to homeowners, tradespeople and the BSA. The BSA takes the job of protecting homeowners very seriously. I am, and I know the shadow minister is, cooperating with the inquiry being undertaken by KPMG. Every piece of legislation in this parliament dealing with building regulation has enjoyed bipartisan support. Of course, we can always do better. That is why we are having a review. To suggest that people not deal with a licensed contractor is brainless and highly dangerous to the economy of Queensland and to the building industry as well. I call on Mr Turner and his mate Nick Newton, who apparently is a licensed builder, to apologise to people they have put on the wrong track. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (10.01 am): The Bligh government is building on its commitment to make Queensland the greenfield exploration capital of Australia by 2020. That is why the Bligh government is focused on the future as we continue to provide tangible support to the resource industry and to their exploration efforts. We are investing $18 million through our Greenfields 2020 program to encourage exploration in frontier and under-explored regions of the state. We are also investing $12.5 million in streamlining initiatives to help industry projects through government approval and regulatory processes and a further $10.7 million on upgrading tenure management systems. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002147"></A>
These initiatives have produced extraordinary results. I am pleased to report today that during 2009-10 Queensland attracted a record exploration investment of $917.1 million. That is a massive 43 per cent increase on the 2008-09 figure of $639.9 million. Exploration expenditure in the minerals sector, including coal, increased 24 per cent from $351.7 million to $436.6 million in 2009-10. It is interesting to note that Queensland’s mineral exploration expenditure was greater than the combined total of $402 million invested in New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. During 2009-10 Queensland’s petroleum and gas exploration investment jumped 66 per cent from $288.2 million in 2008-09 to $480.5 million. This represents 60 per cent of the total Australian onshore petroleum expenditure and clearly reflects the intense exploration activity in the search for coal seam gas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002148"></A>
Queensland’s performance clearly shows that the exploration industry recognises our potential for further mineral and energy discoveries and underpins our reputation as an attractive exploration investment destination. It also reflects the outstanding success of the Bligh government’s $49 million Smart Mining--Future Prosperity and Smart Exploration programs. In fact, exploration expenditure in Queensland during the life of these programs increased from $244 million in 2004 to the present $917 million. That well and truly delivers on our 2006 election commitment to double exploration expenditure to $540 million by 2009. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002149"></A>
A healthy exploration sector means a healthy economy, regional development and, most importantly, jobs. Strong and resilient mining and energy sectors are the backbone of jobs creation and Queensland’s ongoing economic prosperity. Mines have finite lifespans and the government is focused on the future as we rise to the challenge of unearthing new mineral and energy deposits that will deliver new projects and jobs to replace existing mines as they close. Put simply, today’s exploration means tomorrow’s mines and jobs. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.04 am): Over the past 18 months the Bligh government has taken real action to invest in Queensland’s future and safeguard our state against the impacts of climate change. Our primary producers in rural Queensland are on the front line of our response to climate change and that is why we have been working closely with them to implement more sustainable industry practices and protect our environment. We know it takes innovative solutions to combat the challenges of climate change and that is why we are delivering substantial funding to help landholders implement such solutions through the Rural Water Use Efficiency Initiative. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002153"></A>
Today I am pleased to announce the recipients of the next round of $4.5 million in funding under this program. This funding will help irrigators in rural Queensland improve on water conservation and energy efficiency and prepare for the challenges that lie ahead. Peak industry groups working closely with irrigators will be sharing in this funding, with grants awarded to Queensland Dairy Farmers, Growcom, Canegrowers, the cotton industry, Nursery and Garden Industry Queensland, Queensland Turf Producers Association and the Flower Association of Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002154"></A>
I am advised that through the first four years of this program we have delivered savings of 150,000 megalitres of water a year and achieved $280 million in improved profitability in irrigated agriculture. We want to see these results continue, particularly in the area of energy efficiency, which is why we are extending this program to 2013. Peak bodies receiving funding will be able to directly assist farmers through workshops and programs, providing practical information on the ground with new technologies that they can introduce onto their properties to save money, energy and water. Grants of between $290,000 and $1.7 million will be provided to the groups so they can deliver this assistance on the ground. Irrigators taking part in the program will be able to improve their water efficiency by up to 10 per cent and energy efficiency by up to 20 per cent.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002155"></A>
This initiative is a vital component of the Bligh government’s climate change strategy, ClimateQ: Toward a Greener Queensland. We developed this strategy because we know Queensland needs a plan for the future, one that addresses the modern challenges that our state faces. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. GJ WILSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.06 am): NAPLAN results are one of the many tools used to assess the educational progress of young Queenslanders. I am pleased to advise the House that this year’s test results show that Queensland is continuing to close the gap between other states. NAPLAN is a diagnostic tool that allows parents, teachers and government to ensure students and schools are being supported where they need it most. There has never been a level playing field when it comes to education in Australia. Every state and territory is taught differently with different curriculum and deals with state-specific educational issues and challenges. The Labor government is, however, committed to fixing this on a state and national level.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002159"></A>
The Gillard Labor government is doing what the Howard Liberal National Party government put in the too-hard basket for more than a decade: introducing a national curriculum. On a state level, the Bligh Labor government has delivered more than 6,000 extra teachers over the last 10 years, it is investing more than $10 million a day with the federal government in new school infrastructure, it is delivering $320 million in up to 240 new kindergarten services throughout Queensland over the next five years and it is supporting early childhood literacy through programs such as Books for Bubs and Queensland Ready Readers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002160"></A>
I was extremely disappointed to see the member for Surfers Paradise had not reviewed the NAPLAN data when he promptly fronted the media attacking teachers and parents last Friday. If he had read the data he would have congratulated teachers for helping ensure Queensland students were improving at a faster rate than any other state in Australia. I will repeat that: if he had read the data he would have congratulated teachers for helping ensure Queensland students were improving at a faster rate than any other state in Australia. He would also have acknowledged that every state is achieving an average of 90 per cent of students at or above the national benchmark including Queensland. But he cannot even cobble together an education policy so why should we be surprised. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002161"></A>
Many members here today received an education in Queensland private and state schools from our many wonderful and hardworking teachers. I ask the member for Surfers Paradise to shelve his dislike for Queensland state schools and teachers, join the quiet revolution and celebrate the great work that is being done by our students and teachers throughout all of Queensland. Through our world-leading education reforms, the Bligh government is giving every young Queenslander a flying start to learning and life. </Hansard-Body>

Innisfail, Work Camp</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<A ID="pgfId-1004024"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (10.09 am): During the last parliamentary sitting, the member for Mulgrave drew to my attention serious allegations of inappropriate behaviour at the Innisfail work camp. The allegations were made through local media outlets by a former inmate of Queensland Corrective Services. Queensland Corrective Services responded swiftly to these allegations by temporarily closing the work camp and returning all prisoners to the high-security prison at Lotus Glen. The Chief Inspector of Prisons immediately commenced an investigation into the allegations and I am pleased to inform the House of its preliminary findings. To date, the investigation has not found any evidence to support the allegations of serious misconduct or criminal activity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004026"></A>
One allegation was that prisoners at the camp were using illegal drugs. Queensland Corrective Services testing reveals that, of the 154 urine tests and 252 breath tests carried out at Innisfail work camp since 1 July 2009, all returned a negative reading. Additionally, and following the temporary closure of the camp, a search of the work camp site was undertaken by the QCS Dog Squad and no prohibited items were found. Another allegation suggested that prisoners were unsupervised when doing their weekly shopping and on ‘outings’ and when driving the prison bus. The investigation to date has found that weekly shopping and outings have been undertaken under the supervision of QCS officers and that the work camp bus is driven by the camp supervisor.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004029"></A>
The investigation has also found that offenders do not have access to pay TV and nor do they order in pizza from an external pizza company, as was claimed. Despite these preliminary findings, the Innisfail work camp will remain temporarily closed pending the final outcome of the Chief Inspector’s report of the investigation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004030"></A>
Prison work camps are an important element of Queensland Corrective Services’s endeavours to rehabilitate offenders and they also make a valuable contribution to many Queensland communities. Last financial year, work camps contributed around $2.2 million worth of labour to regional communities through the performance of more than 110,000 hours of community service. It is important, however, that these work camps are appropriately managed and that the community has confidence in the security measures and management provided by Queensland Corrective Services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004031"></A>
All of the allegations made in relation to the Innisfail work camp will be thoroughly investigated and the camp will not reopen until QCS is confident that it has addressed any matters which require attention. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. TS MULHERIN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland) (10.11 am): Today I am pleased to announce the membership of the new Australian Agricultural College Corporation Board. The AACC board consists of an impressive membership of appointees who will lead the corporation into the 21st century by providing agricultural career paths in the bush. The high calibre of appointees whom the board has attracted is an example of how important education and training in regional and rural Queensland is to the Bligh government. This is representative of the Australian Agricultural College reforms, which we announced in April, coming to fruition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004036"></A>
By expanding the delivery sites of the college from five to 14, we responded to industry and training needs in rural Queensland to be able to provide the skills and education needed for the future growth in primary industries. The announcement of a state-wide corporation board will secure the financial and strategic direction of the colleges into the future. The state-wide board will also be provided with on-the-ground local understanding of issues affecting producers from industry advisory committees.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004037"></A>
The board appointees bring a wide range of expertise, including finance and banking, links to academia and rural training networks and research and development experience in grains, beef, cotton and sugar. Chair of the AACC board, Graham Hart is the former Chief Executive officer of the Bank of Queensland and has solid agricultural and business networks. Deputy Chair Mary Corbett brings high-level strategic experience in the agricultural sector and has practical educational experience in cotton and sugar research and development. Mr Chris Bazley brings solid industry networks and important linkages to the University of Queensland Gatton campus. Ms Prudence Bonfield has extensive experience in the role of training employers and employees. Mrs Sharyn Gordon is currently the State General Manager, Regional Queensland of Westpac Banking Corporation and in this role spends a significant portion of her time in rural communities across Queensland. Ms Jo Sheppard is currently Mayor of Paroo shire and through her work as a rural consultant has great networks in training and rural industries. Mr Michael Smith has experience in running large and complex agricultural enterprises through his role as General Manager, Bundaberg Farms, Bundaberg Sugar Limited. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004045"></A>
It is an impressive board and the successful candidates will provide excellent leadership for the college to provide relevant agricultural training and education into the 21st century. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. D BOYLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships) (10.14 am): These are difficult times for local government--facing growth pressures, rolling out infrastructure, implementing higher standards of financial management and suffering impacts from the global financial crisis. As the saying goes, when the going gets tough, the tough get going, and I have to say that this applies to Queensland’s councils. In these tough times councils are innovating.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127808"></A>
One example of this is at the Torres Strait Island Regional Council, which had arguably the most difficult amalgamation of all. Fifteen island councils, spread over a huge ocean landscape remote from the centres of power, have combined into one. The TSIRC under the leadership of Mayor Fred Gela has embraced the opportunities of information and communications technology for his council and for the benefit of the people of the Torres Strait. Bringing faster broadband services to the Torres Strait is a major project, with council signing a contract with Telstra to build high-capacity microwave links and upgrade exchanges. My department is providing $3 million in already allocated funding to support council’s new ICT platform. The benefits of information technology for remote communities, separated by sea at the northernmost points of Australia, are nowhere near as important as they are there.</Hansard-Body>

 De-amalgamate the Torres Strait. That is the scandal of your policy. Members would guess, too, at how difficult it is in these geographic circumstances--and how costly for the council--to hold full council meetings every month. Today I am pleased to announce that I have signed off on the TSIRC’s request for permission to hold some council meetings by videoconference and teleconference. Some flexibility in the meeting requirements along with innovative use of videoconferencing and internet streaming is to be allowed in the interests of improving the council’s accessibility for all Torres Strait Islanders and at the same time generating significant savings to the council budget. While council has been rotating meetings between islands to share the load and give residents better representation, the costs of boats, flights and accommodation for meetings is in the order of $50,000 per meeting. How amazing it will be for the proceedings of the TSIRC meetings to instead be available in real time over the internet.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004053"></A>
I pass on my congratulations to the council. This has been made possible by the contribution of the Bligh government and we can surely claim that this is a great example of innovation in the Smart State. </Hansard-Body>

Mr Speaker, as you know, it is a well-established practice in the Westminster system of government for similar bills to be dealt with as a cognate debate. It is also an efficient way of managing the business of the House. That is why I have moved this motion today.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004071"></A>
The Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill, the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill and the Public Interest Disclosure Bill implement the second stage of legislative reform as outlined in the November 2009 Response to Integrity and accountability in Queensland. The government has committed to implementing these reforms by mid 2010 and remains committed to the timely implementation of these reforms.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004072"></A>
These integrity reform bills implement a comprehensive package to strengthen Queensland’s integrity and accountability framework. The bills implement significant improvements to the public sector employment and management framework, including establishing a new, discrete framework for the employment of ministerial and opposition staff; reforming the ethical principles which apply to public sector employees; and further extending the post-separation disciplinary regime across the public service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004073"></A>
The bills also modernise and enhance Queensland’s legislative framework to support a strong ethical culture by providing protection for those in the public sector who do the right thing and stand up to wrongdoing. Together, these bills implement a coordinated program of reform that ensures that Queensland has a robust integrity system supported by a public sector culture that emphasises strong leadership and a conscious dedication to ethical values. The three bills deal with related issues and have been developed simultaneously to facilitate a coordinated transition to the significantly improved public sector governance framework that the government committed to implement through its integrity reform process. </Hansard-Body>

 (Callide--LNP) (10.18 am): The opposition is always cautious about cognate debates in this House, especially in a case such as this where it is proposed to debate cognately three separate pieces of legislation. However, the opposition has looked closely at the three bills. We have considered the proposition just outlined by the Leader of the House that the bills taken together constitute a program of reform that the government wishes to implement. Given that the cognate debate will allow each of the bills to be considered at the end of the second reading debate through a separate question, we have concluded that this is an appropriate move to facilitate the business of the House. We will be supporting the government’s motion for a cognate debate on these bills. </Hansard-Body>

 (Burnett--Ind) (10.19 am): I strongly oppose the motion before the parliament to debate cognately these three pieces of legislation. With a unicameral parliament, that is, no upper house, structurally Queensland has the least accountable government in Australia. Practically speaking, we have the most unpopular government in Australia. The main reason for that, apart from a crying lack of talent from those opposite and it appears from those on this side as well, is because there has not been a chance to properly scrutinise or consider government decision making and legislation. Ironically, the government is presenting as a legislative package bills that will allegedly strengthen integrity reform, but is doing so in a manner that fundamentally undermines the principle of integrity. Each of these bills deserves to be debated separately. </Hansard-Body>

 I question why these bills have to be rushed through this parliament in a cognate debate. If we do not have enough hours of parliament, let us increase the number of days that parliament sits. Let us work on Fridays, instead of finishing parliament on Thursdays. Making this a cognate debate is nothing more than a half-smart political trick designed to reduce the speaking list and, therefore, reduce the amount of time that the Premier has to spend in this chamber.</Hansard-Body>

Yesterday when I looked at the daily <Hansard-Italic>

 this legislation was ranked fourth, fifth and sixth behind disaster management, building and education legislation. This government is saying that education and training are not as important as the ability of the Premier to hire ministerial staffers. I think differently. Disaster management legislation should be completed before ministerial and other staff bills. Cyclone season is fast approaching. The sooner disaster management plans are in place, the sooner children, women, the sick, elderly and disabled will be better protected. I oppose this government motion. I urge the LNP to show some courage, fight for regional and rural constituents and grow a backbone. I urge them to stop being Labor light and oppose this political bullyboy. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind) (10.22 am): I join the member for Burnett in opposing the cognating of these three bills. In my view, these are three separate bills that deal with separate subject matters. One bill deals with the employment of ministerial staff, members of the opposition staff and members of the crossbenches staff. There are totally different terms of reference in terms of employment. Another bill extends disciplinary proceedings to public servants. Certainly I have had recent experience with public servants who have been dealt with very assertively by middle management to the extent that I believe that some middle managers are--to use the topical word--bullying junior staff. I believe that the three bills deal with separate matters. It is worthwhile that the parliament debates the three bills separately. </Hansard-Body>

As the Leader of the House has suggested in the past, in this place there is a lot of hot air, repetition and irrelevance. Given the significance of the need for integrity reform, in this place speeches are far too long. If we shortened them through parliamentary reform, we could deal with these pieces of legislation one at a time. I will oppose this motion. I hope that the opposition can slow the legislation down, because in Queensland people need less regulation and more innovation. We need to look at these pieces of legislation one at a time and give them the warranted time that they need to ensure that the best decisions are made in relation to these bills. </Hansard-Body>

 Credit where it is due, Mr Speaker. As a result of this new level of cooperation, we have not had to guillotine debates and we have had some sensible sitting hours. People have still been able to participate in debates. The fact that today the opposition is taking this sensible course of action in supporting the cognating of the three bills shows that we can work together to make sure that the parliament works very effectively. It is very disappointing to see that the Independents do not want to work with the rest of us to make this parliament work effectively. In fact, I have to say that sometimes the attendance in this parliament of some members of the Independent team is quite ordinary, particularly late at night and on Thursday afternoons, when the rest us are here, sometimes into the late hours of the night, debating and voting on bills. I will not take up too much of the time of the House today. I am happy to conclude there. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.37 am): My first question without notice is to the Premier. I refer to the Premier’s recent state of the state address where she was asked what she would have done differently in relation to Labor’s secret agenda to privatise and sell off assets such as Queensland Rail, our ports, motorways and forests. The Premier claimed that she should have been more ‘upfront’. Will the Premier explain why she and Labor were not upfront with Queenslanders? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004196"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. As I would expect, his question often contains material in it that is simply inaccurate. Our government had no secret agenda. We had a very clear agenda that we took to the last election that the global financial crisis was seriously impacting on our economy and we would have to face some very difficult decisions as we maintained our building program and as we made jobs our No. 1 priority. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004199"></A>
I was invited at the CEDA speech to outline what did I think was the best thing our government had done since the election in 2009. Without hesitation I said that the best thing we had done was maintain our building program, because it delivered on an election commitment. It delivered the jobs that were needed to keep the economy moving at a time when private investment was most sluggish and, most importantly, to keep regional economies moving. You can go to towns like Mackay and cities like Townsville and Cairns and the only cranes you will see on the skyline are there because of government investment, whether it is federal government or state government. It was important. It was one of our biggest election commitments, and we have delivered it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004200"></A>
I was then invited to say what did I think was the worst decision we had made or what would I improve if I had my time again. It is a fool who thinks that they could never learn from experience and go back and, with the value of hindsight, do something differently. I nominated the fact that I thought, because the building program was so obviously and so clearly critical to keeping jobs and keeping the economy moving, I underestimated the attachment that people would feel to some of the assets that we were selling to keep the building program going. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004202"></A>
I have been very upfront about this. If we could go back we would talk to people more about it earlier rather than, for example, put the myths and facts document out at the end of last year, as we did. I make no apologies for being very honest at the CEDA lunch and saying, ‘Could we have done this differently or better? Of course.’ But do I regret for one minute putting our jobs program first? Absolutely not. Do I regret for one minute delivering the biggest building program in the country of any state government? Not for one minute. Do I regret the fact that families are being supported by our building program? Not for one minute. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004204"></A>
This was the right economic strategy. It has been endorsed by every serious economic commentator in the country. It is backed by the credit rating agencies. It stands in stark contrast to those opposite who still have no alternative. They come in here and whinge about it, but they have no alternative--not one alternative economic strategy. Is this a tough one? Yes, it is. Are there easy options out there? No, there are not. So if the Leader of the Opposition wants to talk about an alternative, come on--put it up. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My second question without notice is also to the Premier. Last week the Premier claimed Labor was forced to privatise after the election because before the election she did not know the impact of the global financial crisis on the state’s economic bottom line. Yet on the eve of the state election Labor’s Treasurer released a statement, which I table, which stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1006363"></A>
The full force of the global financial crisis on Queensland was given a price tag of $12 billion. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Not only were we open with the Queensland public about what the global financial crisis was doing to our economy and our budget, we published a budget update. We were the only state to do so. We published an update on the Friday before I called the election and it was in fact the basis and reason I called the election when I did. It was absolutely clear that our budget position was being critically attacked by the global financial crisis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006368"></A>
It is easy to sit here now and feel comfortable about it, as the opposition tries to do, but the world was spiralling downwards. Nobody knew where the bottom would be. Mining companies were laying off 400 and 500 people at a time. Building companies were going to the wall during the election period. </Hansard-Body>

 I take the interjection from the member for Rockhampton. Major companies were dropping workers and workers were losing jobs. It was not this side of politics that stood up and said that we were exaggerating the GFC, that it did not exist, that there was no recession; it was the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Southern Downs. It was not this side of politics that were the deniers of the GFC; it was those opposite. It was the member for Southern Downs. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Then immediately after the election the GFC continued to have an effect not only on Queensland but on Australia. The federal government then published its own budget updates which indicated that the revenue from GST had radically fallen, as we would expect in a serious economic downturn--people stop spending, consumption slows and so consumption taxes like GST similarly slow and drop. What happened? Every state lost GST revenue as a result. Not only did we say before the election that the global financial crisis was causing devastating damage to our budget and our economy, it continued after the election. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006376"></A>
It is the Leader of the Opposition who should be upfront with the people of Queensland about what his economic strategy is. People in Queensland know what our economic strategy is. It is a difficult one, but we are determined to see it through to make a stronger Queensland. What is it that the Leader of the Opposition will do? He arrogantly thinks he does not have to tell people. At least the shadow Treasurer is upfront and open when he says that they are going to reassess the building program. Watch out for the reassessment in your electorate. In every electorate in Queensland every project will be reassessed. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006381"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. As the member will know, it was one of the four planks of our job creation strategy that we would do everything in our power as a government to support new and emerging industries wherever they were found, but we certainly nominated the liquefied natural gas industry and the solar industry as two that we would put effort into. That is exactly what we have done. We have done what we said we would do. We are delivering new industries to Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006382"></A>
I was very pleased that the Deputy Premier could represent the government last week at a signing ceremony of one of the largest trade deals in Australian history. Santos Australia, Petronas, a Malaysian company, and Total, a French company, signed a deal that is worth $100 billion over the next 10 years. This is great news for the Queensland economy and for Queensland jobs. It is great news for regional Queensland. It is great news for cities like Gladstone and Rockhampton and Central Queensland. It is great news for the south-west, with cities like Dalby, Chinchilla, Roma, Toowoomba--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006387"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the Deputy Premier. These are projects that can keep kids in the bush and give those rural families an opportunity for their children to have jobs in the towns and cities that they grew up in and not have to leave. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006388"></A>
This project will deliver more than 6,000 jobs for Queensland by 2014. What it will deliver over the life of the project is a $3 billion boost in royalty revenue--$3 billion from that one contract. Exports of five million tonnes of LNG each year will go to markets in Asia and Europe as a result of this signing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006389"></A>
It means that the new LNG facility at Gladstone--if it does receive federal government tick off--could start construction as early as the first quarter of next year. That means that Santos would then be leading what everyone knows is a race to become the world’s first project to convert coal seam gas to LNG on a large scale out of Gladstone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006390"></A>
We saw the potential and we swung into action more than a year ago. That again stands in stark contrast to those opposite. Last Sunday we saw the member for Condamine being slapped down by the member for Callide over claims that the coal seam gas industry should be scrapped. Then we saw the member for Condamine saying that there should be a moratorium. The member for Callide does not like it. I think he does like having a bit of a stoush with the member for Condamine. The member for Callide is very sensibly recommending reinjecting water into the aquifers. I support him on this. I am pleased to have his support. But he needs to start talking about which one of these is the policy of the opposition. </Hansard-Body>

Our government is determined for Queensland to continue to develop as the powerhouse state of Australia. We have been absolutely clear about our economic strategy.

 After the election we looked at our books. We saw the decline in GST. We made the decision, and there has been nothing from those opposite. They are not upfront with anyone. They have no alternative. They have no vision for the Queensland economy and no plan for the Queensland budget. In fact, every week they come out and say that they want to spend more.</Hansard-Body>

 My question without notice is to the Premier. My electorate has a high proportion of people working in the hospitality and retail industries. Could the Premier update the House on what this government is doing to ensure employees who work on public holidays receive their appropriate entitlements?</Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Speaker. Public holidays are an important part of the cultural life of Australia. There are some public holidays that have additional significance over others, and I do not think there would be any dispute about the very important significance of public holidays for religious observance at Easter, for remembrance on Anzac Day and for the very important role that Christmas Day plays in the lives of Australian families. It is that time of year when many families who do not get an opportunity to see each other at all during the year will travel to see grandparents--that is, they will go out of their way and spend money to be together. It is, in an increasingly busy world, a very important time for families and a very important reason to have a public holiday. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008313"></A>
From time to time, however, public holidays fall at awkward moments, and this year Christmas Day will fall on a Saturday which, under the normal industrial instruments that apply, would mean that workers who are scheduled to work on Christmas Day would not receive the penalties that we would normally associate with a public holiday because the public holiday would be declared on the Monday. I do not believe that the general public expects people to work on Christmas Day for normal rates of pay. In fact, many people would prefer not to work on Christmas Day but in order to hold their job they simply do not have a choice.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008314"></A>
Many of these people are people who work in essential services--that is, people who work in our hospitals, firefighters, ambulance officers and police officers. These are people who already sacrifice so much of their family lives with shiftwork for communities. We also know, as the member for Chatsworth just outlined, that there are many in the hospitality and retail sectors who work at numerous Christmas Day functions. Many people nowadays do not want to cook the Christmas dinner themselves. They take their whole family out for someone else to do it--and the washing up as well--and it is those people who need to be protected in these circumstances. I applaud the recommendation of the Attorney-General that we should on this occasion ensure, by declaring an extra public holiday, that both Christmas Day and New Year’s Day will accrue the appropriate penalties.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008318"></A>
I do draw attention to the fact that next year we will have a very unusual circumstance when Anzac Day will fall on Easter Monday. I think everybody understands the importance of recognising Anzac Day on the actual day that it falls and we are--I give notice here, although there has not been a final decision--looking at making an additional holiday for the Easter Monday to be recognised at a different time. So we may have an unusual circumstance next year with a five-day Easter break, but I do think it is important that we do allow appropriate time for religious observance at Easter but appropriate time for Anzac Day to be marked with the dignity and opportunity that it warrants as well.</Hansard-Body>

‘Walk a day in my shoes’ Program</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008322"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Premier. Premier, I refer to health workers union boss Gary Bullock’s comments yesterday when he was asked about the Premier’s latest stunt of pretending to be a hospital worker for a night. He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1008325"></A>
... it’s insulting to some of our members that’s for sure.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1008326"></A>
I ask: will the Premier finally begin to listen and put an end to these ridiculous stunts which the real workers find insulting?</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008328"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question because it gives me another opportunity to talk about the value of a program like ‘Walk a day in my shoes’. As I have outlined a number of times, we will always find some knockers and we will always find some cynics. I am sorry that Mr Bullock feels that way. However, I can reassure him and everybody else that there are many unions that are actively working with the government to ensure that those members who will be in workplaces that are represented by unions will be working side by side with union members, that they know who their delegates are and that they will be in a position to talk to them. I can assure the House that many of my members have already had--they are reporting to me--a vast number of people contacting their offices wanting them to walk a day in their shoes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008332"></A>
Despite all of the concerns that one would expect in a large health workplace like the PA Hospital, as I said in my ministerial statement this morning, I thank the staff there for what was a very warm, very sincere and very generous welcome to their workplace. They did not miss the opportunity to talk to me about a range of issues, as one would expect--and good on them! Yes, they talked about some of the difficult issues, but they also wanted to talk about a whole range of things that affect them in their daily lives. They were also very keen for me as Premier to understand what happens in their workplace. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008336"></A>
One of the reasons I chose this particular opportunity was that I have worked many jobs in my life. I have been a kitchenhand, I have been a waitress, I have worked in a factory and I have been a cleaner. But I have never had an opportunity to work in a health facility. Health is one of the biggest areas of our budget--it is one of the biggest employers in the state--and to see the reality of high-tech medical care and high-tech nursing, as you would see in the intensive care unit of a hospital like the PA, is nothing short of a revelation and eye-opener. So I thank those staff for sharing their experience and their incredible talent with me so that I have a much better appreciation of what they are doing and the challenges they face. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008340"></A>
As I said, you will always find cynics and knockers when people move out to do positive things. In my experience in life--frankly, it is something I tell my children--you learn something when you think about what it might be like to travel in someone else’s shoes but you learn even more when you make the effort to do it. We make no apologies for being out there connecting with workers in their workplace.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008342"></A>
On the question of industrial issues, I have to say that I was very disappointed to see the LNP spokesperson on industrial relations, Scott Driscoll, come out against our proposal on public holidays. We know that Scott Driscoll runs the IR policy of the LNP--a repeatedly failed LNP candidate who masquerades as a so-called independent representative of the retailers. In fact, I was pleased to see Commerce Queensland this morning recognising how important it is for workers to be paid properly. It is pity that the LNP and its candidates cannot. </Hansard-Body>

Regional Hospitals, Funding</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010412"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms JARRATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health. Can the minister advise the House how Queensland, as Australia’s most decentralised state, stands to benefit from the Gillard government’s newly announced regional health and hospital funding? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010414"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. She is one of those members in this House who has repeatedly and consistently provided strong regional representation for the people of her electorate and for the people of regional Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010415"></A>
Members would be aware that, as part of its negotiations after the last election, the Gillard government indicated that it would be placing an additional $1.8 billion into health funding in the regions, and that will directly benefit regional Australia. That is good news for Queensland. On a 20 per cent basis of population share, that funding would be around $360 million. But more than that, Queensland is the only mainland state that has more of its population outside of its capital city than within it--2.7 million people outside of the capital city to compared to two million people in the capital city and six times the size of Victoria. So in this state regional means regional. It does not mean down the road from Melbourne on a tram or a bus on a Saturday afternoon. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010416"></A>
In the past in this state we have had to put up with underinvestment in regional capital and certainly underinvestment in the training of doctors, which is a major issue we have discussed when it comes to GPs, rural practitioners and the like. So we will work very hard with the federal government. I think it is important to acknowledge that Queensland received about 30 per cent of the regional cancer funding. We got more than our share because we have more people in our regions, and that funding is important. It is also important to acknowledge that, for the federal government to come to the party with clean hands, you have to invest yourself. That is why our $7.33 billion program dwarfs the funding provided by the other states, so that we can say to the Commonwealth government, ‘We are doing it ourselves.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010417"></A>
So what are we going to do in this new round besides ask for more capital for our hospitals? The member for Gladstone is certainly looking at me. I know that she is an advocate for her area, as are many other members for their areas. Who would forget the AMA going berserk during the federal election campaign when Tony Abbott promised to take $544 million out of e-health funding? In a state like Queensland and in a nation like Australia, how ridiculous is that? So what about arguing for some infrastructure for our hospitals and, indeed, general practitioners in the bush, to facilitate e-health? Who could forget that Tony Abbott’s response to the regional Independents was $1 billion for Hobart? I tell you what, Hobart is not regional--$1 billion for Hobart. It was like his Mersey General Hospital policy. Julia Gillard said $1.8 billion for regions across Australia--not just for Bob Katter and not just for Rob Oakeshott and not just for other members representing regional areas, but across Australia. That is sensible policy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010420"></A>
When it comes to the federal government committing money for regional health in Australia, we will align the interests of regional Queensland with the interests of the federal government. That is very important. Technology can be our friend. We will also seek a share of that NBN money--$43 billion--to make sure that people in regional and rural Queensland can get the benefit of that money, as they have in the past with our other investments. It is a worthwhile thing to do. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. We have said on many occasions that the global financial crisis could not have hit Queensland’s budget and the Queensland economy at a worse time. It came at exactly the point where we were reaching a peak in our infrastructure program. If it had hit us three or four years earlier, it would not have had such a devastating impact, simply because we did not have a building program of the size that we had at that point. Why did we have a building program the size that we had at that point? Partly because we had developed a 20-year infrastructure plan and partly because we had an addition to the South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program. We looked right across each of the regions and committed to, and invested in, important infrastructure in major regional centres. I have yet to hear one voice from among those opposite about which one of those projects they believe we should not be committed to and which one of those projects they believe should not go ahead. We know they have a secret plan though, because the shadow Treasurer let the cat out of the bag when he said that they would look to reassess projects. In my experience--</Hansard-Body>

We are looking forward to boost the tourism industry. We are looking forward to protect workers at Christmas time. What do we see from those opposite?

 I thank the member for Capalaba for his question and for his commitment to building jobs, to creating jobs for the people of his electorate, and, indeed, right across Queensland. He does a great job in his role of supporting the trade minister in opening up export opportunities for the people of Queensland to create new jobs, to create the jobs of the future, to create the jobs for the kids finishing school each and every year. To a person, this is a side of politics that supports job creation and the dignity of work. We saw that in the ABS job results last week for the 13th month in a row--13 straight months of job creation, now more than halfway on delivering on our commitment for 100,000 net new jobs over the term of the parliament, less than halfway through our term. That is the commitment that this government took to the last election--to deliver on jobs--and that is exactly what we are doing. We are doing that because we have the plans in place, the policies in place, and we have the fortitude to stick to those plans, to deliver on what we said we would do. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1010449"></A>
Well, we’ve had a number of initiatives--a number. I don’t count them, you know, on--in terms of a massive number, but, sorry, I don’t count them in terms of notating them off. But there are numerous ones and they’re significant. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

If it were not so serious, it would be funny. If it were not so serious, you could forgive the Leader of the Opposition for that sort of Springborgesque response--channelling the deputy leader from the last election campaign, who just said in here a moment ago that the global financial crisis was not known in October 2008. He must have missed it when the world stopped on 15 September 2008 when Lehman Brothers fell over. It is the anniversary of that event tomorrow. We might bring in a couple of newspaper articles to refresh his memory. He must have missed the comments of the Reserve Bank Governor, Glenn Stevens. What would he know about the economy? He is only the chairperson and the Governor of the Reserve Bank. What did he say in October 2008? Glenn Stevens said--</Hansard-Body>

All the old favourites are back in the oven and reheated to rip out. Three years on, what is this government doing? Delivering jobs, just like we said we would. Three years on, what are the members of the opposition doing? Sitting on their tails. </Hansard-Body>

 We have a plan, and we are putting it in place block by block, at the same time as maintaining the biggest building program in the country. The member for Maroochydore squarks about New South Wales. We have, in just our hospital building program, a program that is I think almost three times the building program of the New South Wales government. If the member for Maroochydore wants to identify a hospital upgrade or a hospital rebuild that the LNP believes should not happen, she should stand up and tell Queenslanders. What is your plan? You have no plan. </Hansard-Body>

 I note the interjection from the member opposite, who opposed the job in the first place. That is delivering 3,660 jobs. The Gold Coast University Hospital has generated another 10,000 jobs. Pouring of the ground slab has begun on the mental health building there. Those interjecting opposite might find a place there if they keep going. In the Rocky hospital redevelopment, vinyl floor and wall sheeting is underway. Refurbishing of the medical imaging section is also underway. External works in Townsville are delivering 2,360 jobs. The last of the level 3 concrete structures has been completed and the structural steel roof plane in the plant room has been completed. Those are the sorts of projects that are creating jobs and building much needed services in this state. </Hansard-Body>

Over the last 18 days we have seen a number of things happen in Australia. We saw Hoges detained and then sent on his way. Unfortunately we have had tragic deaths in Afghanistan. We have seen the Gillard government appointed in Canberra and the NBN will start as a result of it. On the weekend my wife and I had the very pleasant duty of attending the wedding of the son of the Leader of the House which was absolutely marvellous. But what have we not seen over the last 18 days? We have seen no revelation from the king of reassessment over there about what he is going to reassess. He big-noted himself on Madonna King’s program saying, ‘We are going to reassess this. This is our strategy. This is our plan.’ What has the king of reassessment done? Nothing! Has he done any reassessing? He has done it in his mind. He has done it in the back room. But where has he not done it? He has not done it in this parliament. He has not done it to the builders in Queensland. He has not come out and said honestly, ‘This is what we intend to reassess.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012612"></A>
I note that the member for Maroochydore was going on with her obsession about the hospital on the north coast. Is that being reassessed? They will not commit to it and they will not admit whether they are even reassessing it. I challenged her in the paper to stand up and say, ‘I will fight for this hospital. It is not going to be reassessed.’ What did she do? Squibbed it! Just as all of those who sit opposite have squibbed this issue. </Hansard-Body>

My question to the king of reassessment is: what are you reassessing? When are you going to make it known to the people of Queensland? When are you going to identify the electorates in this parliament that will suffer your reassessment? I know that it touched a raw nerve with the honourable member because she lacked the moral fortitude to stand up to this gentleman over here, the old king over here. You cower at the king’s feet. </Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Minister for Health. With Tweed Heads, Logan, QEII, Wesley, Mater, Ipswich, Toowoomba and Redlands hospitals on bypass or capacity alert at the same time yesterday afternoon, how many patients were languishing in the back of ambulance vehicles and for how long as a consequence of Queensland hospitals again reaching breaking point? </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1014789"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 With the largest capital works building program in Australia in health, one of the things that we will not be doing is saying to people who are seeking to go to our emergency departments that we will not build more emergency departments--we will not build them at PA, we will not build them a new hospital at the Gold Coast, we will not build them a new hospital on the Sunshine Coast, we will not build the additional capacity. That is what we are doing. If people drive along Ipswich Road they will see the massive increase in size in the PA Hospital. People will see also the work that we are doing at Logan Hospital. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1014792"></A>
We saw in the media this morning the AMA talking about some of the issues regarding presentations to general practice and some of the issues surrounding that. One of those issues of course is the lack of general practitioners. We know that John Howard was responsible for that. Of course, the Rudd and Gillard governments, supported previously by the Beattie government, have massively increased the number of doctors in training. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014793"></A>
The other thing that the AMA calls on the Commonwealth government to do is to increase the Medicare rebate, and I support the AMA on that. We do know that there are far too many presentations to hospital emergency departments for lower categories that could be dealt with by GP superclinics or, indeed, by GPs themselves. That is a structural matter that is easily dealt with. We also know that category 1 and emergency cases are always sent to the nearest hospital and our times are well within the national benchmark, which is less than a minute. Of course, there are times when we have severe capacity in relation to various hospitals, and we will seek to deal with that. I should also note that, from the point of view of my colleague the minister for emergency services, our ambulance response times are amongst the best in Australia and, indeed, our highly trained paramedics have the care of those people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014795"></A>
So where would people like to be? They would like to be in the care of one of the fastest arriving ambulances with a top shelf paramedic going to a hospital that provides great service, and all of that happens in Queensland. The one thing that members opposite will do is guarantee, through their reassessment of building programs, that there will not be sufficient resources in the future to provide emergency department relief. Here are the bricks and mortar. What do they want to do? They do not want to sell QR. Instead of the 13,500 doctors, nurses and allied health professionals we have employed, they would rather spend the money on coal train drivers. I tell them now that coal train drivers will not stop hospitals going on bypass. More doctors, more nurses, more resources will, and that is why we are doing this. It is about time that members opposite told the truth and committed to more medical staff instead of committing to ridiculous policies on privatisation which they do not even believe in. </Hansard-Body>

Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question and for her support of the Queensland Ambulance Service. It gives me an opportunity to talk about some of the achievements of the Queensland Ambulance Service and particularly its staff. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014803"></A>
There are around 3,800 staff working in the Queensland Ambulance Service and about 3,200 of those are front-line paramedics. Last week I and other members--and I thank members on both sides of the House--had the opportunity to thank and recognise the Ambulance Service and its staff during Ambulance Week and particularly the Star Care Awards. I note that in the electorate of the member for Townsville advanced care paramedic Bernadette Carnes was named the state’s top paramedic. I pass on my congratulations to her. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014807"></A>
The QAS responds to around 750,000 incidents a year. On average, that works out to about one every 42 seconds. So this is one of the biggest ambulance services in the world and, as the Minister for Health pointed out a moment ago, with spectacular performance, particularly with response times. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014808"></A>
Last financial year the Ambulance Service responded to 50 per cent of code 1 emergencies within 8.1 minutes. Just to compare that with New South Wales, the year before New South Wales responded to 50 per cent of code 1 emergencies within 10.3 minutes. So that is 8.1 here in Queensland and two years ago in New South Wales, 10.3. That is a spectacular performance and we should take every opportunity to praise our ambos when we can. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014809"></A>
The government responds by supporting the Ambulance Service with the resources it needs. In this budget we funded 75 additional ambulance officers and another 160-odd ambulance vehicles but also, importantly and significantly, the capital works program. There was $3.2 million for six new stations and $13.8 million for 14 replacement stations across the state--a major capital works program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014810"></A>
As has been outlined, the shadow Treasurer let the cat out of the bag on ABC Radio a week or so ago saying that the LNP government is going to reassess all of Labor’s capital works programs. Ambulance officers across the state want to know which ambulance stations are going to be cut. We know the member for Moggill and also the member for Indooroopilly are out there undermining two projects, which I am sure will be first on the hit list: the proposed new ambulance station at Pinjarra Hills--that will be gone under the plan of the member for Clayfield--and the strategic land purchase out in the electorate of the member for Indooroopilly. He is out there undermining a good decision of the Queensland Ambulance Service. That will be the next one to go. They are the first two projects that will be easily done for by the member for Clayfield. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014811"></A>
The LNP has a track record on this. When it came into government last time, there was an immediate capital works freeze. The words of the member for Clayfield are based on the history of this party--</Hansard-Body>

Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Premier. At a community forum I hosted last week with respect to increased water costs in my electorate, approximately 400 residents passed a motion of no confidence in the minister for natural resources. The Premier claims to be listening. Will the Premier now act on the motion of no confidence? Will she accept an invitation from me to attend a similar public forum and listen to the constituents affected by water price hikes? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I do understand that there are many people in the member’s electorate who are genuinely alarmed by their water bills and I understand why. It is not because of any significant increase in bulk water charges by the state government but because of very significant increases by the relevant council owned water utility. I did hear some of the meeting that was broadcast on ABC Radio and people were genuinely concerned about what the water utility was doing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014819"></A>
I think it is important to go back over a little bit of the history of this. I would like to put on the record a piece of correspondence from the Lord Mayor of Brisbane on behalf of the Council of Mayors. The Lord Mayor of Brisbane chairs the South-East Queensland Council of Mayors. In relation to this issue on the structure of water entities, in May 2009 the Council of Mayors wrote to the Treasurer and the minister for natural resources and had the following to say--</Hansard-Body>

In Townsville, in the member for Mundingburra’s area, we are hitting the ground running with $160 million for stage 4 of the Townsville ring-road. The member for Mundingburra will appreciate that.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Attorney-General. I preface the question by congratulating him for appealing Patel’s sentence. I refer the Attorney-General to conditions for non-disclosure clauses in his government’s Patel special mediation process, which ensures that victims are liable to pay back compensation if they speak publicly about the amount that is paid to them. I also refer the Attorney-General to the fact that a number of patients have broken his government’s non-disclosure provisions, disclosed the meagre sums paid to them and stated publicly that his government’s compensation was unfair, inadequate and, also, unconscionable. Will the Attorney-General enforce the non-disclosure provisions and take legal action against those Patel victims who complain about the compensation that they have received? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017298"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In responding to the honourable member’s question, it is appropriate to give an overview of where we are with the special process. As the Premier did in a very comprehensive answer in the last sitting week or the sitting week before that, I will indicate what has happened to individuals who have gone through the special process. No Queenslander who was treated by Mr Patel or who otherwise fell within the bounds of the special process was required to go through the special process. There was no obligation on anyone to engage in the process. The special process was a very significant process that this government put into place to provide the smoothest and most efficient way to provide compensation to the victims of Mr Patel. We did that openly and up-front. It was a Labor initiative to smooth the way for compensation. However, those individuals who did not seek to engage in the process were not required to do so. As I understand it, a small number of people sought to pursue damages by way of a common law action in a Queensland court. It was open to them to do so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017299"></A>
The reality is that the overwhelming number of individuals who fell within the eligibility criteria for the special process went down that path. They were also legally represented. They received independent legal advice that was funded by the state government. They were entitled to take advice to accept a settlement or not, as the case may be. There was nothing that this government did to force anyone to resolve anything. Of course, an independent mediator mediated every claim. That was done independently, at arm’s length from government, as happens in so many civil litigation actions in this state where there is an independent mediator. Individuals were quite open to accept a settlement offer. As I understand it, many of those were in excess of what individuals otherwise may have been entitled to under the general law. That is a matter for individuals, it a matter for their independent legal advisers and it is a matter for the independent mediator. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017301"></A>
What individuals do subsequent to settlement is a matter for them. Our commitment was to make that process as least traumatic for eligible Queenslanders as possible, to smooth the way to enable them to be compensated. We have almost finished the process. I express my sympathy to individuals and families affected by this sad chapter. We have tried to support them through the special process. It is a matter for individuals as to whom they wish to talk to about matters. Generally, when civil matters are resolved by consent between parties in Queensland, it is done so on a basis where they agree not to disclose the nature of the settlement. That is a matter for individuals. I do not see any benefit in pursuing individuals. If they want to speak publicly about it, it is a matter for them. We are seeking to provide support to them and to close this chapter so that they can continue to move forward in their own lives. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MULHERIN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. He is very supportive of the government’s policy on the CSG and LNG industries. Over the past couple of weeks, the government has run a number of forums on the CSG and LNG industries in the Surat Basin. I attended two of those forums, in Miles and Toowoomba. From the forums I attended, it was evident that the landholders received a lot of information from government in relation to the legislation process and protocols around the LNG industry. We have a clear vision on the LNG industry. We want to grow it but, as the Premier has said, that cannot be at any cost. Gas companies must comply with the laws and regulations in place and show landholders and the environment the respect they deserve. We are optimistic about the future of the LNG industry. We believe that if we stick to our plan and get it right, we will deliver on the opportunities the industry offers to all of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition) (11.38 am): We have all heard about the Premier’s 16 so-called achievements after three years in office. Some are so vague and immeasurable that the ‘sweet 16’, as they have been tagged, have become the subject of derision, ridicule and contempt even in the Labor Party. One ‘achievement’ is reducing unemployment. On the figures released last week, there are 131,000 unemployed and there were 116,000 unemployed, not three years ago but last year when the Premier made her promise to create 100,000 jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017313"></A>
Queenslanders do not think that those so-called achievements are the sweet 16, but they can come up with a list of their own. Here is Queensland’s Labor’s ‘sour 16’. No. 1 is losing Queensland’s AAA credit rating. No. 2 is record state debt--the highest in the entire country. No. 3 is massive structural deficits as Labor spends more than it earns and its spending increases consistently outpace its earning increases. No. 4 is electricity prices--Labor’s privatisation has dramatically increased the power bills of Queenslanders. No. 5 is assets sales--a fire sale of $15 billion worth of assets, despite overwhelming opposition from Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 They do not like to hear it, do they? They had their ‘sweet 16’ yesterday, but they have clearly proven not to be true. No. 6 of the sour 16 is literacy and numeracy. One in four or one in five students in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 are achieving only the bare minimum standard or lower for literacy and numeracy. Shame on the Minister for Education. No. 7 is the Queensland Health payroll. There is $900 million for a system that still cannot pay health workers correctly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019749"></A>
No. 8 is South-East Queensland water price rises. There have been massive price rises to pay for a $2 billion water recycling plant that is idle, a $1.2 billion desalination plant that is a lemon, $800 million on a northern pipeline interconnector--which the member for Maroochydore is always referring to--and the scrapped $500 million Traveston Crossing Dam. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019751"></A>
No. 9 is Labor’s fuel tax. Since June 2009, the cost of fuel has risen by 9.1c per litre thanks to Labor’s fuel tax after they promised before the election that they would not touch the subsidy. No. 10 is driver’s licence hikes. The cost of a five-year driver’s licence is set to increase from $73.30 to $152.50. It is a system that is costing millions of dollars. We have 4.5 million Queenslanders in a system that is going to cost them over $100 million for a driver’s licence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019755"></A>
No. 11 is vehicle registration. Our vehicle registration is more expensive than any other state, making Queensland the most expensive state in which to own and run a car. No. 12 is the increase in motorway tolls, crippling some transport intensive businesses. It is only last week that the Treasurer came in here and said that we would have a cap on toll rises. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019756"></A>
No. 13 is a health system that is grinding to a halt under the weight of massive management burdens and systems. No. 14 is Cross River Rail--a project first announced as a priority six years ago and announced almost monthly since then, every time the Premier needs a distraction from her toxic, appalling Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019758"></A>
No. 15 is a justice system that does not deliver justice, where criminals get a slap on the wrist instead of hearing the slam of a cell door. No. 16--the most appalling one of the sour 16--is a cabinet full of underperforming, acquiescent carpet strollers with no real-world experience. They have to be sent out to get some--but only for a day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019759"></A>
They are the 16 things that Queenslanders will remember about the past three years--a litany of failure, an appalling record of deceit and dishonesty. Today we heard a ministerial statement from the Treasurer about privatisation in which he could not even utter the word. Under this dishonest Labor government in Queensland, privatisation has become merely a transaction--the next chapter. So divorced have they become from the truth that they can no longer utter the word ‘privatisation’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019760"></A>
It is no wonder, then, that the column writers have seen fit to explore the raft of weaknesses replete with this government. I noted on the weekend the column of that noted historian Ross Fitzgerald. I do not think anyone would claim that he is a great conservative supporter. I do not think people would say that he is one of ours. Let us have a look at what he had to say in the <Hansard-Italic>

<A ID="pgfId-1019772"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is what they say. Because he has never had a real job, he has to have people who have real-world experience who tell him what to do, except when he practises his well-rehearsed answers to questions without notice. What else does Ross Fitzgerald say? He says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1019774"></A>
Bligh’s departmental head in the Premier’s Department, Ken Smith, is out of his depth and provides no leadership to the bureaucracy. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1019775"></A>
Mr Fitzgerald further states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1019777"></A>
Bligh’s ministers are generally young, inexperienced, lazy and incompetent and promoted by Bligh to ensure their support. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1019778"></A>
Then Mr Fitzgerald states what we all know--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1019780"></A>
The support of Australian Workers’ Union powerbroker Bill Ludwig is crucial to Bligh’s survival. He is the last person of influence standing in her corner. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019782"></A>
Mr Fitzgerald is not alone in his scathing assessment. Steven Wardill of the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 also wrote a very insightful piece about the credit of the Labor Party in this place in which a senior Labor insider is quoted as saying--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1019784"></A>
The whole reason the state caucus is in such bad condition is due to Peter Beattie, he went out of his way to attract mediocrity.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1019785"></A>
The source goes on to say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1019787"></A>
Beattie knew he always looked better when surrounded by B-graders. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019788"></A>
Wasn’t there a minister here once who used to refer to people as B-graders? I wonder who the source was. I see that the member for Chatsworth is here in the chamber. Let us have a look back at the member who came here in 1977 to see if he is the source. Another commentator, Madonna King, also summed up--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019791"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is to point out to the Labor government, of which the Treasurer is an intrinsic part, just how hopeless they are and how they need to be held to account for what they have done when they are trying to make out that they have some sort of proud record. This is what Madonna King said when she summed up Queensland Labor in her column--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1019793"></A>
In fact, the only thing allowing Anna Bligh to remain as leader of the state’s Labor Party--and the Premier for now--is the lack of any suitable replacement--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1019794"></A>
apart from the laughing clown over there. Ms King points out--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1019796"></A>
That says much about Anna Bligh’s Government and the depth of talent of her ministry, but the search for a replacement has led to some bizarre scenarios being floated. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1019797"></A>
The best example this week was that MP for Brisbane Central Grace Grace could possibly replace her as leader. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

 They do not like it, do they? They give it out here for an hour and they cannot even handle it for 10 minutes. Well, blow me down: the member for Brisbane Central is doing the numbers--something that I informed this House of a fortnight ago. This is what Madonna King goes on to reflect about the Premier’s latest media stunt--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1019805"></A>
Thursday night at the Princess Alexandra Hospital will not be seen as a new open Premier hell-bent on learning. It’s more likely to be seen by voters as a cheap political stunt, aimed at improving the Premier’s public relations. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019806"></A>
Union leaders told the Left faction Labor members yesterday that working for a day in a hospital or a hotel is an insult to their members. Of course it is an insult to Queenslanders who have seen all of these stunts before after nearly 20 years of this toxic Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019807"></A>
Mr Ross Fitzgerald summed it up nicely at the beginning of his article on Saturday. He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1019809"></A>
Anna Bligh is only surviving as Queensland Premier because there is no one else willing to lead the ALP into near certain defeat at the next state election due in 2012. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019810"></A>
I do not take victory for granted and, as leader of the LNP, I will work day and night between now and the next election to prove to Queenslanders that we can get this state back on track. We will work day and night to make Queensland No. 1 again. We will work day and night to set out a plan and a vision for Queensland that will once again lead the country. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019811"></A>
Once again we saw this morning from the Premier and the Treasurer lots of overacting and lots of tired regurgitation that ‘yes, we were upfront with Queenslanders last year in the lead-up to the election’ when it was revealed that they did know what the global financial crisis had cost this state. $12 billion is the figure the Treasurer released on the eve of the election. So the Premier did know and will not release today the cabinet document from October 2008 that says that they knew about privatisation and that they had plans about it. </Hansard-Body>

 (Broadwater--ALP) (11.49 am): Firstly, I would like to acknowledge staff and students from Biggera Waters State School. The school council is here with us today, and I would like to thank them very much for making the effort to come. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019855"></A>
Last week at one of my regular mobile offices I met a 55-year-old woman who, for many reasons and personal circumstances, is living in her car. Dianne has a 24-year-old son who is unable to live with her at this time. My office is currently working with her to have this situation addressed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019858"></A>
Meeting people like Dianne who have no place to call home is a reality check on how tough many people are doing it in our communities. The state government has committed to building 4,000 units of social housing under the Nation Building--Economic Stimulus Plan, over 350 of which will be in the Gold Coast region. It is this commitment that will assist high needs clients on the department of housing’s Gold Coast waiting list, including pensioners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019860"></A>
Many community leaders and representatives acknowledge the need for more affordable housing stock on the Gold Coast to help address the issues of growing homelessness and after-housing stress. Even the federal Liberal MP Stuart Robert was quoted in the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Sun</Hansard-Italic>
 during the recent federal campaigns that he was deeply concerned about the severe shortage of affordable accommodation for struggling families. He said, ‘We’re starting to see more and more families and even fathers with young children who are homeless.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019863"></A>
Yes, I could not believe that I was reading those words either given that a year earlier he was generating a great divide amongst the Coombabah community, hosting a public rally against another Labor funded social housing project that had not yet been approved. I am pleased that the Liberal federal member has obviously discovered for himself that people in need of housing support are generally good people who need help. He was photographed with a 75-year-old lady apparently desperate for housing support. Whilst this lady does not in fact reside in the federal member’s electorate, seniors and people with disabilities do represent the highest proportion of people on the housing waiting list. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019865"></A>
The federal member gets it, but what about the local councillor? A member of the Gold Coast City Council’s Planning Implementation and Assessment and Sustainable City Future Committee, Councillor Grant Pforr, last week claimed in the local paper that he had not been told about four two-bedroom apartments configured as one two-storey building on a 967 square metre site. Had the councillor bothered to check first before fronting up at the site with the media in tow, his concerns would have been allayed by a letter that was sent from the town planner of Project Services within the Department of Public Works to the CEO of the Gold Coast City Council in April of this year that said that the Department of Communities would be proceeding with this project. He would have been advised that the project meets the performance criteria of the planning scheme in relation to density, front setback, privacy and car parking, and that the project is assessed within the regional choice domain of the Gold Coast City Council’s planning scheme and identified as code assessable which means, just like in the case of a private developer wanting to do exactly the same type of building development, there is no requirement for public notification. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019870"></A>
There is nothing sneaky about this. The project is within the planning scheme that council developed. So what is wrong with the state government building four two-bedroom units consistent with the planning scheme? The local councillor has, through blatant mistruths to the Coombabah community about his lack of knowledge of the project, ignited a debate about social housing and social housing tenants which I find quite honestly disappointing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019871"></A>
The councillor and some Coombabah residents may be surprised to know that there are already social housing residents living in Coombabah. I have met with a number of Coombabah residents struggling to meet their rent or after-housing expenses who are already on the waiting list or wanting to be. Some of these people live in manufactured home villages, some are families and some are seniors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019872"></A>
When my parents divorced when I was very young my mother was determined to regain her independent life and provide me with the best opportunities afforded to other children my age. Her priority was to find a home. We lived in one of the state’s oldest and most densely populated housing commission blocks ever built. It was Morrill Court in Townsville and it was four blocks of at least 200 units in each block. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019874"></A>
I am telling this story to encourage people to be more compassionate, understanding and in some way tolerant of people who need housing support. I ask Councillor Pforr to realise that not everyone who lives in Coombabah can afford their rent. I ask him to explain to people where he would like them to live. He needs to be honest with the residents about his knowledge of this development application. He needs to support people living in his area to find housing. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs KIERNAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Isa--ALP) (11.53 am): Queensland’s State Emergency Service has a proud history of volunteers who selflessly give their time to support their local communities. The Bligh government is also proud of its role in supporting these SES organisations. This was confirmed in our 2010-11 budget which committed nearly $15 million to the SES. My time as Parliamentary Secretary for Emergency Services will see me continuing the good work of my predecessors in this role of working collaboratively with these services. I will also continue to work closely with the minister responsible, the Hon. Neil Roberts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019881"></A>
The Department of Community Safety and local governments share the responsibility for the management of the SES. I am committed to continuing to work closely with our councils and local communities in a consultative and collaborative way. Apart from visiting the fantastic SES volunteers and EMQ officers in my own electorate of Mount Isa, I have also had the honour of meeting other dedicated SES volunteers in places such as Cairns, Mission Beach and Weipa. I recently attended the commissioning of two new SES buildings in Hughenden and Mission Beach. These great facilities are there to support the fantastic work that the local people do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019882"></A>
Today the SES boasts an active membership of approximately 6,800 volunteers based in 342 groups across the state. The value and dedication of our SES volunteers is clearly demonstrated through their performance of just under 71,000 operational hours since July 2009. This is including the recent February and March south-west Queensland floods and Tropical Cyclone Ului. It is a fact of living in Queensland that we are subject to frequent wild weather events. It is heartening to know that we have the SES which stands ready to assist Queensland communities in times of need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019885"></A>
The Bligh government also has a history of supporting the SES and the good work they do throughout the state. Funding provided in this year’s budget includes over $1.2 million to continue the 2009 election commitment Support our Heroes which will provide an additional 20 new vehicles, four flood boats, two rescue trailers and the delivery of an exercise regime. There is nearly $1.9 million to continue the 2006 election commitment Safeguarding Cyclone Communities which will provide additional replacement flood boats and rescue trailers, personal protective equipment and the stocking of regional disaster stores with items such as tarpaulins and sandbags. Nearly $3.3 million will be used to continue the 2006 election commitment to enhance training for SES volunteers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019888"></A>
In 2009-10, 21 vehicles were delivered to SES groups throughout the state. This includes an additional vehicle which we were able to purchase due to savings being identified. I am quite delighted that a couple of these vehicles were handed over to the great people in Burketown and Karumba in my electorate. This translates to real equipment on the ground where it is most needed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019889"></A>
We have also entered into sponsorship arrangements with companies like the NRMA and the Boating, Camping and Fishing people. We are providing funding across a broad range of areas for the betterment of Queensland communities. We are also planning for the future through providing government funding to Emergency Management Queensland through the Queensland Climate Change Fund. This will allow a continuous close working relationship with local governments and community sector organisations to increase the level of preparedness and resilience to natural disasters in vulnerable communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019894"></A>
The Disaster Preparedness in Vulnerable Communities program provides more than $7 million over four years. The program includes four individual programs. Keeping Our Mob Climate Safe is one of them. I recently met two people who have been appointed under this program at Mission Beach. They are two of four officers who will be going out and working with our Indigenous communities and councils. I look forward to working with them as well. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southern Downs--LNP) (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (11.58 am): Last week the Premier said that she should have been more and could have been more upfront with the people of Queensland on the issue of privatisation. In this parliament today the Premier had the perfect opportunity to be upfront with the people of Queensland on the question of privatisation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019934"></A>
What did we see from the Premier? We saw the Premier fail the fundamental test of her own words. The Premier failed the fundamental test of her own assertions, and again we saw the victory of spin over substance when it comes to the continuing insincerity of this Premier. We also know that, as we saw the early stages of the global financial crisis start to wash across the shores into Australia in September/October of 2008, this government--her government--was already in possession of a cabinet submission which said, ‘Privatise, privatise, privatise’. Yet if one listened to the Premier here this morning in the parliament, she would have us believe that it was not until at least April of 2009 that the government even considered the privatisation of Queensland’s generational assets. This morning the Premier again asserted that only just before the state election--indeed, in about March of 2009--did she say that there could have been an underlying impact on the budget bottom line in Queensland from the so-called global financial crisis and that the government was not considering privatisation. It was not until after the election when--oh, my goodness!--they opened the Treasury safe and realised that all of the money had gone that they considered privatisation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019937"></A>
However, in this place this morning when the Premier was confronted with overwhelming evidence that Treasury had put a proposal to government in October 2008 suggesting that there should be privatisation she was not able to say whether that was right or not. Indeed, she dodged around that particular question. So what we know from this parliament today is that this Labor government--all of the cabinet ministers who sit over there--was considering this privatisation proposal in October 2008. Again, we see a situation of a Premier who believes that she can just talk to Queenslanders--talk at Queenslanders. That is her solution. She believes that the solution to this is to talk at Queenslanders when Queenslanders only want her to open her ears and listen to them. That is why the people of this state feel so deceived by this Premier, who cannot even tell the truth when it comes to the issue of privatisation. The smoking gun was exposed this morning: in October 2008 this government was actively considering privatisation, yet it said that it did not make that decision until six months later. It said that it was not even faced with that particular proposal until six months later. That is another reason no-one in Queensland can trust one iota what this government says.</Hansard-Body>

Another thing that needs to be considered is that Australia has been in two recessions over the last 20 to 30 years--in the 1980s and the 1990s. It did not go into recession in 2008-09, even by the Premier’s own admission. However, during the 1980s and 1990s no Queensland government had to sell generational assets. Governments did not have to sell generational assets in the 1980s recession and did not have to sell generational assets in the 1990s recession. No government sold those generational assets when it came to the Asian economic crisis in the middle of the 1990s. The common denominator here is a Labor government that is fiscally incompetent which brought this on itself and now cannot even be honest.</Hansard-Body>

While on the subject, we have a government that is completely bereft of ideas. It comes into this parliament day after day after day and votes against proposals put forward in private members’ bills before the parliament by the LNP in the most gross act of political petulance, yet comes back into this place and re-enacts those proposals in full or in part as its own. I refer of course to the penalties and sentences amendment bill relating to the Sentencing Advisory Council which the government voted against and brought back as its own. I refer to the serious sexual offenders minimum imprisonment and rehabilitation bill. The government voted against it in 2006 and brought it back in here largely as its own. Then there was the Criminal Code (Assault Causing Death) Amendment Bill 2007. Now the Attorney-General is proposing to do away with the excuse of provocation and the excuse of accident in Queensland, bringing the legislation back into this place largely as his own. Then there was the Telecommunications (Interception) Queensland Bill 2003--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WENDT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich West--ALP) (12.03 pm): I want to alert the House to a significant announcement made last week concerning improvements to the Warrego Highway, and I know that the honourable member for Toowoomba South and the honourable member for Lockyer will be very keen to know more about this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019951"></A>
As members know, this highway is the main artery for heavy vehicles, residents and tourists travelling from the state’s west into the south-east corner. Last Wednesday morning I had the pleasure of announcing that this state government will spend $40 million to improve safety on the Warrego Highway between Ipswich and Withcott. Even better than that, it is planned that the works will be completed prior to the end of 2011. On the day of the announcement I invited the federal member for Blair, Mr Shayne Neumann, to attend, because he has worked tirelessly to attract federal funding for this important National Highway--and I should say that that is only right, because in reality it is a federally funded road and part of the National Highway system. However, I am happy to advise that Shayne has been very successful to date and instrumental in ensuring that the money for the Ipswich Motorway continues to flow--that is, around $2 billion--and that during the recent election campaign he was able to obtain an election commitment of over $50 million to construct a flyover at the notorious Blacksoil interchange. It is only fair to state that the Queensland government is putting in its pound as well in that it is submitting about $16 million, or about 25 per cent of that project, in addition to the $50 million from the federal government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019959"></A>
I also invited to last week’s announcement my electoral neighbour, Mr Ian Rickuss, the member for Lockyer, and the new LNP federal member for Wright, Mr Scott Buchholz, and it was a pleasure to see how everyone agreed that politics needs to be put aside to ensure that the safety of motorists is identified and actioned as quickly as possible. As I mentioned before, work on the new projects is expected to start early next year and will target a number of trouble spots. As such, this funding will allow the following safety upgrades to be undertaken. These upgrades are at the Crowley Vale Road and Harm Drive intersections at Crowley Vale--that is, the Big Orange intersection outside of Gatton, and I am sure a number of members are aware of that particular area and the recent tragedies that have occurred along there; the Claus Road and Thagoona-Haigslea Road at Haigslea which is just east of the Sundowner Hotel--and a few of us have been there--and which has been in need of treatment for some time; the intersection at Moroney Road at College View, where recent accidents have also occurred on the Warrego; and finally but very significantly the intersection at Tallegalla Road and Lowood-Minden Road, which is commonly known as the Minden crossroads.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019971"></A>
In addition to these works, extra funding will be invested in new signage, guardrail installation, removal of roadside obstacles, minor drainage safety works, and line marking and culvert replacement works at various locations between Ipswich and the Toowoomba range. As we all know, the Warrego Highway between Ipswich and Withcott needs urgent attention due to the high volume of traffic that travels this section of road daily, and that is what these funds are all about. The south-west corridor is booming and transport demand on this section of highway has grown by more than a third since 2001, and the honourable member for Toowoomba South can attest to that. Our region needs a safe and reliable road network to cater for increased traffic, and that is why this program of works is so important. We have provided this $40 million of state funding between 2009-10 and 2010-11 and that funding is on top of the $30 million in federal funding between 2008-09 and 2010-11, and that money specifically related to asphalt overlay between the Minden and Tivoli intersection on the Warrego Highway on the eastbound lanes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019976"></A>
Under the $70 million safety improvement program--that is, $40 million from the state and $30 million from the federal government--priority safety works have already been completed at 11 locations. I should point out that we have already improved safety at both the Haigslea-Amberley Road intersection, which is commonly known as the Walloon turnoff, and the Tallegalla Road/Lowood-Minden Road intersection that I spoke about a moment ago, which is commonly called the Minden intersection or Minden crossroads. At that specific intersection a left-hand slip lane was built off the main thoroughfare and has been an outstanding success. The local mayor of the Somerset council is also the local tow truck operator, and they have advised me that we are sending them broke because they used to attend accidents there on a fortnightly, if not weekly, basis and now they have attended only two accidents in the last eight or nine months.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019981"></A>
I note that the minister, Craig Wallace, has just returned to the chamber. I should recognise him particularly for these fine works. The money will be used greatly and will enhance the improvements to those roads. I should also pay special thanks to the Main Roads staff--from engineers to traffic controllers to maintenance personnel and others--who do a fantastic job of maintaining and constructing our road networks. I have no doubt that the minister will mention the fact that these roadworks and construction projects are creating jobs right across Queensland, and nowhere more importantly than across the electorates of Ipswich West and Lockyer and right up through to Toowoomba.</Hansard-Body>

Drivers’ Licences</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms SIMPSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maroochydore--LNP) (12.09 pm): Labor’s answer to a problem is to throw money at it, to not demand value for money and then to make the people pay for the waste. The transport minister, Rachel Nolan, has failed to prove her claim that a doubling in the cost of a Queensland driver’s licence is value for money. I challenge Minister Nolan to release all the documents about the cost escalation of this bungled project and to be accountable to the parliament and to the people--the people whom the minister is telling to wear this outrageous cost hike. The minister’s claim that the cost hikes are value for money is like telling Queenslanders to eat cake when many of them are struggling to survive. Motorists are saying a resounding no to the hikes, with 75,000 people signing an e-petition to protest the Bligh Labor government’s plan to more than double the cost of a licence over the next five years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020018"></A>
Queensland motorists are the most heavily burdened in Australia since the hikes in registration fees and tolls as well as the petrol tax, and this Labor government is not listening. If transport minister Nolan wants to continue the pretence that the huge cost blow-outs are value for money, I say: let us see the proof. I remind the minister that the Auditor-General in his report to parliament No. 8 warned the following--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1020020"></A>
 ... projects can only be considered successful if they deliver intended benefits at an acceptable cost. Therefore, within government, there needs to be a focus on benefits and the active monitoring and reporting of progress towards realising those benefits. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1020023"></A>
Where is the proof? I have sought information about the reasons for the cost blow-outs under the right-to-information laws and I have been blocked. I am appealing the latest decision. This government is desperate to hide the trail of paper about its financial mismanagement and thumbs its nose at the Auditor-General’s recommendations. But Labor Minister Nolan still has the audacity to tell Queensland motorists, who bear a cost burden greater than the people in any other Australian state, that this latest cost hike is good value. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020024"></A>
Let me address first this huge cost blow-out on the project. I table an outline of the escalation in costs, from about $6 million in 2002-03 to an estimated $20 million when the project was restarted in 2006-07, and then a whopping cost escalation in the past few years which has brought the project up to $112 million. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1020026"></A>
Last year alone the estimated total cost for the new Queensland driver’s licence project blew out by $30 million. The result of this mismanagement is that motorists are being gouged. They are milch cows. The cost of a single year’s licence will rise from $29.35 to $68.50 in 2014-15. For a learner driver the cost rises from $72.60 to $148.35, and the cost for a five-year licence rises from $75.55 to $152.50. This increase is a more than doubling of the cost of a licence in only a few years. I table a list of those costs.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020028"></A>
Even with the huge cost blow-out on the original driver’s licence project, the government is still creaming the public. It is draining the money from motorists’ purses. There are just over three million licensed drivers in Queensland. At $152.50 for a five-year licence, the government will reap $477 million over the life of that five-year licence. This is well and truly in excess of the original capital investment of $112 million. We have to ask: where is the money going? It is time this minister and this government were accountable. They are ripping the money out of the pockets of motorists. They are trying to say that it is value for money but they will not come clean with the facts.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020029"></A>
Let us look at the claim that the technology is worthwhile. I think the only fraud that is being perpetrated is the fraud of this government. The minister claims that the new card, which includes a chip--and they cannot explain how it will be used--will stop fraud. It appears that the only fraud here is the government. This project is overdesigned for what it will deliver and it is overpriced. The chip was originally supposed to carry the address on the inside. The boffins realised a bit late that the licence could not be read interstate and that there were other problems with other entities not being able to read the address on the inside. So they put the address back on the outside. I asked at the briefing what the chip would do and I was told that it was future-proofing, but for what future it could not be explained. The situation goes from the bizarre to the ridiculous, because people will be able to buy the new five-year high-tech card and if they change their address they will still end up with an address sticker on the back of that high-tech card. </Hansard-Body>

Tropical North Queensland, Tourism</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020033"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WETTENHALL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Barron River--ALP) (12.14 pm): I would like to draw the attention of the House to a range of ways in which the Bligh government is supporting tourism in tropical North Queensland and also bring to the attention of the House some of the new investments being made in the region by the private sector. Over the past 18 months to two years, the tourism industry throughout Queensland, but particularly in the tropical north, has experienced some of the toughest operating conditions of all time. The vast majority of tourism businesses have traded through these tough times and have done all they can to retain their loyal, dedicated and skilled staff. For that I think they deserve our recognition and thanks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020034"></A>
During this period some businesses have been able to take advantage of the highly competitive conditions in the construction sector to make investment decisions and to reinvest in renewal and refurbishment projects. I also think those investment decisions deserve to be acknowledged and recognised. It was disappointing, then, to read in the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian Financial Review</Hansard-Italic>
 on 6 September 2010 a report that the newly elected federal Liberal National Party member for Leichhardt, Warren Entsch, has criticised the slow renewal of tourism facilities and resorts which he said had been exacerbated by the short-sightedness of the council and the state government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020036"></A>
Mr Entsch was back in his job only a few days before he was talking negatively about one of the most important industries in his electorate. I think it is a disgrace that Mr Entsch has launched such an ignorant attack on the tourism industry. He wasted no time in shooting off his mouth. He is either ignorant of what both the government and the private sector are doing or he is deliberately misleading his constituents. The new federal parliament has not even sat and Mr Entsch is already talking down the tropical north, talking down the tourism industry and talking down the livelihoods of thousands of people across his region. I am sick of the negativity. We need to be talking up our state, we need to be talking up tourism and we need to be talking up the contributions that particularly the private sector is making in very difficult circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020037"></A>
So I will remind Mr Entsch that the following investments have been made in tourism in the tropical north--many in his electorate. He should be aware of them. There has been a major investment at the Paradise Palms golf resort in Palm Cove in my electorate. There has been a major refurbishment at the Hilton in Cairns. There has been a full refurbishment and global brand refreshment of the Holiday Inn in Cairns. There has been the construction of the Cairns Central Plaza Apartment Hotel. There has been a major refurbishment of the Pullman Reef Hotel and rebranding. There has been a major refurbishment at the Rydges Plaza Hotel at Cairns and minor refurbishments at the Rydges Esplanade Resort at Cairns, the Sabaya and Tradewinds. There has been a combined $20 million refurbishment of the Castaways resort at Dunk Island and at Elandra at Mission Beach. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020048"></A>
What an insult to all of the business owners who have made these investment decisions and who, unlike Mr Entsch, have expressed confidence in the future of tourism in the region. Not only have these investments been made; they are paying off. Just today it is reported in the <Hansard-Italic>
Cairns Post</Hansard-Italic>
 that average hotel room rates in Cairns are on the rise and that hoteliers have welcomed the news. The general manager of the Pullman Reef Hotel Casino, Adrian Williams, is quoted in today’s <Hansard-Italic>
Cairns Post</Hansard-Italic>
 as saying that the results are ‘consistent with our view we have bottomed out and should now expect to see positive movement in revenue per available room’. Only yesterday leading cruise operators gave the thumbs up to the state government’s $11.2 million cruise terminal redevelopment of the heritage wharves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020052"></A>
Mr Entsch has attempted to undermine the consensus that has been achieved on the need for a new cultural arts precinct, to which this government has committed $40 million towards its construction. I say to Mr Entsch that it is time to think, act and talk positively for the benefit of tourism and our region. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1020080"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (12.20 pm): As has been noted in this chamber on many occasions, the electorate of Gladstone is growing exponentially and in particular with the prospect of LNG. The vast majority in the electorate welcome the prospect of an LNG industry. However, there are those with concerns about safety, particularly in light of the fact that the LNG plants are proposed to be located in the Gladstone harbour adjacent to urban development. Incidents that have occurred recently in America have caused some disquiet. I will be asking for some information from the relevant departments in relation to any correlation with that incident and potential risks in my electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020081"></A>
There is a great need for infrastructure in the lead up to and during the construction of the LNG projects. Several of them look very promising in terms of their realisation. Infrastructure was looked at in a study commissioned by the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning. The document is completed; however, it has not been released. There is some concern in the electorate that it is taking so long for that document to be released. We need infrastructure that supports a community that is growing--such as roads, affordable housing and education facilities--and agencies that support families such as the department of child safety, community health et cetera. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020082"></A>
The one issue that is raised with me most often is the Gladstone Hospital. I acknowledge that the Minister for Health has already expressed concern about the Gladstone Hospital and has acknowledged that hospital services need to be examined and treated differently in light of the growth in the region. I look forward to a meeting that is to be organised with the minister and others to discuss that. However, over the last week or so I have had a number of matters raised with me and I feel that it is important, because of the concern in the community, to present those matters to this parliament. On 26 August, the Rural Doctors Association said that the Central Queensland health district is the worst off in the state. Queensland Health has this week been accused of understaffing and underfunding the Gladstone Hospital and the RDA says the degradation of the public health system in the state’s central region is the result of long-term neglect. Only today I had a parent ring me who has a family member working at the hospital. The parent said to me that she had not seen her child this demoralised. She said staff are being laid off. The wards are full, but there are fewer staff available. This parent could not clarify whether it was contract staff who were being laid off or full-time staff, but certainly the understanding locally is that staff are to be reduced. That is ridiculous given the growth in the area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020083"></A>
One patient had to have a colonoscopy and several other treatments and was required to go to Rockhampton. This was a gentleman who is sponsoring a petition that is to be tabled this week in relation to the reintroduction of the intensive care unit. Another woman approached me who also had to have a colonoscopy. She has had them previously at the Gladstone Hospital. She was going public. She had paid for her day surgery. The public doctor had had the conversations with her, as had the anaesthetist. She was booked in to have the procedure when the hospital contacted her to say that her BMI was too high and she would have to go to Rocky, although she said she had lost weight since the last colonoscopy was performed at the Gladstone Hospital. Her point of irritation was that she is going to have the colonoscopy in Gladstone, but instead of having it at the Gladstone Hospital she will have it at the Mater Hospital. The cost of the day bed is significantly higher but it will be performed by the same doctor and by the same anaesthetist. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020084"></A>
I believe that the management in Rockhampton, the clinician in charge, as well as the administration manager have a lot to answer for in terms of redirecting medical cases from Gladstone to Rockhampton and also in terms of not properly recruiting and gaining staff for the Gladstone Hospital. It is a growing area. It will be incredibly difficult to get people to relocate to the Gladstone region to work on the LNG plants if the infrastructure is lacking. As I said, the issue raised with me most is the Gladstone Hospital in terms of what the community see as a diminution and a reduction in the services that are available. The staff that work there do a brilliant job. They deserve more respect and they certainly deserve more help. </Hansard-Body>

Everton Electorate, Transport</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020087"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Everton--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(12.24 pm): As in many parts of Queensland, families in the Everton electorate spend a lot of time commuting to and from work. Every minute spent travelling, whether in a car or in public transport, is a minute not spent with family members. This is something I feel even more acutely now that I have become a father again. That is why I am so pleased about major transport plans that the state government announced in the last sitting of parliament. Currently, Mitchelton and Everton Park in the Brisbane City Council part of my electorate have pretty good public transport services, but the same cannot be said for the Moreton Bay Regional Council suburbs of Everton Hills, Albany Creek and Eatons Hill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020088"></A>
Improving public transport for Everton families was one of my election priorities. I pledged to work for it in my first speech to parliament and I have devoted myself to it since my election. To date, improvements include an extra 359 bus service from Albany Creek to the city in the morning peak hour and an extra afternoon 950 bus service from Kedron High School and Padua College to Brookside Shopping Centre. Everton residents continue to benefit from the increased train services that were made possible by duplicating the Mitchelton-Keperra train line just prior to my election. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020089"></A>
But these improvements are just the beginning. In the last parliamentary sitting, the state government announced a visionary plan for transport in South-East Queensland. This plan, known as Connecting SEQ 2031: An Integrated Regional Transport Plan for South East Queensland, proposes a number of projects which, if implemented, would massively improve traffic and transport for Everton families. The key proposals include improvements to a number of major roads, including the western orbital motorway from Toowong to Everton Park--including a tunnel with a connection to the Bruce Highway; the upgrade of major roads between Albany Creek and Aspley and Strathpine to Albany Creek; the investigation of Stafford Road as an underground motorway; and the upgrade of the surface level of Stafford Road. Of course, increasing public transport services is critical to allowing people to get where they want. That is why the transport plan also proposes the introduction of high frequency bus services connecting Albany Creek and Mitchelton to the Northern Busway as it is constructed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020090"></A>
Perhaps the most exciting aspect of the plan is the investigation of a rail link between Strathpine and Alderley. This area is currently served by buses, but a rail line would vastly improve travel times for those catching public transport and also for those who continue to drive. It would for the first time provide a rail option for residents of Eatons Hill, Albany Creek and Everton Park. Of course, Everton residents will benefit from some of the other improvements proposed in the plan that are outside the electorate, such as the Northern Busway from Kedron to Bracken Ridge; Airport Link from Kedron to Brisbane Airport; the Gateway Motorway and Kingsford Smith Drive upgrades; and the Cross River Rail which could double the number of train services from the suburbs to the city.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020091"></A>
Put together, these projects have the potential to save Everton families valuable travel time each and every day. I do not know anyone who would choose to sit in a car, a bus or a train carriage rather than spend time with their family, do some exercise or just relax at home. Consultation on the draft plan is now open and I encourage all interested residents to carefully consider the draft plan and have their say. I will be holding a number of public forums in the area with other local members whose constituents stand to benefit from this proposal and I encourage all Everton residents to get involved. For more information visit the Connecting SEQ website or phone 1800038178. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr HORAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba South--LNP) (12.27 pm): The people of Toowoomba are appalled, angry and disgusted at the way that justice is being administered in Toowoomba. Recently in Toowoomba there was a case where a thug attacked a security officer who was protecting shoppers late-night shopping in our main shopping centre, Grand Central Shopping Centre. As he went to protect some people from a scuffle that was occurring he was hit in the head, knocked down and then this thug came in and kicked him in the head. When the court case was held this thug also pleaded guilty to other charges involving violence towards taxidrivers on two other occasions. However, for this particular major charge he walked out of the court free. He got a six-month suspended sentence; he walked out with not one day of jail and not paying one dollar by way of a fine.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020095"></A>
The people of Toowoomba are disgusted at this. They believe that the police are doing a great job, that the security officers in the shopping centres are doing a great job, and they want to see these thugs receive a proper penalty. These thugs are the sorts of people who, when they sit there in the court with their legal advisers, turn to them when the sentence is brought down and say, ‘What’s happened? Am I going to jail?’ They are told, ‘No.’ They ask, ‘Am I being fined? They are told, ‘No.’ They ask ‘What do I do?’, and are told, ‘Well, you go home.’ In this case, this thug then went onto Facebook, joked about the whole thing with a heap of mates, and was caught on CCTV joking and laughing about the whole thing. What sort of message does that send? When are the people of our city going to be properly and adequately protected? I have been amazed at the number of emails and calls I have received. The talking point of the town has been this particular matter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023201"></A>
We have a great group in Toowoomba called Toowoomba Says No to Violence. It involves the police, many leaders of the community and ordinary people. They work hard to raise money and they hold marches to bring about a bigger appreciation of reducing the level of domestic violence, violence in the streets and violence generally so that our city can become a good place in which to live. However, we need the support of the judicial system to ensure that people who commit violence, the thugs who cowardly kick people in the head and dislocate their jaw, get the message loud and clear that it is just not on. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1023205"></A>
This whole matter blew out even further with a major story on the front page of the <Hansard-Italic>
Toowoomba Chronicle</Hansard-Italic>
 late last week about an incident in the Toowoomba Courthouse involving the same magistrate. Two tradesmen, who were drilling on the floor below putting in smoke alarms as part of the refurbishment that is occurring at the courthouse, were ordered to be locked up in the watch-house for one hour. Imagine the dismay of the police. What do they do? Fortunately, when these two men were put in the watch-house, the door was left open so they did not feel totally locked up. This order of the magistrate was to teach them a lesson. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023208"></A>
I am calling on the minister for police and the Attorney-General to work together to do two things: to try to restore a degree of confidence in our judicial system in Toowoomba and, more importantly, to back and support our police officers. How would members opposite like to walk in the shoes of the police prosecutor or any police officer in Toowoomba who works hard out on the streets and sees cases such as the person earlier this year who, over a period of two months, breached bail seven times and continued to commit offences during that time? How would they like to stand in the shoes of police officers who saw another person last year breach bail around eight times over five months and still commit various crimes during that time? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023209"></A>
It is time to stand up for our police officers. I am calling on the Attorney-General and the police minister to do everything they can to appeal the sentence of this thug. As the sentence was handed down in the Magistrates Court, it is up to the Police Service to appeal it. They need to do everything they can to see that this appeal happens. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023213"></A>
I am also calling on them to investigate matters in the courthouse. The Attorney-General said that that was a one-off incident. I want him to investigate whether a police sergeant has also been warned and threatened with imprisonment in the cells during the refurbishment of the courthouse. It is just not good enough. I am pleased the police minister is in the chamber. I call on him to appeal the sentence and investigate fully what is happening in this courthouse so that we can have confidence in our justice system. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs SULLIVAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Pumicestone--ALP) (12.33 pm): I would like to bring to the attention of the parliament two events of significance. Firstly, I represented the state government last week at Bribie Island in the electorate of Pumicestone. As part of Disability Action Week, I represented the Hon. Annastacia Palaszczuk, the minister for disability services, and officially opened Bribie Island’s first Shared Visions Regional Forum. At this forum people had their say about the Bligh government’s 10-year plan for supporting Queenslanders with a disability and Building Bright Futures, an action plan for children with a disability from birth to eight years. As a member of the disability minister’s backbench committee, I fully support this plan and its objectives. Most governments only look at their term in office and create plans that last around three years. So I am very proud that the Bligh government has shown this vision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023221"></A>
In June last year a committed group of Queenslanders came together to develop an alternative future for people with a disability. One of the key discussion points for this Blue Skies Group, as they were affectionately known, was a need for a 10-year plan. I took great pride in presenting that draft of the plan to the forum. I took the opportunity to thank Blue Skies members for their hard work and dedication, especially Mrs Margaret Ward whose passion showed through in a speech she presented later in the morning about the work of Blue Skies. Margaret’s daughter Mena, who was born with a disability, passed away last year at the age of 30. However, Margaret continues to dedicate her life to making sure people with a disability have access to all services, facilities and infrastructure and encourages people to be courageous in their deliberations and think outside the square. She said the plan was bold and congratulated the minister, whom she described as snappy, smart and energetic, but said that the minister could not do it all on her own. There is the whole of community, business and other government departments. The 10-year draft is community driven. This forum process and Blue Skies are assisting government to bring together a vision, priorities and strategies.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023225"></A>
Minister Palaszczuk travelled extensively throughout Queensland and met hundreds of families and people with a disability. These listening tours assisted her in identifying the key priorities included in the plan. The plan is both a vision and a call to action. It will build on what is happening now and has already attracted record investment in disability services in Queensland. In June this year the Premier and the disability services minister announced that the combined Commonwealth and state budgets would deliver a record $1.054 billion for specialist disability services for the coming financial year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023226"></A>
Queensland is leading the way when it comes to moving younger people with a disability from aged care facilities and diverting those at risk from entering these facilities. So far, more than 100 Queenslanders have moved from aged care facilities into supported accommodation. This government is also committed to supporting ageing carers. Under the disability assistance package we are investing $18.3 million to provide more supported accommodation for an extra 126 people with a disability, and at least half of these will be for people with a disability who have ageing carers. Our 10-year plan is about choice. It is about independence and, most importantly, it is about improving people’s quality of life. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023228"></A>
I also officially opened the new park-and-ride on Bribie Island on behalf of the transport minister, Hon. Rachel Nolan. This $4.2 million initiative will make public transport easier. It will allow commuters to park their cars--there is room for 120 with extra space if needed later--and transfer to a nearby bus service to complete their journey. It also includes disability parking close to the bus platform, direct pedestrian and bicycle access, bicycle storage facilities and a safe and comfortable waiting environment for passengers with sheltered areas, seating, bright lighting and a 24-hour video recording. There are also facilities for the bus drivers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023231"></A>
The park-and-ride will also assist in reducing traffic congestion between Bribie Island and Caboolture train station by encouraging public transport use and, therefore, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The state government’s TransLink Transit Authority’s role is to improve service and passenger information and oversee resources to ensure public transport infrastructure which will meet the demands of our growing population. The Bribie Island park-and-ride is another government project that I lobbied for and it is a great asset for public transport commuter users. I am proud of this government’s foresight in keeping up with the needs of our growing area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023234"></A>
I take this opportunity to congratulate all those involved in its construction and thank the Bribie Island bus company and their staff most sincerely for their considerable cooperation during the park-and-ride construction. I will walk a day in the shoes of a bus driver from the Bribie Island bus company within the next couple of weeks and I hope to share this experience with the House in the near future. </Hansard-Body>

That the bill be now read a second time.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023252"></A>
The bill currently before the House is designed to ensure that Queensland workers can enjoy the same rights and pay entitlements as their interstate counterparts as the holiday season approaches. To this end, the bill provides for the observance of two public holidays for Christmas Day this year on Saturday, 25 December and Tuesday, 28 December 2010, and two public holidays for New Year’s Day next year on Saturday, 1 January and Monday, 3 January 2011.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023254"></A>
The Holidays Act 1983 prescribes those days which are public holidays in Queensland. ‘25 December (Christmas Day)’ and ‘1 January (New Years Day)’ are listed as public holidays. The act also provides for the substitution of other days as public holidays. This year, Christmas Day falls on a Saturday and, without an amendment of the act, would not be a public holiday because Tuesday, 28 December was appointed as a substitute public holiday by gazettal on 28 August 2009. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023294"></A>
In 2011, New Year’s Day also falls on a Saturday. A substitute public holiday has not yet been appointed for that day, but in accordance with past precedent a substitute public holiday would usually be appointed on the following Monday, 3 January in such circumstances. If that substitution was made, Saturday, 1 January would cease to be a public holiday.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023295"></A>
When a day is appointed as a public holiday, workers are entitled to be absent from their employment on the day and still be paid their base rate of pay for their ordinary hours of work. Workers who agree to an employer’s reasonable request to work on a public holiday must be paid any penalty rates prescribed in the relevant award or agreement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023296"></A>
The current act does not permit the appointment of additional public holidays. An amendment to the act is required to permit the appointment of additional public holidays for Christmas Day 2010 and New Year’s Day 2011. Observance of two public holidays for Christmas Day 2010 on Saturday, 25 December 2010 and Tuesday, 28 December 2010, and two public holidays for New Year’s Day 2011 on Saturday, 1 January 2011 and Monday, 3 January 2011, as proposed by this bill, gives all employees the enjoyment of a break from work at a special time of the year or an entitlement to penalty rates on each of the prescribed public holidays if they choose or are required to work on those days.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023297"></A>
Although Queensland’s private sector industrial relations jurisdiction has been referred to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Fair Work Act 2009 recognises as a public holiday any day declared or prescribed under a law of a state to be observed within the state as a public holiday. Therefore, this bill’s amendment of the act to provide for the observance of a public holiday for Christmas Day on both 25 and 28 December 2010 and for New Year’s Day on both 1 and 3 January 2011 will activate public holiday entitlements for those days under federal modern awards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023299"></A>
In the private sector, there are a number of industries operating seven days a week where workers will potentially work on Saturday, 25 December or Saturday, 1 January. These industries include hospitality, accommodation, tourism, heavy industries such as mining, and the retail industry. In the public sector, many health workers, firefighters and ambulance officers will also work on those days. It is only fair and appropriate that those workers be compensated for being away from their families and friends, particularly on Christmas Day, one of the most special family occasions of the year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023300"></A>
The bill before the parliament may result in increased costs to employers, including the government, through the potential for payment of public holiday penalty rates on 25 and 28 December and on 1 and 3 January. However, it is the government’s view that this cost will more than be offset by the benefit to hardworking employees who would otherwise receive no benefit for working on Christmas Day or New Year’s Day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023301"></A>
In introducing this bill, Queensland will be achieving consistency with other states. In Western Australia and New South Wales there are already arrangements in place for Christmas Day 2010 to observe a public holiday on Saturday, 25 December 2010, as well as an additional public holiday on 27 or 28 December. For New Year’s Day, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia each have arrangements in place whereby public holidays are observed on both Saturday, 1 January and Monday, 3 January.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023302"></A>
The amendment bill currently before the House changes public holiday arrangements specifically for Christmas Day 2010 and New Year’s Day 2011 only. By further legislative amendment to be introduced into the parliament in 2011, the government will ensure that this change to public holiday arrangements is made permanent for subsequent years when Christmas Day and Boxing Day fall on a Saturday. The government will also consider at that time whether the Holidays Act 1983 needs to be further amended to modernise the drafting and language of the act, which is now nearly 30 years old. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023304"></A>
Ensuring that all Queensland workers receive fair and equitable entitlements is of great importance. By determining what days are public holidays, the act continues to have a significant role in the activation of industrial entitlements of Queensland workers. It also plays an important role in determining standards of respite and rest for workers and creating opportunities for workers to better balance their work and family life. This bill amends the act to ensure that Queensland workers who have received inferior public holiday entitlements in the past do not suffer a loss of those entitlements this Christmas. That is why the Queensland government supports the bill before the House. I commend the Bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

 Even the true believers of the trade union movement know that this government has betrayed the principles on which the Labor Party was founded. They know that this government and this Premier will do and say anything and betray anyone in their desperate attempt to cling to political power. This toxic Labor government’s trademarks are deceit, deception and dishonesty. Perverting the facts is the stock-in-trade of the Labor government. We have had nearly two decades of trickery perpetrated by a Labor cabinet of charlatans, pretenders and fools. Warwick Capper has more credibility than this toxic long-term Labor government when it comes to integrity. We have endured years of ministers appearing in courts and inquiries and even serving time in jail, but now that Queenslanders are polishing--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The Treasurer loves talking about undergraduate stuff. He is such an expert at it because of his recent experience of it. Now that Queenslanders are polishing the baseball bats waiting for the next election, they come to this parliament with a grab bag of disjointed propositions. This comes from a group that made it legal to tell untruths to a parliamentary committee, and this bill does not fix that. Ultimately, that is the test for this government and it is one that it has failed. Labor changed the law to protect Gordon Nuttall, Labor made it legal to tell untruths to parliament and now Labor is flagging changing the electoral laws to try to stay in government. The contents of this bill are small beer by comparison, as we are faced with a Labor government that will contort and twist the laws in this state to protect its own or to stay in power. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023322"></A>
Let me turn now to a consideration of the bills in detail. The Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill 2010 is part of the government’s attempt to create the image that it is doing something about the smell of corruption that has surrounded it for years. In particular, this bill is a reaction to the activities of a ministerial adviser about whom the CMC conducted public hearings in November and December 2009. There were accusations of directing a public servant to ensure that money to support a rugby club was provided from moneys being made available to the Queensland Rugby Union. Notwithstanding that, from a leak in today’s <Hansard-Italic>
Australian </Hansard-Italic>
newspaper, no-one is to face any criminal charges from the CMC inquiry, it is clear that the disclosures during those hearings--of the way in which Labor apparatchiks have abused their role by directing the Public Service to take actions favourable to the ALP and against the opposition--have embarrassed the government into taking this action. It is clearly arguable that this bill represents an attempt to ameliorate any adverse impacts from the CMC report. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023323"></A>
However, what the government has done in this bill, as I will demonstrate, does not constitute a cure for the cancer that the actions of Labor operatives have been on the Public Service of Queensland. The bill will not protect the Queensland Public Service from bullying and improper directions being given by Labor Party factional operatives. This bill seeks to have ministerial and opposition office staff employed under this specific bill rather than, as currently applies, under the Public Service Act. Is the government planning to effect any real change in the terms and conditions of those employees? The answer is no. Why, then, is this bill being introduced? It is nothing more than an attempt to be seen to be doing something. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023325"></A>
Part 2 of the bill provides for the employment of advisers who are now to be termed ‘staff members’. It is interesting to note that clause 6 of the bill makes it clear that in ministers’ offices the staff members are appointed on the recommendation of the Premier and not the minister concerned. In the faction ridden world of the Queensland ALP, that means that a minister not of Premier Bligh’s faction will have a spy in their office reporting directly back to the Premier. I bet ‘Big Bill’, who assured the Premier she still has his backing probably in the same way he backed ‘Kevin 07’, will be conditioning his continued support for the Premier on the basis of having his AWU acolytes placed in ministerial offices, such as that of the good Socialist Left member the member for Stretton. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027022"></A>
It is also interesting to note that, as at present, staff are to be formally employed by the chief executive of the Premier’s department. While this might be acceptable if the Premier had an apolitical chief executive, the actions of the current incumbent in that position indicate that there is a real risk of a potential abuse of power in that regard, at least by the Premier’s current chief executive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027023"></A>
The Premier’s current chief executive has based his career in the Queensland public sector on following the interests of the Premier and her Left faction. To suggest that he is in any way impartial in the manner of the traditional Public Service is to deny reality. How interesting to note in the <Hansard-Italic>
Weekend Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 the criticism of the Premier’s director-general by Dr Ross Fitzgerald, that great supporter and confidant of former Premier Beattie. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027025"></A>
This situation highlights yet again why democracy in Queensland continues to remain at the threat of a long-term entrenched government that will do anything to maintain itself in power. It is quite wrong that an identified supporter of the government should continue to have a say on issues such as the employment of opposition office staff. As the opposition has observed in connection with the overturning of the traditional rules for opposition advertising, this director-general acts in a partisan and political manner to protect this Premier from legitimate criticism. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027026"></A>
All decisions as to the employment of opposition staff and indeed all supervision of opposition expenditures must be removed from the oversight of the director-general and placed in the hands of an independent and impartial authority, such as the Queensland Parliamentary Service. It is only in this way that democracy can be protected in Queensland. The opposition is not part of the superstructure of government. We are a fundamental element in the process of parliament and should be respected and protected as such. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027027"></A>
Let us now consider further problems with this bill. Part 3, division 1 of the bill highlights the potential for conflict to occur. Under clause 14(1) a ministerial staff member can be the subject of a direction from both his employing member--that is, the minister--and the Premier. What happens if these directions conflict? How is this to be resolved? The bill provides no answer to this question. This conflict is exacerbated when you consider clause 14(3), which allows a more senior staff member to direct a ministerial staff member. Again, I ask: what about the potential for conflict? Presumably the junior staff member obeys the senior staff member. However, who directs the senior staff member? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027028"></A>
Clause 15 of the bill highlights the whole absurdity of the government’s actions with the bill. In an attempt to overcome the recent CMC investigated situation of a ministerial adviser giving a direction to a public servant, it is provided that a public servant cannot be subject to a direction of a ministerial staff member. Yet clause 15(2) goes on to provide that the same ministerial staff member can give a direction to a public servant if he is acting on behalf of a person who may lawfully give a direction. By way of example, it is pointed out that a minister may give a chief executive a direction under the Public Service Act, section 100. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027029"></A>
I ask: what public servant faced with direction from a ministerial staff member is going to ask that staff member whether he or she is acting on behalf of the minister in giving such a direction? Only a public servant who has no interest in a long-term career would be so bold as to ask such a question of a ministerial staff member and seek to establish whether that ministerial staff member is indeed properly authorised by the minister. The reality of life is that the bill in no way overcomes the potential abuse of power which ministerial advisers have engaged in. Even today’s <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 has described the bureaucracy as having inadequate and opaque processes that have muddied the waters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027030"></A>
Division 2 of part 3 contains the usual feel good terms one can expect to find in this government’s legislation. It is actions, not words, that show the real way in which a government works. The practice of the ALP has always been ‘whatever it takes’ to win. That is the motto. Again, it is interesting to note that it is the Premier’s partisan chief executive who is supposed to apply these ethical standards to staff members as well as approve codes of conduct under division 3. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027031"></A>
Division 4 seeks to convert into a statutory obligation the existing requirements about declarations of interest. The purpose is no doubt to avoid conflicts of interest between the personal interests of the staff member and the interests of the employing member or minister et cetera. However, the division makes no provision for the resolution of these conflicts save in clause 25(2), which, in effect, empowers the employing member to give a direction to resolve the conflict. What happens if the direction is not followed or complied with is unclear. Can the minister give a staff member a direction to sell assets, close accounts et cetera? Who determines what is an appropriate and just outcome? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027032"></A>
In part 4, clause 26 gives the chief executive power to issue directives in relation to a staff member. Such a directive could thus be given by the government appointed chief executive to an opposition office staff member responsible to the Leader of the Opposition. This again highlights how anomalous the position is under this bill as regards opposition office staff and why they should be responsible to an independent office--for example, the Queensland Parliamentary Service, as I have already said, as opposed to a government appointed chief executive of the Premier’s department. It is claimed in the explanatory notes that directions to be given by the chief executive under clause 26 are to be consistent with directions given under the Public Service Act 2008. Whether or not this will occur in practice is of course a matter that only time will tell. </Hansard-Body>

Another interesting clause in this bill is clause 33, which enables the chief executive to establish advisory committees to advise the Premier on issues relevant to this bill. Not only that; provision is made to pay people to be on such advisory committees. One can imagine what rorts this will engender. Given that this Premier and her predecessor in office have appointed ministerial staff members in an attempt to ensure that factional enemies in cabinet are kept on a short leash, with the ministerial staff member reporting back to the Premier’s office on the actions of the ministers they are appointed to monitor, no doubt factional favourites will be given yet another plum position from which they can bludge on the Queensland taxpayer. </Hansard-Body>

Given the nature of this bill, the various transitional and consequential amendments contained in the bill are understandable. The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee has made a number of interesting comments about this bill in particular. The committee considers that clause 44, which amends the definition of ‘person employed in the Public Service’ to include ‘staff members’ under the bill, and clause 45, which provides a person employed in the Public Service includes a ministerial staff member, have the potential to affect the rights and liberties of individuals. The committee also raised concerns about clause 15 and the capacity to allow delegation of administrative power other than in appropriate cases and to appropriate persons. The committee commented at paragraph 28--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027037"></A>
However, the committee notes that the legislation is to regulate non-departmental staff. Delegation of administrative power regarding the management of the department to a ‘staff member’ may be a delegation in an inappropriate case or to an inappropriate person. The committee invites the minister to provide information regarding the consistency of clause 15 with section 4(3) (c) of the <Hansard-Italic>
Legislative Standards Act </Hansard-Italic>
and how the proposed provision would work in practice, including whether the delegation of administrative power needs to be in writing. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027038"></A>
It will be interesting to see if the Premier takes the committee’s advice on this issue. The logic of the numbers will no doubt see the passage of this bill through the parliament. However, it will in no way provide a cure for the cancer of interference in the Public Service by the Labor Party and its operatives. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1027039"></A>
Let me turn now to the next bill in this package, the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2010. This bill contains amendments to a series of acts being introduced as part of the government’s much heralded so-called integrity reform package. Again, like so much of the package of reform, there is not always a lot of substance in what is proposed. First is amendments to the Ambulance Service Act 1991. The main matters covered by these amendments so far as ambulance officers are concerned seem to be an attempt in clause 6 to require potential ambulance recruits to make a declaration if they have been the subject of serious disciplinary action in the past. The following definition is being inserted by these amendments--</Hansard-Body>

serious disciplinary action</Hansard-Bold>
, in relation to a person, means--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

(a)	disciplinary action under a relevant disciplinary law involving--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

(ii)	reduction of classification level or rank; or</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>

(iii)	transfer or redeployment to other employment; or</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>

(iv)	reduction of remuneration level; or</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1027048"></A>
(b)	a disciplinary declaration under a public sector disciplinary law that states a disciplinary action mentioned in paragraph (a) (i) or (ii) as the disciplinary action that would have been taken against the person if the person’s employment had not ended.’. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027049"></A>
Whether this applies only to prior public sector employment as opposed to prior private sector employment is unclear. No mention was made by the Premier in her second reading speech of the reasons behind this move. This is typical of the attitude of this Premier to this parliament. Because she has the numbers, she treats this parliament as her plaything. Her speech on this bill was similar to the speeches on the other bills of this so-called package--say little, repeat the key words ‘integrity, ethics, accountability’, which her focus groups have told her to repeat, and use the numbers to ram the bill through parliament. No doubt she will protest, ‘But this has all been considered by my integrity round table,’ but that is not a sufficient reason for this parliament merely to accept her word. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027051"></A>
Why have not all of the bills in this package been the subject of consideration by a committee of this parliament? The answer is: this Premier does not trust her own members to rationally and objectively consider these issues. Instead, she seeks to use these bills to hide the manifest failures of her government. What else is the Premier seeking to do with this bill? She is seeking to ensure that, if an ambulance officer or a fire service officer are subject to disciplinary proceedings, those proceedings can continue after they leave the service. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
Before the break I was speaking about the changes in the legislation that are going to mean that ambulance officers and fire service officers are subject to disciplinary proceedings and that those proceedings can continue after they leave the service. The question is: why is the Premier engaged in this pursuit of officers? Is it because she does not want them blowing the whistle on how bad things really are in these services? ‘Even if you resign we will still come and get you’ is the message. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034012"></A>
Perhaps the Premier will do the people of Queensland and this parliament a courtesy and provide an explanation for these provisions. What examples can she produce to justify pursuing officers over disciplinary matters when they are no longer part of the service? What terrible people have been able to escape punishment because these provisions do not exist at present? How has the community been damaged? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034013"></A>
I venture to suggest to this House that the Premier will not be able to produce much in the way of hard evidence to support her legislative approach. Instead I suggest that this, like much of what the Premier does, is no more than yet another hollow attempt to hide the failings of her administration in the rhetoric of purity of purpose and mind. Keep repeating the mantra--ethics, accountability and integrity--long enough and she might even come to believe it personally. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034014"></A>
We also see in this bill the empowering of chief executives to order people to undertake compulsory medical and psychological examinations. All too often in the Queensland public sector powers of this type are abused in order to get rid of employees who are upsetting their managers, causing problems or bucking the system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034015"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Dick:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 What’s your evidence? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034016"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I have had people approach my office. The question is: how often is this power abused? In the absence of an objective, impartial examination of this power, it is difficult to comment. But the question must be asked: why is it now being incorporated for ambulance and fire service officers? Again, the Premier has not supplied an answer to date. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034017"></A>
Under the proposed amendments, the chief executive is not required to comply with the principles of natural justice in suspending an officer on normal remuneration. This provision is based on similar existing provisions within the Public Service Act 2008. But that, of itself, does not provide a justification. An officer is suspended only if the chief executive reasonably believes there is a ground for taking disciplinary action against the officer and that the suspension will not deprive the person of any income or rights relating to continuity of employment. The provisions also include a requirement for a chief executive to consider alternative duties before suspending a person. Whether or not these provisions will be applied fairly is yet to be confirmed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034019"></A>
The proposed amendments to the Ambulance Service Act 1991 also provide that, if the chief executive suspends an officer, the chief executive may decide that the suspension is not on normal remuneration. How the chief executive is to make this decision is not set out in the bill. This provision is based on similar existing provisions within the Public Service Act 2008 which provide that the chief executive is required to comply with a relevant directive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034020"></A>
While the amendments reflect the approach under the Public Service Act 2008, the relevant instrument will be a code of practice. As I will refer to later, these codes of practice are in effect delegated legislation that this parliament is not given the power to disallow by this legislation. The question is: why are these codes not subject to the scrutiny of this House? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034022"></A>
In addition, the amendments to the Ambulance Service Act 1991 and the Fire and Rescue Service Act 1990 to implement a postseparation disciplinary regime may not be consistent with fundamental legislative principles. The amendments are similar to provisions contained in the Public Service Act 2008 and the Police Service Administration Act 1991. What is the justification? How many offenders are escaping justice? Let the Premier come and tell the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034027"></A>
I turn now to the Auditor-General Act 2009. The amendments to the Auditor-General Act 2009 are claimed by the government to parallel amendments being made to the Parliament of Queensland Act 2001 in relation to declarations of interest by members of parliament. Those amendments are claimed to give statutory effect to the existing provisions under standing orders in relation to declarations of interest by members of parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034028"></A>
The hypocrisy of the Bligh government is again illustrated by this argument. This is the government that, in order to protect corrupt minister Gordon Nuttall from being considered for prosecution by the Director of Public Prosecutions, as recommended by the CMC, recalled parliament, repealed a specific provision of the Criminal Code about telling untruths to parliament that Nuttall had clearly arguably breached, substituted instead a breach of standing orders and then used its numbers to immediately clear Nuttall of such a breach. This Premier was intimately involved in this whole process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034029"></A>
Why now is the same government arguing that it needs the power of a statutory provision to support a provision clearly covered by the standing orders of the parliament? The answer is clear. It is expedient to do so now due to the smell of corruption that now pervades everything that this government does. Not only are members of parliament being used in a desperate attempt to provide a fig leaf to cover this government’s actions; in addition statutory officers, such as the Auditor-General, are to be subject to the same regime in a desperate attempt to provide some justification for this government’s actions. No doubt through the use of this government’s numbers this amendment will be passed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034030"></A>
Let us look at what is being proposed in this amendment. The Auditor-General, in addition to his responsibilities to the Speaker and other parliamentarians, is now to be subject to having his declarations of interest subject to oversight by the Integrity Commissioner under clause 12(7) (e) of the bill. The government suggests that this supports the role of the Integrity Commissioner in promoting Queensland’s public sector integrity and ethics. If, however, it is necessary to have the Integrity Commissioner overlooking the Auditor-General’s interests, who is overlooking the Integrity Commissioner’s interests? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034034"></A>
It should be noted that in amendments to the Integrity Act 2009 proposed elsewhere in this bill--that is at clause 60, proposed new section 80(7)--no similar approach is being adopted in relation to the declaration of interest obligations being imposed on the Integrity Commissioner. This difference in treatment between the Auditor-General and the Integrity Commissioner raises real doubts about the political objectives that this government is seeking to achieve under this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034037"></A>
The rest of the amendments in relation to the Auditor-General do not raise issues of significant concern for the opposition other than displaying an approach of virtually presupposing that an Auditor-General or Deputy Auditor-General will indeed be caught up in some conflict of interest and so provision is being made for this potentiality. This does not say much for the faith that this government has in the process for the appointment of the Auditor-General or Deputy Auditor-General. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034039"></A>
I turn now to the Civil Liability Act 2003. We were told by the Premier that the amendments to this act were ‘to allow apologies to be made without being taken as an admission of legal liability’. We were then told ‘this amendment will allow the government as well as any other person to acknowledge mistakes through an apology where the actions may have caused harm’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034040"></A>
I suppose the House should be happy for at least that acknowledgement from the Premier. The amendment is nothing more than an attempt to reflect in legislation the Peter Beattie political excuse and chest-beating process and give it legislative substance so as to facilitate media management and manipulation. Boy, doesn’t this government need to say sorry for all its maladministration! </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037230"></A>
Let us have a look at some of the stuff-ups this amendment will now allow the Premier to apologise for: the failed Traveston Dam, with the ruined lives and businesses, destroyed families and deaths; the failed South-East Queensland water grid, with billions of dollars being spent on a desalination plant that is not working properly, water pipelines that are rusting and will need replacement well within their normal expected life span and recycled water that no-one in industry will willing buy; and a Health payroll system managed by the members for Lytton and Rockhampton which still cannot pay health workers correctly after nearly six months and has cost taxpayers many hundreds of millions of dollars to date and which now has been abandoned as being the great new model for the whole of the public sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037238"></A>
I do not need to go on with this sorry saga. The House knows well how often this Premier will have to be up on her feet using this new mechanism of an apology to hide the manifest failures of her government. That this legislation is specifically designed to get this government out of trouble is arguably clear from the very provisions of what is being inserted. Proposed new section 72A provides that apologies do not apply to defamation action, unlawful intentional acts causing personal injury and unlawful sexual assault or misconduct. These constitute a significant area of civil litigation from which the use of an apology is being banned. Why is government being given a capacity to utilise an apology to manipulate the media when other persons in the community in similar positions are being denied this selfsame opportunity? I look forward to the Premier’s explanation of the partiality set out in this amendment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034078"></A>
I turn now to the Fire and Rescue Service Act 1990. Just as I have already raised concerns about amendments to the Ambulance Service, similar concerns exist about these amendments to the Fire and Rescue Service Act. Firies, just as much as ambos, deserve an explanation from the Premier about these amendments. Again, I ask for examples that the Premier can produce to justify continued disciplinary pursuit even when individuals have left the service. Where are the examples that can publicly justify this approach?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034081"></A>
With regard to the Government Owned Corporations Act 1993, if there is one element in this bill that exposes the lack of integrity of this government it is the amendment to this act, which exempts all of those government assets currently being disposed of from the supervision of the CMC. Given the history of this government with Labor luminaries such as Terry Mackenroth, Jim Elder, Con Sciacca and company in promoting schemes and getting success fees for deals requiring government approval, how many of these Labor mates are profiting from the current privatisation proposals? What success fees are being paid? Who is getting board appointments and lucrative consultancies? With this amendment the people’s capacity to find out about the way Labor does business is further limited. Even though the CMC does not necessarily have a great track record in this regard, under current chair former Justice Moynihan the possibility exists for an independent and impartial investigation if complaints are made. This amendment will cut off that possibility completely however. So much for a commitment to integrity reform by this Premier!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034084"></A>
I turn now to the Integrity Act 2009. These amendments continue the expansion of the power of the Integrity Commissioner and of his capacity to intervene right the way across the public sector. Statutory officials such as the Auditor-General and the Ombudsman are now going to have the Integrity Commissioner prying into their declaration of interests, notwithstanding that they are statutory officers who have traditionally been responsible to the parliament and its committees. Apparently this Premier no longer trusts the Speaker, the parliament or parliamentary committees in relation to statutory officials. It is the Integrity Commissioner whom the Premier is going to rely on and whom she is empowering. The logic of numbers will keep enhancing the role of the Integrity Commissioner under this government to the detriment of our traditional accountability officials.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034088"></A>
Proposed new section 72A of the Integrity Act 2009 will allow a responsible person for a government representative to give the Integrity Commissioner information, including personal information, about lobbying activity. This section arguably has an effect on a person’s right to privacy, potentially breaching a fundamental legislative principle. The government argues that this section is not objectionable as the information may only be disclosed if it is relevant to the functions or powers of the Integrity Commissioner and the information disclosed may already be known to the Integrity Commissioner--for example, the names of registered lobbyists as listed on the lobbyist register maintained by the Integrity Commissioner. In addition, the protections in the Information Privacy Act 2009 will apply to the Integrity Commissioner in dealing with any personal information provided. To accept the government’s argument on this point one would have to accept that the role of the Integrity Commissioner was not to protect this government, and the question is: can one do that?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034091"></A>
I turn now to the Ombudsman Act 2001. Like the Auditor-General, the Ombudsman is being subjected to the enhanced role for the Integrity Commissioner that this government’s bill provides. Again, this is an example of a lack of faith by this government in the parliament and its processes and also in the holder of the office. There has never been in the history of this office in Queensland the slightest suggestion of any misdoing or abuse of office by successive holders of the office of Ombudsman. These amendments are nothing more than an attempt by this government to divert attention from its own misdoings and maladministration by subtly raising suggestions that it is showing its commitment to integrity by ensuring everyone but itself is being caught in the same net.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034093"></A>
The Parliament of Queensland Act 2001 is also contained within this bill, and once again this government is showing its lack of faith in the institution of the Queensland parliament and of its officers and members to behave correctly so far as their interests are concerned. This from a government and Premier who were prepared to abuse their power and this parliament to protect the former member for Sandgate from possible prosecution by abolishing any potential criminal offence and then using their numbers to allow him to merely apologise to the House! So the question is: what will these amendments do? They will take a matter that has traditionally been a matter regulated by the House under its standing orders under the control of the Speaker and turn the matter into a breach of a statutory obligation. Whilst a breach of a member’s obligations as to declarations of interest is apparently still to remain an issue of contempt for the House to determine, it is now clearly arguable that any minor breach--no matter how soon corrected by a member who apologises for the oversight--will almost certainly have to be referred by the Speaker to the committee to consider if contempt has occurred. No longer will Mr Speaker be able to exercise his traditional role of considering whether to refer a member to the committee. If there is a breach of statute--no matter how technical--it is clearly arguable that the matter must be considered by the committee as contempt. All members of this House should be aware that if they support this amendment they are placing a chain around their necks that one day might choke them for a minor and inadvertent error, and who has not made those in their life? During the recent sittings of parliament we had an example of the Minister for Police having to correct something that he had neglected to change in his pecuniary interest register. That is a salient point about the sorts of things that can be caught up with this change to making this statutory obligation which could have significant long-term effects, and I ask the Premier to clarify.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034099"></A>
The bill also amends sections 70 and 71 of the Parliament of Queensland Act 2001 to provide that the restrictions on members of parliament transacting business with the state only applies to agreements or contracts for the provision of goods by a member to an entity of the state. The bill also inserts a transitional provision that effectively applies the amendments inserted by the bill from 6 June 2002. This retrospective operation was not explained by the Premier in her second reading speech. The explanatory notes merely refer vaguely to being curative in nature. Curative of what? No explanation is provided as to why these provisions do not apply to the provision of services as well as the supply of goods, as is the normal manner of expression in legislation. Once again, this needs to be clarified by the Premier.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034103"></A>
Under the Public Sector Ethics Act 1994, which is also being amended, once again we are amending feelgood legislation, this time to impose new codes of conduct on the Public Service. One of the reasons the standards of service delivery by the Public Service has declined over the years has been that under the Labor government the delivery of effective outcomes has been replaced by a mania for process. Process as devised by the academics that haunt the teaching of public administration in Australia is king! Every ‘i’ must be dotted and every ‘t’ must be crossed before a decision can be made, and no wonder the bureaucracy is held in such poor regard by the general community. So now we are going to have new updated service-wide codes of conduct--all of which must be monitored, measured and revised by yet another layer of public administrators, and of course the Public Service Commission is given an even more enhanced role to monitor these codes. Are these codes in effect delegated legislation affecting the rights of all public sector employees? Why are they not made as proper delegated legislation and thus be subject to the potential for disallowance by this House? Perhaps the Premier can also explain this situation. An LNP government will give the Public Service tasks to achieve. We will concentrate on delivering outcomes for the people of Queensland, not process to provide employment for yet more bureaucrats.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037251"></A>
The Public Service Act 2008 is also captured here and these amendments, as I have indicated, are about expanding the roles and functions of the Public Service Commission and providing some justification for its existence and operations. Most of the amendments have nothing to do with issues of integrity but rather are normal machinery amendments that should be quite properly dealt with in a specific bill. The government itself has identified a number of potential breaches of fundamental legislative principles in its own bill, many of which have been highlighted by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. The amendments to the Public Service Act 2008 remove the requirement that the appeals officer obtain the agreement of the parties before deciding an appeal without a hearing. Allowing the appeals officer to decide an appeal without a hearing may breach the fundamental legislative principle that legislation should have sufficient regard to the rights and liberties of individuals as it denies the parties the right to verbally present their case.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037260"></A>
However, the appeals officer is required to observe natural justice and the parties will still have the ability to make written submissions. The purpose of the removal of this requirement is allegedly to promote timely decision making and to reduce the administrative burden. However, these provisions remove the traditional common law right that you should not be subject to a detriment without the right of natural justice to be heard. Again I ask: how can this possibly be justified under legislation allegedly dealing with integrity? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034152"></A>
I turn now to the issue of the lobbyist register. One issue that has been raised with me when discussing these bills is the operations of the lobbyists register and in particular the inconsistent approach that is being adopted in various ministers’ offices and departments. This House knows well the reason lobbyists have had to be regulated in Queensland is the behaviour of former Labor members and mates such as Terry Mackenroth, Jim Elder, Jim Soorley, Con Sciacca et cetera who have turned the Beattie-Bligh government into the best government that money can buy. But the question is: how much has been paid in success fees to these people over the years? How many board appointments have been made with the lucrative fees that flow therefrom into the Labor mates’ personal coffers? How much has flowed from these funds back into the Labor Holdings slush funds? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034154"></A>
There are many honourable individuals in the representation industry who offer business and individuals advice and assistance in negotiating the increasingly complex government structures that the Beattie and now Bligh governments have created. It is a pity that these honourable individuals and firms are having their reputations tarnished by the actions of the Labor mates cartel that has operated in Queensland over the past 20-odd years. If we are to have these controls to protect the community from the Labor mates, then these controls need to be applied fairly and objectively and not be allowed to be varied by Labor ministers helping out their factional masters and supporters in the lobbying industry. The LNP will be keeping a close scrutiny on these developments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034155"></A>
To suggest that this bill is all sweetness and light and a positive step forward to enhance integrity in Queensland is gilding the lily. All this bill really does is enhance bureaucracy and hobble the Queensland Public Service with even more process than it had before. The Premier is seeking to wrap herself in a cloak of righteousness to conceal her many failings and those of her government. The people of Queensland saw through Labor’s deceit at the recent federal election. I know that they will also do so at the next state election. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034157"></A>
I turn now to the final bill in this package, the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2010. This bill is another part of this government’s integrity reform package and is an attempt to escape the miasma of corruption that has surrounded the ALP. No amount of cover-up will enable this Premier to deny that she sat in cabinet with a corrupt minister, supported him during the whole of his time in office and went so far as supporting the use of the ALP’s parliamentary majority to remove an over 100-year-old law that prevented ministers from telling untruths to parliament and exonerated that minister from any breach of parliamentary practice or procedure. In effect, this bill is a replacement for the Whistleblowers Protection Act 1994. Under that act and under this bill, some limited protection at least is provided to insiders who expose corruption and maladministration in the government and its agencies. The opposition will not be opposing the bill, although a number of matters of concern about the bill will be raised.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034159"></A>
Whistleblowers are a very important group of people who, at sometimes considerable risk to themselves personally and to their careers and financial security, expose the internal failures of governments and their departments. Given the size and scope of government today and given the willingness of governments, particularly the Bligh Labor government, to exploit their position and power to protect themselves against any adverse criticism, whistleblowers are vitally important to uncovering maladministration. Would the disasters of public administration at the Bundaberg Base Hospital have even been exposed without the courage of whistleblowers such as nurse Toni Hoffman, who put her own career on the line to expose the failures? The pressures placed on her were widely exposed during both the Morris and Davies commissions of inquiry. If we are to return good public administration practices to Queensland, members of this House should always have at the forefront of their minds the matters exposed during those inquiries and the lessons that need to be learned.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034161"></A>
Yet the position today in Queensland Health has not changed. It is still worth your job in Queensland Health, in Education Queensland--and indeed in any agency of this government--to expose the many failures of public administration that exist in those departments. What happened to the senior public servant in the recent case that the CMC investigated? He allegedly voluntarily resigned. So much for supporting public servants who do what they are supposed to do and report potential problems.</Hansard-Body>

Whilst the intention of the Whistleblowers Protection Act is laudable, it has failed to provide real protection for genuine whistleblowers. This bill also suffers from the self-same problem of not providing real protection for the whistleblower. The fundamental problem underlying both the Whistleblowers Protection Act and this bill is that both seek to place the responsibility for protecting whistleblowers on the very persons who are often responsible for the problem in the first place, namely, the chief executives of government departments. If those chief executives were part of an independent and impartial Public Service, then there might be an argument in favour of placing the responsibility on them to protect whistleblowers. However, the reality is that, under the Beattie-Bligh government, chief executives are appointed by the Premier of the day, owe a personal responsibility to that Premier and are tasked with the fundamental responsibility of achieving the political objectives of that Premier and ensuring that Premier’s re-election. Any whistleblower who seeks to expose maladministration that impacts on the Premier, the Premier’s government and the chief executives, whose own survival is dependent on the survival of the Premier, is likely to receive short shrift from any chief executive to whom whistleblowers apply for help. However, any legislation that seeks to provide some support for whistleblowers is better than nothing. So for that reason the opposition will not be opposing this bill. </Hansard-Body>

There are, however, some comments that need to be made on what is being proposed. Clause 12 of the bill is a welcome extension of the matters that constitute a public interest disclosure by its extension to cover matters that satisfy either an objective or a subjective test. However, the way in which the test is expressed is open to some debate. Under clause 12(3), it is required under subclause (a) that a person honestly believes on reasonable grounds, or (b) that the information tends to show the conduct or other matter, regardless of whether the person honestly believes the information tends to show the conduct or other matter. My question is: why under (a) do you need to combine an honest belief with any question as to whether the belief is reasonable? Would it not be better to base protection for whistleblowers merely on the honesty of their belief? If they believe honestly in a matter, surely they should be entitled to protection. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034164"></A>
Clause 13 continues to confine matters that can be subject to a public interest disclosure to those matters covered in the Whistleblowers Protection Act. They are still subject to requirements that matters must be ‘substantial’ and ‘specific’ et cetera. These qualifiers act as an inhibition to disclosure of maladministration particularly, when the government is championing its extension of disclosures to matters honestly held.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1034165"></A>
Division 2 of the bill continues the same restrictions that exist under the current Whistleblowers Protection Act. It makes the public sector entity about which the whistleblower is complaining the body to receive the complaint and the body to investigate if the whistleblower is suffering reprisals. I think this is clearly Caesar judging Caesar. This bill still makes the chief judicial officer of a court responsible to receive public interest disclosures about the court. The time is coming when we in Queensland, without any reflection on current incumbents in the chief judicial officer positions, will have to establish, as other jurisdictions have done, an independent and impartial body to consider such public interest disclosures. Judicial commissions are now well-established and well-respected bodies that give individuals who have matters of concern about judicial behaviour access to a publicly accountable review agency. That mechanism in no way impacts on the independence of the judiciary and will arguably assist in enhancing the reputation of the Queensland judiciary in the general community.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1034166"></A>
Part 3 of the bill makes provision for public interest disclosures in relation to corporate entities under the City of Brisbane Act and the Local Government Act as well as government owned corporations. These provisions are easily supportable. However, what is less supportable is the exemption provided for in the dictionary definition of GOC in schedule 4, which exempts those assets that this government is selling under its current privatisation plans. If there is one area of public administration where the activities of whistleblowers should be encouraged and supported, it is in relation to those assets sales. How much money will those who have surrounded and duchessed the current Treasury be making out of these deals? As I have asked before, what so-called success fees are going to be paid and to whom? The government does not want to provide potential whistleblowers with any opportunity to expose these matters.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034170"></A>
Clause 20 in part 4 makes limited provisions to enable a whistleblower to complain to a journalist. However, this occurs only if certain conditions are fulfilled, namely, that the entity to which the public interest disclosure is made did not investigate or deal with the matter, or did not recommend any action in relation to the disclosure, or did not notify the complainant within six months of the date of disclosure. Nothing highlights more clearly the attempts of this government to maintain concealment of wrongdoing than this provision. This provision means that at least six months must expire after the original complaint is made before a whistleblower can lawfully approach a journalist about the matter. This will ensure that matters are stale and perhaps of little public importance to the media when they can be drawn to the media’s attention. This is yet another example of how this government seeks to create the image of protecting whistleblowers whilst at the same time ensuring that nothing effective is in actual fact achieved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037569"></A>
Chapter 3 sets out the obligations on a public sector entity when a public interest disclosure is made. This includes reasonable procedures to ensure that public officers of the entity who make public interest disclosures are given appropriate support and afforded protection against reprisals; that public interest disclosures are properly assessed and, where appropriate, properly investigated and dealt with; that appropriate action is taken in relation to any wrongdoing identified by a public interest disclosure; and that a management program for public interest disclosures for the entity, consistent with the standard issued under section 60, is implemented. Chapter 3 also goes on to provide for what happens if the public sector entity determines that no action is required or if it decides to refer the matter to another body for investigation. Provision is made to give the person who made the public interest disclosure and the oversight agency information about such a decision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037572"></A>
Chapter 3, part 3 gives a member of the Legislative Assembly who receives a public interest disclosure the capacity to refer such disclosure to another body for investigation. Whilst in clause 35 it is provided that public interest disclosure to an MP from this place does not impact upon the immunities, powers et cetera of the parliament, what happens when an MP refers a matter to a public sector agency under clause 34? Does the potential of parliamentary privilege still exist to provide some shield for the whistleblower? Is the MP still free to raise the issue in parliament or are they, in effect, made functus officio by referring the matter to the public sector agency? These are issues that need to be further addressed by this parliament.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037573"></A>
Under chapter 4, provision is made to provide protection for those people who make public interest disclosures. This includes the absence of civil or criminal liability, clause 36; absolute privilege from defamation, clause 38; and protection from reprisals, clause 40. Reprisals are punishable as an offence, clause 41, as well as being a tort for which damages are recoverable, clause 42.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037574"></A>
The bill in clause 43 extends the vicarious liability of a public sector entity for any reprisals made by one of their employees. This is, of course, a good principle for the community to adopt. However, as per usual, this government has given itself an out from liability by clause 43(2). All it has to do is prove on the balance of probabilities that it has taken reasonable steps to prevent any reprisal. No doubt strategic plans et cetera will be prepared to ensure that all departments are able to avail themselves of this provision. I think it is hypocritical of the Premier to suggest that she is enhancing the role of whistleblowers when, in fact, she is doing her best to shut up the whistleblowers who are exposing the multiple failures of her government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037575"></A>
Clause 44 purports to give a whistleblower a capacity to utilise the antidiscrimination methodology to protect themselves from reprisals. It is suggested that this is a viable alternative to litigation. This is just not so. Anyone who has had any dealings with the antidiscrimination system in Queensland knows that this is a mechanism about which little is known or publicised--yet another way of hiding matters away with a group of government appointees who can be relied on to do the right thing by the government that appoints them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037576"></A>
Clause 45 of the bill is yet another example of the way in which this government seeks to camouflage its real intention. This enables an agency to take action against a whistleblower through utilising what is termed ‘reasonable management action’. An attempt is made to define what this constitutes in the following terms--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1037577"></A>
(a)	a reasonable appraisal of the employee’s work performance; </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

(h)	a reasonable action in relation to the employee’s failure to obtain a promotion, reclassification, transfer or benefit, or to retain a benefit, in relation to the employee’s employment.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037585"></A>
However, all this begs the question: who determines what is reasonable and when is it determined? Whilst it might eventually be possible through litigation or appeal or determination by the oversight agency to have this decision objectively determined, the reality of the real world is that the whistleblower is immediately subject to attack by the midlevel managers whose failures are often the cause of the whistleblowing in the first place. How many whistleblowers have been broken in Queensland by having their positions reviewed or made redundant to requirements or by being subjected to compulsory medical and psychological testing with a view to forced medical retirement? All of these punishments are no doubt justified on the basis as being part of, as I quoted before, ‘reasonable management practice’. The reality of life is that this is the way the stirrer-whistleblower is got rid of by the system. This government in this clause is doing nothing more than giving its minions in the Public Service a legal basis to exert more pressure on those who wish to expose the maladministration of this government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037586"></A>
Chapter 5 of the bill which relates to the establishment of an oversight agency raises some real concerns. Clause 58 makes the Public Service Commission the oversight agency. Of course, like all senior executive appointments under this government, the Public Service Commission is composed of persons appointed by and responsible to this government. They are the Public Service Commissioner, the director-general of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet, the Under Treasurer and whichever director-general is responsible for what is left of industrial relations in this state, the director-general of the department of justice at this time. Yet this is the body which is supposed to oversight the way in which the other senior executives appointed by and responsible to this government handle public interest disclosures about this government’s maladministration.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037587"></A>
The alleged oversight agency role is set out in clause 59, yet when one examines the provision all one sees is that, as I was advised in the briefing on this bill, this allegedly is a role about collecting statistics and examining systems. There is no need to appoint a government controlled body such as the Public Service Commission to do this. How does this improve the standard of protection for whistleblowers who have made a public interest disclosure? Rather, this is yet another way in which the political interests of this government can continue to be protected by yet another of its politically appointed agencies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037588"></A>
The dangers in this approach are well illustrated when one considers clause 63, which deals with the relationship between the oversight agency--the Public Service Commission--and the Crime and Misconduct Commission and the Ombudsman. Both of these bodies are responsible to the parliament as a whole, as opposed to the government of the day. The capacity of the government of the day to influence and control their internal activities is much more limited and diffused. Yet clause 63 enables the Public Service Commission to act as oversight agency in relation to how those bodies handle any internal public interest disclosure from within the agency. This is a gross interference with the rights of the parliament and yet another example of how this government seeks to regulate and control the activities of any public agency that it does not directly control.</Hansard-Body>

As has been previously stated, the opposition will not be opposing the bills covered in this cognate debate. We do not, however, believe that they contain the best possible mechanisms that can be used to ensure fundamental integrity is practised by a government that is fundamentally rotten to the core. As with so much of the legislation of the Beattie and Bligh governments, it is all showy surface with no internal merit or substance. </Hansard-Body>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (3.07 pm): Like all other speakers, I find it very hard to respond to this bill without laughing. A cognate debate of three bills--addressing ministerial officers, integrity reform and public disclosure--has been introduced by the Premier. All are suboptimal. What is not funny is that it is being delivered by a person who is the Premier of our great state, with its 150-year history of democracy--from an amazing convict colony beginning built on the basis of accepting the worst rejects that Britain felt it no longer could place--and the Premier thinks integrity is a statement that one can claim without living it. Has history really repeated itself such that a government could have become both so disconnected from the public and so brazen that it has destroyed all the trust the public has been persuaded over years to place in it? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037592"></A>
In all fairness, this first bill addresses the legislative framework for employing ministerial staff, the justification being, in the Premier’s own words in her second reading speech, ‘reflecting the differing and quite separate roles of ministerial staff and public servants’. The Premier has gone to some lengths to explain the powers, roles and responsibilities of those staff. She explains that they are not empowered to direct public servants in their own right. I agree with the intention of the bill with regard to these staff. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040717"></A>
It also says that, although they have different roles and have a different role to ordinary public servants, their own personal security is linked inextricably with that of their masters. They are truly the servants of their masters, not the public, and their political masters are the government. Their appointments are made by the director-general, the Premier and the cabinet on the recommendation of the Premier, opposition leader and, in only a few cases, a member of the parliament. One would almost wonder how they feel when each poll result or public survey is announced. Are the fluctuating fortunes of those in the public eye only just a fraction of the greater scene, with an enormous group of support staff watching, listening, sensing, living and breathing every last word or action of their political masters? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040720"></A>
Of course, some of these special people just accept whatever fate may befall them, good or bad. The difference between success or failure depends on whether their member or minister connects with the public or remains in the political favour of those in leadership. What often seems to be lacking is the credibility or capacity of the minister or member, for it is perception that rules the day. Sadly, it is just that, the day: who won the day, not really who lost, for if one won then the others either lost or were just ignored. To be ignored repeatedly is to be forgotten. To be forgotten is to be irrelevant. A ministerial staffer’s job swings on that balance in the wind. In some cases of perceived or real transgression or crime, some staffers are persuaded to accept blame and exit stage left. </Hansard-Body>

This bill is the response to a Labor minister getting stuck and her adviser being left to improvise with the public servants that he faced. This morning’s <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 has named Simon Tutt as about to be exonerated. Maybe he felt like this when he was faced with the pressures and he was not certain what to do. The pressures can be just too great. For all this wonderful work, either nothing works or seems to work and their own lives become so difficult with strained families and relationships that grow distant as they try to please their masters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040724"></A>
Certainly on our side of politics I remember Greg Jackson very fondly. Some may also remember him in the same way. He had many of the fine traces of people who loyally give all of themselves, often to their own peril. Maybe when they have no more to give, their own lives seem worthless and because their own futures are so inextricably linked to their masters, they lose control of their own lives and destiny. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040725"></A>
I realise that modern political machines cannot seem to function without such people. It is, indeed, timely that this bill attempts to implement a framework of ethical behaviour, including declaration of interest, codes of conduct and application of the CMC and other judicial instruments. What is tragic is that there are two groups, one supporting the current Labor government of the day and the other spartan supporting the organisation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040726"></A>
Irrespective of all these ridiculous statements by the current government about the best resourced opposition, we have a state Labor government which employed a vast army of journalists, media advisers, hacks and hangers-on. After 12 years of continuous governing and a diminishing ability to employ anyone just to try to plug every leak, the walls are fracturing and morale is failing. Most are wondering what will happen when the music stops, for inevitably it will and their jobs will be gone. For others who feel they might be able to claim Public Service status, their fear is irrelevance, a generation of non-government, and, for some, a Gulag--leftists and communist created gulags. So the thought is all too close to home for these people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040728"></A>
The second bill is the integrity reform bill. It is very difficult not to support anything that purports to be implementing integrity reform in Queensland. This bill is primarily to deliver a single code of conduct for the Public Service. It would be wrong to say that everything the Premier comes into parliament with is just a cynical vote-buying exercise to save her from both political oblivion and public long-lasting acrimony. However, to introduce this bill the day after she was unable to claim the third anniversary as Premier, when she endured group after group challenging her right to serve as leader, sweet 16 is the new jingoistic theme. We are all to believe she has never been kissed before, either. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040729"></A>
What is wrong here is the obvious disconnect between the word ‘integrity’ and this current Bligh Labor government. It is very difficult to reform something if you cannot get your own house in order. Everyone has a favourite integrity quote, but the one that embraces all is that integrity is what we do, what we say and what we say we do. On any level the public has ceased just grappling with what went wrong with Labor; they just want to get rid of them for nothing they have done is what they said they would do and Labor has done many more terrible things in Queensland on top of that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040730"></A>
It would be incorrect to say that the state Labor government has not looked at responding to integrity and accountability in Queensland, but the response is marred in looking for ways of escaping the clutches of rules fairly imposed and ignoring the rest of the world on the issue. Labor in Queensland has decided it is so virtuous because they claim year on year that not only did Tony Fitzgerald rid our state of old-world governance, they remain his champions 20 years later. The true situation is really very different. Tony Fitzgerald’s assessment of the current Labor government is summed up in his own words as saying access can now be purchased, patronage is dispensed, mates and supporters are appointed and retired politicians exploit their connections to obtain success fees for deals between business and government. We are not talking about a few ex-Labor mates; there are buildings full of them and a vast amount of state cash being shovelled their way.</Hansard-Body>

For any perceived failing of the National Party in government, at least the bulk of the funds built our roads, hospitals, cities and social infrastructure. All this lot seem to build are monuments to themselves. They eat at trendy restaurants and they travel to far-away places on expense accounts that, in the most recent case, delivered a payroll system that was formerly called Paris--interestingly, it was a European trip--that could not even deliver for our health workers and destroyed the morale of current Health staff. It was implemented as Workbrain under IBM and SAP. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040733"></A>
The concern is raised further in this bill because of the lobbyist register and the inconsistent approach being adopted in various ministers’ officers and departments. There are very few changes currently that would seem to reassure anyone that Labor has changed anything other than forcing Terry Mackenroth from his position at the Gold Coast SuperGP. Far too much largesse and excessive slush funds have been taken out at the beginning of major state projects and it has to stop. Labor hacks were masquerading as facilitators in this process. It is not transparent and the lobbyist register will enjoy the LNP’s close scrutiny. </Hansard-Body>

It was ‘last resort Laurie Connell’ in Western Australia who made success fees a fine art. For those who may not know, he collapsed a Labor government, put a Premier and his ministers in jail and died in strange circumstances. The effects of his activities have consequences even today. Have any current Labor members considered any of this when dealing with such people as have been named in parliament today, including Jim Elder, who was named in the Shepherdson inquiry? As usual with anything to do with Labor, the critical information lies in the bill and not in the second reading speech. In this bill there are significant numbers of acts to be amended. Rather than going through one myself--and I think the opposition leader has done that very well--I will constrict myself to the contentious areas and relating those where I have particular interest. </Hansard-Body>

The proposed amendments to the Civil Liability Act 2003 allow for an apology to be made without an apology being able to be regarded as an admission of liability. This is at best looking after the state’s common liability. At worst, it is a ‘get out of jail free’ pass, maladministration, manifest incompetence and recklessness. </Hansard-Body>

The Patel Bundaberg Hospital disaster, as detailed in the Davies inquiry and as continues on today, is testament to what we need to do about how we need to approach people very decently and look after their interests. That is the state’s role. Also I cite the Health payroll crisis, with this dubious program previously named Paris, which was found to be faulty by most overseas companies, was renamed Workbrain, sold to us under IBM and SAP and has basically delivered nothing for our Health staff. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040743"></A>
The Public Interest Disclosure Bill is the whistleblower bill. It has been discussed extensively by the opposition leader and I will restrict myself to the issues that I think are salient. The Premier believes the former bill is expanded upon and for the first time in Queensland it will provide protection for disclosures to the media in particular circumstances. The bill is either just backsliding or may be just a little more sinister in delivery because the Public Service Commission is composed of government appointees in the same manner as are the department chief executives. This is beyond that problem of Caesar judging Caesar, which has been raised today. This is not a question of security or anonymity. However, what incentive is there for staff to raise issues of major concern with such a panel? After taking such action, the whistleblower has to take their own action to enforce the protective liability provisions. I think the bill takes two steps sideways rather than going forwards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

In many ways these cognate bills are really quite cynical and sickening. This is exemplified very clearly by the Premier’s statement. In her second reading speech she stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1043918"></A>
As the way in which government business is done continues to evolve and change, so, too, must our governance structures evolve and change ...

<A ID="pgfId-1043919"></A>
However, the public does not trust the government. They do not believe the Premier and, whether or not the Labor government believes it, the public was not told about asset sales and does not believe the Premier is truthful. Once lost, trust is not easily recovered.</Hansard-Body>

Last night on the ABC, <Hansard-Italic>
Australian Story</Hansard-Italic>
 broadcast a wonderful story about Michael Ware, a war correspondent. He made the amazing statement that there is no truth in war, for war is the consequence of loss of trust. If war is also the consequence or the result of failed diplomacy, does this mean that the current Labor government is a failure and its diplomacy with its constituency and the wider populous is also a failure? Is that why the Queensland public took to federal Labor with baseball bats at the last election and, after not getting what it wanted, that is, a change of government, the mood is ill requited? I wonder if what is waiting out there is nothing short of utter annihilation for state Labor? I think that is the case. The polls are getting worse and suggest that that will occur. </Hansard-Body>

No self-induced Labor crisis will save the incumbents or the staff supporting them, for this series of bills is about those staff. Currently, nearly all newspapers in Australia rate the Premier and Treasurer as the worst Queensland leaders ever and they will be reviled forever. Self talk in a protected environment means little. But what of their staff? What of the true believers, cynics, modern leftist revolutionaries, Labor diehards and the many who genuinely believe in the greater good of what they are doing for their masters? Undoubtedly, some are probably still celebrating the near-death experience of a first-term Labor federal government and wondering, ‘What if?’ </Hansard-Body>

In other words, losing their lives.

In the end, the foot soldiers wear the consequences of dishonesty. If these bills are to validate them, it is nothing more than hypocrisy. Shakespeare was right on the mark when, in <Hansard-Italic>

 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (3.22 pm): Today I rise to contribute to the cognate debate on the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2010, the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2010 and the Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill 2010. First, I will address the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2010, which proposes to amend legislation to implement a range of integrity and accountability reforms, and other operational improvements, supposedly designed to strengthen Queensland’s integrity and accountability framework. The bill amends numerous other legislation for a particular purpose following the Bligh government’s release of a discussion paper,<Hansard-Italic>
 Integrity and accountability in Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
, to prompt public discussion on integrity and accountability issues and seek public input on proposals for integrity reform. </Hansard-Body>

The bill amends a series of acts to seek to apply a single code of conduct across the public sector, designed to overcome the scepticism from the public that this government has any integrity left at all.

The response committed to a number of integrity and accountability reforms to strengthen Queensland’s integrity framework, including creating statutory obligations for members of parliament and statutory office holders to declare their interests; amending the Civil Liability Act 2003 to allow for apologies by government departments without admission of legal liability; and introducing a single code of conduct for the Public Service, including necessary amendments to the Public Sector Ethics Act 1994.</Hansard-Body>

The Liberal National Party has previously called for an extension of the operation of official misconduct in the wake of the Bundaberg Hospital scandal and the Flavell employment contracts scandal. The Liberal National Party has considered the extension of the role of the Integrity Commissioner so that it covers all parliamentarians. In the wake of recent events with the imprisonment of yet another Labor government minister and the smoke and mirrors that this Labor government has engaged in over recent days, the LNP hopes that those amendments are enacted. The government’s main purpose for rushing through this legislation is to cover its own tracks and to make the general public think that it is serious about cleaning up its own corruption. We have seen this in the past with the Beattie government and now the same stench of corruption permeates through to the very core of the Bligh administration. Queenslanders are not fooled and the polls clearly show that they believe that Premier Bligh and her government are not to be trusted or believed. Nothing short of a royal commission will expose the corruption of this government and Queenslanders deserve nothing less. </Hansard-Body>

The public shows a lack of trust in the government. Recent polls in the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 reveal that 65 percent of people believe corruption and cronyism are widespread in the Bligh government. This follows a report by the Crime and Misconduct Commission into police misconduct and a speech by 1980s corruption buster Tony Fitzgerald QC. The <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 conducted a Galaxy poll that revealed that two-thirds of Queenslanders believe corruption and cronyism is widespread in the Bligh Labor government. The poll revealed anger, contempt and complete dissatisfaction with Premier Anna Bligh and her ministers. Corruption fighter Tony Fitzgerald’s savage attack on Labor’s 12 years in power has resonated with voters, who are obviously fed up with the government and would kick them out now if they could. At her 2009 election campaign launch and victory speech, Ms Bligh called on the public to trust her, but they have turned their backs on her and the government.</Hansard-Body>

We are facing government debt of $85.5 billion. To put that in simple terms, for an average family of four that means a $78,000 debt each, that is, a massive $78,000 debt per person, not per household. It is going to cost Queensland taxpayers $14 million a day, every day, to pay the interest bill on that $85.5 billion of debt. We are the only state in Australia to have lost our AAA credit rating and, having previously been the nation’s economic powerhouse, this government should be embarrassed that we are now on a credit watch with Standard &amp; Poor’s. This is the same government that went into the election stating that the fuel levy would remain in place, but it has not. This is the same government that is busily selling off our assets to try and dig itself out of the black financial hole that it has put this state in.</Hansard-Body>

The Premier has introduced the integrity bill as nothing more than a diversionary tactic so that her government appears to be doing something in response to allegations that the Labor government is guilty of corruption, cronyism and unethical behaviour over the past 11 years. On 29 July 2009, the Premier announced a review of integrity and accountability in Queensland that would focus on a broad range of integrity and accountability issues, including political fundraising, the adequacy of internal misconduct investigation procedures and dealing with pecuniary/conflict of interest matters. The government has previously announced that all government members of parliament will be required to meet annually with the Integrity Commissioner to discuss matters related to their statement of interests in the Register of Members’ Interests. </Hansard-Body>

That brings me to the issue of lobbyists and lobbyist registers, which have been in existence for many years overseas, particularly in Canada and the US. The Western Australian government has had one for quite some time. In the lead-up to the 2007 federal election, with reports of cronyism in WA, Kevin Rudd announced that on winning the election he would commence a lobbyists register for the Prime Minister and Cabinet. All lobbyist groups quickly accepted this as the norm and to this day the lobbyist register works well in Canberra. I have no issue with a lobbyist register or listing current clients. The prohibition of success fees in Queensland is interesting, given that no other state in Australia or the Commonwealth has entered into arrangements of this nature. I would suspect that this provision would only encourage secrecy and not stamp it out. </Hansard-Body>

As a former government and media relations consultant and a nurse for 30 years, my involvement with government relations began in 2000 when, as the general manager of the Wesley Gold Coast Hospital, I commenced the first free screening program for bowel cancer in Australia. My mother was the first person we picked up in the program. I was involved in the national task forces on colon cancer and childhood obesity. I lobbied for that issue pro bono. The same can be said for the nursing education policy written for the Howard government. I have worked closely with federal governments in the Life Saving Drugs Program. That program, started by Dr the Hon. Carmen Lawrence, replaced the Act of Grace, where children with rare and fatal conditions could be treated in Australia instead of being sent overseas. Those conditions affect a very small number of Australians. Conditions such as Gaucher, Fabry and Mucopolvsaccharidosis I, II and IV are so rare that nationally they affect less than 100 patients and, in some cases, less than 15 patients nationwide. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050211"></A>
In addition, paroxysmal nocturnal heamoglobinuria is another disease vying for inclusion in this program and affects over 100 young Australians. The Life Saving Drugs Program, started by the Labor government and subsequently supported by the Howard government, has given much needed treatment to many families throughout Australia. It is a tribute to both governments that they recognised the need to support these patients who would otherwise have died. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>
(Mr Wendt): Order! Member for Mudgeeraba, I am having trouble following the relevance of the issues you are discussing to the bills. Can you point out to me where they might be? </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1050217"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BATES:</Hansard-Member-Up>

Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In this place I will continue to fight for health rights and I will continue to fight for better health services for residents in Mudgeeraba, Queensland and Australia, and nothing will deter me from working towards a world-class health system as opposed to that which we have here in Queensland. I also found totally abhorrent comparisons in the past of my lobbying efforts with those of Labor mates who lobbied the Beattie-Bligh Labor government for favours. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050221"></A>
The key with this bill is not what is in it but what is not. This bill fails on all accounts to make any real changes to the issues of corruption, cronyism and unethical behaviour in this Labor government. It does nothing to stop ministers misleading the parliament or one of its committees as this legislation was brought in to ensure that former Beattie government ministers who had misled parliament were not jailed. It fails to provide any change to the total lack of ministerial responsibility from this Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050222"></A>
There is nothing in the bill about electoral reform and truth in electoral campaigning which was much talked about in the lead-up to this discussion paper. It has done nothing to stop Labor from accepting political donations from people before the courts on official corruption charges and it does nothing to stop union donations flowing into Labor coffers or, alternatively, does not address the parallel campaigns that unions run on behalf of the Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050223"></A>
The bill fails to hold the Premier and the government to account over their misleading the people of Queensland about asset sales and fuel taxes. The Premier promised reforms and, despite more than 200 submissions to the integrity green paper, we get four amendments, three of which are already being done in practice. This government wants to also determine what occupations you can have before you even get into parliament and when you leave it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050225"></A>
This bill is nothing more than a desperate attempt to save face from a Premier and a Labor government that have had a former minister jailed and another embroiled in a sports rort scandal and a trail of former Labor mates under the microscope for unethical and questionable behaviour in their postpolitical life. This is just more smoke and mirrors from a tired, on-the-nose Labor government trying not to sink in the quicksand that it itself has created. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050226"></A>
I now turn the next bill, the Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill 2010. The Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill creates a new stand-alone framework for the employment of staff members to support ministers, the Leader of the Opposition and, where necessary, other non-government members of parliament, separate to the Public Service Act 2008. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050228"></A>
In the <Hansard-Italic>
Response to Integrity and accountability in Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
, released on 10 November 2009, the government committed to a number of integrity and accountability reforms, including introducing new legislation governing the employment of ministerial and electorate office staff. Ministerial and opposition staff are currently employed under the Public Service Act 2008 through the employing authority of the director-general of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050230"></A>
In January 2010, the government made a submission to the Crime and Misconduct Commission’s inquiry into the interactions between ministers, ministerial staff and public servants. A number of measures have been implemented in this respect, including amending standard employment contracts and issuing a communique setting out clearly that ministerial staff do not have the power to direct public servants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050231"></A>
The bill implements a stand-alone framework for the employment of ministerial staff, staff of the Leader of the Opposition and staff of other non-government members of parliament. The bill includes a specific provision that ministerial staff are not empowered to direct public servants in their own right, thus acknowledging the limitations on powers of ministerial staff members. Further matters dealt with in the bill include codes of conduct and the provision of statements of interests by staff members, which continue current administrative practice as established under the Ministerial Handbook and Opposition Handbook. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050232"></A>
It is interesting to note that in the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 last weekend issues relating to the Ministerial Handbook were raised in relation to an incident with ministerial staff at a function outside of the office, including a further function which was held at the casino in Brisbane as an unofficial gathering, attended only by ministerial staff. The article states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050234"></A>
Anna Bligh’s army of ministerial advisers has been forced to learn how to behave properly after a harassment claim against a Cabinet Minister’s chief-of-staff at a post-parliament booze-up. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050235"></A>
<Hansard-Italic>
The Sunday Mail </Hansard-Italic>
can reveal staff in all 18 ministerial offices have undergone anti-discrimination training at taxpayers’ expense only weeks after Main Roads Minister Craig Wallace lost his top confidant after he allegedly acted inappropriately towards a young woman related to a senior Labor MP. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050236"></A>
The revelation is the latest to rock the Bligh Government as the Premier endures dissent from her own Labor colleagues over the asset sell-off and woeful opinion polls putting the ALP’s primary vote at a perilous 29 per cent. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050237"></A>
It is understood the allegation by the woman related to a drinking session held by Mr Wallace for his staff in the Brisbane CBD after the minister’s recent Budget Estimates hearing. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050238"></A>
The party kicked on into the early hours of the next day. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050239"></A>
The chief-of-staff later moved to the office of Child Safety Minister ... Directed to attend at the behest of the Premier’s office, instead of doing their normal duties the advisers were taught about sexual harassment, workplace harassment, vicarious liability and the complaints process during the half-day sessions. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050240"></A>
Mr Wallace had held the party after his Estimates hearing ... as a thank-you to his ministerial staff after they prepared him for the annual Opposition inquisition about the finances of his department. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050241"></A>
But it is believed they were later joined by staff from other offices at the Treasury Hotel and Casino as the festivities stretched into the early morning when the alleged incident took place. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

While the Queensland Ministerial Handbook states that some types of complaints can be referred to Queensland Police or the Crime and Misconduct Commission, matters can also be resolved informally. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050244"></A>
However the handbook does put a specific onus on “ministers and their senior ministerial staff” in policing harassment because it can constitute official misconduct. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050245"></A>
This article is particularly interesting given that I have received numerous complaints from the Gold Coast Hospital and Robina campuses regarding bullying and intimidation of staff from Queensland Health by staff from Queensland Health and apparently those principles do not extend to similar complaints by staff in those roles as it now does for ministerial staffers. That 97.7 per cent of all complaints referred to the CMC relating to Queensland Health are then referred back to Queensland Health is preposterous. This is Caesar judging Caesar and, more often than not, those who are charged with investigating these incidents are the very same people who are responsible for the bullying and intimidation in the first place.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050246"></A>
The next bill I will discuss is the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2010, which seeks to implement another stage of the integrity reforms and will replace the existing Whistleblowers Protection Act 1994. The integrity response provided in earlier discussions is committed to reforming the Whistleblowers Protection Act 1994 to ensure that Queensland legislation and practices are informed by present-day best practice and are of the highest standard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050247"></A>
I find this laughable when one of Queensland’s largest employers, Queensland Health, does not follow its own practices nor its policies and procedures. Staff who do speak out are victimised and bullied either into submission or completely out of the system. Only last sitting I rose to highlight a disgraceful example of the Bligh government’s toxic culture of bullying and intimidation which continues to permeate the Queensland public hospital system, particularly in relation to victims being blamed and whistleblowers being bullied. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050248"></A>
I have been made aware of an allegation of a serious assault of a sexual nature by one Queensland Health employee against another. Both continue to work in the public hospital system. I focused my attention on the atrocious and unfair way Queensland Health has used and abused the performance management policy--its own performance management policy--to systematically humiliate, punish and belittle one of its own employees in the workplace in an effort to avoid dealing with this serious and difficult situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050249"></A>
Queensland Health’s treatment of this employee is nothing short of negligent when the hierarchy has known of the assault allegation for three months and done nothing. Instead of supporting its employees during vulnerable times, it hangs them out to dry. Irrespective of the outcome of investigations into this claim, Queensland Health does owe a duty of care to its employees to provide a safe workplace. It has an obligation to the employee in this case to take her concerns seriously, to act compassionately without favouritism and to establish a safe and secure working environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050250"></A>
Instead of supporting employees during vulnerable times, Queensland Health and its managers have acted only to avoid taking action. They have washed their hands and told this employee that it is not their problem and not their fault and even implied that the alleged serious assault ‘was a result of the employee’s own behaviour’. The employee requested secondment to less stressful duties which was coldly rejected by management, who then accused the employee of ‘blackmail’ and said that they should ‘hurry up and get over it’ and should take leave without pay or long service leave. </Hansard-Body>

Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>
(Ms O’Neill): Order!<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
Member, I would like you to tell me how the story is relevant. I understand that you are going down the pathway of public interest and disclosure, but I do not know if this is relevant. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050252"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BATES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am actually referring to the whistleblowers act. This nurse has gone through all the designated processes, has alerted her line managers to what has been going on and has subsequently now had to lodge a WorkCover claim and a grievance with Queensland Health. If Queensland Health had followed its own policies and procedures, this would not have been necessary.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050256"></A>
The lack of support and insensitivity of Queensland Health are atrocious and clearly calculated to make the issue go away. This person has lost their dignity, wages, leave and entitlements. Morale amongst hospital staff is already abysmal, particularly when victims are victimised and whistleblowers are bullied and intimidated. Since highlighting this particular issue and another earlier this month regarding a nurse, Sue Dale, who was bullied and intimated whilst working at the Gold Coast Hospital, the culture has remained the same.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050300"></A>
A total of 30 nurses from the Gold Coast have contacted me outlining their concerns and telling me their stories. Many are so fed up that they are happy to go public with their particular issues as they have already been dealt with unfairly by Queensland Health. I urge all nurses to continue to contact me and to continue to have the courage of their convictions, to stand up for their patients and to continue to blow the whistle on the Bligh government and its culture of secrecy, intimidation and bullying. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050303"></A>
There is always strength in numbers and nurses standing together on this issue cannot and should not be ignored. This government relies on the fact that nurses will not strike, they seldom work to rule and at all times have the interests of their patients at heart. Nursing is a vocation, not a job. Now we see that many months after the failed pay debacle nurses are now expected to be Florence Nightingale and turn up to work in the knowledge that they will probably not be paid at the end of the fortnight and, if they are, that their pay will be incorrect. The Liberal National Party will not be opposing these cognate bills. However, we will be moving amendments in the consideration in detail stage. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Everton--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.40 pm): These bills are another example of the proud record of Queensland Labor governments in improving the accountability of government. From time to time we see this opposition impugn the actions of this government and accuse it of impropriety and corruption. The speech preceding mine from the member for Mudgeeraba is the latest disgraceful example of this practice by the opposition. Her speech was full of slurs and baseless allegations against people who are unable to defend themselves in this House. Her speech brings shame on her and the LNP. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050306"></A>
All I can imagine is that the reason for her speech and the speeches of members before her is a guilty conscience on their part because they are the inheritors of the Bjelke-Petersen legacy of corruption and secret government. There is more than one serving member of the opposition who has identified Joh Bjelke-Petersen as his political hero. Yet those opposite have the hide to come in here and lecture government members again and again about corruption. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050307"></A>
Sadly for the opposition the actions of this government and its predecessors prove that this government has done more to uphold and improve the accountability of government than any other in this state. Consider these actions taken by Queensland Labor governments. We have introduced estimate hearings. We ended the gerrymander by which this opposition’s predecessors systematically rorted elections in this state for decades. We created the CMC--a standing royal commission with the powers to investigate misconduct by public servants and politicians alike. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050309"></A>
We introduced the first Freedom of Information Act into this state to give Queenslanders access to government information. We must remember that one of the motivations for introducing this act was to break down the atrocious practice of the people of Queensland being unable to access secret Special Branch files put together on them simply because they had the hide to speak up against the government of the day. In this term of government we have strengthened the FOI Act by introducing the new Right to Information Act. We have created a lobbyist register requiring lobbyists to disclose their activities. We have introduced laws to protect whistleblowers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050310"></A>
On any fair and objective measure there can be no doubt that this government and its predecessors have taken the accountability of government incredibly seriously. Far from just giving hollow speeches about it, we have taken action to put these sentiments into practice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050311"></A>
The bills currently being debated take that proud record further. They are the second stage of wide-ranging reforms to strengthen the integrity of government operations in Queensland. The Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill constitutes the first new stand-alone legislation in Queensland governing the employment and conduct of ministerial staff. In doing so, we are setting standards for ministerial staff that lead the nation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050313"></A>
As many members are aware, in addition to my previous jobs in the hospitality and retail industries and as an employment lawyer, for several years I worked as a ministerial adviser and as a public servant. Having sat on both sides of the adviser/public servant divide, I welcome the clarity that this bill provides for ministerial office relationships. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050314"></A>
While much maligned, the role of ministerial adviser forms an essential part of the operations of government in the modern day. Without ministerial advisers to request independent policy advice from the Public Service, to provide political advice to ministers and to convey and oversee the fulfilment of requests of a minister, the wheels of government would grind to a standstill. In my experience, ministerial advisers in this government take their roles incredibly seriously and act responsibly in the exercise of their authority. However, it is important to put in place safeguards to ensure that these highly influential roles are always exercised appropriately. That is what this bill does.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050315"></A>
Importantly, the bill specifically provides that ministerial staff are not empowered to direct public servants in their own right. Again, in my experience, ministerial staff respect the fact that their job is to represent the views of their minister to public servants, rather than direct public servants to do whatever they--that is, the advisers--want. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050316"></A>
When I worked as an adviser I always found that the way to get the best out of public servants was to clearly and politely explain one’s requests by reference to the minister’s views. Equally, as a public servant, one could be confident of one’s actions if one knew that the adviser with whom one was dealing was conveying requests on the basis that they were informed of their minister’s position. I am pleased that this bill clarifies that this is to be the basis of all dealings between ministerial staff and public servants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050317"></A>
The only other amendment I was going to mention is the amendment proposed to the Civil Liability Act. That amendment will allow for governments to make apologies to members of the public without an admission of legal liability. Again, drawing on my own experience in government previously and as someone who often used to sign replies to members of the public who were complaining about the actions of government in some way, it was enormously frustrating that one of the things that we were sometimes advised by well-intentioned public servants was that we should not convey an apology on behalf of the government because that could risk us exposing ourselves to legal liability. I was always very frustrated by that approach because I could clearly see from reading the letters that were sent to the minister that one of the things that the member of the public most wanted was some acknowledgement of fault on behalf of a government official, whether it be a politician or a public servant. The mere expression of an apology would go a long way to repairing whatever damage had been inflicted. I am very pleased that these amendments put the ability of a government to make apologies without an admission of legal liability beyond doubt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050318"></A>
There are various other important amendments contained in these bills, including ones to better protect whistleblowers and to improve government accountability in other ways. In the interests of time, I will leave it to other government members to speak in favour of these amendments. I have no doubt that my fellow government members of this parliament will be able to proudly reflect on the excellent record of this and previous state Labor governments to pursue accountability of government. We have a much stronger record than those on the other side of the House. There is no doubt about that. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr EMERSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Indooroopilly--LNP) (3.46 pm): Queenslanders ask themselves every day whether they can believe anything that this Labor government tells them. When we heard the previous speaker talk about his time as a ministerial adviser one doubts very much the truth involved in his speech. This government has been characterised not just by massive debt and massive deficit but also massive deceit. This is a government that has refined the art of cover-up and has been proved to have had corruption in its ministerial ranks. This is why it is so important to have effective whistleblowing laws. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050321"></A>
Those laws need to give confidence to the community. They need to provide appropriate safeguards for those genuine whistleblowers. These whistleblowers often risk their livelihoods and place immense stress on themselves and their families to help expose the failures, the fabrications and the fraud of the government and its departments. Given the track record of this government, can the community have any doubt that Labor would do anything to attempt to protect those who have done wrong and punish those who reveal the wrongdoing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050323"></A>
This year we saw the conviction of former Queensland Health surgeon Jayant Patel for the manslaughter of Queensland Health patients. It was a timely reminder of the value and importance of whistleblowing. Would this tragic failure of administration at the Bundaberg Hospital have been exposed without the courage of whistleblowers like nurse Toni Hoffman? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050325"></A>
More than 20 years ago the concerns of honest police triggered the media investigations which led to Queensland’s Fitzgerald inquiry into official corruption. It was as a result of that Fitzgerald inquiry report that Queensland became the first Australian jurisdiction to provide legislative protection to whistleblowers with the Whistleblowers Protection Act 1994. As the recent Whistling While They Work project indicated, the Whistleblowers Protection Act has now been surpassed nationally and internationally in relation to several of the most important features of statutory whistleblowing regimes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053896"></A>
That report found that in both practice and perception there are deficits in the Queensland laws. These include lower overall confidence in relevant legislation amongst public employees than in other jurisdictions, lower overall trust amongst public employees as to how they would expect the management of their agency to respond to an employee report of wrongdoing than in other jurisdictions studied, lower average outcomes in terms of the perceptions of whistleblowers as to how they were treated by the management of their agencies than in New South Wales or Western Australia and lower average comprehensiveness in agency whistleblowing procedures than in the other jurisdictions studied. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

This Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2010 is in effect a replacement for the Whistleblowers Protection Act 1994. While it is an improvement, it still provides limited protection to those who want to blow the whistle on maladministration and corruption. One of the fundamental flaws of both the whistleblowers act and this bill is that the responsibility for protecting whistleblowers may rest on those persons whose conduct and maladministration is being exposed--that is, the chief executives of government departments. But what if it is not that chief executive but another senior member of the government? There has been an increased politicisation of the Public Service under the Beattie and Bligh governments. Those heads of departments know to whom they owe their jobs. Under that regime, how confident can any whistleblower be that their concerns will be dealt with appropriately? What protection will there be for whistleblowers who go to the media as occurred more than 20 years ago in helping to trigger the Fitzgerald inquiry? Under this bill there are still only limited provisions to enable a whistleblower to complain to a journalist. They have to meet extremely strict and onerous conditions. They first have to ensure that the entity to which the public interest disclosure is made did not invest or deal with the matter or did not recommend any action in relation to the disclosure or did not notify the complainant within six months of the date of disclosure. So more than 180 days after making a complaint, a whistleblower can still not lawfully approach a journalist about the issue. That means for six months the maladministration or corruption may continue with extremely serious consequences. It may also mean that the whistleblower may be under continual and possibly intolerable stress and pressure. It also means that the timeliness of the issue may be lost, and that is exactly what a government that is expert in cover-up and spin would want. While these laws are an improvement, they are still not as effective as they should be in protecting whistleblowers. </Hansard-Body>

Mr BLEIJIE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kawana--LNP) (3.51 pm): I rise to contribute to the cognate debate on the Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill, the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill and the Public Interest Disclosure Bill before the House today. For ease of reference and so as not to confuse my learned colleagues opposite, I will speak to each bill separately. I will start with the Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill. It is prudent that the issue of political influence over the Public Service is debated in the House today given the recent CMC investigation into an alleged sports rort pork-barrelling by the office of the former sports minister, the member for Sunnybank, in July 2008.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053979"></A>
The role of departmental staff is to firstly serve the interests of the public as opposed to the interests of the government. Any advice given or action undertaken by departmental staff should always be impartial and carried out with full objectivity rather than the classic ‘Yes, Minister’ response from the popular television show of the same name. The role of all ministerial staff is to serve their respective minister. Any direction or exercise of power reserved for the minister with respect to his or her department portfolio must be treated with honour and respect for the position that the ministers should always carry. It is not something to be acted upon by a ministerial staffer or adviser who has not been appointed to such a high office of which such reservation is attributed. Clause 15 of the bill seems to be as a direct result of the CMC investigation into the alleged actions of Mr Tutt, yet the clause is contradictory in nature as it is subject to a direction of a ministerial staff member and then in another section that same ministerial staffer can give a direction to departmental staff if they are acting on behalf of a person who may lawfully give a direction. There needs to be a clarification and prescriptive processes for establishing a ministerial staffer’s authority for giving such a directive so that a public servant can make the distinction as to whether the direction is one that the ministerial staffer is able to make in the first instance.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053981"></A>
If the government was serious about restoring integrity back into the system, then it could potentially create offences for a ministerial staffer to give a ministerial directive to a Public Service employee. Under this bill, ministerial and opposition staff are recognised as separate to the Public Service, as should be the case. But if one looks more closely at the detail of the bill, there are no changes to the employment conditions of the staff which indicates that this is an act of mere tokenism rather than any restoration of integrity into the current system. The bill states that ministerial staff will be appointed on the recommendation of the Premier and not of the relevant minister. This begs the question of loyalty and accountability of the respective minister’s office. The eminence of factionalism within the Labor Party suggests that the Office of the Premier is using the system to monitor her ministers to ensure that her position as leader of the Labor Party is not undermined by the numbers in the centre and Right factions of the Labor Party. The Premier is running scared that the faction leaders of the Labor Party will replace her as Premier in the same way as the federal leader was replaced.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1053989"></A>
I will give the House a classic example of this Premier taking responsibility of ministerial staff in terms of an issue that I have been dealing with at the Montessori school in Sippy Downs. There has been an issue at that school on which we briefed departmental staff. The adviser to the minister was present. A month later we had not heard anything. We then wrote again to the minister. That ministerial staffer had been sent to another minister’s department. I then had to again bring representatives from the school down to again brief the minister’s department, and now we are on the third or fourth ministerial adviser. It is increasingly hard to deal with the tough and heavy issues in our constituencies when one books an appointment with a minister and spends quite a considerable amount of time briefing the minister’s department and then without any notice there is a new departmental staff officer or policy adviser to the minister who has to be briefed all over again. That issue with regard to Montessori school started several months ago and it is ongoing because we are now on to our third or fourth ministerial adviser whom we are briefing at the moment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053992"></A>
The government’s attempt to enact more integrity and accountability into the current system juxtaposes its longstanding attitude of jobs for its Labor mates and is as a result of the degradation of Public Service impartiality and political neutrality. Clause 17 of the bill applies public sector ethics under the Public Sector Ethics Act 1994 to ministerial and staff members. When applying these ethics, it is important to recognise the political function of these officers and staffers and the adversarial system in which we operate. Given this, the Office of the Premier and the Office of the Leader of the Opposition should be differentiated in terms of a code of conduct and general staff demeanour. Opposition staff are and should be accountable to the Leader of the Opposition, not the Office of the Premier. The Office of the Leader of the Opposition should be accountable to a completely separate office such as the Queensland Parliamentary Service rather than the Premier’s office. There needs to be a clear distinction between the Public Service and ministerial offices and any dealings between the two need to be conducted in a far more transparent manner. The bill before the House does not do that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053999"></A>
This is another example of a government that is all talk and no action. The only substance is the washing powder, and it is on a revolving spin cycle. Queenslanders need to be able to have faith that their Public Service is acting impartially in their collective best interests and not at the behest of a particular political party that is the government of the day. The Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill is another example of this government’s slogan of all talk and no action, and would anyone in Queensland believe that it is the Labor Party introducing bills into this place that contain the word ‘integrity’! Queenslanders would not believe it. Queenslanders understand that any bill introduced into this parliament by the government--the Labor Party--that contains the word ‘integrity’ is of course a way of circumventing the issues facing many Queenslanders at the moment. Again, this government is all talk and no action. It is saying, ‘Look at us, Queensland. We’re doing stuff. We’re introducing bills on integrity and accountability in parliament. We probably don’t believe any of it, but we’re still introducing it anyway. It makes a good headline.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054002"></A>
The bill amends several acts of which I will make mention of but a few. The amendments to the Auditor-General Act 2009 contained in the bill create an obligation for the Auditor-General with respect to making declarations of interest.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057532"></A>
The Auditor-General’s declaration of interest will now be subject to overview not only by the Speaker of the parliament but also the Integrity Commissioner. Instead of looking for appropriate ways in which the office of the Integrity Commissioner can be expanded to promote Queensland public sector integrity and ethics, as the Bligh government purports to do, we have here a mere duplication of reporting procedures to multiple officers. A similar amendment is proposed for the Ombudsman Act 2001 with respect to the disclosures of interest of the Ombudsman. These amendments are another example of spin by a government to bring about integrity and accountability to the system, but they are nothing more than a further bureaucratic process that is more costly and far more timely. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057536"></A>
The bill also amends the Civil Liability Act 2003 by allowing apologies to be made without being taken as an admission of legal liability. This amendment is a farce for any process of public accountability by the government. The government has a record of going broke on the back of a mining boom, losing its AAA credit rating, having a huge public debt, holding a fire sale of Queensland assets and making one stuff-up after the other. I would like to reiterate the points made by the honourable the Leader of the Opposition in relation to some of the major stuff-ups. One, of course, is the big Traveston Dam debacle. Another is the South East Queensland Water Grid, including billions of dollars wasted on a desalination program and recycled water programs. There is also the Health payroll system, which has still not been fixed, the A1GP debacle that occurred last year, which should have cost the job of the Minister for Sport, and the list goes on. This legislative amendment is designed specifically--</Hansard-Body>

Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection. Madam Deputy Speaker, correct me if I am wrong, but we are talking about integrity in the offices. I would have thought that ministerial integrity would form some basis of this debate. This legislative amendment is designed specifically to allow the government to try to cover up its mistakes, of which there are many--too many to detail in 20 minutes--with a simple apology and no particular admission of guilt. This government is not about taking responsibility for its actions and for its mistakes; it is all about trying to save face in reaction to continual poor opinion polls. This amendment does not apply in the case of defamation, an unlawful intentional act or an unlawful sexual assault. Clearly, an apology carries with it some form of implication of guilt and responsibility and is not something that should be trivialised. By introducing this tokenistic amendment of an apology without responsibility, the government is trying to cover its tracks and trivialising the effect of what an apology means. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057540"></A>
One major amendment in this bill should have every Queenslander concerned, and that is the amendment to the Government Owned Corporations Act 1993. The bill removes assets of government owned corporations that are being privatised from the jurisdiction of the Crime and Misconduct Commission Act 2001. The question to be asked is: why the amendment? What is the intent behind this amendment? Such an amendment would be required only if the government had something to hide. Obviously, from this amendment the government does. From the outset of the asset sales, the government has deceived the people of Queensland, and hiding this amendment in a bill titled ‘Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill’ is another act of deception. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057543"></A>
I put it to this parliament that the members of this state Labor government are certainly the Decepticons of the Transformers’ world--continually trying to transform into something else, presenting a facade of accountability, integrity and honesty. But the result will always be the same. The government members will always be the Decepticons. Including this amendment in the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill does not mean that the amendment will have anything to do with integrity reform at all. In fact, it removes accountability with respect to the sale of the assets. The government is so determined to proceed with the sale of the assets regardless of the views of the public that it is trying to sell this amendment as a part of its so-called integrity reform. Again, that is another rort on the part of the Bligh Labor government. I know that I have used the word ‘spin’ a few times already today. I have said that the only substance in this spin is the washing powder, but it is precisely what it is: spin, spin and spin. When it comes to the polls, I say to all members on the government side of the House who have a margin of possibly seven per cent or less that there is no reverse on this spin-cycle washing machine. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057547"></A>
The bill also amends the Public Service Act 2008 by removing the requirement to obtain an agreement by the parties prior to an appeal for it to be decided without a hearing. That means that appeals may be decided without the parties being afforded the full opportunity to be heard. Again, such an amendment should not be included in a bill purporting to be focused on integrity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

The Public Interest Disclosure Bill deals with the public interest disclosure requirements and any information that is brought to the attention of the public sector agency. The amendments require the individual agency to notify the complainant in writing as to what action will be taken. I table for the information of the House two copies of letters from the Ombudsman, Mr David Bevan, with a c.c. copy to the Law, Safety and Justice Committee. I point out to the House that the two letters have been authorised for release by the Law, Safety and Justice Committee and, therefore, do not breach the standing orders.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1057552"></A>
If that is the case, as an officer of Parliament, independent of the executive government, I am strongly opposed to any proposal that the Public Service Commission be given jurisdiction to review and monitor the way in which my Office carries out any of its functions, including its function of dealing with PIDs (either individually or generally) that may be made to it under the Public Interest Disclosure Act. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1057554"></A>
Similarly, I am strongly opposed to the Public Service Commission being given jurisdiction to direct the way in which my Office is to perform its functions under the bill by way of imposing binding standards on my Office... Again, it is an inappropriate interference with the functions of an independent officer of the Parliament. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057555"></A>
Talk about accountability and integrity! We have these letters from the Queensland Ombudsman. He then goes on further in his letter of 2 July 2010--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1057557"></A>
However, as it is clear that the government has not accepted my submissions, I will not reiterate here why I consider my proposal to provide a more effective model. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057558"></A>
Therefore, the Ombudsman limits his comments to concerns that he raised in his letter of 24 May. I table a copy of the letter and note that the tabling of those letters, as committee correspondence, has been approved by the Law, Safety and Justice Committee. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057559"></A>
When it comes to transparency, this government clearly falls short of the mark. An example of this falling short is an amendment that provides that the disclosure to a journalist--</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1057560"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Watt: </Hansard-Member-Down>
Are you going to refer to the Premier’s reply? Are you going to be transparent? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057561"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the member for Everton and note that the response to which he refers has not been authorised for release. Therefore, under the standing orders I will not speak about it in parliament, because then I would be breaching standing orders. I certainly do not want the member for Everton to accuse me of that because no doubt he would be the first one to pop up from his little chair and squeak the words, ‘You have offended the standing orders. You are referring to parliamentary committee documentation that has not been authorised for release.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057562"></A>
As I said, when it comes to transparency, this government clearly falls short of the mark. An example of this falling short is the amendment that provides that disclosure to a journalist will be legal only if the public sector entity does not notify the complainant within six months of the complaint. A period of six months is far too long. When you consider the issue of the Queensland Health payroll system, six months is too long. In certain cases, such as the Bundaberg Base Hospital situation, six months is too long. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057563"></A>
Today, we have heard of instances where whistleblowers have lost their jobs as a result of bringing to the attention of the public the maladministration of this government. It is such a shame that the government is so adamant about saving face and covering up its mistakes and failures that people risk losing their jobs if they speak out against it. The bills that are before the House today as part of the Premier’s so-called integrity reform are, in fact, nothing of the sort. Queenslanders will never forgive this government for the deceitful way in which it went to the election in 2009 with no mention of privatisation and then, once it was elected, it introduced the privatisation of five of Queensland’s largest assets, all in the name of the global financial crisis as if it had happened overnight. Although the Premier claims that her government will listen to the will of the electorate, her continual defiance of the public’s attitude towards asset sales is a true indication of her real position.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057564"></A>
In closing, I will paraphrase a true classic from the recent federal election campaign: with a bandaid here and a bit of spin there, more talk, no action, here we go. Look out Queensland, Labor’s a failure with the same old Bligh slide show. On that note, I say thank you. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DICKSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Buderim--LNP) (4.09 pm): I rise to speak in relation to the integrity reform bill proposed by this government. Sadly, integrity seems to have been lacking within the Labor government. Last year former royal commissioner Tony Fitzgerald gave an address at Griffith University on the current state of public corruption here in Queensland and took particular aim at the government sitting just across the chamber from where I stand. In part, Mr Fitzgerald said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1061084"></A>
The current concerns about political and police misconduct are a predictable result of attitudes adopted in Queensland since the mid-1990s ... Greed, power and opportunity in combination provide an almost irresistible temptation for many which can only be countered by the near-certainty of exposure and severe punishment.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1061085"></A>
Ethics are always tested by incumbency. Secrecy was re-established by sham claims that voluminous documents were ‘cabinet-in-confidence’. Access can now be purchased ... mates and supporters are appointed and retired politicians exploit their connections to obtain ‘success fees’ for deals between business and government. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061086"></A>
That does sound very familiar. Long before the media investigations into any of this, our side of politics had been calling for a lobbyists register. We said that the government should introduce a Queensland register of lobbyists modelled on federal Labor’s scheme. Last year in Queensland, we saw the lid lifted on the jobs for mates and lobbyists rort. The media forensically dissected just who was who in the zoo. We saw that former Queensland Labor Treasurer Terry Mackenroth and former federal Labor MP Con Sciacca received a success fee of nearly $500,000 for providing advice to the successful Thiess backed Airport Link consortium. Subsequent to the exposure Mr Sciacca resigned from a government board. He resigned after 2 years as chairman of Forestry Plantations Queensland, one of the government owned assets lined up and sold as part of this Labor government’s assets fire sale.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061087"></A>
On 6 August 2009 the Premier issued a media release. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1061088"></A>
Accountability and transparency in public administration is at the heart of robust democracy. As Premier, I believe government has a duty to continually reform and adjust to the evolving expectations of the people they represent.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

In a state of panic over what was being revealed, the Premier released a public discussion paper. The Premier was cynically pretending that she was unaware of what the community expects from its government when it comes to integrity. But we can go back further in examining what integrity means to this Labor government. In an earlier episode of ‘Underbelly: Labor’ we met the character Gordon Nuttall MP, the once golden haired minister of the Beattie Labor government--a real good old-fashioned brown paper bag crook. In July last year Nuttall was found guilty on 36 charges involving $360,000 of secret corrupt payments during his time as a Queensland Labor government minister. But let us not forget that the Labor government health minister Gordon Nuttall was also up to his neck in the tragic Jayant Patel disgrace. He lied and pretended publicly in this very parliament that he was not aware of the truth about Patel. The Labor government of the day was happy to accommodate Nuttall on that issue. In December 2005, then Premier Peter Beattie told this House--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1061090"></A>
We are not going to simply have a media feeding frenzy to destroy someone when there is not a basis to do it. If there was a basis to sack Gordon Nuttall I would have sacked him, but there is not.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1061091"></A>
Even Rob Schwarten got in on the act, jumping to Nuttall’s defence. Let me quote the ‘minister for silver spoons’--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1061092"></A>
There is not one skerrick of evidence to say that former minister Nuttall deliberately misled that estimates committee. There is no piece of evidence available to this parliament or anywhere else.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061093"></A>
Minister Schwarten believed that Nuttall was an innocent man. Back in July, instead of facing the media over the Auditor-General’s report into CorpTech’s involvement in the bungled Queensland Health payroll system he was having a five-star lunch with the union heavies, who were no doubt paying. With his department’s integrity under the spotlight, the Premier and Deputy Premier kept the minister away from media questions about CorpTech. I wonder how many nurses had five-star lunches that day.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061094"></A>
As mentioned earlier and within this bill, on 6 August 2009 the government released the discussion paper <Hansard-Italic>
Integrity and accountability in Queensland </Hansard-Italic>
to prompt public discussion on integrity and accountability issues and seek public input on proposals for integrity reform. Following consideration of public submissions and the advice of a round table of experts, the government released the <Hansard-Italic>
Response to Integrity and accountability in Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
 on 10 November 2009. The response committed to a number of integrity and accountability reforms to strengthen Queensland’s integrity framework, including: creating statutory obligations for members of parliament and statutory office holders to declare their interests; amending the Civil Liability Act 2003 to allow for apologies by government departments without admission of legal liability; and introducing a single code of conduct for the Public Service, including necessary amendments to the Public Sector Ethics Act 1994. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>

That seems to me like the government putting yet another restriction upon scrutiny of its liability arising from incidents such as Patel. This part even makes it inadmissible for nurses to present the weak-kneed apologies of the health minister and various Health bureaucrats in any civil action against Queensland Health over the pay debacle. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

The problem for this current state Labor government is that it cherry-picks the subjects about which it feels integrity is an issue. However, it is not just about brown paper bags, jobs for the boys and doing business on a wink and a nod with former Labor Party people turned lobbyists. It is also about the integrity of doing the best for the community, doing what it can to help the public get through day-to-day life. But what have we seen from this Labor government in recent years? It tries to pretend that it is none of its doing. We have heard the health minister stand in front of the media when addressing the nurses pay scandal and say, ‘Don’t blame me. I’m just the minister.’ And we have heard Minister Robertson when quizzed on electricity say, ‘It’s not our fault. It’s the independent regulator.’ Now in relation to water bills the same minister says, ‘It’s nothing to do with us. It’s the councils’ fault.’ Yet every one of the monumental debacles happening year after year, day after day is indeed the result of this government’s contempt for the public. It has the gall to talk about integrity. But rest assured that the people of Queensland are waiting with bated breath for the next episode of ‘Underbelly: Labor.’ </Hansard-Body>

(4.17 pm): I rise to support the cognate bills before the House and welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on these landmark bills that continue to give form to the Bligh government’s commitment to integrity and accountability in Queensland. Of course, this is not the first time that such matters have been at the centre of debate in this House. While I would like to say that it has ever been so, that is of course not the case. There was a long, dark period of government under the direction of one Johannes Bjelke-Petersen when corruption thrived and various attempts by the media and the Labor opposition to throw a spotlight on this activity met with arrogant dismissal by the government and, according to Tony Fitzgerald in his introduction to the report on the Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct, the community had become indifferent to these allegations. </Hansard-Body>

Indeed, in their great read <Hansard-Italic>
The Ayes Have It</Hansard-Italic>
, John Wanna and Tracey Arklay point out that as far back as the early 1980s the Labor opposition had begun to attack the Bjelke-Petersen government over corruption and misconduct issues. The then opposition spokesperson for police and prisons, Kev Hooper, regularly raised allegations relating to drug trafficking, prostitution, illegal gambling and SP bookmaking. History records that even these revelations made within this House failed to move a single member of the National Party or the Liberal Party, either inside or outside of the parliament, let alone the Premier, to raise a finger to genuinely investigate the allegations. Fitzgerald explains that when such issues were raised by the media the police spokesperson routinely ground out stereotyped denials and hit back at critics.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061108"></A>
It was not until May 1987, following the ABC’s screening of a documentary <Hansard-Italic>
The Moonlight State</Hansard-Italic>
, that a crack appeared in the wall of silence that had been set up by a corrupt government and its cronies within the police force. The rest, as they say, is history, but it does us good to think about how easily corruption can flourish when there is no commitment to integrity or accountability.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064594"></A>
Many things have changed since the dark days of Bjelke-Petersen’s reign of corruption, but that does not mean that there is no need to regularly revisit and strengthen the laws and conventions that govern public integrity and accountability. This process is necessary in order to give the public of this state confidence that we will never again spiral down into the abyss of corruption that will forever define the Bjelke-Petersen years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064598"></A>
As a new Premier with a new mandate, Anna Bligh wasted no time in expressing her determination that integrity and accountability would form the cornerstone of her program for reform. On 6 August last year, the Queensland government released a discussion paper titled <Hansard-Italic>
Integrity and accountability in Queensland </Hansard-Italic>
around which a robust discussion and consultation program was rolled out. The government’s response paper identified a range of legislative and administrative changes that had regard to four key principles: strong rules, strong culture, strong scrutiny and strong enforcement. We have already seen the first phase of reforms passed by the parliament and enacted to establish more stringent guidelines for the regulation of the lobbying industry. These measures included banning cash for access arrangements and creating a register of lobbyists to be overseen by the Integrity Commissioner.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064599"></A>
These latest reforms, which are before the House today, extend the quality of accountability and the demand for integrity to a whole new, never before seen standard. Importantly, the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill institutes a statutory requirement for members of parliament to provide declarations of interest for the Register of Members’ Interests and Register of Related Persons’ Interests. While these have, till now, been requirements under standing orders, these amendments enshrine this standard in legislation. Other amendments go to further strengthening lobbying regulations by requiring that unregistered lobbying activity be reported to the Integrity Commissioner and establishing a new set of warnings and suspensions to deal with breaches of lobbying regulations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064602"></A>
The Public Interest Disclosure Bill delivers on the government’s commitment to reform whistleblowers protection legislation. For the first time in Queensland, whistleblower protection will be extended to disclosure to the media if the matter has been first taken to, but not resolved by, the appropriate public sector entity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064604"></A>
The new Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill lays down a formal legislative framework which recognises the realities of the working relationship that exists between ministers or other office holders, including the opposition office, and their staff. Importantly, it makes clear that, while ministerial officers will interact with the Public Service for a variety of quite legitimate reasons, they may not direct them. In addition, ministerial staff will be required to provide annual declaration of interest statements and abide by a code of conduct.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064605"></A>
Being a member of parliament can sometimes feel like one of those dreams--or nightmares--when you suddenly find yourself naked in a public place with all your private bits exposed to the eyes of the world. We are required to be entirely transparent about things that other people would consider to be private affairs. But we are also charged with writing and setting in motion the laws of the state, and there are governments still in this world today that use that power to further personal gain or political advantage.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064606"></A>
By raising the standards of accountability for members of this parliament we choose to remove the potential for human weakness and generate public confidence in the integrity of members of this place and those who work with or for us. I commend the bills to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (4.23 pm): There is a lot in these cognate bills that I could speak on today. There is the establishment of yet another paid advisory committee through clause 33 of the Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill--another paid committee for Labor mates; there is a new requirement for QAS officers to declare that they have been subject to serious disciplinary action in the past; there is the rather bizarre requirement for the Auditor-General and Ombudsman, the independence and authority of either having rarely been questioned, to now declare their interests with oversight provided by the Integrity Commissioner; and there are the changes to the Civil Liability Act that will enshrine in legislation that saying sorry cannot be taken as an admission of legal liability. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064611"></A>
I know the opposition leader and the member for Kawana have both identified a number of questionable cases where such legislation would clearly protect this disastrous Bligh government. Given that my colleagues have covered many of these amendments in detail, let me return more specifically to the Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064612"></A>
Through a 12-year career in the Commonwealth and Queensland public services, one principle sat front and centre in every action I undertook: that I was to provide frank and fearless advice to the government of the day. That meant that, regardless of my personal views or my personal political persuasions, I worked tirelessly for the government of the day. So for four years I worked for the Howard coalition government in the Commonwealth Department of Defence and for the subsequent eight years, for the Beattie-Bligh government here in Queensland. I know that principle guides many, if not all, of my former Public Service colleagues, as it should. As was written in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 editorial--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1064614"></A>
THE essence of good policymaking lies in the relationship between the bureaucracy and the government of the day. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1064615"></A>
The editorial continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1064617"></A>
That relationship is always a balancing act.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1064618"></A>
Bureaucrats need to preserve their independence and capacity to provide frank advice while making sure they are implementing the policies of the government. Ministers and their staff need to ensure their political imperatives are met without compromising the impartial role the Public Service should play in formulating policy. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1064619"></A>
Let me reiterate that last comment--</Hansard-Body-Continued>

Ministers and their staff need to ensure their political imperatives are met without compromising the impartial role the Public Service should play in formulating policy. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1064622"></A>
There is no question that public administration and government is getting more challenging and complex and keeping that balance is increasingly difficult. However, difficulties should not result in an abdication of those principles. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064623"></A>
It is clear that not all ministerial staff working for this Bligh Labor government have been able to overcome these difficulties. As outlined in that same editorial--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1064625"></A>
The Crime and Misconduct Commission inquiry into the behaviour of Simon Tutt, former police minister Judy Spence’s chief-of-staff, heard enough evidence to suggest that the dealings some ministerial staff have with public servants and the attitude they display are not only far from ideal but also interfere with good governance. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1064626"></A>
Such behaviour is not acceptable. Not only is it not acceptable, it is deplorable and must not be allowed to continue. The fact that a senior public servant, Deputy Director-General Craig Mathieson, whom I happen to know from my own Public Service career in the north coast region, felt sufficiently pressured by the then minister for police’s office that he increased the proposed grant in question by $200,000 is indicative of a sickening change--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064627"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOOLIHAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I rise to a point of order. In relation to the report that has been mentioned, there is an article in today’s newspaper. But that says that it is a draft report and it is a leaked report. I would suggest that the member is treading on very dangerous ground in dealing with that report until the report is, in fact, tabled in this House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064628"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>
(Ms O’Neill): Order! I agree and I ask the member to move on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064629"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr POWELL:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is a sickening change in the dealings between a once independent Public Service and the political beings of the minister’s office. There must be a renewed effort to establish ground rules so that all parties know where they stand. The editorial continues--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1064631"></A>
This is a bigger deal than ensuring a degree of courteousness and professionalism.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064632"></A>
If staffers believe they can instruct public servants at will or, worse, claim they are acting on their minister’s behalf when they are not, then it is plain they need to be pulled into line. If they believe they are able to act this way with senior public servants, then the integrity of public administration is in deep trouble. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064633"></A>
I appreciate that clause 15 of this bill endeavours to do this. However, I am not sure it will achieve its intended objective. Rather, it may confuse the matter even further. As the opposition leader highlighted, in an attempt to overcome the Tutt situation of a ministerial adviser giving a direction to a public servant, this bill provides that a public servant cannot be subjected to a direction of a ministerial staff member. Yet clause 15(2) goes on to provide that the same ministerial staff member can give a direction to a public servant if he is acting on behalf of a person who may lawfully give a direction. As stipulated by the opposition leader, what public servant, faced with a direction from a ministerial staff member, is going to ask that staff member whether he or she is acting on behalf of the minister in giving such a direction? Only a public servant who has no interest in a long-term career would be so bold as to ask such a question of a ministerial staff member and seek to establish whether that ministerial staff member is, indeed, properly authorised by the minister. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064635"></A>
The same concern was also highlighted by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. Section 4(3) (c) of the Legislative Standards Act provides that whether legislation has sufficient regard to rights and liberties of individuals depends on whether, for example, the legislation allows the delegation of administrative power only in appropriate cases and to appropriate persons. Whilst the explanatory notes attempt to justify the breach of fundamental legislative principles contained in clause 15, the committee remains concerned, stating--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1064638"></A>
Delegation of administrative power regarding the management of the department to a “staff member” may be a delegation in an inappropriate case or to an inappropriate person. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064674"></A>
The committee was so concerned that they invited the Premier to provide information regarding the consistency of clause 15 with section 4(3) (c) of the Legislative Standards Act and how the proposed provision would work in practice, including whether the delegation of administrative power needs to be in writing. I note that the Premier has replied to the committee’s concerns, but has done little more than rehash the explanatory notes. As for the practical implementation of the clause, the Premier writes--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1064679"></A>
A key function of Ministerial staff is to communicate with public servants about Ministerial views or decisions. While it would not be practicable for formal authorisations or written delegations to be made by Ministers for every communication entered into between Ministerial staff and public service employees, the extent of authority and the types of work to be performed by individual staff members would be determined in accordance with contracts of employment and day-to-day work management processes. As staff members would not be delegated any formal authority over the management of a department it is therefore not considered that the Bill allows any inappropriate delegation of administrative power. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1064680"></A>
I am sorry, but I am still not clear how a public servant will know, as clause 15(2) states, that the same ministerial staff member can give a direction if he is acting on behalf of a person who may lawfully give a direction. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064681"></A>
Therefore, I close by reiterating the calls of the Integrity Commissioner, Dr Solomon, who said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1064683"></A>
This is the place to spell out that advisers cannot direct public servants in their own right and cannot use their minister’s name if they do not have the minister’s specific approval. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1064684"></A>
This is too important an arena for us to be unclear in our legislation. If our intent is to legislate what has been established by convention over many years, then let us get it right the first time. </Hansard-Body-Continued>

Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind) (4.31 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on the three bills currently before the House: the Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill 2010, the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2010 and the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2010. The Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill 2010 is overdue. I congratulate the minister on introducing this bill and I certainly intend to support it. I believe it clarifies the roles and responsibilities of staff, whether they be employed by a government minister, an opposition member of parliament or a member of the crossbenches. I intend to put some questions to the minister during the committee stage of the debate in relation to the employment of staff. I will leave that to the consideration-in-detail stage of the debate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064687"></A>
In relation to the Public Interest Disclosure Bill and the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, I certainly support the proposal to enable a minister of the government to make an apology without the apology being used as an admission of liability. My experience has been that there are many unfortunate situations where things occur and an apology is certainly justified and warranted, but for a range of legal reasons it is not provided. Often the family directly affected is asking simply for an apology. Therefore, I congratulate the government on this initiative. I will endeavour to support that component in those two bills. However, I will reserve my decision on how I propose to vote on the bills until after I hear how the Premier responds to the matters raised by other members of the House and those raised in my contribution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064688"></A>
I am aware of how quite a few middle management staff in the Queensland Public Service operate. Recently, I had occasion to study the Queensland government code of conduct. My understanding is that the government of the day made a decision and the middle management staff were very zealous, committed and passionate in making sure that the government’s intention was achieved. Some members of the junior staff contacted me and that filtered back to middle management. I will not mention the department involved, but the department officers will know about whom I am talking. Lo and behold, the middle management quoted the code of conduct to the junior staff, indicating that it was totally inappropriate for the staff to share their concerns about what was happening in the department. Therefore, I am aware of the current code of conduct and the way it has been used to put pressure on staff not to share with members of parliament the concerns that they genuinely and rightly have. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064689"></A>
I recall an occasion under a former government when a former Minister for Health attended a public meeting at Nambour Hospital and, basically, read the riot act to staff. He said, ‘How dare you share your concerns with members of parliament.’ His words were, ‘Get on board or get off the ship.’ That minister is no longer with us. You could have heard a pin drop in that meeting of dedicated and committed nurses and health workers at Nambour Hospital. It was disappointing that the media was not there. We were expecting our new Health Minister--it was the former member of parliament who is now in jail--to come to Nambour to say, ‘The government is here to work with you, to share the load and to try to respond to the great pressures our hospital staff are facing’, but instead he read them the riot act. Basically, he said, ‘Stop talking and stop complaining.’ I raised this issue with the minister and said, ‘With respect, Minister, the staff who have been sharing concerns with me have not been trying to tip a bucket on the government, but are simply trying to share their anxiety and their concerns about the level of health care of the people they are entrusted with caring for.’ Unfortunately, it did not go anywhere. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064690"></A>
I am aware of other state government departments that, over the years, have used a range of strategies to put significant pressure on junior staff to prevent, hinder or stop them from talking about their genuine concerns with members of the opposition and members of the crossbenches. The bills before the House talk about freedom and flexibility to share concerns with the media. Clauses 12 and 13 of the Public Interest Disclosure Bill contain significant amendments. The government goes out of its way to say how a member of the Public Service is able to share their concerns about maladministration and official misconduct with members of parliament. Clause 45 is headed, ‘Reasonable management action not prevented’. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1064692"></A>
Nothing in this part is intended to prevent a manager from taking reasonable management action in relation to an employee who has made a public interest disclosure. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1064693"></A>
However, a manager may take reasonable management action in relation to an employee who has made a public interest disclosure only if the manager’s reason for taking the action does not include the fact that the person has made a public interest disclosure. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1064694"></A>
The clause then defines ‘manager’ and ‘reasonable management action’. I quote that clause because I believe, effectively, it is a way out for middle management bureaucrats who want to get their way for a range of reasons. They will be able to use that clause to put significant pressure on staff who would otherwise like to share their genuine concerns with a member of parliament. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064695"></A>
I understand there are significant challenges and real difficulties in getting the evidence that is needed to prove that a manager has abused their position. If this bill becomes law, such a manager could use proposed section 45 to try to intimidate, manipulate or pressure a junior staff member. The reality is that most middle and senior managers are very intelligent and competent people, otherwise they would not hold those positions. They have achieved those positions in the Public Service because of a demonstrated ability to get results. Therefore, at this stage I flag to all members that I will introduce an amendment to this bill to delete clause 45. I believe most public servants are good law-abiding people. They want to see good outcomes for the various departments they work in. I believe this clause is simply an easy way out for those competent intelligent middle management and senior management people to use their position of influence to get rid of or put influence on the very people that the Public Interest Disclosure Bill is intended to protect and give freedom to. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068760"></A>
Another concern I have in relation to these two bills is that I believe they are simply building a bigger bureaucracy in our Queensland Public Service. They are building a massive bureaucracy, and I really wonder whether that is necessary. We talk about the whistleblower legislation. I have concerns with these remaining two bills. I am aware of how public servants are able to manipulate and influence junior staff so that they do not share their genuine concerns with members of parliament. I believe that we should be directly encouraging public servants to share their genuine concerns with members of parliament, irrespective of whether they are members of the government, opposition or crossbenches. We have all been elected to represent our constituents in Queensland to the best of our ability. I genuinely believe that removing clause 45 will put significant pressure on middle management to curtail their potential to use that clause to bully, if I can use that word, members of the Public Service who want to share genuine concerns with members of parliament. I resume my seat and wait to hear the Premier’s reply. I look forward to these three bills proceeding to the committee stage. </Hansard-Body>

 (Currumbin--LNP) (4.40 pm): I rise to join the debate on the Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill 2010, the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2010 and the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2010. These bills were introduced on 3 August by the Premier and Minister for the Arts as the second stage of the Bligh Labor government’s suite of legislative reform announced in the November 2009 <Hansard-Italic>
Response to Integrity and accountability in Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
. Before lunch today I listened as the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Surfers Paradise, began his debate on these bills. From the moment he got to his feet and uttered some home truths about this shabby Labor government, the heckling and harassment from government members was unleashed--just like a pack of wild animals. They can dish it up but they cannot take it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068769"></A>
Journalist Ruth Limkin wrote an article for the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 in July 2009 that explained that by googling the word ‘integrity’ you find 66,500,000 results. There is apparently no shortage of integrity online, but, unfortunately, it is lacking from this Labor government. In an admission of its failings, in August 2009 the government released a discussion paper, <Hansard-Italic>
Integrity and accountability in Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
. The idea of government reform sparked a sizeable response, with 240 submissions officially accepted from a variety of stakeholders. Members of the public, legal professionals, professors, numerous organisations, the Clerk of the Parliament, the Crime and Misconduct Commission and even the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party were among those whose contributions to the highly contentious topics of accountability and integrity were chosen for public consumption on the Premier’s website. The Clerk of the Queensland Parliament, who is held in high regard, made the following opening comment in his submission--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1068774"></A>
If we are to learn anything from our 150-year history as a colony and state, it is that an absence of scrutiny, accountability and transparency will lead, inevitably, to an absence of proper administration. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068775"></A>
He argues that the current system fails to meet the needs of the state, especially since the abolition of the Legislative Council in 1922. No wonder the Clerk and others were concerned. A brief glance at Premier Bligh’s history reveals a series of appalling examples of what the Premier considers to be an open, transparent and accountable government. Here are just a few. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068776"></A>
In January 2006, then Acting Premier Bligh announced that the Labor government would introduce laws to make it legal for her and other ministers to deliberately tell untruths to parliamentary committees. In January 2008, Premier Bligh appointed confessed electoral cheat Mike Kaiser as her chief of staff. Mr Kaiser had previously been forced to resign from parliament in disgrace. He has now left the Premier’s employ with a promise of more money and her blessing to work with NBN Co. In January 2009, it was revealed that members of the Queensland Labor Party were pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars in so-called ‘success fees’ for winning government contracts. Ms Bligh had sat around the cabinet table approving projects that incurred success fees. Among the recipients was her former Labor cabinet colleague Terry Mackenroth, along with former federal Labor MP Con Sciacca. In July 2009, it was revealed that the Bligh government had illegally accepted a $225,000 election donation from the powerful union the CFMEU. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068782"></A>
In September 2009, the LNP released an issues paper, <Hansard-Italic>
Integrity and accountability in Queensland: a blueprint to end Bligh Labor’s corruption and cronyism</Hansard-Italic>
. This was followed by a private member’s bill, the Criminal Code (Honesty and Integrity in Parliament) Amendment Bill 2009. It is because of an unwavering and genuine commitment to restoring integrity to parliament that the opposition continues to call for the end of sloppy, underhand practices in this House. Over 20 members of the LNP stood up to support this bill, but the government’s contribution to that debate was pathetic. A total of five Labor members chose to speak against it and the rest voted it down. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs STUCKEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I think it would be very useful if the member provided what he was talking about. I am sure that when the next election comes around constituents will be reminded of who supported various policies. If Queenslanders want a true revelation of what members of this Bligh government think about providing integrity and accountability to the people of Queensland, then it is important for my constituents to look at the speaking list and see who spoke on this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068789"></A>
The first stage of the Bligh government’s reform was introduced in November 2009 under the auspices of the Integrity Bill 2009, which, among other things, created the stand-alone Office of the Integrity Commissioner, banned the payment of success fees and created a register for lobbyists. As I mentioned in my speech on the Integrity Bill 2009, the first stage of supposed reform did little to offer any substantial changes to prevent corruption, cronyism and unethical behaviour of ministers of government and in elections. Not surprisingly then, these bills before the House today, which together introduce a host of reforms and amendments to about a dozen acts of parliament, have been tossed together in this cognate debate, reducing honourable members’ time to address them individually. Nevertheless, the opposition this morning agreed to pursue this approach. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068790"></A>
Objectives of each of the bills are as follows. The Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill 2010 will create a new stand-alone framework for the employment of staff members to support ministers, the Leader of the Opposition and, where necessary, other non-government members of parliament. This framework will act separately to the Public Service Act 2008. This bill provides a specific communique that ministerial staff do not have the power to direct public servants, an action promised by the government in its January 2010 submission to the CMC inquiry into the issue of interaction between ministers, ministerial staff and public servants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068792"></A>
Notably, the CMC’s inquiry was initiated in response to allegations of misconduct involving former ministerial adviser Simon Tutt to then police minister Judy Spence in the sports rort claim involving $4.2 million of taxpayers’ money. It is a concern of the LNP that this bill does not go far enough to clarify and may even increase the uncertainty of the roles of ministerial staff. As it stands, this bill does little to reflect the reality of established practices and relationships between ministerial staff and public servants. Even more alarmingly, it fails to eliminate the ingrained culture of abuse of power that led to a public inquiry into the behaviour of Tutt and his fellow ministerial staff. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068794"></A>
If it truly is the government’s intention to prevent ministerial staff from giving directions to public servants, then this should be a concrete provision in the bill, but sadly it is not. Confusion prevails with the provision that a public servant cannot be subject to a direction from a ministerial staff member, unless they are acting on behalf of a person who may lawfully give a direction. For example, a minister will still be allowed to give direction to the chief executive of their department. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068795"></A>
Furthermore, it is outrageous that this bill places direct responsibility for the appointment of opposition staff with the director-general of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. As the member for Surfers Paradise stated earlier, the opposition is in no way part of the government. It is a fundamental element of the Queensland parliament, and control of staff should be placed with the Queensland Parliamentary Service--an impartial body, unlike the government’s chief executive--to ensure fair and unbiased decisions are made. I note that a number of LNP members have raised these concerns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068834"></A>
The Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2010 will, in effect, replace the Whistleblowers Protection Act 1994. According to the Premier’s second reading speech, this bill builds upon the framework established under the existing Whistleblowers Protection Act and maintains the protections and rights of disclosers. It could be argued this bill is simply putting a new name to an old face. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068836"></A>
The fundamental problems that exist with the current Whistleblowers Protection Act have managed to weasel their way into this replacement bill. It would seem the Bligh government has made no significant attempt to initiate substantial reform. Namely, the responsibility for protecting whistleblowers is placed upon the very persons who are often the subject of contravening activities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068837"></A>
This bill does permit public servants to leak their concerns to journalists in certain circumstances. However, these circumstances are an avenue of last resort where attempts to have the matter resolved internally have failed. In reality, this means a whistleblower can go to the media only after the required six months for response has expired, leaving any value to their claims stale, dated and, quite possibly, no longer in the public interest. This is a classic example of Labor camouflage and subterfuge, designed to deter the very people to whom it is meant to provide avenues of help. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068838"></A>
The culture of fear created by this government extends beyond the Public Service. Perceived or otherwise, there is a very real fear factor amongst many people who have complaints with the BSA. Only last night I had a gentleman on the phone who contacted me on behalf of another couple who were too terrified to call me directly because they were worried that if the BSA found out that they were contacting me they would somehow be persecuted. I received a submission yesterday to my discussion paper from a couple who wanted to contribute and share their own experiences. This morning I received an anxious email from this couple begging me not to reveal their identity as they feared that the BSA would find out and punish them. It is really sad when situations like this abound and governments become extremely defensive about these behaviours. Consumer protection is everybody’s business as is child protection. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068839"></A>
Now I will make a few comments regarding the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2010 that proposes amendments to a number of acts including the Ambulance Service Act 1991, the Auditor-General Act 2009, the Civil Liability Act 2003, the Fire and Rescue Service Act 1990, the Government Owned Corporations Act 1993, the Integrity Act 2009, the Ombudsman Act 2001, the Parliament of Queensland Act 2001, the Public Sector Ethics Act 1994, the Public Service Act 2008, the Public Service Regulation 2008 and the Right to Information Act 2009. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068841"></A>
It is really astonishing to see the lengths this government will go to to remove itself from liability as a result of its poor decisions, inaction and lack of governance. The proposed amendments to the Civil Liability Act 2003 to allow government departments to apologise without admission of legal liability will shamefully assist the government in admitting to the enormous array of faults and maladministration which have led to some of Queensland’s worst public crises. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068843"></A>
Need I remind the House of the incompetent governance and subsequent denials by the members for Lytton and Rockhampton that resulted in thousands of Queensland Health workers denied pay or experiencing deficient pay cycles for the past six months. Queensland was in the news nationally for all the wrong reasons, as this Health payroll fiasco exploded and the Premier had to undertake damage control by putting an urgent halt to all human resource and payroll programs across her government departments. While she overruled the Minister for Public Works and stripped him of his power in this area, she refused to hold him accountable for his negligent leadership which allowed this awful situation to unfold. Just where is the accountability here? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068845"></A>
Six months on and the situation is still not resolved, with countless alterations needing to be made to health workers’ pays each fortnight. Since September last year the opposition repeatedly alerted Queenslanders of the impending failures of this payroll system. Countless people’s lives have been upturned needlessly by the incompetence of this Bligh government and its ministers. They will not forget when it is time to cast their vote at the polls. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068846"></A>
But now the government’s answer to all of this is to again flex its power muscle to avoid fallout, just as it did in 2006 when it recalled the parliament to remove the offence of telling complete and utter untruths in the Legislative Assembly from the Criminal Code to protect the unforgivable and illegal acts of a former minister--a mate whom many who are still elected members praised for his good character. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068847"></A>
Tony Fitzgerald’s damning comments on the dangerous direction the Beattie and Bligh Labor governments were taking our great state of Queensland in July 2009 have in some way brought us to this debate today. He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1068850"></A>
Access can now be purchased, patronage is dispensed, mates and supporters are appointed and retired politicians exploit their connections to obtain success fees for deals between business and government.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068851"></A>
The timing of this shameful indictment from such a respected individual would certainly suggest it was the embarrassing truth that forced the government to address its shortcomings in the area of integrity and accountability. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068852"></A>
In summary, the LNP accept that some of the amendments within these three bills that we are debating here today are a step forward and an improvement on some aspects of current legislation. Unfortunately though, as members have heard from my LNP colleagues, the Bligh government is using this opportunity to create a fanciful delusion that it is serious about bringing integrity to the operation of Queensland’s government. The people of Queensland are not fools and they know a stunt when they see one. They have lost all confidence in the Bligh government and who could blame them. The LNP, on the other hand, is determined to return accountability and integrity to Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

Mr HOOLIHAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Keppel--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.56 pm): We are dealing with three bills in a cognate debate--the Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill, the Public Interest Disclosure Bill and the Integrity Reform Miscellaneous Amendments Bill. For the benefit of members of this House, I would like to outline some things from the past that certain speakers seem to have overlooked. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068855"></A>
Once upon a time in a galaxy very close to the state in which we presently stand there was a dark side. It was a dark side known as the National Party. All of the opposition speakers seem to have forgotten names like Austin, Lane and Harvey or Terry Lewis or the arch conspirator of the lot who ended up having to have a juror suborned so that he could get the charge thrown out. We come in here and we hear all of these comments about integrity. I do not believe that most of the speakers from the opposition so far could even spell the word. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068857"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mrs Sullivan:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Some of them weren’t even born. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068858"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOOLIHAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection. That is pinching my speech. These people come in and reiterate so much tripe that they believe is contributing to integrity matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068859"></A>
We had the example in this House this morning of the member for Toowoomba South demanding that the Attorney-General take action against a magistrate for a decision that was reached in Toowoomba. How about this for imposing integrity on the courts? We had the Fitzgerald inquiry. The member for Currumbin can waffle on about what Tony Fitzgerald said in July 2009, but what about the reports that Tony Fitzgerald wrote in 1989 that gave us the original CJC? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068860"></A>
Then we had the disgusting and quite outlandish approach of the Borbidge government when it appointed the Connolly-Ryan inquiry to nobble the CMC. They blew it. They did not have any sort of integrity laws. There were none. I worked in the Magistrates Court at that time and I can give members instances of where phone calls came to the magistrate stating that they had to take certain action. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072664"></A>
I knew where they came from and I knew what they were told because I saw the end result. Even the member for Glass House, who mentioned that he had worked for 12 years under the Howard government and the Beattie-Bligh government, is not old enough to have worked under the Bjelke-Petersen government. However, some of the people who were involved with that era are still in this House. Some of them became ministers in the Borbidge government, and I refer to the disgraceful episode in terms of the Mundingburra by-election and an MOU with a certain union. Shock, horror! Should I say it was the Queensland Police Union? That was once again an endeavour to put pressure on the Police Service to act in accordance with what the government of the day wanted. Terry Lewis went to jail for that lack of integrity.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072671"></A>
These three bills are part of the suite of legislation which arose from the <Hansard-Italic>
Response to Integrity and accountability in Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
. The Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill will provide a framework for employment of ministerial staff outside the Public Service so that the actual obligations and requirements of ministerial staff are set out quite differently and in quite separate roles to public servants. As we heard in the minister’s second reading speech, those staff are now employed under the Public Service Act but that does not recognise the distinct roles that they play from the rest of the Public Service. The new regime will separate them from the Public Service and the bill makes provision for an annual declaration of interest, codes of conduct for ministerial staff, the continuation of the current application of the Crime and Misconduct Commission, the Ombudsman and offences under the Criminal Code.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072679"></A>
While dealing with offences under the Criminal Code, it is about time that those people who supposedly have some knowledge of the law and who believe that they can come into this House and slip in under the radar and become the government of Queensland, not knowing anything at all about legislation, should very quickly change the comment about the right to tell untruths to a parliamentary committee. Anyone who thinks that they can come into this House and do that has this House to answer to--no-one else. If someone misleads this House, it should be this House that imposes the penalty on the person who does that. This is one of the only jurisdictions in the Western world that imposed a criminal liability on a member of parliament. If one looks at the Criminal Code published by Sir Reginald Carter, they will see the basis on which that was put in. It was put in when the Criminal Code was written by Sir Samuel Walker Griffith because of his ongoing fight with a member of the legislature at that time who just happens to be a distant relative of mine. I will not go any further with that, but Sir Thomas McIlwraith was my great-great uncle and that was the basis for it because he had made some outlandish arrangements with the Queensland National Bank during the 1890s.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072688"></A>
This really is one of the bills that are part of the government’s commitment to ensure appropriate frameworks are in place to guide the interactions between ministerial staff and Public Service employees. This afternoon I had the great enjoyment of being able to watch proceedings and I found that I had a much more enlightening afternoon when I watched certain of the opposition members with the volume turned down. That told me as much as what I would have found out in here. We heard from the ‘Radio WBTE’ from Kawana--WBTE, applying the American radio system, is wet behind the ears. He is not even old enough to remember Joh Bjelke-Petersen’s name, let alone walk in here and propose to talk about the integrity of members of parliament and how this will be imposed on public servants.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072693"></A>
I turn now to the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill which will introduce a revised set of ethics and principles to form part of the Public Sector Ethics Act. That will deal with integrity and accountability, promoting public good, commitment to the system of government, and accountability and transparency. The one thing that will come out of this--and I heard the member for Nicklin mention this--is that there is a revised model for Public Service appeals, and that also relates to the Public Interest Disclosure Bill which I will deal with separately. It creates a statutory position of appeals officer and extends disciplinary provisions to all Public Service employees. There will be new obligations for certain statutory office holders to declare their interests to their ministers and the Integrity Commissioner. Who in this House would argue with that? When dealing with public money and when dealing with public confidence, which member is going to walk into this House and object to that? Hopefully no-one. The bill also introduces into the Parliament of Queensland Act a statutory requirement for members of the House to provide declarations of interest for themselves and related persons. The procedural requirements in standing orders will remain.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072701"></A>
Comment was also made about amendment of the Civil Liability Act to allow apologies to be made without being taken as an admission of legal liability. That is already in place in a number of areas of the law. What is wrong with saying, ‘I’m sorry that this occurred’, or it may well be, ‘I’m sorry that this occurred within my department and we will ensure that it doesn’t happen again by the introduction of A, B and C as rules to abide by’? This will allow any government--not just a Labor government but any government--or any other person to acknowledge mistakes where their actions may have caused harm.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072703"></A>
The Public Interest Disclosure Bill is a slightly different kettle of fish. Public interest disclosures have for a long time come under what was known as the whistleblowers act and people were terrified of making any sort of disclosure. This act gives them a framework to do that. The member for Nicklin mentioned his proposal to delete proposed clause 45 of the bill, but he did not read far enough, because there are sufficient safeguards and sufficient background actions allowed in that, if any action is taken in relation to reasonable management, there is still a right of appeal in order to review what has been done by a public officer.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084527"></A>
As I said, these three bills form part of the suite of bills which will replace some old acts and enhance integrity requirements so that the people of Queensland are quite at ease with what is done in their name by members of parliament and by public servants. In terms of some of the arguments that have been raised, those people who want to raise those arguments should go back, as I said at the start, and remember those names I mentioned--Harvey, Lane, Austin, Lewis and Bjelke-Petersen. They gave us the Fitzgerald inquiry. This state has come many miles since Fitzgerald brought down his report and hopefully with the introduction of these bills we will travel a lot further. I commend the bills to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs MENKENS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burdekin--LNP) (5.09 pm): These bills that we are debating this afternoon strike at the very heart of this government--a government that has been in power for too long and that has lost touch with the honesty and integrity that is required of it. It is disappointing that these bills are being debated cognately, because that does not give members enough time to really discuss them and analyse how much and how important they are. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080459"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs MENKENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is still disappointing that they have been put together to be debated cognately. The bills that we are debating are the Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill 2010, the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2010 and the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2010. The Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill 2010 sets up a new stand-alone framework for the employment of staff members to support ministers, the Leader of the Opposition and, where necessary, other non-government members of parliament separate from the Public Service Act 2008. Whilst there has been wide consultation, with over 200 submissions accepted to the <Hansard-Italic>
Integrity and accountability in Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
 discussion paper, which was released in August 2009, there remain entrenched fundamental concerns about the outcome. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080461"></A>
In relation to the employment of ministerial staff members, the Premier is the person who is charged with appointing all ministerial staff. That is the reality, as the chief executive of the Premier’s department appoints these staff members on the recommendation of the Premier. The minister for whom they will work is not part of this process. That then means that the employees remain beholden to the Premier, who has the overt factional control of all ministerial staff. As such, the Premier cannot be distanced from shouldering the responsibility for the actions of the full complement of ministerial staff. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080462"></A>
This control by the Premier endures in relation to staff members subject to direction. Ministerial staff members are subject to directions from the Premier as well as the member for whom they are employed. Therefore, these staff are in the tenuous position of effectively having two masters. There is the potential for conflict with this arrangement relating to directions from the Premier and the employing member. The reality may be that this process could become untenable. Other staff members are merely responsible to direction from their employing member or senior staff. So there remains a concern in this overall area of direction and the resolution of conflict. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080463"></A>
The area of employment of staff members by the Leader of the Opposition reflects the current position of contracts for opposition staff being signed by the director-general of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. Again, there is a close linkage with the Premier in this process. The director-general of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet is a personal appointee of the Premier and the possibility for political interference is considerable. One could push the case for opposition office affairs being removed from this government control through the personal Public Service appointee of the Premier. Instead, this appointment could be controlled through an independent body such as the Queensland Parliamentary Service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080466"></A>
One of the critical aspects of this bill relates to staff members not being empowered to direct Public Service employees. This area can be directly attributed to trying to remedy the blatant actions of Simon Tutt. Should we need to be reminded, this incident relates to a ministerial staffer giving a direction to a public servant. Although this amendment seeks to ban the practice, it does not make the giving of such a direction by the staff member an offence. As this case is so fresh in the memory of the state government, these flagrant and self-effacing actions should be made an offence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080468"></A>
Clause 15(2) provides a convenient out whereby a staff member directs a public servant on behalf of a person who may give a direction, for instance a minister. An undue amount of pressure can then be placed on a public servant should they refuse to carry out the directions of a staff member on the premise that they are acting for a minister. Again, the inextricable linkage to the Premier comes into question in relation to the code of conduct and its consultation, review and compliance. This is particularly relevant in regard to interference and influence by the director-general of the Premier’s department. The director-general is personally appointed by and is responsible to the Premier for the activities of the opposition office. The code of conduct for opposition staff should be approved by the Leader of the Opposition. With regard to the area of compliance with the code of conduct, responsibility should rest with the Leader of the Opposition or a third-party agency such as the Queensland Parliamentary Service.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080469"></A>
With regard to the consultation about and the review of the code of conduct, the chief executive of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet is required to consult with the Leader of the Opposition. There is a concern that there is no obligation on the chief executive to comply with any request from the Leader of the Opposition. The linkage of chief executive to the government cannot be underestimated in relation to being independent and it does not sit well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080470"></A>
The Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2010 contains a range of amendments to several acts in an effort to espouse the so-called virtues of this integrity reform package. In relation to the amendments that are made to the Ambulance Service Act 1991, there is the addition of a new section requiring any potential employee to disclose any serious disciplinary action that they may have been involved in in the past. There is also a rewrite in relation to the obligation of the Auditor-General making a declaration of interest. This amendment will diminish the historical independence and impartiality of the position of Auditor-General and the Auditor-General’s responsibility to parliament on a holistic basis.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080473"></A>
With regard to the amendment to the Civil Liability Act 2003, there will be the insertion of a new part 1A that allows for an apology to be made without it being able to be argued to be an admission of liability by the party making the apology. This new provision will not apply in the case of defamation, an unlawful intentional act or unlawful sexual assault. This new part is sure to be used by the government in relation to its well-publicised service delivery failures and public administration issues. The government will now have a vehicle to repent for the wide-ranging failures that it has orchestrated and presided over. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080476"></A>
In relation to the amendments that are made to the Government Owned Corporations Act 1993, one amendment raises questions and concerns. This amendment relates to the removal of assets of GOCs that are being privatised from the jurisdiction of the CMC act. A cloud hangs over this amendment. What is the driver for this amendment? Privatisation and asset sales have infuriated Queenslanders and this covert action will be questioned in terms of why it is required. This is a government and a Premier that talk big about accountability. They talk about openness and integrity, but the community certainly does not believe that anymore. The community has totally lost faith in this government to tell the truth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080477"></A>
Before the last election the Premier and the Treasurer hoodwinked the people of Queensland over the sale of Queensland’s assets and the public will not forget that. The people in my area saw the breakdown of the negotiations between Queensland Rail and the Queensland government over the construction of the northern missing link rail connection. There are just so many contractors who were dudded by this government with broken contracts and the let-down of expectations over this project. Many of those business owners face huge economic losses arising from this breakdown of negotiations and some have been unable to recover. Now, of course, this coal transport infrastructure is on the market along with the coal-loading facilities at Abbot Point. These facilities are major wealth generators for Queensland. Did the Premier tell us about that before the last election? Absolutely not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080480"></A>
Recently I spoke to the RTBU leaders in Townsville. Certainly, it was a revelation of the enormous anger that is felt right across the sector about this government letting down the community and, more than anything, letting down their very supporters. Of course, the local members in Townsville--the member for Mundingburra, Lindy Nelson-Carr, and the member for Townsville, Mandy Johnstone--have got themselves in a bit of hot water for speaking the truth, for publicly calling for a rethink on the privatisation issue. It was a brave move on their part and I say good on them for doing it. But sadly, they reverted to form once they got back in the parliament and they are again echoing the government’s line. The public really expects much more from its elected members than what it has been subjected to from the Labor government incumbency--a tired, worn-out government that has been in power for too long. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080481"></A>
Queensland has been subjected to a litany of disgraceful issues that this government has tried to cover up, and the public has rightly had enough. We have just listened to a huge tirade from the member for Keppel, and I also note the comments by the member for Whitsunday about the anticorruption royal commission and Judge Tony Fitzgerald’s findings and comments made 20 years ago. However, both of those members omitted the views that were expressed by that same man recently in what he says will be his last political commentary. His comments then referred to the current Labor government and they were not complimentary. Mr Fitzgerald said that the prevailing political culture is amoral, anarchic, controlled by money and lacking in ethics, oversight and accountability. He said that too many politicians are motivated by power rather than public interest and that there is too much government by executive. In short, Mr Fitzgerald says our democracy is not broken but bent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080510"></A>
His introduction stated that the community is ill-served by this escalating transfer of power from the public to the dominant political parties and the parties’ disinterest in ethical constraints and resistance to oversight and accountability, even by independent anti-corruption bodies. Without satisfactory legal and ethical fetters the political process, like all human constructs, can be and is manipulated and exploited to advance personal and group interests. A political class has evolved which is interested in little but the acquisition and exercise of power. I must say this is a terrible indictment on this government. I would tactfully remind the member for Keppel and the member for Whitsunday that people in glass houses are in no position to throw stones. </Hansard-Body>

 Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw. In relation to the amendment of the Parliament of Queensland Act 2001 there is a new part, Register of Interests. This turns into statutory form the provisions of standing orders in relation to statements of interest. New members are to supply such statements within one month of taking a seat; also to supply a statement for a related person. Failure to supply will be contempt. All changes must be reported in a month. Failure to notify is contempt. All statements are to be put in the form provided for under standing orders. Giving a knowingly false or misleading statement is contempt and ‘interests’ for the purpose of the statement is to be given a wide meaning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080516"></A>
These obligations offer no flexibility in relation to time lines and any slight errors made by members would see them potentially referred to a parliamentary committee for contempt. It would also appear that the role of the Speaker to exercise a value judgement prior to reference to the committee is not an option. There is also an amendment that excludes local government. This amendment will see that a member of parliament cannot transact business with a state entity but may do so with a local government. The rationale behind allowing a member of parliament to have an active business relationship with a level of government that they could possibly influence seems flawed.</Hansard-Body>

The Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2010 has the objective of implementing the next stage of the integrity reforms and will replace the existing Whistleblowers Protection Act 1994. This is a critical bill to empower insiders--well, supposedly to empower insiders--to expose corruption and maladministration in government and its agencies and to advance the reporting and investigation of these alleged concerns. In reality it is these insiders who become the first to become aware of wrongdoing and can often be crushed by the wrongdoing they see. There must be a process that is sensitive to allow the insider to fully detail the allegations as they see it to ensure a full investigation is undertaken if it is deemed warranted. It is also noted that the disclosure can only legally be made to a journalist if the original body complained to did not notify the complainant within six months. This appears to be an inordinately long period and there should be a case to reduce this. A complainant should be able to approach a journalist if not notified within one month that the complaint is being investigated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080518"></A>
The section in relation to protection needs to be robust. There needs to be no overt or implied pressure or reprisals on employees who are making bona fide disclosure. It is very disappointing to see the level of fear that we are seeing right across the Public Service in so many departments. They are seeing what is happening but they are too frightened for the sake of their job to actually make disclosure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080519"></A>
The content of these bills does have major relevance to government but certainly it can be questioned whether the mechanisms within these bills are the best possible. I note the comments made in relation to these bills by the Leader of the Opposition and I support his position in this cognate debate. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.24 pm): I rise to contribute briefly to the cognate debate on the Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill 2010, Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2010 and the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2010. This is a cognate debate, as many members have made comment on. From the start I would like to reiterate the position that I adopted this morning, along with the other Independents, that we do not believe that this should be a cognate debate. Every piece of legislation in this cognate debate should be considered on its own merits. This cognate debate involves three important pieces of legislation with many clauses and divisions all squeezed into one rushed debate and pushed through this chamber. This style of cognate debate would not be happening in the federal parliament where the Independents hold the balance of power. I doubt very much that Independents would put up with a situation where, with minimal consultation, such significant bills are rushed through parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080522"></A>
If, after the next state election, I am lucky enough to be returned to this place and I am part of a group of Independents who hold the balance of power, which all the political experts seem to be predicting is going to happen, if this type of political stunt is pulled I will be voting against this cognate legislation just on the principle that it is cognate legislation and it is being rushed through parliament and therefore by its very nature there is less scrutiny and transparency. The Independents could act as the de facto upper house. Especially in a unicameral parliament there needs to be more scrutiny of legislation. We have heard many times how legislation gets to this House. Well, quite frankly, by the time the legislation reaches this chamber the debate is done and dusted. No matter how good a speech we make in this place, it does not matter what we say, the government will use its numbers to force the issue. Effectively what we have in the Queensland parliament is an elected dictatorship. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080523"></A>
What will happen if the numbers are more balanced within this chamber is that there will be greater consultation on legislation before it even reaches this chamber. That will be a good thing for the people of Queensland, the mums and dads, and especially the workers for the Queensland government who have so much at stake with these three bills. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080524"></A>
Member after member of the LNP stood to their feet and made very articulate speeches, the majority of which have actually punched holes in and torn this government’s cognate debate to shreds. The member for Surfers Paradise, who has the benefit of a very well resourced office of highly paid and intelligent researchers, said this was an attempt by the government to cloak itself in righteous garb. I agree with him. He said the bill is a reaction to an embarrassing incident. I agree with him. It is action, not words, that shows how a government works. ‘Why is the government pursuing ambulance officers after they have left the service?’, were the sorts of comments made by the member for Surfers Paradise. Then at the end of his speech he said something that absolutely nearly knocked me off my chair. I may have got it wrong and I am prepared to be corrected, but he said that he and the LNP would support this legislation. That was after he delivered a magnificent speech that ripped this legislation to shreds. How can an opposition that has comprehensively established an argument to oppose this legislation then indicate that it will fail to oppose the legislation when it is time to come to a vote?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080525"></A>
The member for Mudgeeraba urged nurses to have the courage of their convictions and go to her with public interest disclosures. How can nurses have the courage of their convictions and make public interest disclosures to the LNP when members of the LNP fail to show they have the courage of their convictions in this place?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080561"></A>
The member for Kawana cried, ‘Spin, spin, spin!’ Yet this morning he was happy to cuddle up with Labor and vote with them when they were allowing this bill to be passed through this chamber as a cognate debate. In disrespecting this chamber and the rules of this chamber and using this chamber as a plaything, as they did this morning when the LNP had an opportunity to take a stand against the Labor Party, are they worried about the government sending out a few press releases saying that the opposition opposed three dodgy bills that were rushed through this parliament? If we have the arguments in this chamber then surely we can prosecute those arguments out in our own electorates, out before our people and before the journalists who ring us and say, ‘Why did you vote this particular way?’ Surely if we have strong words in here, those strong words should follow us out into the community and we should be proud to stand up for those views that we articulate in here. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080565"></A>
Many people in this debate have referred to Toni Hoffman and the great work that she has done and the sacrifice she has made. She deserves every accolade, every medal, every word of praise because she risked everything. This government still treats her in an appalling way. Every Labor member of this chamber should hang their head in shame for the way that she has been left now. I have brought to this chamber many times, repeated times, the circumstances in which this brave whistleblower has found herself after undergoing the ordeal of two royal commissions and a significant criminal trial. Yet this government still prefers to ignore the plight of Toni Hoffman. Today might be a good day to send a message to all the Labor members here, who all have their heads bowed, as they should, that it is time now to bring some justice to Toni Hoffman, to care for her. Why did she have to use all her recreational leave to give evidence or to prepare to give evidence to the two royal commissions and to the criminal trials? We have an opportunity right now. Instead of listening to history lessons from those opposite about the bad old days, how about dealing with the circumstances of the bad old days that are facing us right now? Right now there is a whistleblower who has been shoddily looked after, poorly treated, and we can remedy that situation from now if we have the support of those members opposite. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080571"></A>
I remember the day when Toni Hoffman walked into my office. I remember the difficulty I had also with the political party providing the opportunity to make her voice heard in this chamber, and credit must go where credit is due. If it had not been for the member for Toowoomba South, who supported me then in that party room, then I doubt very much that Toni Hoffman’s voice would have been heard in this chamber. We would have been a far poorer Queensland for that. I can honestly say this now: if Toni Hoffman had approached the LNP now or the ALP--God forbid--she would have Buckley’s chance of having her voice heard in here. How can we trust an opposition that does not have the courage of its convictions about a simple matter of voting for or against a bill to actually put itself on the line and make that whistleblower’s voice heard in this chamber? That is what I would like an answer to today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080576"></A>
Toni Hoffman talked to me about the threats that she and the other nurses at the Bundaberg Base Hospital received from the manager of the Bundaberg Base Hospital in the case that they approached me, a member of parliament. The threat was, ‘If you see Rob Messenger, you will be thrown in jail.’ I hope that there is provision in this legislation, which I am not going to support, that stops managers and high-level public servants--actually, I would describe some of them as mercenaries. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080577"></A>
Some of the managers, especially of the hospitals, have no connection at all with the community. They do not care what the community says or does. All they care about is receiving their very good pay cheque, coming in under budget and following orders that come from a centralised bureaucracy, obviously in Charlotte Street. They are guns for hire; they are mercenary guns for hire. I have seen so many come and go at the Bundaberg Base Hospital it is not funny. They come in, they carry out the orders, they mouth the platitudes and they cover up. For example, they have covered up the superbug outbreak that has been present at this hospital for a year or more, the dental crisis where 268 people were exposed to unclean dental equipment, the whistleblowers--and I will talk about them in a minute--such as Christine Cameron and the over 100 incident reports she submitted that received no feedback. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080580"></A>
Those people need to be held to account. Those mercenary public servants need to understand that if they ignore whistleblowers there will be a penalty to pay. I am glad to see that some of the lessons we have seen from the royal commission are that the likes of Leck and Keating could be pursued by the CMC if they carried out those actions; we have been successful in having that changed. I do have concerns about the Public Interest Disclosure Bill. There are some structural flaws in this bill as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080584"></A>
We have heard from many speakers about the limits that this legislation places on whistleblowers and their ability to approach the media. The reality is that if the media had not spoken to the whistleblower after her voice was heard in this chamber then we would not have had a royal commission because this government went into cover-up mode immediately. As soon as Toni Hoffman’s voice was heard in here, within a matter of days we all know that someone ordered one of those mercenary public servants to buy Patel a business class air ticket and fly him to America where he escaped. Then the machinery of government kicked in. The ministers visited and said to the gathered public servants, ‘Which part of “there will be no investigation” don’t you understand?’ It was taken seriously until Hedley Thomas took the time to speak with the whistleblower, understand that what she and others were saying was truthful, did a little Google search and some fine investigative journalism and found out the real situation and the horrific history of Patel in America and wrote that media article--it was probably a bit like the <Hansard-Italic>
Four Corners</Hansard-Italic>
 program. It took a media organisation to break a massive story that then shamed this government into acting, and this government came kicking and screaming to a royal commission. It did not want a royal commission. It was only, I believe, the ability of the CMC to refuse to investigate the allegations saying, ‘We don’t have the resources,’ that left this government with no other option but to hold a royal commission. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080591"></A>
Have we learnt the lessons of the whistleblowers, in this particular case, of the royal commission into Queensland Health? No, we have not. We still have a bloated bureaucracy. Unfortunately, we have an opposition that is unwilling to attack that bloated bureaucracy. They are very fearful. We found out in the royal commission that, out of the 65,000 employees in Queensland Health, 80 per cent were non-clinical and 20 per cent were clinical. That is not to say that the entire 80 per cent of non-clinical staff were administrative staff and wasted effort. However, it showed that there was an imbalance within Queensland Health. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088747"></A>
If we want to save money, pay our bills and pay off our loans, we will have to finally attack properly the issue of government waste. We are going to have to work out exactly how much is being wasted and cut out that waste. We owe it to our children and our grandchildren. We owe it to the whistleblowers for the lessons we should learn from them. We have found out that there are massive inefficiencies in Queensland Health. Why would an anaesthetist who works in the private system for one day a week and the public system for four days a week perform more operations in the private system than in the public system? Those are the questions that we are going to have to answer honestly and address purposefully if we are going to get this state back on track. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084729"></A>
Before in this place I have raised the issues concerning another whistleblower from the Bundaberg Base Hospital and, once again, the government is trying to cover up those issues. Her name is Christine Cameron. She was a nurse who worked in the accident and emergency department of the hospital. She made around 100 reports of very serious incidents that affected the wellbeing of staff and patients, but she has never received a reply to those reports. I took her to the CMC and we made declarations before the CMC. As the Public Interest Disclosure Bill will allow, the CMC passed those complaints on to the department of Queensland Health, which investigated the claims and allegations through its ethical standards unit. Eighteen months later we are still waiting on the report from the ethical standards unit. It appears that this government is hiding that report. An interim report that came out was basically made up of mistruths. Suddenly, the report went from being the responsibility of the ethical standards unit to that of a manager and then back to the ethical standards unit. We saw this stupid dance where it went back and forth, and we did not quite know who was responsible for writing the report. Needless to say, there is one fact out there. That report has not been written and Christine Cameron, the people of the Burnett and I are still waiting on it. Christine Cameron was responsible for forcing this government to build a new emergency department, which provides six new beds. She deserves credit. I know from experience that this lady is another whistleblower who has risked everything and cannot go back to her profession. She cannot stand the sight of the Bundaberg Base Hospital. She breaks down at the sight of the hospital. She cannot nurse again. She has been completely destroyed by the process that this government has put her through. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084731"></A>
The provisions in the bill that limit who a whistleblower can speak to, especially in the media, are very serious. They should not be there. It will diminish our ability to uncover corruption, to identify waste and to protect the children, women, disabled people and Indigenous people who have been left unprotected by this government. Because this bill has been made cognate and because these three very important bills are being rushed through this parliament without proper scrutiny, I will be opposing them. I reiterate that if we find ourselves in the position where a group of Independents hold the balance of power, I expect any future government to give reasonable and fair warning and allow fair community consultation. That has not happened with this cognate debate. It has been a tricky political stunt and I oppose it. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MALONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mirani--LNP) (5.44 pm): I rise to speak briefly on the Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill, the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill and the Public Interest Disclosure Bill. I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition for the great speech that he made in the parliament today. He covered all the issues exceptionally well. I will speak only briefly on the bills and mainly limit my comments to the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill with reference to the Ambulance Service Act 1991 and the disclosure necessary for recruits who come on board the QAS. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084736"></A>
During my time as shadow Minister for Emergency Services, I have had the misfortune of becoming aware of what happens to people who run foul of the operations of QAS and the middle and upper management of that organisation. They have been pursued through the CMC and, ultimately, through the integrity commission board of QAS. Even if they are cleared by the CMC, they will still be pursued by the QAS. In a lot of cases, those paramedics and employees of QAS are put through absolute hell by this government and previous Labor governments. Frankly, I see this legislation as giving the government greater opportunity to pursue people once they have made a declaration. I believe everybody should be treated equally. When a cadet joins the QAS, or anyone else enters employment within government, I believe they should be treated equally and fairly. However, I have seen family units break down, divorces occur and suicides happen because of the bullying and harassment within emergency services. I have raised my concerns about this in relation to the Ambulance Service Act, and obviously firefighters are affected as well. In relation to rural fire brigades and so on, middle and upper management appear to have a view that volunteers are just unpaid staff who can take orders as if they were paid staff. That is not acceptable. Volunteers give of their free time. They help people who are in distress. They fight fires or perform emergency services work. They may work on the side of the road with the SES. All of the volunteers who do such work save this government and the taxpayers of Queensland quite a considerable amount of money, yet they are bullied and abused in this manner. Therefore, ‘integrity’ is not a word I would use lightly in connection with the government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084737"></A>
I was reluctant to speak on these bills, until I heard the member for Keppel make some comments earlier in the House in relation to some Liberal and National parties’ pre-1989 members who faced certain charges and some of whom went to jail. They were caught up in a situation that none of us would ever want to be caught up in. They were signing off on documents that were appropriate at the time, but then pre-dated legislation was pushed through the parliament by the Goss government--in fact, they were Henry VIII clauses--and those members were caught up in a situation whereby the documentation they had supplied was no longer relevant or was not regarded as sufficient. I would hate any member of parliament to have to go through that again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084738"></A>
If we want to talk about integrity, let us talk about some of the members of the Labor Party who have also been members of this House. Let us talk about Keith Wright, Bill D’Arcy and Gordon Nuttall. Unfortunately, the government of the day sat with Bill D’Arcy while he was a convicted criminal because they did not have the numbers in the House. Is that integrity? If members opposite are going to throw stones, they should make sure that they aim properly. If we are talking about integrity, we could talk about Paul Lucas, Jim Elder, Grant Musgrove and Mike Kaiser. Do I need to go on? I find it unbelievable that an educated member of this parliament would be stupid enough to raise the issue, particularly when his side of the House is so out of step with integrity. As I said, I was reluctant to speak on these bills, but I was amazed that a member of the parliament would make those claims. If we look back at history, the charges that were laid against the members of the Liberal and National parties were quite minor in comparison to those laid against Keith Wright, Bill D’Arcy and Gordon Nuttall. I did not want to speak at any length on these bills, but it is very important to correct the record. Those members opposite should hang their heads in shame. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. DM WELLS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Murrumba--ALP) (5.49 pm): Madam Deputy Speaker, may I commence by paying tribute to the Public Service of Queensland, the loyal civil servants who serve the people, irrespective of which government is in power, and who do so diligently and so well. I have had the privilege of working with the Public Service of Queensland in the capacity of a minister, in the capacity of a government backbencher and in the capacity of an opposition member. In all of those circumstances I have found that they were diligent, they were committed to serving the mandate of the government of the day and they were absolutely meticulous in their duty. I have seen them go far beyond the extra mile in order to serve. I have seen them work back until midnight in order to get a job done. I have seen them give away their weekends in order to get a job done. I have rarely seen a public servant who even showed the slightest moment of hesitation or the slightest complaint about doing their duty to the public. Overwhelmingly, the Public Service of Queensland has done us proud and has delivered the consequences of our democratic system. I think that we ought to pay them such a tribute. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084770"></A>
I was somewhat surprised therefore when I heard the Leader of the Opposition say that the purpose of the legislation was the ‘bureaucracy is held in such poor regard by the general community’. It is not held in poor regard by the general community. The public servants of Queensland are widely respected. The Leader of the Opposition also said that an LNP government will not be providing extra processes for ‘yet more bureaucrats’. The anti-Public Service bent of honourable members on the other side of the House needs to be known more widely, I think. The Public Service is the instrument by which the mandate that the people give to the elected government is delivered, and our Public Service does it well and they do it proud. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084771"></A>
This is a piece of legislation that has a number of consequences. It brings together a single code for public servants, a single ethical code. It establishes a basis of principles for departmental statements of objectives. It provides a statutory basis for our pecuniary interest register. It brings other officers into the integrity framework including officers who report directly to the parliament. I would like to mention some of those in a moment. But I interrupt what I was saying because I want to nail a misstatement. I want to nail a disingenuity that came from honourable members on the other side of the House. Perhaps it need be mentioned only once, but it should be mentioned. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084772"></A>
Honourable members referred to the removal by this parliament some time ago of a section of the Criminal Code that made it a criminal offence not triable in the courts to lie to a parliamentary committee. I remind honourable members that the proposition that the government made it open to members to lie to parliament is itself a lie. To lie to parliament is a contempt of the House with severe consequences. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WELLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I retract. The misleading, the disingenuousness and the falsity of the proposition that the government made it possible for MPs to tell untruths to parliament is a proposition that is inimical to democracy. The old law did not just potentially criminalise MPs but also potentially criminalised journalists, public servants and indeed any member of the public ever called before a parliamentary committee. A corrupt government would be able to use a provision like the old section 57 of the code to silence dissent and suppress free speech by threatening to bring a person who makes assertions it particularly did not want to hear to trial in a criminal court. A corrupt government would be able to stack a court to ensure a conviction. How odd it is therefore that the same opposition that says it wants to bring back criminal court processes for things said under parliamentary privilege told us today that it had reservations about putting the requirement for pecuniary interest declarations into legislation because people do make mistakes. That is somewhat inconsistent one might think, but then there are cheap votes to be won by falsely asserting that this government made it permissible to tell to the parliament something which was untrue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1084783"></A>
I would now like to refer to some remarks made by the honourable member for Kawana. He, in the course of his remarks, tabled some correspondence from the Ombudsman which he had clearance from the committee of this House to make use of in this debate. He did not table the response to that correspondence of the Premier which I think completes the picture. The proposition that the Ombudsman was asserting--and one has to take due cognisance of the Ombudsman’s thoughts on this subject--was that it was improper, in his view, to extend the scrutiny of the Public Service Commission to the management of the Ombudsman’s office, and the reason for that was that the Ombudsman’s office reports to a committee of this parliament. It is a creature of the parliament, not a creature of the executive. Therefore, the Ombudsman argued that it was not appropriate for the Public Service Commission to have overall scrutiny of the Ombudsman’s office. On the basis of his argument, one would have to agree that it would not be appropriate for the executive arm of government to have overall scrutiny of the Ombudsman’s office. But that is not what was actually at stake and that is not what the legislation proposes to do.  I table the letter from the honourable Premier in respect of this matter to the parliamentary committee so that the documentary record is complete for the benefit of the public. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Paper-Heading>

Tabled paper:</Hansard-Italic>
 Letter, dated 8 September 2010, from Hon. Anna Bligh MP, Premier to Ms Barbara Stone MP, Chair of the Law, Justice and Safety Committee, in relation to the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2010. </Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088789"></A>
I note that it points out that this legislation does not give the Public Service Commission the power to review or monitor the way in which the commissioner--that is, the Ombudsman--exercises functions under the Ombudsman Act. The letter goes on to say that the functions of the oversight agency will only apply to the corporate responsibilities of the Ombudsman in relation to employees of the office. In other words, it is only about management. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088795"></A>
The extension of the ambit of the Public Service Commission to look at the Ombudsman’s office and to look indeed at any agent of the government broadly speaking which reports to this parliament applies only to the management functions and the HR functions of that office. It does not relate at all to the independent decision-making power of the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman’s decision-making power of course should be exercised independently. This legislation does not give the Ombudsman the power to second guess, to scrutinise or to call to account the exercise of that discretion. What this legislation does, however, is address any management issue that might arise. </Hansard-Body>

There was never--the last time I asked the question; and I did ask the question--any public interest disclosure within the Ombudsman’s office. While the issue is theoretical it is nevertheless a point which the Ombudsman might well properly make. But the answer to it is that it relates only to management. While it is appropriate to congratulate the Ombudsman on being zealous to preserve the independence of statutory office holders who report to the parliament, at the same time it is important for this parliament to note that the independence, the discretion and the capacity to do their statutory tasks is not inhibited, not even to a slight degree, by this piece of legislation. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1088798"></A>
This is a benign piece of legislation. This is a piece of legislation that we would expect to see in the kind of free, open and democratic society that Queensland is. This piece of legislation is a tribute not only to our public servants but also to the minister--that is, the Premier--who introduced the legislation. It is a statement of our democracy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088799"></A>
This legislation is not necessary because of any fault that we find with the Public Service or the public sector generally. This legislation is necessary because the public needs to know how open and transparent this government and this parliament is. The public needs to know about the pecuniary interest register that honourable members have to fill in. They need to know that statutory office holders in terms of their personnel management function do have oversight from an agency that maintains consistent provisions across departments. We would not want a statutory office, however independent it might be in the fearless exercise of its function, to be investigating its own public interest disclosures, were there any, because we would not want Caesar to be investigating Caesar. This is an important piece of legislation. It is a significant advance in Queensland’s democracy. I recommend it to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr CRANDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Coomera--LNP) (6.04 pm): The cognate debate incorporates debate on the Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2010, the Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill 2010 and the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill. The Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill 2010 is necessary and is brought about because a ministerial adviser overstepped the mark and directed others to divert funds meant for use by a particular organisation. This the classic master-servant relationship where the master has all the power. He wields the power and directs the public servant to do as he or she is told. It is high time that the necessary legislation be put in place. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1088802"></A>
I have to ask whether this sort of bullying is rampant not only within ministerial offices but within departments. We have heard numerous examples brought to light by opposition members. Here is another example. A Department of Transport and Main Roads employee who fell ill had some 15 years of exemplary service. The mental health illness was partly brought about by the workload among other things. The health issues are well documented over an extended period of time by no fewer than four separate health professionals, including two psychiatrists. There are psychiatric reports as long as your arm. As well, there were workload issues brought on by workplace harassment and bullying. Combine all this with sexual harassment allegations. Amongst all of this there was a severe lack of communication from the department. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088804"></A>
Due to the mental health issues, the employee found it difficult to give evidence. Indeed it appears that it was on the employee’s psychiatrists advice that to do so could be detrimental to the employee’s health. Eventually the case was finalised and it was found that there was no case to answer. There was no case to answer even though there were sexual harassment, bullying, workload issues et cetera. What do members think happened? The case was closed? No, not at all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088805"></A>
The department is considering charging the employee with making vexatious claims and for misconduct. Here we have an individual suffering mental health issues who could not properly give evidence. That was part of the reason for the decision that there was no case to answer. Now that person has been told that the department may pursue a case against them. It is going on and on. This person is being persecuted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088807"></A>
Where is the common sense in this case? It is obvious to everyone that this person is suffering mental health problems. This person needs to focus on their recovery. I call on the minister to use his discretion in this matter and call the attack dogs off. This person needs to focus on their recovery. This person is being persecuted. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (6.07 pm): I rise to speak to the cognate bills. They are three very important bills, hence the division this morning in relation to debating the three of them cognately. All of them deal with very important issues not only for the running of the parliament and government departments but also from the perspective of the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1088812"></A>
I did not hear all of the debate because our committee sat in the early part of the afternoon. From the rest of debate that I have listened to one would be forgiven for thinking it was a competition between the ALP and the LNP to determine who had the most crooks. We had lists of Austin, Lane and Lewis and then Wright, D’Arcy and Nuttall. I am not referring to those six people when I say this. It is possible for people in a position, in a job, to make mistakes. If those mistakes are intentional then that is where illegality, fraudulence and those sorts of accusations come to the fore. I think the community showed in the federal election that it is sick and tired of the major parties, instead of dealing with the issues, taking pot shots at one another and trying to justify their actions on the basis of wrongdoing on one side whilst the people making those accusations possibly live in glass houses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092964"></A>
All of us are capable of making a genuine mistake. The Public Interest Disclosure Bill and the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill are there to manage people who might try to do the wrong thing intentionally. The Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill 2010 is a bill to separate the appointment of ministerial staff from the Public Service Act into its own act. I thank the minister for the briefing that we received. Leighton, Nick, Christine, Cecilia, Donna and Karen gave us a great deal of their time and certainly were able to answer most of the questions asked. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092971"></A>
The fact is that the Labor Party gained office in 1989. I have only been involved in this parliament since 1995, but my observation prior to that and certainly my observation since then is that senior staff, including directors-general of departments, have been politicised. It started in 1989, and when Rob Borbidge took office in 1995 my office received correspondence alleging that Borbidge was appointing directors-general on a politically biased basis. I looked into that process, and that is when I determined that he had not started it; it had been growing as far as senior ministerial staff and senior governmental officers were concerned. Therefore, I can understand why the opposition has raised concerns about directors-general being able to appoint opposition staff as opposed to the Public Service, which generically has been apolitical.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092976"></A>
At the briefing it was indicated that in practice the arrangements will be much the same. However, if there is any concern about the independence of appointments then certainly that needs to be clarified and corrected. It is important for ministerial staff not to be able to give direction to departmental staff, unless of course they have the direct authority from the minister. But let us be honest: the reality is that many ministerial staff will carry out their duties--and I am not talking about ministerial staff now; I am talking generically--with an inferred authority because they get used to acting in that way. In past history it was always said that the Public Service was apolitical. There may be one or two directors-general who can claim that they have been in the Public Service in those senior positions across both sides of government, but they are very few and far between now. Therefore, those senior political appointments are politically based as opposed to independently based.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092980"></A>
There have been a number of concerns raised in relation to the Public Interest Disclosure Bill. It is critically important that people working in the Public Service have an ability to take their concerns, if they have an honest belief that there is wrongdoing, to people outside of the Public Service. The most strident example of the lack of ability for a department internally to deal with regular complaints is the Patel issue. One or two of the staff--I do not think it was only Nurse Hoffman, but she perhaps was the main one--regularly took their concerns to their higher management and those concerns were blocked within the immediate hospital structure. The Public Interest Disclosure Bill or whistleblowers legislation is intended to be a safety valve, if you like, for those people who work within the Public Service in particular to be able to make a public interest disclosure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092988"></A>
There are only a few other issues that I want to raise with regard to this bill. As has been mentioned by other speakers, I am concerned about the protection from liability in that a person who has been involved in or who supervised an activity--an action--is able to make an apology to an affected party without attracting liability. In some instances that is excellent because, as the member for Nicklin said--it may have been someone else--often people who are disadvantaged or offended by a process only want an apology. However, in many instances that apology should be inclusive of reparation, whether that is financial or physical reparation. I am concerned that the lack of liability that will attach to an apology, whilst good in some instances, could mean that there will be a rash of apologies because people will think, ‘It’s not going to cost us anything because there’s no liability,’ and it will be possible for serial offenders to hide behind that ‘I’m sorry’ and not actually address the actions that have attracted the need for the apology. If there is a systemic problem then the problem should be fixed, not a series of apologies to a series of people because of the same lack of action, wrong action or hyperaction.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092989"></A>
The member for Nicklin raised concerns about clause 45 of the Public Interest Disclosure Bill which provides that reasonable management action is not prevented in relation to a whistleblower, and I would share his concerns. Humans are wonderful beings and can do tremendous good; however, we can also be tremendously devious. One of the most difficult things to identify and prove is that a manager, given that they are in a disproportionate position of power--they are senior and have more authority over, usually, the whistleblower--if they are so disposed, will be able to use what they call ‘reasonable management action’ and disadvantage a whistleblower and be able to justify it. Regardless of whether clause 45 is in or out of the bill, if a manager does take reasonable management action then the whistleblower themselves would be less likely to cause or question that action if indeed it is reasonable. I also note that the member for Nicklin will be moving an amendment in relation to that matter.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092990"></A>
Other speakers have talked about departments where they have had direct experience of employees articulating concerns to elected members and to others and subsequently being read the riot act, where they are reminded in very forceful terms of the code of conduct. Most often it is in the department of health, but it does happen in other departments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092992"></A>
When I was mayor of Calliope council I had a staff member come to speak to me in relation to a private matter. It was to do with a footpath in front of their place. They had asked for remediation of that footpath. It had not happened appropriately and then it had not happened at all. They came and spoke to me and I spoke to the appropriate person in the council to request that that be inspected. The employee was then approached by a senior manager and told that they had done the wrong thing by speaking to me. It is my firm view that, even if you work for government, you do not give up your democratic right to justice or an opportunity to be heard. However, I think in many instances people who work within councils or government departments have those fundamental rights eroded because they are told that they cannot speak out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092995"></A>
In one instance I had an employee of a government department speak to me. She had been told by her departmental seniors that she was going to be terminated as she was seen to be unfit for the job because of a response to a specific situation. She had six to nine months of grief from her immediate senior and yet for that same situation she had received at least two citations from the director-general level of the department. So on the one hand she was being told within her local management area that she was unfit for the position based on this incident, yet in the macro sense she was told that she had responded very competently and that the people who were affected whom she dealt with were incredibly complimentary about what she did. Indeed, she was instrumental in saving a life.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093024"></A>
So from my perspective, it is critically important that workers within the government sector and within the council sector--where this bill will have reach--have to go through the chain of command within reason but, where that fails, they must be able to pursue their grievances externally as a democratic right and opportunity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093026"></A>
The Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill extends the opportunity for a person to have disciplinary proceedings to continue even if that person resigns from the department. I believe that is reasonable, provided the issue is serious enough for those proceedings to continue. This bill contains the apology without legal liability. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093027"></A>
From the community’s point of view, whether these bills pass unchanged or not, it is our responsibility, as members of this chamber and for people in every workplace, to as much as possible act in good faith and act honestly in the carriage of our responsibilities. There will be people who will fail and that is where the legislation is needed. But certainly, the legislation should not be drafted in a way that will disadvantage people who work in good faith and who want an opportunity to correct a wrong externally if they cannot get it sorted out internally. It would be a tragedy to see this state in any way undermine or compromise the ability of those employees to do that. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr SPRINGBORG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southern Downs--LNP) (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (6.21 pm): In rising to speak in this cognate debate and in perusing the intent of these bills, I think it is fair to say that whilst the intent of what is put before this parliament is generally appropriate, one has to wonder about the motivation. I think the motivation has probably grown out of the predicament that this government has found itself in since the last state election. There has been a hue and cry across Queensland about the deception and the dishonesty at the last state election and a whole range of more recent situations where high-profile members of the government--from a parliamentary perspective and also from a senior staff perspective--and former members of this House have found themselves in a position of being compromised, in a position of facing charges, in some cases criminal charges and being incarcerated, and in other cases being accused of inappropriately using their power and influence in the case of staff and, in the case of former members of this House, lobbying to gain some sort of significant financial benefit based on their previous knowledge or through the position that they have within the hierarchy of the government in Queensland. So whilst there is some indication that there may be some benefit from certain provisions in these bills that are being debated cognately, I think the intent is something that is a little more questionable.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093030"></A>
None of this means absolutely anything unless the government is prepared to live by the spirit of this legislation, which will undoubtedly pass through this parliament tonight or tomorrow. If you are fundamentally good and you fundamentally know the right thing, then you are going to fundamentally do the right thing. If you fundamentally have a predisposition towards not doing the right thing and you take every opportunity to advance your own position, whether that be financially or through a position of power, then it does not matter the amount of legislation, the amount of regulation, the amount of codes of ethics, the amount of codes of conduct, or the conflict of interest disclosures, you are still going to fundamentally try to find a way of doing the wrong thing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093031"></A>
I ask members to keep in mind that in recent times in this parliament we have seen a whole new range of accountability measures put in place. Some years ago we saw an Integrity Commissioner put in place apparently to address issues where members were struggling with situations of compromise or concern about conflict in relation to their role as an MP or their role as a member of the executive and what is expected of them. Despite the Integrity Commissioner being put in place, we have seen at least one minister--and probably two ministers--go to jail in Queensland and we have also seen a situation where the actions of other senior members of government staff have been brought into question. So I am not necessarily sure that this legislation is going to bring about this wonderful reform, this great new day in the sun that the government says it is going to bring about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093032"></A>
In 2009 Tony Fitzgerald said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1093034"></A>
Reform is always difficult. Vested interests whose activities might be adversely affected inevitably oppose reform strenuously. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1093035"></A>
He went on to make the following very concerning statement--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1093037"></A>
Misleading or deceptive conduct is barred in commerce, but secrecy and misinformation...are routinely employed by politicians. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093038"></A>
I do not think that that is something that we should be wearing with any badge of pride in this place. I think the most concerning thing is that Tony Fitzgerald made these comments almost 20 years after the landmark Fitzgerald reform process, the report which he brought down which the former Premier Mike Ahern said would be implemented lock, stock and barrel. Indeed, the early stage of that legislative reform was put in place by the Cooper administration insofar as the then CJC Act and the Electoral and Administrative Reform Commission were established. The various arms and tentacles of the reform went on from there and were implemented by the Goss government in its first term. Very worryingly, I think that in recent times a fair bit of that reform has variously been wound back, stymied or in some way blocked by this government in particular. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093039"></A>
I have listened with interest to some of the assertions made by honourable members opposite about how good the Labor Party has been with regard to integrity and what this legislation is all about. But I have noticed that one thing that is fundamentally missing from their narrative is the word ‘honesty’. Dishonesty is the whole reason that this government finds itself in this predicament at the moment, because it fundamentally and comprehensively misled the people of Queensland at the last state election, particularly on the issue of the sale of generational assets and also on the issue of the retention of the Fuel Subsidy Scheme in Queensland. That is a sin beyond which I think it will be very difficult for this government to recover. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093040"></A>
I have also heard members opposite talk about the Labor government and the abolition of the so-called gerrymander. That process started with the establishment of EARC in 1989, but I will review the issue of this so-called gerrymander, which had its genesis back in Labor’s days of the 1940s and the 1950s. On not one single occasion from 1957 to 1989 did Labor in Queensland achieve more than 50 per cent plus one of the vote. On the first occasion that it did so in 1989, it actually won the election. Then we had the EARC reform process and we went to the election in 1992 under the so-called new uncorruptible electoral boundaries in Queensland, which were put in place as a consequence of the EARC process. It is very interesting to note that, with the redistribution, the vote for the Labor Party in the 1992 election was 48.73 per cent. In 1989 it was 50.32 per cent. In 1989 the vote for the National Party was 24.09 per cent. In 1992 it was 23.71 per cent. In 1989 the vote for the Liberal Party was 23.5 per cent. In 1992 it was 20.44 per cent. All of those political parties achieved a vote within about one per cent or just over what they achieved in 1989 and guess what? The Labor Party won exactly the same number of seats as it won in 1989, the National Party won one fewer and the Liberal won one more. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093041"></A>
But what happened in 1995? The Goss Labor government won 46.7 per cent of the vote and won a majority in this parliament. Indeed, based on the figures at the last state election, the LNP in Queensland has to win 54 per cent of the vote in order to just win a majority in this parliament, but Labor can maintain power with 47 per cent of the vote. That is an issue that fundamentally needs to be addressed. With the way that the boundaries have been drawn, we have a one vote, one value gerrymander in Queensland. After the last state election in South Australia, that parliament was prepared to see whether the Electoral Commission should be trying to address the issue so that the votes received on a two-party preferred basis were reflected in the number of seats that were actually delivered to the parties at that particular poll. I think it is something that fundamentally needs to be looked at here. It is about time that those people who want to comment on this issue, those people who want to rewrite history, fundamentally look at what really happened between 1957 and 1989 vis-à-vis the Labor Party and the conservatives at the time and what has happened subsequent to that period. I think that a scrutiny of what happened during that time would reveal that there is something fundamentally wrong with the Queensland electoral system at the moment. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(7.31 pm): It has been said that a wife who loses her husband is called a widow, a husband who loses his wife is known as a widower and a child who loses their parent is referred to as an orphan, but there is no word for a parent who loses a child. That is how awful the loss is. In 2008-09 eight children aged between one and four drowned in backyard swimming pools in Queensland. It would be simplistic to compare this number to the number of backyard pools in Queensland, which is estimated at over 300,000, because for every tragic drowning or near drowning event the impact extends beyond the immediate family and into our communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097404"></A>
Queenslanders enjoy an enviable lifestyle. We identify with images of the surf and the sea. We take pride in our athletes who compete in swimming events. Our climate lends itself to backyard pools and owning a pool is a source of enjoyment for many families. Unfortunately, too often this idealistic image is shattered as we hear reports of a tragic drowning. In some cases it is revealed that the backyard pool failed to meet basic safety standards. Indeed, media reports just last week indicated that a staggering 80 per cent of pools in the Sunshine Coast Regional Council area failed council safety inspection at their first attempt. This figure is disturbing. It appears that far too many pool owners have become complacent and either accidentally or deliberately ignore pool safety laws. These owners take the chance that they will not be caught out by council inspectors, but in doing so they are playing Russian roulette with our children’s safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097405"></A>
The Swimming Pool Safety Improvement Strategy has enjoyed bipartisan support because the issue of pool safety is an important one. The Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) will continue to enjoy that bipartisan support from the LNP. As is often the case, a fresh set of eyes can see areas of improvement and it is with that spirit that the LNP will be proposing amendments and raising concerns with a view to taking good and important legislation and making it better. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097406"></A>
The policy objectives of the bill’s pool safety reforms are to help reduce the incidence of pool related immersion injuries and deaths for a very vulnerable section of our community, children under five. It is envisaged that this would be achieved by introducing the requirement for pool fences to be regularly inspected by competent and qualified pool safety inspectors. This is in part achieved by enabling legislation found in the Building and Other Legislation Bill that was introduced this year. This bill enabled the establishment of the Pool Safety Council, which is responsible for overseeing the operation of the pool safety inspector licensing system, including the approval of training courses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097407"></A>
I would say to those members of the Pool Safety Council and the minister that any training course must be conducted by a registered training organisation and the course must comprise of modules that meet nationally recognised competencies. Failure to do so will erode public confidence in our pool safety inspectors. When the person turns up to undertake the inspection work, Queenslanders need to know that they have been properly trained and that the organisation that trained them met the Australian Quality Training Framework standards. They have to have confidence that the training they received met the national qualifications and they need to know that it is a nationally recognised training level. Registered training organisations have a requirement to face audits to ensure that they are delivering quality training and assessment. If we get it right at the beginning, if we ensure that those organisations that are providing the training are indeed RTOs, we can have confidence that what we are setting up today will serve us well into the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097409"></A>
Failure to adhere to nationally recognised competencies and to only reference them will result in qualifications that are at risk of becoming identified as something akin to a corn-flakes-packet licensing option with no credibility. That is something that we cannot afford to have in our community. I would urge the Pool Safety Council and the minister not to take shortcuts in this area. Indeed, we can draw upon the federal Labor experience with the Home Insulation Program. That program was rushed out for political expediency. Training was compromised and, tragically, not only were the lives of homeowners and installers put at risk but also lives were lost. We must not allow this to occur with the training of pool safety inspectors. We must not set it up to fail by compromising the high standard of training. I note that the minister in his summing-up on the Building and Other Legislation Bill (No. 1) said that the high quality of pool safety training courses is absolute. I would hope that that line would be honoured by the minister and future ministers to follow. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097410"></A>
Whilst the bill does not detail a commencement date, the Premier is on the record as indicating a start date for stage 2 of 1 December 2010. It is appropriate that this is when we should start the focus because, obviously, we are moving into our summer season and many Queenslanders will be dusting off their swimmers and getting into their backyard pools. However, we have seen some impacts upon this timeline. Of concern is the formation of the Pool Safety Council. Despite the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) passing in May, we are advised that, indeed, the first meeting of the council was only last week. Four months have passed. The Pool Safety Council has a responsibility to approve the training program and to ensure that the training of individuals is to an appropriate standard before they are licensed. It is of concern to the LNP. </Hansard-Body>

It would be optimistic to expect licences to be issued before October at the earliest. That gives us only two months to undertake the necessary inspections and to ensure that we are ready for an implementation date of 1 December. There is concern that there will not be a sufficient number of properly qualified pool safety inspectors in place to cope with the influx of applications before 1 December and in the weeks immediately following as we come up to that busy time of year with holidays and families taking time away from their home only to come back later in January but wanting to have their pools certified. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1109866"></A>
It is clear that this government and the minister could have and should have done more to prepare Queenslanders so that the pool safety certificates could be issued before 1 December 2010. What we now need to ensure is that proper resources are committed by this government so that we do not see the program fall over on its first day. It will be an issue of resourcing. It will be an issue of commitment. It will be an issue of finding the right public servants to champion this to ensure that the job is done in a timely manner.</Hansard-Body>

On the issue of the pool safety certificates, it is good to see that the minister has learnt from the debacle that was the sustainability declarations. I commend the minister for getting the font right and for making the certificates easy to use. It highlights for all of us in this chamber that we should not simply parrot the lines that are given to us. When the sustainability declaration was introduced, Labor MPs embarrassed themselves. They stood up saying that there was no fault with this declaration, that the documentation was fine. Clearly, they were wrong. Three versions later, we now have a sustainability declaration that, whilst I do not support it, I accept is a much better version than was introduced to this parliament in the very first place. </Hansard-Body>

Tragically, many of these drowning incidents occur shortly after families with young children move into new and unfamiliar environments. This is why the state government has proposed that pool owners who want to sell or lease a property will first need to obtain a pool safety certificate. We want to ensure that residential pools are safe before a new family moves in. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127850"></A>
These were the minister’s words from his second reading speech in the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill No. 1. He clearly said they are seeking pool safety certificates ‘before a new family moves in’. The minister was right then. He was spot on. The research clearly shows that in those first six months when families are in a new environment they are at the greatest risk. I would hazard to say that in those first three months the risk is probably at its greatest. Indeed, having been in the Army and moved quite a few times with my family, I know that in those initial weeks, when people are unpacking boxes and trying to find where the various cupboards are, that is the time when they are most unfamiliar with their new home. It is with that concern in mind that the LNP will be moving amendments to ensure that a contract to sell a property with a pool is conditional on the issue of a pool safety certificate and that we do not set this legislation up to fail by providing a 90-day window for the purchaser to make the pool compliant. Those 90 days could be 90 days of danger for any family. Why the minister has backtracked from his original position is of great concern. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105606"></A>
We know that these initial days are the most critical and the effect of the amendment we are putting forward will be to make it safe for families when they move in. This amendment is supported by the LGAQ. It is supported by the Swimming Pool &amp; Spa Association of Queensland. Even the REIQ was not opposed in our discussion and even made the suggestion that, in order to cut red tape, a single disclosure regime could be put in place not only for the pool safety certificate but also the current requirements that exist for the earth safety switch and smoke alarms, which must be declared before the time of sale. Clearly, there is support, but there is even greater support as I am advised that the minister’s own Pool Safety Council in its very first meeting directed the chair to write to the minister indicating that the Pool Safety Council is not supportive of the 90-day period that has been placed in this bill. It wishes to see, as we do, as all Queenslanders do, a bill that is watertight, a bill that is right, a bill that will deliver safety for our children in Queensland. I would encourage the minister and all members in this chamber to support these amendments. They are not designed for anything other than to ensure our children are safe. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105612"></A>
If the minister does not intend to support these amendments, he must provide to this House reasons why he has backed down from his original position. He must tell this House who has lobbied him to change from his original position because the major stakeholders are, indeed, supportive. Wandering through the Stranger’s Dining Room this evening, I had the opportunity to meet with Mr Plint from Hannah’s Foundation. He indicated to me that he personally is also supportive of this amendment. Here is an individual who has taken a tragedy in his life and turned it into a cause that he champions. This amendment is something that will make good legislation better. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105616"></A>
I am sure that, despite the best efforts and desires of all in this chamber, this bill will not stop tragic pool drownings. Unfortunately, no legislation that we pass can stop them permanently. Supervision of children by responsible adults is essential. Indeed, in many child drowning incidents, supervision was deemed to be inadequate or nonexistent. Coronial data reveals that in many instances when toddlers drowned the responsible adult was not even aware that the toddler was in danger. The Queensland Injury Surveillance Unit observed that there were few reports of toddlers drowning when they were being directly supervised within the pool enclosure. Clearly, supervision is the best form of defence. Secondly, it is entirely appropriate that we focus on ensuring pool enclosures are up to the appropriate standard. But if we come back to the issue of supervision, that then requires us to ensure that the community is aware. I would call on the minister and this state government to undertake a major education and awareness program--and to properly fund it--within the community to educate all about the dangers of our swimming pools and how they can safely enjoy them within their own backyard. It is the small things that we do that will ensure our children are able to appreciate the great lifestyle that we have in Queensland without being placed at risk. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105618"></A>
We have seen many wonderful community initiatives over the years that have worked fantastically at raising awareness. Laurie Lawrence’s Kids Alive--Do the Five is one that comes to mind and was well supported by the Howard federal government in ensuring that it was funded appropriately. As I mentioned earlier, the Plint family’s Hannah’s Foundation is one that works tirelessly to ensure that not only legislation but also education is appropriate. We need to ensure that our state government also undertakes its responsibility, takes its fair share and does its part of the heavy lifting when it comes to protecting our children by funding major education and awareness programs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105623"></A>
I would now like to touch on the issue of enforcement by councils. Our local councils will, in many cases, remain the default inspectors of our swimming pools. There is a responsibility for them to keep up to date the swimming pool register that was debated in the earlier Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. Whilst local governments have indicated to me that the government has promised they will not be left with the enforcement of this regime and the enforcement costs, I must admit I am hesitant to agree with this assessment. The question has to be asked: who else will take on the responsibility? Clearly, the state government does not have a structure to be able to act as a fallback for pool inspections. Do we expect that to fall upon real estate agents? It is hardly within the job description of the average suburban realtor. We need to ensure that if we expect our local governments to do this work we also provide them with the additional resourcing, otherwise we will find ourselves in the situation in which we found ourselves in 1991. When the new pool laws were brought in at that time--incredibly radical--there was a heightened awareness and the public expected and, indeed, acted to make sure that their pools were compliant to the standard of the day because they expected that they would be inspected. This did not occur to the level that they anticipated and over the years we found the community becoming more and more complacent when it came to pool safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105626"></A>
With regard to local government within our state, we also have to be cognisant of the fact that we have many remote area councils. Enforcement is particularly an issue for our remote and regional councils within Queensland. There is a concern that this legislation has been largely written with the larger coastal councils in mind, many of which have established pool safety regimes. Clearly, this is not the case for all councils, particularly in our regional areas. These councils have small workforces which face many challenges, not the least of which is distance. Whilst I recognise there is a provision in this bill for remote inspections to be done by a form of correspondence, there are dangers with this, forcing inspectors to be reliant upon information that is provided externally. I am sure we have all had the experience of looking for a property and seeing a photograph of that property in a magazine. Invariably, for many of us, when we actually turned up to the street address the house that was in front of us did not always look like what was in the glossy brochure. It is of concern that the information can be presented in such a way that may hide serious flaws within the pool fencing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105663"></A>
We need to look at how we can empower and resource remote and regional councils so that they too can step up to the challenge. In remote and regional areas the training of appropriate inspectors, both on council staff and in the private sector, can be an added burden. Clearly there is not the concentration of population in remote areas, making the economy of scale more difficult. This is likely to increase the costs of compliance within regional Queensland. Again, we need to look at ensuring that our cousins in regional and remote areas are not left carrying a burden greater than that faced within the south-east corner. </Hansard-Body>

I note the change in the maximum depth of wading pools from 450 millimetres to 300 millimetres, which brings Queensland in line with broader national guidelines for wading pools and temporary inflatable pools. Over many summers when my kids were young they certainly enjoyed slashing around in such pools. I am concerned about the enforcement requirements surrounding such pools. It is fairly likely that the majority of Queenslanders have one of those pools, perhaps tucked away under the house or up in the roof, that probably has a depth greater than 300 millimetres. This comes back to the issue of education. We can be fairly confident that when the temperature rises on a summer weekend and kids ask their parents for an opportunity to cool down, those pools will be taken out, inflated and used in the back yard. However, that is the time that council inspectors are least likely to be patrolling, acting on complaints or enforcing pool regulations. This will be a very difficult requirement to enforce. One Saturday morning a family decides to inflate the wading pool and the kids play in it. On the Sunday afternoon, the pool is drained and deflated. The council has no evidence of the risk that those children were exposed to. I ask the minister in his response to address how he feels this difficult area of the legislation will be managed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105667"></A>
The issue of rental properties is a particularly difficult area. From reading the bill it appears that the owners of rental properties will be responsible for the fencing of pools. There are obvious difficulties in relation to liability if a renter chooses to use a removable pool. In that case, who is responsible for the fencing? Will it rest with the lessor or should that responsibility be moved to the lessee? By their nature such pools are not fixtures, but fences generally are. That issue needs to be addressed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105668"></A>
I am concerned about the impact of the announced 1 December commencement date on rentals. This comes back to the issue of the time line. We are looking at a very condensed couple of months in which to get this scheme up and running. Any leases for houses with pools will need to comply with this legislation from the commencement date. This will impact on leases that are a renewal of previous agreements. From our reading of the bill, there is no leeway for the owner or the renter in terms of the commencement date. Many owners are likely to be unaware of this requirement until they try to renew the lease and then they may find that they are faced with a substantial cost to upgrade pool fencing. That is not to say that they should not upgrade the pool fences, but we need to ensure that the fences are upgraded. We do not want a situation where the landlord chooses, because of cost, to simply place a padlock on the gate of a pool fence that is not compliant and assume that he or she can get away with that. We need to ensure that there is appropriate time to bring those pool fences up to the required standard. In addition, we do not want landlords to terminate leases because they cannot afford to fix a fence, resulting in an increase in the number of people looking for rental accommodation within Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105669"></A>
The bill contains a component that relates to repairs by inspectors. Three areas are of concern. The first is the potential for a conflict of interest. It is acknowledged that options exist for small repairs. For example, an inspector may identify that the only problem with the pool fence is a $50 latch that could be replaced very easily. There would be no great conflict of interest in the inspector, at that point, offering to replace the latch immediately. However, because of the BSA’s requirement that work valued at less than $3,300 can be undertaken by an unlicensed person, there is a concern if the work becomes more involved. In the example I have given where the inspector replaces the latch, he may then discover that the footings of the fence have eroded or that the panels need to be replaced. We could have a situation where inspectors conduct work and then have to inspect their own work. Clearly, that would not be a desirable outcome. We seek the minister’s advice as to how the practicalities of this bill will prevent those conflicts from occurring. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105670"></A>
I note that in much of the material that has gone forward the government indicates that the cost of an inspection would be in the vicinity of $90. I am sceptical that we would see the cost remain at that level. The very nature of the training required and the equipment necessary to ensure that an inspection is done to a proper standard--for example, pressure testing of the actual pool fencing or the equipment necessary to test whether electrical equipment located within three metres of a pool fence is appropriately earthed--may force that price to climb. Already families are facing incredible pressures because of the failed policies of this government when it comes to issues like water, registration and electricity costs. The last thing that we need to do is increase the burden on the Queensland family household budget. </Hansard-Body>

It is said that when a parent dies you lose your past, but when a child dies you lose your future. I am sure that it is the genuine hope of all those within the House that this bill goes a long way to preserving the future of Queensland by improving pool safety. </Hansard-Body>

I now turn to the other components of the bill. The bill recognises the American Staffordshire Terrier as an independent breed. We have no concerns with that part of the bill.

The bill refers to the redevelopment by the Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association, the RNA, of the Ekka site. I cannot help but reflect that with the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1), other members and myself raised concerns during the briefing that occurred before the debate, during the second reading debate and briefly during the consideration of the clauses before the guillotine was applied to the debate. The component of the bill relating to the RNA goes to the essence of the failings of this long-term Labor government. The parliament is here to debate and to improve upon legislation. If in May of this year the government had listened to the concerns that were raised in the briefings and in the parliament by other LNP members and myself, we could have agreed to an amendment to ensure the RNA’s interests and the interests of the people of Queensland were protected. Clearly that was not the case. As a result of the arrogance of this long-term Labor government and the blindness of this minister in refusing to listen, four months have been unnecessarily wasted. Of course, the LNP supports these amendments because we raised the concerns in the first place. </Hansard-Body>

The Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is part of the plan that is supported by the LNP. We commend all those who have worked on the drafting of this legislation to ensure that we can put forward a pool safety regime for Queenslanders that is safe and that ensures when our children are at their most vulnerable they are protected. I put it to the minister that the amendments that will be circulated are designed to make good legislation better. They are designed to ensure that at the most critical time when families are in the unfamiliar environment of a new home they are indeed protected by ensuring that the onus rests upon the seller. This is not a new concept. It is one that we have seen with earthed safety switches and with regard to smoke alarms and it is one that the minister himself proposed in his second reading speech for the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1). We supported the minister then, we support his original position now, and we call upon him to support this amendment so that we can make our pools safe for families from the moment they move in. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs STUCKEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Currumbin--LNP) (8.01 pm): I rise to join the debate on the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010, which was introduced into the House on 18 August by the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning. In doing so, I echo the sentiments of the shadow minister, the honourable member for Gympie. As members have heard, the LNP are offering bipartisan support for this legislation and will be moving some amendments that will offer further improvement to this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109899"></A>
This bill will implement the second stage of the government’s swimming pool safety improvement strategy following the completion of a comprehensive review of Queensland swimming pool safety laws in September 2009. A committee was established on 14 December 2008 to provide a report to government recommending improvements to pool safety laws. Membership of this committee included representatives from the Department of Infrastructure and Planning, the Local Government Association of Queensland, Kidsafe Australia, Queensland Master Builders and the Swimming Pool and Spa Association of Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109904"></A>
After the review report, which contained 22 recommendations, was released in April 2009, the government sought public comments and held a series of forums across the state. The first stage of the swimming pool safety improvement strategy, which began on 1 December 2009, introduced a new safety standard for all new residential pools. All swimming pools built on or after that date must now undergo mandatory final inspections and display CPR signage. Stage 2 proposes to extend uniform safety standards to all existing pools across the state originally intended to be in place by the end of 2010. The first phase of stage 2 was enacted in May with the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2010. This act established the legislative framework to support a new class of licensed pool safety inspectors, created the independent body the Pool Safety Council and established a state based swimming pool register. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109909"></A>
The bill before the House today is the second phase of stage 2 and proposes amendments to the Building Act 1975 to extend pool safety laws to include pools at hotels, motels, other residential buildings, caretaker residences, caravan parks and indoor pools; to introduce a system for mandatory pool safety inspections at the point of sale and lease of properties with pools; to reduce the maximum depth of portable pools not requiring fencing from 450 millimetres to 300 millimetres--I might add here that children can still perish in one foot of water; to remove existing local government exemptions other than for those with a disability; to introduce a physical impracticality exemption to be administered by the chief executive; to require mandatory reporting to Queensland Health by public and private hospitals and the Queensland Ambulance Service of immersion incidents involving children; and to provide health professionals with the opportunity to voluntarily report pool immersion incidents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109911"></A>
The bill also amends the Animal Management (Cats and Dogs) Act 2008 to provide legislative clarity that Amstaffs and American pit bull terriers are not the same breed of dog following a recent court decision involving a Gold Coast case. Amendments are also proposed to the Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland Act 1971 and the Sustainable Planning Act 2009. The focus of my contribution this evening will be on the aspects of the bill relating to swimming pool safety. </Hansard-Body>

My colleagues and I fear that we will be back here within a year debating another change to this legislation to rectify the mistakes made by this incompetent Labor government. Again, it would seem that the drafting of critically important legislation has been rushed through without taking on board the wisdom of key industry stakeholders even though there was ample opportunity. Are we headed for a repeat of the pink batts, green loans or sustainability declaration form debacles? All three initiatives were poorly thought through, shabbily planned and appallingly implemented--all three abject Labor government failures, trumpeted as groundbreaking schemes yet failing disastrously due to sloppy planning, inept governance and true-to-form Labor government incompetence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109917"></A>
According to the explanatory notes, the objective of the government’s pool safety reform is ‘to help reduce the incidence of pool related immersion injuries and death’ particularly for children under five. Unreservedly, the LNP supports stronger measures for pool-fencing laws, provided that they are fair and workable and that they afford the protection for which they are designed. As I have stated when addressing previous legislation on this subject, I have witnessed the tragic after-effects in my role as a paediatric nurse, and therefore it is my strongest belief that there can be no legislation or regulation implemented by government that dilutes the responsibility of parents and guardians to supervise their children in and around the pool or, for that matter, any body of water. Sadly, the majority of cases of immersions and drownings under five are preventable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109918"></A>
It is critically important that the message of swim safety advocate and Currumbin local Laurie Lawrence continues to hold precedence in early childhood--fence the pool, shut the gate, teach your kids to swim, supervise and learn to resuscitate. These five simple principles have, without doubt, saved countless lives over the 22 years that Laurie has been promoting the swim safety message to all Australians. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109920"></A>
The swimming pool safety improvement strategy will replace 12 existing pool barrier standards with a single standard that applies to all regulated pools. This was a key recommendation of the review report presented to the government as a result of confusion from differing standards for pools built at different times. Compliance will be required at the point of sale or lease or within five years, whichever occurs first, for properties with non-shared pools. However, specific provisions have been provided for shared pools. Shared pools associated with short-term accommodation will be given a six-month phase-in period, while all other shared pools will be given two years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109921"></A>
I would question the government’s motives of paramount child safety in light of the number of concessions that have been included in this legislation that favour the tourism industry. The explanatory notes state that this provision is a concession to this important industry, which may face difficulties reaching compliance at the start of the busy summer period--another example of poor planning and coordination by the Bligh government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109922"></A>
Incentive schemes have also been offered in this legislation, encouraging operators to ‘get in early’ in exchange for a two-year certificate instead of one year. Other shared pool owners will be given a two-year phase-in period, placing questions over why the safety of some shared pools is less urgent than others, and less urgent again for non-shared pools. Where is the uniformity in that? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109923"></A>
Members of key industry bodies are discouraged by the government’s last-minute decision to include a 90-day allowance with the point of sale and lease provisions within this bill. Where a seller has not secured a pool safety certificate prior to settlement, the onus is then placed on the purchaser to comply within 90 days. This is contrary to other mandatory point-of-sale obligations that must be borne by the seller, such as the installation of smoke alarms. This was pointed out by the honourable member for Gympie. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109925"></A>
When considering child safety as the paramount objective of these changes, the consequences of legislating for a potentially dangerous situation to remain for as long as three months must be addressed. Research indicates ‘the risk of drowning is highest during the first six months’ in a new property--a direct quote from the minister’s second reading speech. What the minister failed to mention, however, was that his government’s policy will leave this hazard wide open. Who will take responsibility for a child who drowns in that 90-day period because of inadequate pool fencing? This is why the LNP will be putting forward an amendment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1114390"></A>
I turn now to the provisions in the bill regarding exemptions. A stated aim of this legislation is to remove existing local government exemptions other than exemptions for persons with a disability. Whilst I understand the complexities encountered by many people with disabilities, having a disability does not preclude a person from having children in the home. Surely children of disabled persons should have adequate safety precautions in place as those with able parents and carers. Disability exemptions will continue to be decided by local councils. I note that the exemption is to remain with the person and not the property which offers reassurance to the individual concerned should they move to another residence. New occupiers will need to adjust the property to meet full safety requirements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1114391"></A>
I also want to note the inclusion of impractical and somewhat contradictory compliance exemptions that will allow for a pool owner to apply to the chief executive for an exemption in the case of physical movement of a building or wall being required for the construction of a fence or the removal of any protected vegetation under an act or local law. I do not doubt the impossibility of certain circumstances to erect a pool fence or similar safety device, but if the safety of children is the overriding principle why is the government prepared to relax laws for a protected species of plant? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1114392"></A>
Having the distressing experience of nursing paediatric immersion patients I welcome the provisions in this bill enforcing mandatory reporting by hospitals of pool immersion incidents involving children. Reported data will undoubtedly enable a greater factual base to direct future policy for improving safety standards and procedures. Bath immersions, as a result of children being left unattended, should also be reported. Voluntary reporting by health professionals is also encouraged by protection from disciplinary action under this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1114393"></A>
Of particular concern when considering the scope of this legislation is the considerable uncertainty as to the number of swimming pools in Queensland. In his second reading speech the minister alludes to some 325,000 pools existing in Queensland. However, SPASA, the peak industry body, suggests the figure is closer to 900,000 swimming pools across Queensland. If the minister has worked out his time lines on the figures he quotes then he has miscalculated greatly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1114395"></A>
This gross inaccuracy could present some issues with the implementation and operation of the state based swimming pool register which was established in the previous legislation passed in May. To date, the minister still has not been forthcoming as to exactly how this will work. Perhaps he will enlighten us in his reply.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1114396"></A>
The following concerns were raised in a recent meeting with industry stakeholders on this legislation. Training and qualification requirements have still not been revealed even though the legislation is upon us. There is no requirement for prerequisite building or similar experience to become a licensed pool fence inspector. The costs of the training course and inspections look likely to be greater than the government’s modest estimates which will undoubtedly be passed on to the consumer. The special provision that on-site inspections are not required for pools in remote areas of the state is of concern. Also there were concerns that the department will approve course providers other than registered training organisations, as we saw with the ill-fated pink batts and green loan schemes. The 90-day period for compliance at the point of sale or lease defies the major purpose of the legislation which is to position child safety as the paramount objective as child drownings are more likely to occur in a new and unfamiliar dwelling. The requirements for fencing portable pools filled above the new 300 millimetre maximum depth cannot be adequately enforced. As I said, these were issues raised by industry experts, not by me. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1114397"></A>
It would seem from this extensive list of issues that Labor has not thought through this properly and obviously has not taken on board validated information from respected industry stakeholders. Of most concern is that there are no clear definite guidelines. This legislation reads, as is so often the case from the Bligh government, as a rudimentary draft, a naive work in progress, despite Bligh announcing new laws were on the way back in December 2008. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1114398"></A>
Such elementary planning is unacceptable for such far-reaching legislation that will affect so many people, particularly on the Gold Coast where my electorate is based. It is also imperative that legislation of this nature, with its mandatory requirements that have hefty financial consequences, be economical. Prohibitive costs to homeowners and the bodies corporate are an inevitable outcome of these stringent proposed safety measures, especially at a time when people on the Gold Coast and in my Currumbin electorate are really hurting from the spiralling costs of living under this Labor government. Fuel prices, electricity prices, water prices are all on a staggering unstoppable ascent with no reprieve in sight. Without question, the hip pockets of swimming pool owners are going to hit hard by the provisions of this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1114399"></A>
According to the explanatory notes, pool upgrades are expected to cost $95 million and pool safety inspections $80 million over the first 10 years. It can only be assumed that these are completely unfounded estimates given there is no certainty as to how many pools exist in Queensland and the extent to which some homeowners will need to go to comply with these new standards. </Hansard-Body>

As many pools on the Gold Coast have been designed with lake, canal or beach views in mind--and perhaps hinterland views, as is my case--it is understandable that some pool owners would be seeking a transparent glass or perspex fence that would not obstruct their views rather than the cheaper aluminium alternative. Costs could be in the vicinity of $20,000 which is a hefty impost, particularly for homeowners whose exemptions will be removed abruptly by this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1114401"></A>
Due regard must be given to the effect these unprecedented compliance costs will have on the average household. In addition, checks need to be in place to ensure that prices do not suddenly go through the roof and cause a plethora of rogue operators to appear. According to the explanatory notes, the administration costs of the established Pool Safety Council are expected to reach $19.7 million over 10 years to administer the pool safety inspection and licensing system. Once again, if this figure has been calculated on the minister’s estimates then it is way off the mark and would be almost triple this amount. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1114403"></A>
Alarmingly these costs are to be recovered in part by fees and charges levied on pool owners. I hope there will not be additional charges above and beyond the already imposing costs to meet compliance that pool owners will be forced to fork out for the administration of this government implemented independent council. I would ask if the minister would clarify which costs are being referred to here. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1114404"></A>
Of critical importance to the success of this safety reform is education--a sentiment that was shared by the review committee. Widespread awareness of the changes must be made a funding priority by the department and this government. In his second reading speech the minister referred to ‘developing a targeted education and awareness campaign’. I would ask the minister if he is able to inform the House of the progress of this campaign and the costs associated with it. </Hansard-Body>

I again raise concerns from the debate of the previous legislation back in May that were brought to my attention by a private certifier. This experienced individual held reservations that the number of qualified inspectors will be far short of that needed to adequately and thoroughly inspect the existing number and future growth of pools in Queensland that this legislation will affect. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1114406"></A>
Given the number of pools across the state and the gross miscalculation being used by the minister, there are concerns about the volume of work that will be initiated by the mandatory point of sale and lease provisions proposed in the bill and having an adequate number of trained, qualified and licensed inspectors in time for the commencement of these provisions. These concerns have been compounded by our meeting with industry stakeholders who shared these exact reservations. It is now believed that the government’s own deadline of 1 December this year may not be met because, put simply, it is just not ready. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1114407"></A>
Tasked with approving training qualifications and eligible course providers, it is deeply concerning to learn that the Pool Safety Council established by the act in May only met for the first time a couple of weeks ago, which is completely unsatisfactory considering the closeness to the proposed commencement date. At this late stage the minister has not revealed what training modules will be required for licensing pool safety inspectors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1114409"></A>
There are fears--and I mean genuine fears--that the implementation of nationally recognised training modules will be bypassed in the name of political expediency as the minister rushes to meet his self-imposed December deadline. In his rush to play catch-up the minister must be very careful that he does not compromise the efficacy of this legislation by approving short cuts to training that would permit substandard qualifications for people to become inspectors as this would present an unacceptable risk to the safety of children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118736"></A>
I ask whether the minister is prepared to take responsibility for a child who drowns as a result of a poorly trained inspector, one allowed to operate due to inferior standards set by his department. Already residents in my electorate have raised their concerns about a sudden proliferation of swimming pool inspectors converging on the suburbs, knocking on doors and ringing telephones signing people up for contracts and doing deals. Add to that inflated prices by pool fencing companies that will pop up overnight like mushrooms and a recipe for disaster looms for consumers. In summary, the LNP is supportive of legislation for tougher pool safety laws to protect the safety of young children as the primary aim. However, as I have made unequivocally clear, we are not supportive of this Labor government’s haste in introducing poorly drafted critically important swimming pool reform legislation. We are also not supportive of the fact that so much has been left unresolved, not allowing for a true indication of how these measures will be implemented. Unfortunately, this wait-and-see attitude simply does not cut it when the safety of Queensland’s children is at stake. I really hope that the minister is able to allay these fears in his reply. </Hansard-Body>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (8.20 pm): The Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is a unique bill that has application to pool owners for mandatory pool safety inspections, dog owners who do not want to have their dogs classified as pit bull terriers and a safety net for the RNA in Brisbane. There are problems with regard to two areas of the bill. It goes without saying that the RNA changes seem appropriate for an institution that has lasted 140 years. The statistics on both immersion injuries and drownings of children in swimming pools are well known. Tragically, whilst not all of the 50-plus immersion injuries annually in Queensland lead to death, the consequences for the family, the child and the community are horrendous. It all happens so quickly, so silently and so close to care. Pools continue to be built at a massive frequency. It is currently estimated that one in three new dwellings in South-East Queensland has a pool installed, yet we swim less, have smaller families and both parents are often working full time. With an average cost of between $12,000 and $20,000, homeowners are building pools at the same rate as their massive media rooms. Fortunately, pool fencing legislation is mandatory but is constantly challenged. I make my own comments with regard to media rooms. I do not think they are necessary.</Hansard-Body>

Dr DOUGLAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As the minister pointed out in his second reading speech, these new laws applying to new pools commenced in December 2009 after extensive consultation. In single families I think a media room is probably appropriate, member for Brisbane Central, but in larger families I wonder if TVs are used as child-care methods.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118753"></A>
Stage 2 affects existing pools and the intention is to ensure both compliance with fencing laws and mandatory inspections at point of sale or lease. As has been noted, the Building Act 1975 facilitates a new pool safety inspector licensing system and Pool Safety Council to assume control of the licensing system. There is a legitimate concern that the laws are being implemented without enough training of inspectors, and the fact that there may not be enough of the inspectors on the ground could be an issue. For property owners who are selling this is an extra compliance cost and for those leasing with either a renewal or a new lease it is another cost. The challenge for local councils is to get it done and get paid for doing so. An owner may want a reasonable cost and some certainty both in terms of timeliness and certification of the issue of their certificates and many fear the transfer of liability, especially from public risk back to the owners.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118756"></A>
I believe in pool fencing regulation and the need to make it mandatory. My real concerns stem from a number of legal cases, particularly on the Gold Coast, where the Supreme Court has upheld that owners who have taken all and many steps to make their pools safe or similar were still found to be liable in complex, truncated, technical cases over everything from inadequate signage to inadequate adult supervision and, in one awful case, blame a very doubtful technical failure of fencing close to a canal as the reason for a disaster that occurred. There are a few recent well-publicised cases, but there will be more with the advent of more homes having tanks installed where we are likely to see problems similar to pools given that most of these tanks have no security fencing and have mains power points attached to pumps located close to the tanks and open tops that will allow children entry. The minister has detailed closely how the system will work and how councils will manage the pool safety inspectors and issues of complaints. It is disconcerting that there has been no regulation requiring notification to owners regarding entry to properties. The issue of appointments and permission to be on private property will have to be clarified. I believe this has been raised by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. It is worth noting that these inspectors will be able to carry out minor repairs which seems to add a layer of common sense to these regulations, and the minister is to be congratulated on taking those steps.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118759"></A>
There will be a state based pool register created and maintained. All pool owners will be compelled to register, with a new offence provision for those who do not do so. I am a pool owner and, like many other pool owners, have great interest in how this proceeds. Like most, safety remains a burning concern for us all--everything from the quality of water, efficient filtration, adequate total perimeter child-proof fencing with reliable child-safe locking gate systems and high pool visibility from the most utilised aspect of the house. We must leave no stone unturned in the pursuit of what constitutes the ideal pool design, pool fencing and certification with known proven safe methods. What remains at issue is how to cater for both the rogue and those who become neglectful. A pool does require some skill to maintain beyond being built and delivered. For many, maintenance is done by external qualified pool maintenance staff and pool franchisees. But for many that is not so. Most owners learn from the school of hard knocks. Pool water testing is random, infrequent and in Queensland heat usually leads to an unsatisfactory result. Fully automatic does not necessarily mean that the owners or lessees of those properties do not need to check a pool constantly, and pool water is potentially harmful, especially after summer rain. The Gold Coast of course gets seasonal rain as well, particularly at the end of September as summer comes. It also gets seasonal rain in late January. These are times of the year when holidays are occurring and children are around.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118761"></A>
Pool fences, panels, locks, magnets, key locks and missing rivets all need to be checked on a routine basis. The majority of pools are salt water and there is a significant corrosion factor that needs to be considered as a safety issue, and it needs to be raised as a particular issue because it is an increasing problem in South-East Queensland that saltwater pools are not being maintained as regularly as they should. All pool parts--fences, gates and external furnishings--have a high-wear factor. They can become dangerous. For those reasons, licensing is necessary and needs to be repeated. Most homeowners stay an average of seven years in their own home and lessees five years. Therefore, this regulation will probably give rise to a check time frame that should address most of those issues.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118765"></A>
I remain concerned about the issue of children drowning or suffering immersion injuries in friends’ or neighbourhood pools, especially when those neighbours or friends may not be home. For those reasons, in the absence of mandatory front and rear fencing, I believe that all pool fencing should be a total perimeter 1.2-metre minimum with a 100 maximum bottom-to-ground space and a similar bar-to-bar width. No glass or fencing should be permitted to be frosted facing the dwelling because the pool should be totally visible at all times. All edges should be blunted and rolled to eliminate cuts to children. All gates under current rules should have an adequate safety lock. This is essential. There does appear to be an area of general concern--that is, those homes that are reliant on self-closing locks or glass doors where the pool immediately adjoins the home. This is not raised in the bill but is a particular problem throughout the state. I would have to say that this is an older home problem, but it does occur in newer homes as well because people want their pools to abut the rear decks of their homes. It is timely that this anomaly is discussed in terms of dwellings having a safety door. Currently, premises are allowed to have a self-closing sliding door. That needs to be excluded. Additionally, all dwellings where pools have adjoining common areas or waterways must be completely fenced on all four sides.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123394"></A>
I accept that there are valid reasons for every situation, just as long as there are gates that can be closed with child safety locks where this cannot be achieved. All power should have safety cut-out switches to the main power board. Pool lighting and pool spas should require further review, because I think these issues have not been adequately discussed. As I said, wear and tear remains a considerable issue and I think that currently it is an issue that is not adequately addressed in any bill that is facing us. With the numbers of pools that have high utilisation because they are shared, particularly where there are numbers of units, and also the increasing use of saltwater pools, I think wear and tear is an issue. The evidence supporting pool safety fencing is now irrefutable. When combined with teaching all children to swim at an early age, CPR training and a healthy respect for water, collectively we will reduce child immersion fatalities and injuries. I believe that we will also reduce the death rate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123395"></A>
I like the new rules regarding wading pools, particularly the maximum depth being reduced to 300 millimetres from 450 millimetres. The likelihood of drowning is said to be reduced by a very high margin--I believe it is three times per 150 millimetres. I am not sure whether going below a depth of 300 millimetres reduces the likelihood further. Fish ponds, both internal and external, and external and internal water features are increasingly common in homes that are being built in South-East Queensland. I believe that they should be rated as wading pools and that they should have the same rules apply to them. Currently, fish ponds and water features are largely uncovered. I believe that there should be discussion about covering them with mesh or glass. It would seem erroneous not to draw fish ponds and water features into this current rule. It is a worrying trend, particular on the Gold Coast, that homes with fish ponds and water features are being built for sale. I remain of the opinion that all public areas that retain water, particularly those that have depths of greater than 200 millimetres, require perimeter shielding, particularly if the entry point is reasonably accessible by any human being, particularly a child. </Hansard-Body>

The dog issue remains in part an issue of debate, DNA, desire and ‘damned if you do and damned if you don’t’. There appears to be a near universal view that an American pit bull terrier is a dangerous breed of dog. It is an unpredictable dog. It is bred as a fighting dog. It is unlawful to have the breed here and, as such, the breed is unsuitable for domestic, urban, semiurban and particularly rural environments. We have enough problems with wild dogs as their effect on our agricultural industry is significant. If there is a mechanism that clarifies the Staffordshire breed as a safe dog then so be it. Any breed causing any problem requires further review. Certainly in my electorate there have been significant problems with dogs attacking people. To tell you the truth, I think that any dog that deems itself a problem we would be better off without. </Hansard-Body>

I move on to the issue of the RNA, which is a much loved institution in Queensland that occupies a special place in the state’s history. As many people know, the RNA has extensive freehold and leasehold land at the base of Spring Hill and adjoining the Valley. The site contains a number of historical buildings, including the John McDonald Stand and a number of facades, including the sample bag pavilion. The RNA is expertly run by John Tunny and the chair, Vivian Edwards, who is a neurologist practising in Ipswich and also in Brisbane. The RNA stages many events annually, but the Ekka is the key event that has universal acceptance throughout Brisbane and the state. In fact, many people seem to remember going to the Ekka for their whole lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123405"></A>
 The development of theme parks, particularly Movie World and Dreamworld, and the corporatisation of agriculture seems to have affected the RNA significantly. The difficulty that the RNA experiences is the one-off cost of holding such events. Maybe the reality is that the Ekka could change and the land may have to be sold. This is disappointing but, like everything, it remains a possibility. The government is attempting to set conditions upon which that might occur. I find that rather worrying on a number of levels. Like everybody, I certainly do not want to see things that have remained such an institution for a long time change, but I think we have to have faith in the management, and the board has to manage the RNA as it sees fit. Of course, the RNA sits on largely private property and the management of the RNA is trying to manage it the best way it can. I think realistically the bill is attempting to do many things and maybe to hamstring them is not the right way to do it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123406"></A>
There are many ways of looking at the RNA, and probably this is so because the Royal National Association reflects many different things to many different people. As I have said, for country people the RNA delivers a method of displaying their stock and produce. For some, the RNA presents a chance to compete and be rewarded in the market for doing so. It gives these people a social outlet, both the show itself and the many events during show week. For city people, the RNA provides them with the chance to see aspects of country life, especially small animals for children and a vast array of all sorts of things that reflect life itself and, certainly, a lot of our history. The fireworks in the night-time almost mark the end of winter. The RNA employs many people and it provides a big cash impetus for our community. Every province, state or nation has some form of vehicle by which they can display themselves to others and their own public. The Ekka is Queensland’s and, probably moreover, it is South-East Queensland’s. Therefore, the RNA is rightfully not anyone’s property but everyone’s property. The future of any of the RNA--either bits of it or as a whole--should be widely discussed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123408"></A>
The government correctly put the Inner City Bypass in a tunnel under sideshow alley years ago and it remains reluctant to be prescriptive with what the board of the RNA plans for its own future. The Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, being so close, benefits by virtue of the public space provided by the RNA and so does an increasingly dense inner-city urban population. I think we need to leave the RNA site as it is. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123409"></A>
As has been stated, the LNP is putting forward amendments to this bill. Rather than government members saying that there should be no amendment, I put it to members that there are many solutions to serious problems and that they should remember that every life saved is a child’s and a family’s life that is changed for the better forever. No-one should ever think they have all the answers. Governments are often the last to find enlightenment. </Hansard-Body>

In my own electorate over past years there have been terrible tragedies arising out of pool drownings. These are not statistics to champion. I really want something better for all. If a drowning is preventable--as most are--then the efforts must be targeted at achieving a zero result. It is true that 40 per cent of the state’s 300,000 pools are indeed unsafe and that they would fail a routine safety check. This bill offers every child and their family a positive step in safety and an opportunity to alter that awful grief of families who may well have a child suffer from such a terrible tragedy. This statistic of 23 children drowning in three years is one that we should say is in the past. If compliant pool fencing is the answer, so be it. </Hansard-Body>

Ms van LITSENBURG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Redcliffe--ALP) (8.38 pm): I rise to contribute to the debate on the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010. This is a positive bill with good outcomes for the community and it will be good to see it passed before the swimming season starts. This bill focuses on reducing the number of immersion accidents and deaths of young children aged under five years. In a community that has become busier, it is vital that each home has the protection that is needed to ensure that young children are safe in those few minutes where a vigilant parent is distracted. This legislation relates to stage 2 of the swimming pools strategy and it is important in my electorate of Redcliffe because there is an increasing number of pools but also many canal homes built in the 1980s under earlier pool legislation. This part of the legislation harmonises all regulations into one set of standards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127870"></A>
I am going to focus on the role of local government and inspectors in ensuring a timely and effective implementation program. I am aware that much emphasis has been placed on ensuring that services will be readily available when required to meet pool owner demand. This is particularly important as the primary method of determining a pool’s compliance with the new standard is through pool safety inspectors. As demand is expected to increase following the commencement of this legislation, in order to provide a necessary fail-safe this bill provides that local governments are required to offer a pool safety inspection service on request. In this way, regardless of where a pool is located in Queensland, the pool owner will have adequate access to pool safety inspection services. This will be of particular benefit to pool owners in rural and regional areas where it may be more difficult to obtain private pool safety inspection services. Because of this fail-safe function, local governments are integral to the pool inspection process and I would like to acknowledge this fact today. However, the government is also conscious of the fact that pool safety systems should not simply place a large burden on local governments. As such, we have taken concrete and positive steps towards streamlining the responsibilities of local government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127871"></A>
The role of identifying noncompliant pools will shift to the chief executive as the keeper of the state-wide pool register. Local governments will benefit from improved data collection and reporting practices. Armed with this information they will be empowered to focus their resources, allowing them to conduct their traditional pool safety responsibilities with greater effectiveness. It will also allow local governments to undertake their enforcement responsibilities with greater efficiency in relation to high-risk pools, particularly those in which an immersion incident has occurred. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127872"></A>
The bill recognises the particular challenges involved in providing services to remote areas. To meet these challenges the bill provides that certain inspections may be conducted remotely. If a pool is located in a remote area as declared by a resolution from the local government, an inspector may then inspect the pool using any documents or technology they deem fit. If using these methods they can satisfy themselves that the pool complies, then they may issue a pool safety certificate. This provision empowers both private and local government inspectors and is an innovative solution designed to ensure that pool inspection businesses can provide appropriate service levels to remote areas. The bill will ensure that the innocent pool owners are not taken advantage of by inappropriate practices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127873"></A>
The passage of this bill will allow sufficient time for the government to deliver a comprehensive marketing and communications campaign that will inform pool owners of their obligations. The campaign will make it clear that pool owners must only employ licensed pool inspectors. I would like to take this opportunity to assure all members that pool safety inspectors must be licensed. To obtain this licence pool safety inspectors must undergo a training course that has been approved by the Pool Safety Council. It is through these licences that owners will be able to access the services of legitimate pool safety inspectors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127874"></A>
I am aware that the department has made significant progress in terms of pool safety inspector training, with work having already begun on pool safety inspector training courses. It is also encouraging to note that a number of expressions of interest and requests for information from people interested in training to become legitimate pool safety inspectors have been received. With all of its members appointed, the Pool Safety Council will convene its first meeting later this month. One of the most important items on the council’s agenda will be to discuss the progression of the training course and possibly, if circumstances permit, a review of the course materials. These training courses are part of a comprehensive strategy designed to ensure that at the commencement of this bill there are enough pool inspectors to meet consumer demand. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127875"></A>
Modelling shows that as the new pool safety system is expected to encourage a $45 million investment in the pool safety industry, the equivalent of 100 to 200 full-time pool safety inspector jobs will be created. However, given that many building professionals will be encouraged to add pool inspections to their existing repertoire, Treasury anticipates that there will also be between 600 and 1,000 part-time inspectors. This will provide jobs for up to 200 people as we come out of the global financial crisis. This legislation is in line with the Bligh government’s Toward Q2 plan to build a strong economy and a strong community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127876"></A>
Given that a spike in demand is expected shortly after the commencement of this legislation, a conscious effort has been made to ensure that consumer demand may be successfully met. Building certifiers have been empowered for one year from the commencement of this bill to grant pool safety certificates. After this year they will be required to have a pool safety inspector licence if they wish to continue inspecting pools. In this way they will be subject to the same legislative requirements as other pool safety inspectors and subject to the same code of conduct. It is also important to know that when a building certifier signs off on a newly developed property as compliant with building standards this will be considered adequate confirmation of the pool’s compliance and a pool safety certificate can be deemed to be in effect for its usual duration--that is, one year for shared pools and two years for non-shared pools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127877"></A>
In addition to the pioneering reforms that promote the safety of Queensland children, this bill also amends the Animal Management (Cats and Dogs) Act 2008 to provide clarity and certainty to nearly 4,000 American Staffordshire terrier--or Amstaff--owners in Queensland. I know that Minister Boyle took a personal interest in this matter and I am pleased that this bill will categorically distinguish Amstaffs from American pit bull terriers which are considered restricted dogs. This will clarify a recent Supreme Court decision which ruled that the two breeds were the same. Without amendments amstaffs might be subject to the same stringent keeping requirements associated with other restricted dogs at an estimated cost to owners of $5,000. The amendments clarify this government’s unbroken intention that as a rule American Staffordshire terriers do not trigger the same requirements. Of course judgements about the danger posed by a dog must be made on a case-by-case basis. Should a dog show menacing or aggressive behaviour, local governments are still empowered to declare the dog as menacing and enforce appropriate safety precautions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127878"></A>
Finally, the government recognises that the identification of dog breeds can be quite difficult so we have implemented a number of certification tools for breed identification to assist dog owners and local governments. The bill expands the role of a veterinary surgeon to enable vets to certify breeds of dog. It is hard to imagine another profession that deals with dogs so regularly and this expertise should be acknowledged.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127880"></A>
The bill also recognises pedigree certificates issued by the Australian National Kennel Council and its members as acceptable evidence of a dog’s breeding. In this bill the minister has provided practical solutions for the community to keep young children safe and to ensure that our pets are safe for families and localities. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Ms FARMER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bulimba--ALP) (8.49 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010. There is nothing more precious than our children’s lives. Each time we hear of the death of a child I am sure that the heart of every member in this House breaks just a little, feeling for the parents of that child and for the lost future that they face. That is why our job in passing this bill is so important. It is imperative that, in a state like Queensland, where we have so many backyard pools and a climate that irresistibly tempts young children into those pools as often as they can, we put legislation like this in place to ensure their safety. The bill, quite simply, delivers the most fundamental shake-up of pool safety legislation in nearly 20 years. This sentiment--to shake things up--is manifest in the bill and I am proud to be part of a government that has adopted such an innovative and comprehensive approach to pool safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132296"></A>
This bill will be effective because the provisions it contains, many of which are the first of their kind in Australia, address pool safety from a number of different perspectives. Although implementing best practice safety standards has been proven to save lives, this bill also introduces a suite of measures designed to ensure the functional operation and enforcement of such standards. The mandatory point-of-sale and lease inspection systems, for instance, ensure that the owners of non-compliant pool fences are required to upgrade them. Importantly--and this is something on which I would like to speak in particular--the bill also introduces a mandatory immersion incident reporting system. This system will not only improve our knowledge and understanding of the factors which lead up to immersion incidents, it also means that the right remedial action is undertaken whenever and wherever an immersion incident occurs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132297"></A>
The rationale behind the immersion reporting system is very simple: by opening up the avenues of communication between those who are at the coalface of immersion incident response and those who collate, analyse and assess immersion incident information, we can improve the consistency and validity of immersion incident data. Although we are only too aware of the tragic figures surrounding drownings in backyard pools, unfortunately, we simply do not have accurate data around immersion incidents. Without that, we cannot fully understand what we need to do to address pool safety issues in the best possible way. </Hansard-Body>

Under this bill, ultimately, if a child is submerged or partially submerged in any pool and their health or wellbeing is adversely affected, this will be sufficient to trigger its reporting as an immersion incident. This is a key reform as it will, over time, improve the accuracy of reporting in non-fatal immersion incidents. Closing this data gap will improve the quality of research and analysis into the antecedence of all pool immersion incidents and will allow relevant organisations to more accurately assess pool safety issues. This will improve the quality of the solutions we can propose. Obviously, to achieve the greatest benefits of this system, relevant organisations or individuals must report immersion incidents in a consistent, regular and uniform manner. So the bill places mandatory reporting obligations on public and private hospitals as well as on the Queensland Ambulance Service. It also provides protection to individual health professionals who voluntarily report immersion incidents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132300"></A>
The bill contains an obligation for the Queensland Ambulance Service to provide written notice to the chief executive of Health when and if the service is notified of a pool immersion incident, and a similar obligation is applied to the person in charge of a hospital. In both cases, the notice must be provided within five business days and contain, as a rule, the name and date of birth of the child involved, the date of the incident or examination, the address of the child’s parents and the address where the immersion incident occurred. The bill does not require an investigation to occur and the information is only mandatory if it is known. In this way, a conscious effort has been made to only require information that is usually gathered in the course of day-to-day operations. This will mean that ambulance staff as well as nurses and doctors in emergency departments are not burdened by red tape and can remain focused on their lifesaving activities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132302"></A>
As well as these mandatory obligations, the bill empowers individual health professionals to report to the chief executive of Health any information relevant to a case they believe involves a pool immersion incident. It does so by explicitly removing any concern that health professionals may have about their legal liability in the situation or their compliance with a code of ethics, etiquette or professional conduct. The aim of this is to give health professionals the confidence to report immersion incidents to the chief executive of Health, thereby helping to make sure that there is comprehensive and accurate collection of immersion data. Once the chief executive of Health has received notice of a pool immersion incident, the bill provides five business days to give notice of the pool immersion incident to the Pool Safety Council, the relevant local government, the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian and the chief executive of the Department of Infrastructure and Planning. Once the relevant local government has received this notification, they must inspect the pool. In this way, any necessary problems with the pool fencing will be identified and fixed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132305"></A>
The mandatory immersion reporting system will encourage compliance with safety standards. Ultimately, it will promote accurate and comprehensive data collection on immersion incidents. There is no doubt that these innovations will play a critical role in ensuring that we are making the best informed decisions in the future about how to improve pool safety for our young children. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1132307"></A>
I congratulate the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning on his genuine dedication in bringing about these reforms and on his work with all stakeholder groups to ensure that the reforms are suitable and acceptable but also tough and right for the job they need to do. This sort of legislation is so important. Looking after our kids is so important. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr RICKUSS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lockyer--LNP) (8.56 pm): I rise to say a few words on the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010. I would like to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of Andrew Plint from Hannah’s Foundation. I am sure the minister’s office has had a lot to do with Andrew and his wife, Katherine, who have been very involved with Hannah’s Foundation since the unfortunate passing of their daughter Hannah. The minister acknowledged Hannah’s Foundation in his second reading speech for providing some assistance with some of the regulations in this bill. He acknowledged also the Royal Life Saving Society, the Queensland Law Society, the Real Estate Institute of Queensland and people like Laurie Lawrence and general community members who have always been interested in this sort of thing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132320"></A>
I had the good fortune of having a meal with Andrew tonight--I am sure he will not get into trouble with Katherine about that--in the Strangers’ Dining Room and we discussed some of these issues. It is an ongoing learning curve. I must support the amendment that the member for Gympie has brought into the House. It seems to be a common-sense amendment. The community as a whole would probably support that amendment, too. There are arguments for and against leaving the legislation as it currently stands, but I do feel that the amendment is probably justifiable as we have already legislated for the mandatory installation of safety switches and smoke alarms in houses at the point of sale. So this is probably not a bad amendment as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132323"></A>
We do need to be careful. It is about supervision as much as it is about regulations for fencing. Parents still have to be careful. On my own property in Laidley we have a pool with the appropriate pool fencing, but through the fence is the Lockyer Creek, which at the moment would be about 18 feet deep. So people have to supervise continually. The same principle applies to blow-up pools, and the bill’s provisions regarding fencing now apply to the reduced depth of a pool of 300 millimetres from the previous 450 millimetres. People need to be aware that particularly small infants can still drown in those sorts of things. They can drown in bathtubs as well. It is a shame. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132326"></A>
I must congratulate Andrew, Katherine and the other members of Hannah’s Foundation. Not only are they interested in pool regulation and child safety, but they also act as a consulting and support network for people who have suffered such a tragic loss in their families. This service has been sadly needed. When Hannah did pass they realised this sort of support network was missing from society. It is people like Andrew and Katherine who actually do make a difference to society. They have put a lot of work into it, even through a lot of heartache. I say congratulations on the great work they have done over the years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136874"></A>
All we can do is look to the legislation that has been introduced. It is great to see the movement on this since 1 December, when stage 1 was introduced. We are now dealing with stage 2. I imagine that pool regulations will be toyed with over a number of years and, hopefully, we will see emerge the regulations that will enforce the safety standards that we need. Terrible tragedies can happen in spa pools and children have had their hair caught in pumps. Myriad mistakes can be made. Many of us have a lucky story where one of our children has fallen into a stream, creek, dam or pool and we have managed to pull them out in time. Supervision is really important. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136875"></A>
Some of the data relevant to the bill has been collected from groups such as Hannah’s Foundation, the surf-lifesaving association and so on. It shows that a percentage of drownings happen in the early stages of the occupation of a new home. That is vital information that people must be aware of when they buy a new home or lease a new property. It is good to see that the minister has announced improved funding for an education and awareness campaign. We need a continual process of improvement in education and awareness. That is an ongoing program that needs to be continually improved. Unfortunately, at times the wrong people watch the ads. It is very important that we reach busy young families. Perhaps the department can distribute kits to the maternity units in hospitals so that the information is available to parents when their children are very young. We need to make families aware right from the start. That idea has come into my head as I stand here. </Hansard-Body>

 That might not be a bad idea. Some of them probably do deserve to be put down. Definitely there are some bad owners.

 I am sure the minister will be able to enlighten me on that statistic if it is not right. On the issue of the sustainability legislation about the privacy laws, some of the councils have gone overboard with the enactment of privacy laws. It has gone almost to the point of stupidity. I honestly feel it is a misinterpretation of the act. I encourage the minister to enlighten some of the councils about what they should be doing with some of the laws, because it is frustrating for constituents who are trying to find out information about privacy laws. </Hansard-Body>

The legislation dealing with the RNA showgrounds is common-sense legislation. It should be put in place. My brother owns a block of land at the top end of Bowen Hills.

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (9.04 pm): I rise to speak to the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). Along with every single person in this chamber, I believe that the protection of people from drowning is an important element of the bill. More particularly, the protection of children, especially small children, from drowning is critically important. Significant improvements have been made since the introduction of mandatory pool fencing to protect small children. Earlier, the member for Nanango and I were talking about this issue. She said that the safest thing around any pool is adult supervision and she is so right. There is no substitute for that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136891"></A>
Therefore, the changes to the legislation in relation to pool fencing are reasonable. A good education campaign to alert homeowners to any new obligations is very important to the success of the legislation. It is one thing to be able to hit people over the head with a stick if they do not comply, but they need to have full knowledge of their requirements. They need to be well advised of their new obligations. There is much that we can do in relation to pool fencing. I put on the record my appreciation to the many paid workers and volunteers who undertake lifesaving duties. They provide a wonderful service. However, as I have said there is no substitute for parental vigilance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136892"></A>
The bill clarifies the situation in relation to American Staffordshire Terriers, which are also known as Amstaffs. Certainly I have received my fair share of correspondence from American Staffordshire Terrier owners claiming that their dogs are safe and well behaved. Most dogs are wonderful. When a dog has a bad temperament, you have to look at the owner and see where that--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes. The clarification in the bill is important. It will certainly give some peace to the owners of American Staffordshire Terriers. The dogs that bite the most are ones such as dachshunds, and our Aussie blue heeler is pretty well known for biting. Members should look at the statistics. The most unlikely dogs bite and little dachshunds are the worst. They are close to the ground and have to look for something to bite. </Hansard-Body>

The bill deals with the protection of the RNA Showgrounds, the Ekka site, for future generations. Again, I commend the minister for that. The showgrounds have a very sentimental place in the hearts of people right across Queensland and particularly those who live in the south-east corner. Whilst it is important that this development goes ahead in a private partnership, it is also important that the site be retained for future generations, not only because of its practical use but also because of its historical significance to the community. I support the legislation. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (9.07 pm): This evening I rise to make a contribution to the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010. The purpose of this legislation is to amend swimming pool safety laws and it is the second phase of stage 2 to introduce mandatory pool safety inspections. The objective is to help reduce the incidence of pool related immersion injuries and deaths for a very vulnerable section of the community, children aged under five years. The bill introduces requirements for pool barriers to be regularly inspected by competent and qualified inspectors to ensure that they comply with a uniform pool safety standard. In the past pool-fencing laws have been successful in saving the lives of young children, and the aim of these reforms is to ensure the laws continue to achieve this objective in the most effective manner possible.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136903"></A>
It is widely acknowledged that supervision is the first line of protection for children where swimming pools are involved. However, an effective pool barrier provides added protection in cases where supervision breaks down. Research undertaken by the Queensland Injury Surveillance Unit in 2002 suggests that at least 70 people are alive today because of the introduction of pool-fencing laws in the early 1990s. The LNP has concerns regarding the implementation of these laws, particularly regarding the rushed implementation foreshadowed to come into effect on 1 December 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136942"></A>
Between 1 January 2004 and 18 May 2010, 35 children under five years of age drowned in Queensland’s residential swimming pools, as well as two drownings in wading pools and one in a homemade pool. It is estimated that 50 young children present at emergency departments each year due to immersion injuries, some of whom will suffer permanent brain damage. Interestingly, I have my own personal experience with the near drowning of my son, Gregory, when he was just 18 months of age, but unfortunately this legislation does not cover the manner in which his close encounter occurred.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136943"></A>
I took my son to a local nursery to buy plants and my son was busy taking the names of plants out of pots and putting them into different pots, just to confuse potential buyers. I went inside the nursery to purchase plants and I heard a splash. I luckily did not ignore this and ran outside to find my son submersed in a timber barrel, which are often used as planters. These barrels are filled with water before they are sold so that the barrels do not crack. Unfortunately this instance almost caused the drowning of my son. So I guess the moral of the story is that you cannot even go to somewhere relatively safe such as a nursery and not have an almost life-threatening incident occur. Luckily also for my son I am a nurse and I was able to give him CPR. These barrels of course are not captured in this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136944"></A>
Defective fences remain a significant factor in the findings of coronial reports on fatal immersion accidents, with young children commonly shown to have gained access to a fenced pool through a gate or door. Such circumstances include where a pool gate has been propped open--often a result of pool gates that do not close or latch automatically--or a child gaining access to a pool via child-resistant doors, which were permitted for pools built before 1 February 1991.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136945"></A>
Pool safety laws introduced in 1991 required all outdoor residential swimming pools to be fenced. These laws have contributed to saving 70 young children between 1992 and 2001. The LNP has concerns that training programs for inspectors who will implement these laws are yet to be finalised. There is yet to be a Pool Safety Council set up by the government, and the LNP has grave concerns that the inspectors carrying out these repairs to existing pool fences are yet to be certified so that the safety components of this legislation can be effectively enacted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136946"></A>
Under this legislation, the buyer of a property has 90 days to comply with the legislation and this will have an impact on local governments in the enforcement of these responsibilities and liabilities. The Liberal National Party will be supporting this legislation as the aim is to bring about improvements in pool safety. However, we continue to have grave concerns about the implementation of these important reforms. The consistent message amongst stakeholders in the review of this legislation was that, whilst everyone supported this as a move to improve safety for infants and young children around water, there still remained substantial concerns regarding the implementation of this legislation. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr RYAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Morayfield--ALP) (9.13 pm): I rise to contribute to the debate on the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). The key focus of this bill is to implement the next stage of this government’s pool safety reforms. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136958"></A>
It is often said that one of the great Australian dreams is to own your own home. It may also be said that the great Queensland dream is to own your own home with a pool in the backyard. Queenslanders love the water. We love our lifestyle. But, sadly, the great Queensland dream can sometimes turn into a living nightmare. Sadly, families all around Queensland have been dealing with terrible tragedies involving children and swimming pools. What is worse is that some of these tragedies could have been prevented. There is no denying that these accidents can happen and may always happen. However, some of these accidents can be prevented. Even if this government through its pool safety reforms can prevent just one of those accidents into the future and save just one life, then these reforms have achieved something. The safety of our children is the key priority guiding these reforms. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136961"></A>
As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, this bill represents the culmination of the Queensland government’s swimming pool safety improvement strategy. It builds upon this government’s previous reforms and seeks to introduce a nation-leading implementation and compliance scheme for a strategy designed to reduce the incidence of immersion injuries and fatalities. The reforms outlined in this bill will reinforce the effectiveness of swimming pool legislation and will help protect young children from the risks associated with residential swimming pools. These risks are real and they are often frightening. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136964"></A>
As consecutive stages of our pool safety program have been rolled out and particularly through each legislative initiative that has advanced this strategy, this House has heard exactly how many children have died each year because of incomplete or inadequate pool fencing. To remind you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and the House, in the period from 1 January 2004 to 18 May 2010, 41 children drowned in Queensland swimming pools. Of these 41 deaths, 10 occurred in public pools, 33 occurred in in-ground private pools, two occurred in above-ground pools, two occurred in wading pools and one occurred in a homemade pool. Last year alone, we lost eight children under the age of five. Even these figures are dwarfed by the number of immersion injuries that present to emergency departments each year. Children who survive are all too often robbed of a lifetime of opportunity due to permanent brain damage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136967"></A>
In spite of such sobering statistics, these tragedies are not an inevitable part of Queensland’s future. I wholeheartedly support this government taking decisive action to improve upon that record and promote the safety of young children around swimming pools. If this legislation, if this whole strategy, saves even one life, then it will all have been worth it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136969"></A>
As parents and carers are the first line of defence against an immersion incident, I am pleased to see that this government will promote supervision and vigilance as the primary means of ensuring a child’s safety around swimming pools. Teaching children to swim as early as possible is an effective means of preventing drowning tragedies. In recognition of these facts, I am pleased to see that this state Labor government has more than tripled its funding for this year’s summer safety campaign. The government’s campaign will again remind parents that supervision and swimming skills are the primary forms of defence against an immersion incident involving a young child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136971"></A>
I understand that the opposition is supporting this bill but will move some amendments. I particularly understand that the opposition will move an amendment to make the pool safety inspection a condition of sale. From my background as a property solicitor, I have some reservations about the foresight that goes with that particular amendment. </Hansard-Body>

Mr RYAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Perhaps if the member for Gympie had spoken to the self-appointed champion of property conveyancers, the member for Kawana, who has often spoken passionately in this House in defence of property conveyance lawyers and also real estate agents, he would know that one of the primary aspects of property transactions is providing certainty to both buyers and sellers. One of the primary aspects of providing certainty to buyers and sellers in property transactions is to limit the number of options for people to get out of their contract. The priority of this legislation is to improve pool safety. The priority is not to create additional burdens and uncertainties for purchasers and sellers of residential property. So the obligation is correctly placed in this legislation on people to ensure that pool safety is improved but will not create additional uncertainties and burdens on people who are parties to property transactions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141683"></A>
Although I welcome the opposition’s support, the particular amendment that will be moved by the member for Gympie poses some threat to the certainty surrounding property transactions for buyers and sellers and does not improve on the safety position in the legislation as it is drafted. Whilst I appreciate that some people may question the rigorous extent of these pool safety standards, it is critical that we place the safety of children first. It is important that this parliament now act to further improve pool safety as soon as possible. I take this opportunity to commend the minister, his staff and the department on their work in respect of the bill. With those comments I commend the bill to the House and encourage all members to support it. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.20 pm): I rise today to support the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). I specifically intend to concentrate my comments around the point of sale inspection system but also the Sustainable Planning Act. This government--and I am sure all members in fact--believe that stronger pool fencing legislation can help save lives. That is why this bill introduces a new point of sale compliance system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141686"></A>
To ensure that this groundbreaking legislative scheme is effective, it has been drafted to cater for a wide range of circumstances where pools are used. This is vital to ensure that the lives of young children are protected whenever they use a pool or, just as importantly, visit other homes and places that have pools as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141687"></A>
For some pool owners upgrades will not be necessary or will in fact be minor while for others there may be more substantial work required. However, I think it is fair to say that pool owners will be given ample opportunity over a five-year period to comply with the new laws unless of course they sell their property first. What this means is that pool owners will have a five-year period in which to prepare unless they sell the property before that period. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141688"></A>
It is this sales trigger which is to become a key element of this bill and which will deliver on the government’s commitment to phase in the new pool safety standard for existing properties. It is felt that this will optimise the uptake of the new standards as it was also specifically designed to address the unacceptably high number of immersion injuries and deaths involving young children that occur shortly after families move into new and hence unfamiliar premises. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141689"></A>
I think it is widely known and accepted that numerous pool safety organisations agree that the risk of drowning is highest among young children during the first six months of occupying a property. This is why the point of sale inspection system has been introduced. As such, if the seller already has a compliant pool fence, as evidenced by an approved pool safety certificate, they simply provide this to the purchaser. However, if a pool safety certificate is not in effect for the property the seller must provide notice to the purchaser and the chief executive of the Department of Infrastructure and Planning that such a certificate has not been obtained and that the pool fence may not comply with the appropriate standards. This notice must also state that the purchaser may need to complete upgrade work on the pool fence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141691"></A>
In cases where pools are sold without a pool safety certificate, the certificate must generally be obtained by the purchaser within 90 days of settlement. It is considered that, in this way, those families who purchase homes with pools are alerted to the potential dangers of non-compliant pools and their obligations. At the same time, this will also protect young children and families who may visit them by ensuring that pools are brought up to the new standard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141692"></A>
This legislation has been drafted widely to apply to both shared and non-shared pools. By way of example, shared pools include those located in unit complexes and motels. As such, a non-shared pool will most commonly be associated with a private house. For shared pools, if a seller has not already obtained a pool safety certificate then before they may legally settle a sale transaction they must also provide notice to the owner of the shared pool, which is usually the body corporate for the complex. In this way, all of the relevant parties are notified of their potential obligations. This will trigger the body corporate to bring the pool up to the new standard providing added protection for all unit owners and visitors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141693"></A>
By requiring that the chief executive be notified, the state based pool safety register can be appropriately updated with this information and subsequent follow-up action can be arranged and taken in relation to the potentially non-complaint pools. In addition, by notifying the purchaser the seller is informing the buyer of their obligations before the contract is settled, making them fully aware of the risks involved with the pool. It is considered that this will encourage vigilant supervision of young children around the pool. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141694"></A>
In addition to these reforms, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak about the reforms that this bill makes to the Sustainable Planning Act 2009. The planning and development online, or more widely known as PD online, facility has been utilised by many local governments for many years and is considered to be a valuable tool for providing easy access to information by the community about property details, planning scheme requirements, mapping and development application activities. I can attest to the fact that the community has long demanded ready access to this information. I believe that councils have welcomed it as an opportunity to demonstrate the openness and transparency of the process involved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141695"></A>
However, the Information Privacy Act 2009 that applies to local government from 1 July 2010 has meant that if any of the information provided on PD online contains personal information its publication may be in breach of the privacy legislation. As a consequence, PD online has to be removed from or partially closed at least on some council websites. I think this would be of concern to some community members, including councils, who have become reliant on this information being readily available on PD online. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141697"></A>
In view of this, an amendment to the Sustainable Planning Act 2009 is proposed to remedy the situation by authorising the online publication of this material. This amendment simply authorises that the material may be published. It is significant that the amendment is not a strict requirement so the discretion remains with the council to decide whether to publish online or not. That is very important. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141699"></A>
It is well known that the development application process under the Sustainable Planning Act 2009 is a public process and the council must make the development application and related material available to any person to view freely at the council’s office. As such, it is seen that having the information available on PD online simply facilitates accessability to this information and allows community members to avoid a personal visit to the council office. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141700"></A>
However, it is also considered that council will have the discretion to remove the name, address and signature of persons making the submission from the publication of the submission about a development application as is the case when councils make submissions available for inspection over the counter. Council will also retain the discretion about whether to publish information or documents containing sensitive security information. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141701"></A>
I believe that this bill successfully balances the need for ready access to development application materials with the protection of an individual’s personal information. Further, it also balances the need to grant pool owners sufficient time to prepare for reducing the danger inherent in high-risk pools. As such, ultimately it balances practical considerations with community safety to achieve the best possible outcomes in terms of public interest. It is for this reason that I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.26 pm): I too rise to speak in the debate on the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Legislation (No. 2). From the outset, let me add my support for any piece of legislation that looks to improve our ability to keep our kids safe, particularly when it comes to drowning deaths in swimming pools. When this bill came up for debate and we received the swimming pool safety laws brief put out by the Queensland Parliamentary Library I took the liberty of forwarding it on to a constituent of mine, Mr Harry Wrangell. The minister may remember that I mentioned some of the submissions that Mr Wrangell made to the review committee. Unfortunately, Mr Wrangell replied by saying that he still has not heard back from the review committee or anyone to do with the swimming pool safety law review which is a bit frustrating for not only Mr Wrangell but also me. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141705"></A>
He still has a number of issues that I think are worthy of raising. I hope the minister will take a moment to listen to some of the concerns he raises. The research brief itself mentions that over half of fabricated metal fencing does not comply with the standard for strength. Substandard fencing is still being used. The brief, and certainly the legislation, does not go any further in terms of mentioning strategies to enforce the standard of fence panels nor have any fines or the like been imposed on manufacturers or suppliers of faulty products. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141706"></A>
I think Mr Wrangell is right in suggesting that this may become a bit of an issue for pool inspectors when they try to determine the strength of the pool fencing. It is still the case that kids can get through, get around or push down some fencing. As Mr Wrangell suggests, testing for such standard compliance requires special hardware which is normally performed in laboratory type environments. It is going to be very difficult for pool safety inspectors on site to determine whether that pool fencing is up to standard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1146523"></A>
Mr Wrangell suggests--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1146525"></A>
Other safety products must have a permanent label attached stating the relevant standard of compliance. This is why I suggest that pool safety panels, posts and gates must display this permanent marking. This is the only way that pool owners know that they have been supplied with an authorised product.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146527"></A>
Mr Wrangell is also very passionate about the gates and the locks around swimming pools, and he made a submission specifically around some of the work that he has been doing on alternatives. He strongly believes that many deaths and near drownings have been attributed to young children climbing up some movable object, reaching the release knob and gaining entry. He states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1146530"></A>
It is beyond belief and logic thinking that the standards do not stipulate a minimum force which must be applied to release any locking mechanism.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1146531"></A>
He continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1146533"></A>
Locks which use electromagnetic attraction to hold a locking bolt in place have a bad safety design defect. The locking feature can easily be negated by simply placing a metal washer over the magnet’s pole face. (the bottom half of the assembly).</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1146534"></A>
The gate will still close perfectly, but it will never lock.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1146535"></A>
If we continue to use substandard gates and locks then we possibly still have not got this right. He goes on to say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1146537"></A>
Another feature of this type of lock is that the force required to release the lock is insufficient, as well as the fact that the magnetic attraction on the plunger forms part of this force.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1146538"></A>
He suggests that--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1146540"></A>
... locking devices should be included in the Australian Standard (or State building codes), which would require that the locking pin arrangement be completely enclosed to make it tamper proof. Methods are available to do this.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146541"></A>
Ultimately, though, my biggest concern in terms of correspondence I continue to get from Mr Wrangell is that he has failed to receive any response or even acknowledgement from anyone involved in the pool safety law review. It really pains me to know that a constituent of mine is going to such effort to contribute to the debate, to contribute to the making of legislation and to contribute to the making of policy in this state and yet we cannot even acknowledge it. He concludes by saying--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1146544"></A>
I would appreciate a response as to how my suggestions were received, and if any of them look like being adopted. Incidentally, I requested some help on pool safety matters some five months ago--first to the Institute of Building Surveyors, and then to Building Codes Qld.--I am still waiting for a reply to the question I asked.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146545"></A>
If the minister has an opportunity in his reply to respond to some of those issues around the strength of the panelling, the gates and the locking mechanisms, I know that that will go a long way to assuaging the concerns of Mr Wrangell and me in those matters. With that, I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146548"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr DOWLING </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Redlands--LNP) (9.31 pm): Tonight I rise to contribute to debate on the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010, which addresses pool safety, clarifies that the American Staffordshire bull terrier is a different breed from the American pit bull terrier, and sets out to protect the Ekka site should the RNA become insolvent. I will limit my comments to the pool safety components of the legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146551"></A>
I also add my congratulations to the officers who have put this legislation together. I congratulate the bureaucratic side of this government in terms of the policy that they have put together and recognise the work that they have done in bringing this legislation forward. However, I do have some concerns about this legislation. I have concerns about how this legislation will be implemented. While we applaud the sentiment and applaud anything that is a step in the right direction for pool safety, we are mindful of how this legislation will be administered, how it will be managed and the processes that will be followed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146553"></A>
In the first instance there is the creation of a new entity. The Pool Safety Council will be largely responsible for administering this new regime that is being rolled out. There will be a pool safety inspection regime and there are questions about how that might be managed and implemented. There are issues with the pool safety certificates in terms of how they will be managed. There are also questions about the pool safety inspector training regime and the courses that they will be put through. There are questions as to how that will be administered, how that will be delivered and who will deliver it. These are all critical questions in ensuring that this legislation is correct and does deliver what we want--that is, zero drownings in Queensland. If we can get this legislation right, we will be well on the way towards achieving that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146554"></A>
So we have all of those questions. There are also questions around the registration of all swimming pools. I took the liberty of talking to officers from Redland City Council today. Those officers believe that they are well on track to have that register ready to present to the Pool Safety Council. Their work is underway. This bill is obviously quite a significant piece of legislation in that it is going to affect an estimated 325,000 existing pools across Queensland and it is a huge task to manage that. The legislation also ensures that those same pools comply with the most recent regulations. Again, this is an important step forward.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146559"></A>
Part of this bill relates to the requirements for portable pools or those pools with a depth of 300 millimetres, down from 450 millimetres. I would ask the minister during his summing-up if he could clarify some of the steps that have been taken in amending regulations requiring fencing or whatever instruments may be required in that instance. I take on board that that issue probably sits better with the Minister for Fair Trading in terms of those types of areas where these pools are purchased. However, the questions I have are around what information will be available at the point of sale. Again, I realise that this is not this minister’s responsibility, but there needs to be some connection between those two ministers and maybe in his summing-up the minister can touch on those issues. There are not only the requirements at the point of sale but also the requirements in terms of the packaging. What information will be available on the packaging for these portable pools? What sort of education regime are we looking at rolling out, because without getting those three things correct we will be no further advanced? We will not be achieving what we need to achieve in order to ensure pool safety.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146564"></A>
I am absolutely certain, based on what I have heard from the minister’s second reading speech, that it is certainly not his intent nor is it the government’s intent, but there is the potential with this new regime of pool safety inspectors to create--and I have heard other members mention this--a set of circumstances as occurred with the insulation program. New businesses blossomed overnight. We need to ensure that we get the mechanisms right not only for the training but also for the type of people who are performing these functions. We need to ensure that we do not create another insulation type debacle or allow another water tank installer type business to blossom overnight. As we know, overnight business opportunities attract the opportunist. We need to ensure that everything is done to make sure that does not happen.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146565"></A>
There is also the question around these same pool inspectors becoming repairers. Again, this is an opportunity where someone could introduce themselves as a legitimate pool inspector and quite legitimately be a pool inspector. During the audit period they may find some issues with gates, with fences and with latches in terms of minor works and see the opportunity to create their own small business empire. They are the questions I have for the minister. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146566"></A>
This is about ensuring that we get all of that detail right, and we should not lose sight of the fact that we have very compressed time. This becomes law on 1 December and three months later everything needs to be up and running. There is that transition period, and I heard the shadow minister reference how we address that transition period and how the regulations will be able to be delivered upon. Looking at the legislation that has been put before us, none of these things has been finalised and that leaves me with an uncomfortable feeling. An issue that has been mentioned a couple of times and something that I have a great deal of difficulty in understanding is why the government would allow a vendor to, as it were, leave the scene of the crime and not make the home good before they move on.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146604"></A>
I draw a parallel between selling a house and selling a motor car. I do not see any difference whatsoever. When I go to sell a car I cannot do so without having a roadworthy certificate for it. Why should I be able to sell a house without having the house fully compliant? It is simply one more check that needs to be made. You have to have your safety switches in place, you have to have your smoke detectors in place and you have to have your pool certified. That is what should be before this House today. Again, I am pleased that the shadow minister will be moving an amendment along those lines. Hopefully, those opposite will support it, because I think it is common sense. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146605"></A>
It is absolute certainty that is required in this instance instead of passing the responsibility to the purchaser. As we have heard, vendors have 90 days in which to make the pool fence compliant. In that 90 days there is the highest risk of new pool owners, new families, moving into a home, experiencing a drowning or an immersion incident. I know absolutely that if we can get this legislation tidied up, it will be good legislation and it will be something that will start to achieve the target that we are looking for, and that is zero drownings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146606"></A>
I also draw the parallels between a sale of a property and a change of a tenant in a lease or rental situation. I wonder why there is this disparity between the two. If you change your tenant, your pool must be compliant before a new tenant can move into that rental or lease property. Why would the situation be any different for a new family taking up ownership of a home? I cannot understand how that would be even remotely different--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146607"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Hinchliffe:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 You were citing evidence about high risk. It is the higher risk space. Rental properties are the higher risk. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146608"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DOWLING:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection. High risk is anyone moving into a home with a pool when they have not had one before, be it a rental property or be it an owner-occupied home. It is the same risk. We cannot split hairs on this issue. If these pool safety regulations are to be successful, they need to be consistent in application and consistent in administration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146609"></A>
The minister might also address in his summing-up how and why the council building inspectors are deemed to be authorised pool safety inspectors for the first year but then presumably are required to go through re-accreditation, a new licensing regime and/or pay for a new licence the following year. Historically, the council has always been a strong ally of the government in pool safety regimes, pool inspections and the administration of pool safety. I am just wondering why there would be that movement away from that relationship and why council inspectors would not be considered to be appropriately licensed or accredited inspectors for the purposes of pool legislation. As those council officers are inspectors for the first year of this legislation, why should that system not continue? I would also ask whether or not these council pool inspectors would be required to undergo training each year or each time their licence comes up for renewal. The minister might also be able to touch on that matter in his summing-up. </Hansard-Body>

 I take that interjection from the member for Gympie. I just phoned him up. His number is in the <Hansard-Italic>
White Pages</Hansard-Italic>
. This morning I talked to Laurie to just get a sense of pool safety from one of Queensland’s most passionate pool safety advocates. He has been one of the leading voices in pool safety for I do not know how long and I will just paraphrase some of his comments. He said that pool safety is not a silver bullet and that this legislation will not achieve it on its own. But Laurie did say that it is obviously a step in the right direction. He highlighted a number of things that he felt really needed to be addressed at a state level. Obviously, one was pool fencing, and that needs to be ongoing. The pool fencing regime and all the pool regulations need to be an ongoing process. It is a moving feast. Laurie also said that pool safety is about doing the five: it is about drown-proofing littlies and children, it is about swimming lessons, watching your mate and resuscitation. He again emphasised all of those--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Bold>
An honourable member</Hansard-Bold>
 interjected.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146615"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DOWLING:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 He went on a little along that line, but he also stressed that education is one of the things that is missing at a Queensland level--that federally funded campaigns are running but that the state has probably dropped the baton on those education campaigns a little. Laurie’s comment was that if we get all of those things right--and he was by no means critical of the government--we will give ourselves the best chance of having no drownings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146616"></A>
While talking to Laurie I obviously took the opportunity to say, ‘Look, this is our position. We will be moving an amendment on this legislation. What are your thoughts in relation to the settlement issue and when the pool must be made compliant? When should that certificate come into place?’ He agreed that the time really needs to be at the point of sale and that the vendor needs to be the one who makes good and not the incoming person. Laurie quoted a number of statistics--and we have heard them all here tonight--about how critical those first six months are. We have taken the first half of that time to allow new owners to come up to speed. I suspect and I suggest the--</Hansard-Body>

You’re supporting the amendment?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146618"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DOWLING:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am supporting the amendment, but I also suggest that, while we might sit in here and say, ‘In 90 days you have to get the pool right’, I suspect that it will take considerably longer than 90 days. I know that people will have all the excuses under the sun. The pool needs to be compliant prior to settlement.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146619"></A>
Laurie did say that anything less than that is really compromising the safety of the young people moving into the house. So I look forward to supporting the amendment moved by the shadow minister and hopefully we will hear some answers from the minister in his summing-up. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs ATTWOOD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Ommaney--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.46 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010 and in particular the introduction of a single uniform safety standard for all pool fencing in Queensland. The introduction of this standard is the defining feature of this legislation and the central component of the government’s swimming pool safety improvement strategy. It incorporates modern, best-practice principles and endeavours to reduce the number of fatal and non-fatal immersion incidents involving young children in residential swimming pools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146622"></A>
Although this legislation can never replace parental supervision, it acts as an important safety net for that brief window where supervision fails--those few brief minutes that it takes for a child to drown. In those minutes, a compliant pool fence could mean the difference between a close call and a tragedy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146623"></A>
This bill is the result of the most significant review of our pool safety laws since they were introduced in 1991. The 1991 reforms heralded a dramatic and sustained reduction in drownings. Last year, Queensland lost eight children in residential swimming pools--more than any other state in Australia--and this government is determined to do better. It is abundantly clear that legislating comprehensive pool fencing laws is an effective means of reducing drowning deaths and immersion injuries. With the solution so readily apparent, we are simply not prepared to accept the risk that swimming pools and faulty barriers pose to young children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146624"></A>
Principally, this bill creates an obligation on all pool owners to ensure that, by the prescribed date, their pool is compliant with the new uniform standard. However, there are over 300,000 existing pools in this state and while some require only minor improvements, others might require substantial work. Although the most extensive work will be for fences nearing the end of their serviceable lives, we cannot pass this legislation today and expect every pool owner to upgrade tomorrow. The industry could not sustain the demand and pool owners would be robbed of the opportunity to evaluate their situation, make a practical decision and order their affairs to accommodate that decision. Consequently, the government proposes to implement a five-year phase-in period for compliance with the standard. Owners will have five years from the commencement of the legislation to upgrade their pool unless they sell or lease their property first. This phase-in period will keep demand at sustainable levels and facilitate a more gradual and comprehensive method of monitoring and enforcing compliance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151591"></A>
The phased implementation of this legislation is an essential feature of the Pool Safety Improvement Strategy. It will allow pool owners sufficient time to prepare for the new laws while also limiting demands on the pool safety industry to manageable levels. Maximising the number of pools in Queensland that are compliant with the standard increases the chance that there is a safety net in place during those fleeting minutes it takes for a child to drown. Thus the new standard will have a broader application. All regulated pools will be captured regardless of when they are constructed or whether they are new or existing, indoor or outdoor, shared or personal. There are currently 11 different sets of pool fencing standards in force which results in a confusing and onerous compliance paradigm. Homeowners and pool inspectors will no longer need to consider a number of potentially applicable standards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151592"></A>
The new standard will also be extended to include pools associated with a wide range of buildings, including houses, townhouses, unit complexes, hotels, motels, backpacker hostels, caravan parks, transportable home parks and caretaker residences. Portable wading pools that are filled to a depth of 300 millimetres or more will also now be covered. Previously portable wading pools could accommodate water to a depth of 450 millimetres without requiring fencing, but the significant risk of drowning in such pools will now be recognised in law. This change is an adoption of a national standard. While the effectiveness of this standard will be bolstered by its broader application, this government understands that an effective policy must have enough flexibility to be applied in a wide variety of situations and this bill strikes that balance by providing a number of exemptions for situations where it would be highly impractical to expect owners to comply fully with the standard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151593"></A>
Pool owners may apply for an exemption on the grounds that it is physically impractical to comply with the standard, while people with disabilities can obtain an exemption allowing appropriate access to the pool. Applications for exemptions will be made to local governments who are best placed to assess the individual circumstances of each pool and each pool owner. These exemptions are aimed at accommodating people’s varying circumstances without sacrificing the safety of young children. Thus the bill only allows exemptions to the extent that they would ameliorate the difficulty for which the exemption is being sought. In effect, the new standard applies wherever an exemption does not. In this way deviations are minimised and the standard can still be used as the primary means by which owners can ensure the compliance of their pool fence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151594"></A>
Exemptions may also be made conditional upon any requirements or conditions that a local government deems necessary to ensure that young people are adequately inhibited from accessing a pool. In this way Queensland’s pool safety laws are not only the most comprehensive in the nation, but also offer appropriate flexibility to pool owners facing different circumstances. The bill empowers local governments, having granted an exemption, to revoke that exemption in certain circumstances. For example, if the exemption was based on false or misleading information or the applicant has not complied with a condition the local government may issue a show cause notice. If no satisfactory reason is provided then the exemption may be revoked and a penalty will apply if the applicant does not comply. It is important to note that an exemption for disability is specific to a particular person, while an exemption for impracticality is specific to a particular property. This has important implications for pool owners because the legislation provides that an exemption ends when it is no longer applicable. For example, if a person with a disability no longer resides at that property then the pool owner must upgrade the pool, whereas an impracticality exemption survives a change of occupier.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151595"></A>
Finally, I conclude by reiterating that the new safety standards are based on best practice. I believe that this bill will help make Queensland pools safer. However, nothing can substitute parental supervision. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

(9.53 pm): Great things are happening at Nerang State Primary School which has adopted a number of programs to change the school community’s approach to healthy eating and the use of fresh produce in the day-to-day lives of its 380 students and their families. About 20 percent of the school population comes from a Pacific Island and Maori background which, of course, have different diets as well. Whilst the school has successfully implemented the Stephanie Alexander School Garden Program this year and now has a flourishing vegetable garden, it is also educating parents and carers of the importance of using healthy food in their cooking. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151602"></A>
The school has started a cooking program for parents and carers in an effort to show families that fresh food is important in their family diets rather than packaged and takeaway food. Parents are able to bring along their food to a cooking class and are shown how to make a delicious and nutritious casserole to feed their young. Principal Rod Kirkland told me last year and then two weeks ago that staff were noticing an increase in pre-packed food in students’ lunchboxes but now students were adapting their tastebuds to more fresh fruit and vegetables. The Stephanie Alexander Garden Program has been highly successful and has encouraged a whole group of young gardeners at the school. The students can choose food that is healthy and then engage in fun and hands-on experience in growing, harvesting, preparing and sharing fresh and delicious food. Rod Kirkland told me that most students would not normally eat fresh beetroot but after making chocolate and beetroot cake in the classroom recently they could not get enough of this vegetable. As well, the garden is increasing students’ knowledge of vegetables. Out of 90 students, one knowledgeable student correctly named a Jerusalem artichoke. Students are currently picking lettuce, rocket, beetroot, chard, parsley and radish.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151603"></A>
The garden has been a big community effort with 40 volunteers needed each week to run 10 classes. The school is finding it difficult to get this many volunteers with all the pressures of busy lives these days. The school hopes that the garden will lead to students and families creating their own gardens at home and also help students make life-long decisions on better food choices. As well, the garden program is being used in other subjects at school such as science, English and maths. Nerang is the only school on the Gold Coast with the garden program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151604"></A>
As mentioned earlier, the school has a high Pacific Islander population and has two clubs for older Maori boys and another for younger Pacific Islanders and Maoris where they can learn dances and songs about their own cultures. Recently I spent part of my Saturday helping out at the school fete which was well supported by the community and raised $8,000. Coming up shortly is the Nerang’s Got Talent competition which is being jointly run by the school along with Nerang State High School and Worongary State Primary School. Congratulations go to principal Rod Kirkland, Steve Bell, Carol Randall, Anne Panitz and all the hard-working staff and volunteers at Nerang State Primary School for making a difference in the lives of their school community. </Hansard-Body>

World Suicide Prevention Day</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151612"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs SMITH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burleigh--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.56 pm): World Suicide Prevention Day is a time to reflect on the fact that each day seven Australians take their own lives, a day to remember that more Australians commit suicide than are killed in car accidents and a day to publicise the fact that suicide is responsible for 25 per cent of all deaths of men aged between 20 and 34. Men over 75 years are also potentially at high risk and Indigenous suicide rates for young males in some remote communities are up to four times higher than comparable non-Indigenous rates. Suicide and self harm both bear huge individual, family, social and economic costs. The latter alone runs to billions of dollars. Conservatively, for every suicide six family members and close friends are left behind. They have to grieve the loss of a loved one and deal with a whirl of emotions and questions such as whether the suicide could have been avoided and whether anyone could have done more. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151613"></A>
Research indicates that the most promising way to prevent suicide and suicidal behaviour is early recognition and treatment of depression, substance abuse and other mental health issues. Improving public knowledge about mental health and suicidal behaviour is an important goal. It may contribute to suicide prevention by changing public recognition and attitudes towards mental illness. It includes promoting awareness that many suicides are preventable.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156533"></A>
Reducing the stigma associated with mental illness, substance abuse and suicide is one of the keys. While we need health services to address suicide prevention, we also need to be able to discuss the issue openly and honestly. We could go a long way to reducing our suicide rate by accepting people as they are and removing the social taboo on talking about feeling suicidal. A person simply talking about how they feel greatly reduces their distress. They also begin to see other options and are less likely to attempt suicide. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156536"></A>
Given the stigma that exists around suicide, it is understandable that more is not being said or written in the media about the issue. Taboo is a powerful force in society and it requires courage to break the silence. There have always been suicides and there always will be. However, if we focus on the issue with the same vigour as we do for problems such as the road toll and cancer, we can make a difference. Governments can fund programs but only societies can wipe away a stigma and talk about how we can best help people who have plumbed the depths. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156538"></A>
As a patron of Care For Life--Suicide Prevention on the Gold Coast, I want to particularly acknowledge Raylee Taylor. She has been a dedicated volunteer for suicide prevention for 16 years and was recently presented with a Premier’s Award for Queensland Seniors. Raylee has overcome the tragedy of losing her own son to suicide to work hard at suicide prevention and assist families to work through their grief of losing loved ones. I admire her strength and her ‘never give up’ approach. I truly believe there are people still with us today due to her unflagging efforts to promote awareness of this issue. We must never give up. Too many people are depending on us. </Hansard-Body>

Road Safety, Warrego Highway; Recycled Water</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156542"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr RICKUSS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lockyer--LNP) (10.00 pm): I rise to say a few words about another accident on the Warrego Highway. This highway continues to have a high accident rate and, unfortunately, much of this is due to pure driver error. The truck that rolled over yesterday was an empty semitrailer. It happened on a section of road that is well marked. The driver just apparently mistook the turn, went to sleep--I do not know. It was pure driver error and he ended up crossing both lanes of the highway. Fortunately, he was only taken to the local hospital so his injuries were not severe. I urge the motorists who are travelling on our highways to take care. As much as millions of dollars will be spent this year on improving the safety of the highway, the motorists do have to take some care themselves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156544"></A>
The other issue I would like to raise as it relates to my local area is recycled water. The recycled water project has been ongoing for something like 15 years now. It really is a travesty that this water is going to waste. It is a bit like the Traveston Dam, unfortunately. This project is complete. It is sitting there at the Wivenhoe Dam with good access to the Lockyer Valley, but the water is not being utilised except for the small amount that is going to two power stations. This is a total waste. It is going to be a cost burden that will be imposed upon the local water bodies. Unfortunately, the whole of the state is paying for it. Surely, it is time that this water was used in industry and agriculture. The only big user of the recycled water project will be the agricultural industry in the Fassifern, Lockyer and Brisbane valleys. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156546"></A>
It is about time this government bit the bullet and actually put this water to good use. It is just atrocious that this pipeline that goes all the way to Wivenhoe Dam--only 20 kilometres from some of the best agricultural land in Queensland--is not being used. I cannot understand how this government can hold its head up and talk about its efficiencies and what it has done for society when this water is just sitting there. The amount of $2 billion has been spent on this water project and none of it is being used. It is a shame. It would actually supplement the fruit and vegetable industries in South-East Queensland, which would make some of these farms much more sustainable. It has to be provided to the farmers at a realistic price. Every pedestal user in South-East Queensland has to realise that they have to subsidise this water because the price that the government is trying to charge the farmers makes it totally unviable. We are helping to clean up the bay. The government cannot leave a $2 billion project sitting idle doing absolutely nothing. I cannot believe this government has put up with this sort of project. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs MILLER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bundamba--ALP) (10.03 pm): Last Friday marked the official opening of the Goodna State School community hall. At a cost of nearly $3 million, it is a top class facility in Goodna. It is not just a hall, but a full-sized basketball court, a canteen, a conference room and a big stage with a top-class lighting and sound system and change rooms out the back. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156553"></A>
Are we proud of our NAPLAN results? We sure are in Goodna. Our students at Goodna State School are on a pathway to academic excellence. That is our aim and we are achieving it. At Goodna we have had big improvements across-the-board but especially in years 5 and 7. Academic excellence is our mantra and with our step into prep, language immersion, playgroup and the oral language project, we are making great inroads into educating our local children. We are not just teaching children. With Bremer TAFE, we are teaching English to their parents three days every week. The Survivor English Program is going great guns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156555"></A>
So Goodna is a school for adults learning literacy, for children and for also the wider community. If you can sing you can join the Goodna community choir based at the school. The choir sings at the school and at civic events and has instilled a great pride into everyone in the Goodna community. Our Pathways to Peace Program, which has been running for several years, continues to be successful year in and year out. You can get a lot of hugs, words of encouragement and a helping hand at Goodna, all with the aim of accessing academic excellence. Everyone is valued at Goodna State School.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156556"></A>
To top it all off, last week Goodna State School was one of the Queensland state schools selected for free eye screening through the One Sight Program. Good eyesight is critical to learning and our community thanks One Sight, the not-for-profit arm of the eye care company that owns OPSM for their professional care of our students throughout the screening process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156559"></A>
I would like to say good on you, Goodna State School. With 615 children enrolled and growing every week and with 20 adults enrolled at the school learning literacy three days a week, we are achieving academic miracles with the support of an excellent principal, Margaret Gurney, our deputy principal, our teachers and ancillary staff, our parents and community members. At Goodna, we are showing the rest of Queensland and Australia how a caring, peaceful community can achieve academic excellence. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind) (10.06 pm): Recently I had the chance to attend the Nambour and District Care Association annual general meeting. This association has been servicing the Nambour and surrounding community for the past 26 years. It currently operates from its own premises in Doolan Street, Nambour. It now receives Home and Community Care funding to support its service. The service was developed to assist people to meet their range of needs to maintain a reasonable quality of life so that people are able to remain living independently in our community, thus preventing the need for them to move into a nursing home or a hospital facility. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156565"></A>
We have a carer support group, which meets regularly, with 27 carers attending during the year. Since last year’s annual general meeting, the workers have provided 45,853 hours of care to 1,623 people on 33,950 occasions. Our day respite centre has had a total of 138 people attending during the past year. Some of these people attend daily and most attend more than one day each week. Of the people who attend the centre, 41 per cent are aged over 85 years and 19 people are aged over 90 years of age and one of our elderly clients is almost 99 years of age. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156566"></A>
Our centre is open for respite services Monday to Friday from 9.30 in the morning to 2 pm and on Thursdays afternoon sessions commence after 2.30 pm. Transport to medical appointments for clients is one of the most frequently requested services. I understand that 611 people were assisted this year on 6,047 occasions. Also, a total of 367 people have been assisted with shopping during the year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156567"></A>
The centre is not solely reliant on Home and Community Care funding and this year the centre raised $9,960 from raffles, $4,391 from unsolicited donations and sales from the gift shop raised just over $700. It received $77,335, which was generated from a collection of fees for services provided and an additional $21,222 has been paid by people who attend our respite centre. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156568"></A>
The home modification service is another service provided by the centre and the centre is used almost every afternoon. There is a great management team which supports our manager. We have great community involvement. I would like to use this opportunity to put on the public record my appreciation of the great services provided by the Nambour and District Care Association. It is truly a commendable service. I would like to take this chance to table for the benefit of all members and especially the minister for communities a copy of its most recent annual report.</Hansard-Body>

Mrs SCOTT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Woodridge--ALP) (10.08 pm): I would like to thank the Premier and her cabinet for a very successful community cabinet meeting held in Logan City on 6 September and for the diverse range of activities held throughout the city, where each of our six state members was able to host an event specific to their electorate. The Hon. Peter Lawlor and I started the day at our Logan City Special School, meeting with Acting Principal Anne Nystrom, P&amp;C Chairman Wayne Ernst, teachers and a number of students. Always eager to meet visitors, the students had beaming smiles. We know that they are going to enjoy their new bus, which will be purchased following a grant from the Gambling Community Benefit Fund. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156615"></A>
While cabinet met at the Logan Entertainment Centre, I joined my colleagues Barbara Stone, Evan Moorhead and a number of Logan City councillors to tour Yarrabilba, one of the chosen sites in South-East Queensland for major development. The CEO of the Urban Land Development Authority, Paul Eagles, was on hand to explain the development, which will give a major boost to jobs in the area and increase the options for housing. I then joined the Premier and the Minister for Transport, Rachel Nolan, for the major announcement of a new bus station for Logan Central which I shall speak about in greater detail at another time. It was then time for all to gather at the magnificent Logan Metro Indoor Sports Centre where in excess of 300 of our Logan community members joined us, with many gaining access to the ministerial area of their choice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156619"></A>
Working dogs are taking on more and more duties. After lunch I joined our primary industries minister, Tim Mulherin, to view the superb abilities of two fire ant detection dogs. Their supersensitive noses can sniff out two small plugs smelling of fire ants buried in a vast paddock. They are a great addition to the team helping to defend our outdoor lifestyle from the blight of fire ants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156620"></A>
The Attorney-General, Cameron Dick, next visited the Logan legal advice service at the Youth and Family Service. This was a great opportunity for staff to acquaint the Attorney-General with the very valuable service they perform, along with our solicitors who give freely of their time, and to approach him about an extension of their services. Finally, I joined the Attorney-General back at my office, where he recognised the huge contribution of two of our long-serving JPs, Brian Cochrane for 25 years and Kelvin Abraham for 40 years. In fact, Kelvin has almost reached his 50 years and I hope to see him recognised, once again, in 2011. Brian and Kelvin were joined by their wives. They have expressed their deep appreciation that the Attorney-General took the time to spend an hour or so chatting over a cup of tea in a very relaxed fashion. They will treasure the memories of that meeting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The minister will get it back. For 1 years the community has been liaising with the Sunshine Coast Regional Council in relation to the Palmview greenfield structural plan that the council had to get developer ready. At a meeting in March 2009, the community put forward numerous suggestions to council. It then released its position paper. Unfortunately, a lot of the major issues that the community wanted addressed were not addressed in the position paper. Council then released another position paper, being the structural plan, and asked for community feedback before it went to the honourable minister. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156631"></A>
The community held another successful meeting with the Sippy Downs and District Community Association where the major issues were highlighted. The council sent that to the state. Once the state had responded, we were advised that the council still did not take on board the major issues in the community. This year the issues were again addressed at a local community meeting with the Sippy Downs and District Community Association. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156632"></A>
The major issues include some form of highway access or service road, the green link that is going to rip through the heart of the Sippy Downs community--obviously, the Sippy Downs community do not want it; they want it rerouted--the sequencing of the development and the upgrading of Claymore Road. I thank the Minister for Main Roads and the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning for sitting down with the community and discussing these issues with them, and giving the commitment that once the final structural plan is received by the state they will certainly look at it and take on board the issues of the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156633"></A>
Unfortunately, council does not hold the same view. Last week council voted on it. We do not know what the council’s current position is. They said they are very happy with it. From the rumour mill I am hearing that the community will not be entirely happy with the result. Tonight I call on the minister to give the Sippy Downs and District Community Association another opportunity to respond. I believe the minister will receive the documents from council on Friday. A 10-day period will follow. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156634"></A>
I never thought I would say this in the chamber, but the minister may be our last hope with respect to getting a community development that is acceptable to the current Sippy Downs community and that addresses the major issues such as the highway access and the green link. If we shove 14,000 people into a development that will negatively impact on Sippy Downs, that will not benefit the Sunshine Coast. </Hansard-Body>

Child Protection</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156637"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms van LITSENBURG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Redcliffe--ALP) (10.14 pm): Last week was Child Protection Week and a time to put the spotlight on the abuse and neglect of children. A child who is nurtured and grows up happy and well adjusted faces the world with confidence. When they start their own family, they bring all those experiences to that challenge. A child who is brought up with abuse and neglect faces the world with fear and mistrust, and often uses alcohol or drugs for confidence or suffers low school achievement or depression. When they come to start life relationships and a family, do they have the tools to do better for their children? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156638"></A>
That is why the Bligh government has made it our priority to enshrine protection for our precious children in legislation and to increase funding to community organisations to prevent neglect and abuse in vulnerable families, and to enable children and families who have suffered abuse to work through the trauma and co-dependency issues and move on with their lives. Those are services that have been changing people’s lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156639"></A>
In Redcliffe, Chameleon Youth Housing, Redcliffe Youth Space, Redcliffe Community Association, church organisations and foster and kinship carers are our front line. The success of the Bligh government’s work to eradicate child abuse is marked by the way the Redcliffe community has begun to act to support vulnerable children. Saint Vinnie’s Give a Child a Chance Foundation hosted 150 people at a fundraising dinner to support children to get a fair go in education. This money means children who would otherwise not have breakfast, lunch, uniforms or school books or be able to attend school excursions will be supported in those areas so they do have a fair chance at a good education. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156640"></A>
The Redcliffe Hospital Foundation held its Child Abuse Awareness Family Fun Day on Sunday with free rides and activities for children. Redcliffe residents came out to play, but they also took away the message. Several families shared how they had turned their lives around because of support from Bligh government funded services. Those are the outcomes of this Labor government partnering with community groups to prevent abuse and to heal the damage done through abuse. This is an important focus of the Toward Q2 plan to build a strong community. Strong communities are built on happy, well-adjusted children in functioning families. Only the Bligh government has increased funding and quality assurance in child protection to ensure good results. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (10.16 pm): This evening I rise to speak on behalf of the residents and frequent users of Worongary Road. We are absolutely appalled that the Minister for Main Roads, Craig Wallace, insisted that the $1.1 million he announced on 7 September was new money and that his department had already spent $1 million on upgrading Worongary Road. Neither the residents nor I can see any sign of where his government has spent that $1 million. If $1 million has been spent already to fix the 0.3-kilometre stretch of road between Uplands Court and Brixton Court then the minister must take the locals for fools. There has been no work done on this section of road since it was first announced in the road implementation plan. This is an absolute outrage and a slap in the face to residents who drive this treacherous road daily.  Either the minister misled parliament in his answer to my question on notice or he misled the media and residents of the Gold Coast last week. A sum of $1 million had already been allocated from the Safer Roads Sooner program to address the 0.3-kilometre stretch of road and was reannounced in the 2008, 2009 and 2010 budgets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156680"></A>
I have been calling for Worongary Road to be ‘demained’ since March 2009. Residents have had enough of the buck-passing and it is time the minister got serious about the safety of motorists along this stretch of road. This road has seen an increase in traffic of over 1,400 cars per day and is a fatality waiting to happen.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156681"></A>
The minister needs to get out of his ivory tower, take a visit to Worongary so he even knows which road he is talking about, meet with the Gold Coast City Council and hand over the road like he said he would 18 months ago. He was in the area only last week but failed to come and see the condition of the road for himself. Instead, he made comments on the road from kilometres away. The minister said on Channel 9 Gold Coast news--</Hansard-Body>

This is extra money on top of that so we have already spent that million dollars we announced in 2008. We spent that all on safety works on the road and the road maintenance.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

If the minister stands by his comments then, by my tally, residents are owed $2.1 million of upgrade for the road instead of filling potholes, which is all that has been done so far. Show me the money, Minister! Worongary residents are sick and tired of this arrogant, out-of-touch, on-the-nose state Labor government. With the Premier promoting ‘Walk a day in my shoes’, I propose that the minister drives a day in the cars of motorists who have to put up with the patchwork quilt that is Worongary Road and which will remain this way until the minister comes good with his promise to demain this dangerous road. </Hansard-Body>

Ms O’NEILL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kallangur--ALP) (10.20 pm): Disability Action Week from 5-11 September celebrates the experiences of people with a disability and aims to raise community awareness of the benefits of building communities where people with a disability can be genuinely and meaningfully included. This year’s Disability Action Week Awards have again recognised those individuals and organisations whose work is directly related to disability, as well as individuals and community organisations that have chosen to include a disability focus within their wider role.</Hansard-Body>

On Tuesday, 7 September I was invited to attend this year’s Disability Action Week’s fabulous function at the convention centre, because an inspirational young man, 19 years old, from Petrie in the beautiful electorate of Kallangur had been named Outstanding Young Achiever in the Queensland-wide awards.</Hansard-Body>

Tristram Peters, described as a wheelchair sports ace, who captains and coaches Queensland’s wheelchair sports teams, is seen as a role model for young people with physical disabilities with whom he engages in his work for support organisation MontroseAccess. He has helped improve the quality of life for many clients by leading and engaging others in physical activity programs. His can-do attitude and independent lifestyle foster confidence, help build self-esteem and motivate his peers with a disability.</Hansard-Body>

Apart from his wheelchair sport prowess, Tristram promotes MontroseAccess’s Walk with Me event, mentors people in wheelchair skills and physical activities, and is a hydrotherapy facilitator. He works tirelessly to encourage others to engage in activities and healthy behaviour and participate in community activities, especially through local PCYCs.</Hansard-Body>

Tristram was presented with his award by disability services minister Annastacia Palaszczuk, who kindly arranged for me to be present on stage to congratulate him. His proud parents were there to see him collect his award. Tristram told me he was a bit embarrassed by all the fuss. Like most local heroes, he did not seem to think he was anything too special. The decor for the event was reminiscent of a high-end night club, complete with butterfly lights and fantastic table decorations. The stories of all the recipients were inspirational, and the commitment of the organisations represented was outstanding.</Hansard-Body>

I was pleased to attend and felt very fortunate indeed to have the opportunity to be there. One of the highlights was that I had the pleasure to see my first ever signing choir. Rockhampton’s Crescent Lagoon State School signing choir performed three songs<Hansard-Italic>
--We are Australian</Hansard-Italic>
, <Hansard-Italic>
Speaking Hands Listening Eyes</Hansard-Italic>
 and <Hansard-Italic>
Eagle Rock</Hansard-Italic>
. The skill of the choir and the joy on the faces was awe-inspiring, and they received resounding applause. Some of us in the audience may have joined in during <Hansard-Italic>
Eagle Rock</Hansard-Italic>
. We were also very lucky to see the Western Suburbs Special School choir perform several songs, and I would say that after <Hansard-Italic>
Lean on Me</Hansard-Italic>
 there was not a dry eye in the house.</Hansard-Body>
