Alleged Attempted Deliberate Misleading of the House by a Minister</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr GIBSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gympie--LNP) (9.32 am): Mr Speaker, on 20 July during the hearing of Estimates Committee E, the consideration of the portfolio of Infrastructure and Planning, there was an incident that goes right to the heart of government accountability and transparency. At approximately 6.25 pm the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning was offered the opportunity to table documents by the chair of the committee, which he accepted and leave was granted. However, before the documents were tabled it became clear that the minister was instructing a public servant to alter the document. I am confident that an examination of the video footage by you will clearly reveal the alleged actions of the minister. Were it not for the swift action of committee members, and in particular the chair, in directing the minister to table the document unaltered we may have seen a contempt of the estimates committee process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998507"></A>
It appears the intent of the minister was to deny the committee information contained in that document. To date, the minister has made no attempt to explain his actions to the parliament. It may simply be that the minister is inexperienced in what the requirements of tabling the document involved. However, the motive behind such an attempted action displays a serious breach of the conventions of parliament. I will be writing to you to ask you to investigate the matter further to determine if referring this matter to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee for investigation is required. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, I refer to a matter of privilege raised by the honourable the Leader of the Opposition in this House on Wednesday, 9 June 2010 regarding the administration of the budget of the office of the opposition, particularly the oversight of expenditure on advertising. I subsequently received from the honourable member correspondence regarding the matter. I also sought information from the Premier regarding this matter pursuant to standing order 269(5). For the benefit of the record, I table the correspondence received in relation to this matter.</Hansard-Body>

 Letter, dated 9 June 2010, from the Leader of the Opposition to the Speaker regarding the matter of privilege raised by the Leader of the Opposition in the parliament on Wednesday, 9 June 2010 noting a comment by Commissioner Fitzgerald. </Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998670"></A>
Essentially, this matter involves the administration of the budget and expenditure of the office of the opposition. I do not believe that it has been established that the issue of the administration of expenditure has given rise to any basis for believing that the rights and immunities of any member of this House, as a member of this House or a committee of this House, have been affected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998679"></A>
As I have concluded that there is no matter of privilege arising I will not be referring the matter to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.40 am): The Gold Coast Rapid Transit project will transform the Gold Coast. It will not only generate more than 6,000 jobs; it will change the way that people move around this great city. When trains start using the new light rail line in 2014 it will make the Gold Coast an even more attractive place to live, work and play and as a destination for tourists.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002529"></A>
It was a great pleasure on Sunday to be joined by the federal minister, Joe Ludwig, Minister Nolan and Mayor Ron Clarke as I turned the first sod on this $949 million project. Preliminary works have started on the Gold Coast University Hospital station. This will be the first station in this new project. It will be located at the new hospital that has been built co-located with Griffith University. In that year Griffith University is on track to reach more than 20,000 students. It is a major Gold Coast destination and trip generator. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002530"></A>
Over the next few weeks locals will start to see this project coming to life as excavators and bulldozers begin the heavy duty work of constructing the station’s shell. This will be a busy station with forecasts of about 7,000 passenger movements per day by 2016. Stage 2 of the light rail project involves appointing an operator franchise and we are currently assessing a short list of three consortia and expect to make that decision and announcement in March next year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002531"></A>
This project has been made possible because of a three-way partnership between the three levels of government. It has seen a financial investment by a Commonwealth government that wants to build the nation; it has seen the Gold Coast City Council make a contribution of $120 million--no mean feat for a council--and the state government put in the lion’s share. It is a perfect example of all three levels of government coming together to make the funds that they have go further for the people they represent. This is a model that works and one which we are now seeing applied in relation to the Redcliffe rail line. I look forward to giving the House more construction updates as this project progresses. </Hansard-Body>

Integrity and Accountability Reforms</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002534"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.42 am): Our government is continuing to deliver the most significant integrity and accountability reforms in Queensland in a generation. Today we continue to deliver on the promise we made to keep Queensland at the forefront of open and transparent government in Australia. This week the government is introducing the second phase of its integrity and accountability reforms, building upon the reforms introduced in last year’s Integrity Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002535"></A>
The integrity reform bills which I will introduce into the House later today are part of our continued commitment to the highest standards of integrity, accountability and transparency in government. The bills introduce significant reforms, including an overhaul of whistleblower protection legislation. Our new Public Interest Disclosure Bill will, for the first time, provide protection for disclosures to the media in certain circumstances. We want to make sure that if legitimate concerns are raised and then not treated seriously there will be circumstances where providing information to the media is in the public interest and this new bill recognises that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002536"></A>
We hope that the need for these provisions never arises, but they will be there if the need does arise. This bill implements strong requirements to ensure public interest disclosures are dealt with appropriately within government. These amendments will provide an additional safety net to ensure serious issues are exposed so they can be rectified as quickly as possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002537"></A>
Queensland will be only the second jurisdiction in Australia to put this important protection in legislation. In addition, the Public Interest Disclosure Bill will introduce a new external oversight for public interest disclosures and new minimum standards for dealing with these disclosures. Other reforms in the suite of bills I will introduce today include establishing a strong and clear legislative framework to govern ministerial staff employment arrangements, to establish a single code of conduct for the Public Service, to enhance the role of the Public Service Commission in promoting an ethical Public Service culture and continuing the expansion of our disciplinary regime to ensure that it applies to public servants even after they leave the government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002538"></A>
Our reforms continue to deliver a strong, clear message that this government expects everybody in public office to uphold the highest standards of integrity and accountability. These extensive reforms ensure that Queensland’s system of integrity and accountability is strong, transparent and one of the most stringent in Australia. This is not the end of the process, however. We will continue to keep driving reform on issues related to these matters, including reform of the political donations regime in Queensland, and members will see that proceed over the next couple of months. </Hansard-Body>

Regional Sitting of Parliament, Mackay</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002541"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.45 am): I am pleased to advise the House that next year Mackay will become only the fourth regional city in the state’s history to host a meeting of the Queensland parliament. I can confirm that the Queensland parliament will sit in Mackay on 24, 25 and 26 May 2011. I am urging people in the region to save a day in May to come along and see democracy in action. There will be a week of events, including a state reception, a play for children explaining how parliament works and an evening question time. This is an opportunity for locals, particularly school students, to see the cut and thrust of parliament and watch laws being debated and passed without having to travel to Brisbane. The Mackay Entertainment and Convention Centre will be the venue for the regional sitting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002542"></A>
It was not possible to consider Mackay for one of these sittings in the past because it simply lacked a venue of sufficient size to hold a full sitting of the parliament. It is because of our government’s investment in a significant expansion of the Mackay convention centre that it can host not only this event but, perhaps more importantly sometimes for the locals, some great entertainment acts that simply would not have come to town. We might be classed as entertainment, Mr Speaker. Let us see how we go. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002543"></A>
I understand that Mr Speaker and the Clerk will be travelling to Mackay on 9 August to assess logistics and to encourage locals to attend next year’s historic sitting. Taking parliament out to our regions to the people that we all represent is a very important initiative and I trust that all members will fully support this worthwhile exercise and ensure that it is just as useful for the people of Mackay as it has been in the other regions that we have travelled to. </Hansard-Body>

Federal Election, Use of Queensland Government Facilities</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002546"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.47 am): As members know, we are now in the full swing of a federal election campaign. No doubt there will be occasions during this period when political candidates request the use of Queensland government facilities. These requests can range from holding media conferences or functions to conducting political advertising and other electioneering activities. It is critical during this period that the impartiality of the Queensland Public Service is assured. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002547"></A>
Accordingly, I have approved a set of guiding principles for the use of state government facilities in the lead up to and during the federal election. These principles aim to ensure that a consistent and impartial approach is adopted by the Queensland Public Service during the election period. The principles ensure that electioneering activity can occur at a reasonable level but that it does not disrupt the day-to-day service provision of facilities and that access to facilities has an appropriate level of approval. My government is committed to upholding the integrity of the Public Service. These principles make it clear that electioneering activity must not engage public servants in political dialogue or partisan activity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002548"></A>
On 19 July the director-general of my department forwarded these principles to chief executive officers across the Queensland government to be made available to Queensland public sector officers. This makes good on the commitment I gave to the House during the last federal election. I will table a copy of these principles for the information of the House when I receive them. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (9.49 am): One month ago the Premier and I detailed the government’s response to the report of the Auditor-General on the implementation of Queensland Health’s new payroll system. The government accepted all of the Auditor-General’s recommendations, including that Queensland Health continue the steps it had already taken to stabilise and improve the system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002588"></A>
But we did not stop there. The government announced a plan that went beyond implementing the Auditor-General’s recommendations. We have taken steps under the government’s contract with IBM to hold that company accountable for its performance. We are running the ruler over the payroll applications to ensure the most appropriate software has been chosen for Queensland Health’s needs. We have engaged a review of the shared services delivery model, including the ongoing role of CorpTech. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002590"></A>
We are strengthening Corporate Services in Queensland Health with new personnel and a new structure under the interim leadership of Deputy Director-General, Michael Walsh. We will move to remake the payroll structure by creating a regionalised structure. By the end of September, we will have a dedicated pay hub to service every hospital. In doing so, we will create two new local pay hubs: in Mackay and on the Gold Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002591"></A>
It has been one month since that announcement was made and good progress has been made towards delivering the model. We have established a new, direct, regionalised support service for staff who are experiencing problems with their pay. The pay hotline is successfully providing advice to hundreds of employees on matters ranging from underpays through to tax and superannuation queries. As part of the new regionalised model, Queensland Health staff can now make appointments with payroll hub staff to go over their documentation and work through any complex issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002592"></A>
Feedback from staff from pilot initiatives in southern Brisbane was extremely positive and the features of the model, tailored to the needs of each district, are now being rolled out across the state. The new regionalised model pay system is also progressing well. Pilots have been trialled in Brisbane and Townsville and consultation with staff and unions on details of the model has been very constructive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002593"></A>
I cannot emphasise strongly enough how important that consultation process is. Queensland Health let down staff previously by not consulting them properly on the new system. I am advised that the consultation is proceeding well and that reclassification of positions within payroll hubs is being undertaken to better reflect staff roles in the new model. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002594"></A>
One month after we began implementing the regional model, last Wednesday’s payday was the most stable and accurate since at least March. The number of casual staff and new starters whose pay was not processed in time for payday, I am advised, was down by over 40 per cent on the previous cycle. The number of outstanding adjustments is less than half what it was only eight weeks ago. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005238"></A>
There is still work to be done to deliver the world-class pay system that Queensland Health staff deserve, but one month after the new regionalised model was announced, the results are very promising. </Hansard-Body>

Mount Isa, Lead Levels</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005240"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (9.51 am): I refer to media reports yesterday about an editorial in <Hansard-Italic>
The Medical Journal of Australia</Hansard-Italic>
 about lead levels in children in Mount Isa. This is not a new study but, essentially, a summary of claims written from a particular perspective on the matter. The government is committed to working with the community and Xstrata to address lead exposure issues in the Mount Isa area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002599"></A>
We are not standing still when it comes to monitoring and managing lead exposure in Mount Isa. Our whole-of-government approach has been comprehensive but has essentially consisted of three key steps: public education about living safely with lead in Mount Isa; tighter regulation of Mount Isa mines to reduce emissions; and greater and more transparent monitoring of air quality.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002600"></A>
Lead occurs naturally in the environment as well as being released from mining lead and other metals and, previously, from lead in petrol. Exposure to lead occurs through ingestion, inhalation of dust and air contaminated by lead. Children play in dirt and hand-to-mouth behaviour causes ingestion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002601"></A>
Mining in Mount Isa began in 1924 and full-scale production was reached in 1931. Queensland Health undertakes active and passive surveillance of children’s blood lead levels, case management of children with elevated blood lead levels and the promotion of behaviours that reduce risk. Queensland Health, with community partners and Living with Lead Alliance, chaired by Betty Kiernan MP, member for Mount Isa, continues to develop and implement community strategies aimed at reducing exposure to environmental lead. The 2007 Blood Lead Survey tested 400 children in Mount Isa and found that 11 per cent, or 45 children, exceeded the guideline value of 10 micrograms per decilitre endorsed by health authorities including the WHO. All children with blood lead levels exceeding guideline values are closely case managed--providing advice to parents and guardians to manage children’s exposure, conducting detailed environmental and social audits including soil and paint sampling if needed and follow-up testing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002603"></A>
The follow-up survey, the 2010 Mount Isa Blood Lead Survey, commenced on 20 February 2010 and is ongoing. The survey will test the blood of 144 Mount Isa children aged between one and four. To date, 136 children have been tested as part of the second survey. Of these children, seven, that is 5.1 per cent, have tested in excess of the notifiable level. That is still 5.1 per cent too many; we want to have a level of nil. These children are now being case managed. There are numerous factors, however, that may influence a child’s exposure including the nature of the environment to which they are exposed at home and at play. Residents should reduce dust in and around the home, wash hands before eating and maintain a balanced diet. Free screening is available to all residents of Mount Isa through QML with Xstrata meeting the costs of this service. The Queensland government is taking this matter very seriously. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (9.54 am): As the Reserve Bank board convenes today to determine the official interest rate setting, there is a clear-cut case for them to pause and stay on the sidelines. Recent data confirms a recovery is underway. However, we are far from home and hosed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002609"></A>
Inflation nationally last week surprised on the downside. In Queensland, the CPI eased to 2.7 per cent for the 2009-10 financial year in line with budget estimates. The global growth question remains central to our state. As a trade exposed economy what happens beyond our doorstep matters just as much as what happens on the domestic front.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002610"></A>
While much commentary has been advanced in recent times, the data tells the real story. We have now seen 11 straight months of jobs growth including the last three months of nation-leading jobs growth. That is why we are closing in on our target of 100,000 net new jobs this term. The policies we have put in place are delivering--and the official data tells the real story.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002611"></A>
Today the detailed State Accounts for the March quarter are released. I table a copy for the benefit of members of the House. Queensland is the only state to record such detailed state level accounts, similar to the National Accounts prepared by the ABS. The Queensland Office of Economic and Statistical Research prepares these documents.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002613"></A>
The accounts record that the Queensland economy grew by 0.9 per cent in the quarter, to deliver 2.6 per cent trend growth to the year ending in the March quarter. As members will recall, the financial year result estimated in the budget papers was for growth to strengthen to three per cent in 2009-10. This result would be ahead of the estimated national growth rate in the Commonwealth Economic Statement of 2 per cent. Once again, our economy is out in front of the national economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002614"></A>
Drilling down into the accounts provides a data-based read on activity in the economy. Public final demand, including investment through our capital program, is driving state growth, contributing 0.6 percentage points of the 0.9 per cent trend growth in GSP in the March quarter 2010. Private investment remains challenged, particularly by credit conditions. There is a role here for banks to support the recovery and not constrict it. That makes our building program absolutely vital. It is delivering growth and delivering jobs, just like we said it would. Just as importantly, the accounts show positive growth in household consumption and dwelling investment rising for the third consecutive quarter, while trade provided a neutral contribution in part because the jury is out on the global growth equation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002615"></A>
The fact is that questions remain and the risks remain. A confidence rebuild is underway--but the task is far from complete. The market expects rates to remain on hold--and they should. The market wants to see governments with policies to support growth, which we have. No-one benefits from the opposition’s garrulous schadenfreude, delighting in talking down the Queensland economy for base political motives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002617"></A>
These remain challenging times--and that requires governments with leadership and a policy plan. That is what this government is providing in spades: jobs generating growth including nation-leading, jobs-generating growth for the last three months, positive economic growth--out in front of the nation--and an economic reform agenda for the future. I commend the State Accounts to the House and to anyone looking for the data, not the hyperbole. </Hansard-Body>

Sentencing Reforms</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002621"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (9.57 am): The Bligh government is in the midst of delivering a significant reform program to modernise our state’s legal system, and another major milestone will be reached later today. That is when the government will introduce legislative changes that will strengthen Queensland’s criminal justice sentencing framework.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002623"></A>
The bill I will introduce to the parliament today will create the state’s first sentencing advisory council and will create a power for the Court of Appeal to deliver and review guideline judgements. Our changes to sentencing will go further, with amendments to the Penalties and Sentences Act that further reflect the Bligh government’s tough-on-crime approach. Firstly, adults convicted of sexual offences against children under 16 years of age will have to serve an actual term of imprisonment, unless there are exceptional circumstances. These reforms recognise the seriousness of any form of indecent treatment of a child by an adult and reflect the potentially devastating consequences for young victims. Adults convicted of these types of offences can expect to do jail time. That is what the community expects and that is what should happen.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002625"></A>
Secondly, courts will also be required to treat the age of a child victim as an aggravating factor in violent crimes against children when considering whether a serious violent offender declaration should be made. This will require judges to recognise the disproportionate power of an adult over a young child and the much lower level of force needed to cause serious injury. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002662"></A>
Finally, the new provisions will target offenders who repeatedly break the law by enshrining the principle that judges and magistrates must treat each relevant previous conviction as an aggravating factor when determining penalties. These reforms make it crystal clear that the community expects offenders to be punished appropriately for their crimes. They strike the right balance between judicial discretion and a sentencing regime that reflects both the community’s and the government’s expectations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002663"></A>
Some extraordinary claims have been made since yesterday’s announcement, particularly in relation to exceptional circumstances, which demonstrate a wilful and deliberate ignorance of how our criminal justice system works. The inclusion of the exceptional circumstances provision is important. While it is difficult, if not impossible, to envisage circumstances in which a violent sexual offender might satisfy such a provision and in doing so not be sentenced to an actual term of imprisonment, there may be some offences that will be caught by this provision that involve circumstances that warrant further careful consideration by a court, for example, where a 17-year-old and a 15-year-old are in a consensual relationship. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002664"></A>
The law must be capable of providing a just and appropriate sentence based upon all the facts in a case, most notably where those facts are unusual and differ from more straightforward examples. The fact remains that there are aspects of our criminal justice system that are difficult and complex, and our criminal justice system must be capable of a higher level of debate than the sort of sound bites and sloganeering that the members opposite regularly engage in. The reforms to be introduced today by the Bligh government are yet another example of our commitment to protecting the Queensland community and ensuring criminals are sent to jail. </Hansard-Body>

 (Ashgrove--ALP) (Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability) (10.01 am): It is great to be back. In June, I joined the Premier on North Stradbroke Island to announce our government’s vision for the future of the island. It is a vision that will deliver a sustainable and prosperous future for the island’s people and the environment. We will end mining on North Stradbroke Island by 2027 and turn more than 80 per cent of the island into national park, with 50 per cent to be protected by the end of next year. We want to transition the island community from unsustainable jobs in mining to jobs in ecotourism that give locals a long-term future while protecting the environmental values of this iconic natural asset. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002671"></A>
This is a big vision for real change on North Stradbroke Island. That is why yesterday I was disappointed to read Mike O’Connor’s article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
, which stated that the government was going to allow mining to continue until all the resources are gone. I am advised that there are at least another 200 years worth of resources that could be mined on North Straddie. Our government’s decision means that mining operations will wind up some 180 years before the mining resources are exhausted. However, we are not going to shut down an industry overnight. We have committed to work with the mining company, the community and other stakeholders before legislation is passed to ensure a certain timetable for the future. This consultation is not only fair, but is also about transitioning the community. I reject Mr O’Connor’s suggestion that the government has a ‘cosy relationship’ with the mining company on Stradbroke, given the fact that the government is currently prosecuting the company on the island for serious offences under the Integrated Planning Act and the Environmental Protection Act.</Hansard-Body>

 I take that interjection from the honourable minister. Our government is committed to doing the right thing for the future of North Stradbroke Island and its people. We know that delivering the kind of vision for Stradbroke that we want to see will protect it for the future. We need the support of the local community and, importantly, we also need the support of the traditional owners, the Quandamooka people. We already have an in-principle agreement to develop an Indigenous land use agreement. I am pleased to be part of a government that is taking this big step forward to protect the future of an iconic part of Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002675"></A>
However, while we have laid out a vision for the future and drawn a line in the sand, the LNP has simply stuck its head in it. As usual, it cannot figure out where it stands. On the day we made this announcement, the member for Clayfield welcomed the protection of the island while the member for Cleveland called for mining to continue indefinitely. The LNP is lost with no ideas for the future. Its environmental record is about as flimsy as Tony Abbott’s record when it comes to the protection of workers’ rights in Australia. </Hansard-Body>

Building Services Authority, Review</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002678"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (10.03 am): On 19 May in this House I announced that I would institute a review of the Building Services Authority. On 9 July the board of the BSA took the decision to appoint KPMG to conduct the review, which then commenced on 19 July. Today I can also announce the release of a discussion paper on the review of the Building and Construction Industry Payments Act 2004. I instituted this second review as a result of representation from the Queensland Master Builders Association. Both of those reviews are very timely given that the last review of the BSA was five years ago and the BCIPA was introduced in 2004. I encourage all members to participate in the reviews and seek submissions from their constituents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002680"></A>
In my view, the BSA does a very good job in regulating the industry and managing the unique statutory insurance scheme. I believe the bipartisan approach, which has seen every piece of legislation passed unanimously through this parliament in the past decade, has contributed to the community confidence and solid legislation that has underpinned the BSA. I particularly mention the diligence and sincere contribution of the former shadow minister, the member for Mermaid Beach, who is particularly interested in the area of consumer protection. I thank him for that contribution, as a result of which the insurance scheme was amended. I table the terms of reference for the BSA review, which includes a full organisational review and an examination of future demand for services, current and future funding, and impacts of national and state reforms.</Hansard-Body>

I note that on 22 July, a month after I advised the House of the impending review, the shadow minister decided to politicise the issue of building services reform. Fair enough, I say.

Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission Report</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002697"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (10.07 am): The final report of the 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission was released in Melbourne on Saturday. Tragically, 173 people lost their lives during the Black Saturday bushfires on 7 February 2009, making the event one of the worst natural disasters in Australia’s history. While Queensland’s environment and bushfire risk is different from that of Victoria, the Bligh government and the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service are comprehensively reviewing the report’s 67 recommendations. It is important that we take every opportunity to learn from natural disasters in an effort to mitigate the potential for similar destructive events to occur in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046805"></A>
The report’s 67 recommendations are grouped into nine categories ranging from bushfire safety policies to emergency and incident management, land and fuel management, the causes of fires, and planning. Importantly, the commission concluded that the central principles of the ‘stay or go’ policy remain sound. However, it noted that there needed to be greater emphasis on the important qualifications that leaving early is always the safest option and that in less severe fires staying to defend a well-prepared defendable home is also a sound choice. These principles are important elements of Queensland’s current Prepare.Act.Survive policy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046806"></A>
Actions already taken by the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service in response to the commission’s interim findings and reports include: testing and implementation of the emergency alert warning system; development of standard protocols about the content and broadcast of warnings; signing of a memorandum of understanding with Commercial Radio Australia to complement and extend our existing emergency information broadcast agreement with ABC Radio; enhanced support for rural fire volunteers; adoption of a nationally consistent six-category fire severity rating scale; and identification of locations to act as Neighbourhood Safer Places to be used as places of last resort in the event of an emergency.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005342"></A>
August traditionally marks the start of the bushfire season in Queensland, and the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service has been proactive in preparing for this year’s season. Additionally, over the past five years, Labor governments have increased funding for the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service’s rural operations by 84 per cent to $31.7 million this financial year. This increase in funding has allowed for a renewal of rural firefighting vehicles, a boost in support staff and training, and the supply--at no cost to brigades--of personal protective equipment for volunteers. An ongoing commitment to training and equipment enhancement, coupled with the learnings from previous bushfires, will ensure Queensland is well prepared for this year’s bushfire season. </Hansard-Body>

Vocational Education and Training</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. GJ WILSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (10.11 am): The state government is committed to a vocational education and training system that delivers for Queensland students and employers. That is why we have commissioned an independent review of vocational education and training delivery in Queensland to prepare the sector for the next cycle of strong economic growth. The review is timely in light of ongoing national reforms to vocational education and training and the higher education sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005347"></A>
The recovery of the Queensland economy is well underway, with the resources sector continuing to grow strongly and a raft of new industries also emerging. It is critical that vocational education and training and higher education is able to fully respond to the learning and skilling needs of industry and individuals, particularly in regional Queensland, over the coming decade. We need to make sure that those who provide the training on the ground--TAFEs, private training organisations and universities--are fully geared up to deliver the training that experts, industry, employers and unions tell us we need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005348"></A>
The review will provide advice to the Queensland government on performance of the current system and recommend ways to improve it to ensure that the delivery on the ground of training is meeting the needs of students and industry. Key to this process will be a review of vocational education and training delivery in the TAFE sector to further improve the flexibility and responsiveness of the public training provider. TAFE will continue to be the central provider of publicly funded training. The government wants to ensure that TAFE is in the box seat to provide the skills needed by employers over the next decade. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005350"></A>
The review is being led by Mr Peter Noonan, a consultant and researcher who has played a major role in the shaping of post-secondary education and training reforms in Australia and internationally over the last 25 years. Mr Noonan has extensive experience and knowledge of these sectors in Queensland and other jurisdictions and is well placed to undertake the review. TAFE institutes, universities, private sector training, unions, employer associations and relevant agencies will be consulted as part of the review. This important work will complement the work being undertaken to set up the Queensland Skills Commission. Across government, a steering committee has also been established to oversee the training delivery review, with recommendations to government for consideration in late 2010. </Hansard-Body>

 (Thuringowa--ALP) (Minister for Main Roads) (10.14 am): Mr Speaker, we have been on a roll in Main Roads. We are delivering better roads for Queenslanders. We have opened the Townsville Ring Road, the Mulgrave River Bridge in the Far North, the Bundaberg Ring Road, the Hospital Bridge in Mackay, the new Sir Leo Hielscher Bridge, the Ted Smout Memorial Bridge, the Endeavour River Bridge in the Far North. Labor is building Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005362"></A>
It is time for another road trip, Mr Speaker. On the Gold Coast we are spending more than $370 million and delivering more than 3,000 jobs; in Brisbane, more than $1.25 billion and around 9,500 jobs; on the Sunshine Coast, around $250 million and more than 2,000 jobs; on the Darling Downs, more than $100 million and in excess of 950 jobs. Let us head out to the south-west, where we are spending $58 million and that means more than 500 jobs; in the Wide Bay-Burnett, more than $600 million and 4,700 jobs as a result of our roads program; in the mighty Fitzroy, more than $160 million and more than 1,400 jobs; in the central west, more than $60 million and that means 550 jobs; in the beautiful Mackay-Whitsunday region, where parliament is going to sit next year, more than $145 million and 1,200 jobs. </Hansard-Body>

 I take the interjection of the member for Whitsunday. She knows the importance of better local roads and better jobs in her community. In my neck of the woods, in the north, we are spending more than $170 million and that means 1,600 jobs for local road workers. In the north-west, in Betty Kiernan country, we are spending $80 million plus and that means 950 jobs. In the Far North--that growing region of the state--we are spending more than $370 million and that means 2,200 jobs. And this is at a time when Cairns needs jobs more than ever before.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005365"></A>
Mr Speaker, we are building more than roads; we are building on the economic strength of regional Queensland, building stronger economies for the people who live and work in the regions and we are delivering a road network that is second to none. How have we been able to deliver all of this? We had a plan and we stuck to it like glue. We made the tough decisions so that we could deliver the road infrastructure needed to take Queenslanders into the future--to build a first-class road network, to ease congestion, to slash travel times and to make life better for motorists no matter where they live in our great state. </Hansard-Body>

Biosecurity Bill 2010, Exposure Draft</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005368"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. TS MULHERIN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland) (10.17 am): I am pleased to announce the first stage of targeted stakeholder consultation on the Biosecurity Bill 2010. The Biosecurity Bill 2010 will be the most sophisticated and advanced piece of biosecurity legislation in Australia. We are seeking further input from stakeholders on the exposure draft to ensure its maximum benefit for the industry and the community. The bill will replace a number of pieces of existing legislation so that biosecurity incidents can be responded to in a more efficient manner. The amount of $3.5 million was allocated in the 2010-11 state budget to finalise the development of the comprehensive new legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005369"></A>
Queensland is the front-line state for biosecurity in Australia. The state’s agricultural sector is worth around $12.5 billion per year, with around $6 billion of this production exported overseas. Without good biosecurity, Queensland and Australia risks losing access to these critical markets which are vital to the Queensland economy. That is why Biosecurity Queensland has recognised the need for a single, cohesive biosecurity act. Stakeholders and interest groups are being invited to provide feedback on the exposure draft to gain a better understanding of how industries’ biosecurity needs can be addressed within a single act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005370"></A>
For many years, Queensland’s biosecurity legislation has operated using a number of separate acts and regulations. The new legislation will have a broad focus on prevention and management of biosecurity risks in a modern environment. This will provide a flexible legislative framework to allow the government to respond effectively to any biosecurity threat across any number of environments. We will no longer be required to rely on different pieces of legislation depending on whether the threat was marine or land based, or whether it is a livestock or plant related risk. It will be designed to suit a client focused approach to delivering biosecurity services with less red tape and aligned to biosecurity risks. By mid-2011 a complete biosecurity exposure bill will be available for general consultation before a finalised bill will be introduced into parliament. </Hansard-Body>

Remote Indigenous Land and Infrastructure Program Office</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. D BOYLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships) (10.20 am): The Remote Indigenous Land and Infrastructure Program Office has been open for just over a year and during that time its pedal has been firmly on the metal. Critical to getting building underway in the discrete communities is sorting out land issues. There is survey work happening right now on the ground in Aurukun, Doomadgee, Hope Vale, Kowanyama, Mornington Island, Yarrabah and Palm Island. Survey contractors have been engaged for Lockhart River and Wujal Wujal, with workers expected this month in Cherbourg, Napranum, Mapoon, Pormpuraaw and Woorabinda, as well as in the northern peninsula communities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008094"></A>
These projects are vital to providing the housing that is so essential to these communities and that is so in demand. Through the development of township-wide ILUAs this will allow these communities for the first time ever to have town planning schemes. This will mean communities can better plan for roads and houses and for business and resolve long-standing boundary issues. The 2010-11 budget includes $7.25 million to ensure this groundbreaking work continues.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008097"></A>
What is more we already have major runs on the board. By 30 June 2010 the program office had completed land infrastructure plans for all 16 Indigenous local government areas across Queensland. By the beginning of July 46 new houses had been built and by the end of August that figure will rise to 83. The houses, however, must be connected to essential community infrastructure including water, sewerage and electricity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008098"></A>
A matching infrastructure budget is essential. I am proud the Bligh government has allocated $67 million. Heaven knows what would happen under Tony Abbott. His announcement during this election campaign has been that he will slash the infrastructure fund for Queensland. By contrast, round 2 of the federal Labor government’s Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program saw $16.8 million going to Queensland last year. Amongst those to receive this vital funding were Aurukun, Cherbourg, Doomadgee, Hope Vale, Kowanyama, Lockhart, Mapoon, Mornington, Napranum, the Northern Peninsula Area Regional Council, Palm Island, Pormpuraaw, Torres Shire Council, Torres Strait Island Regional Council, Woorabinda, Wujal Wujal and Yarrabah. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.22 am): In March the Bligh government held the Queensland Growth Management Summit to address population growth throughout the state. At the summit Queenslanders spoke and we listened. As a result, the Bligh government has identified and is implementing new policies and initiatives to build the regions and take pressure off the state’s south-east.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008108"></A>
In the four months since the summit, the Bligh government has delivered eight regionalisation forums in Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Toowoomba, Rockhampton, Gladstone, Bundaberg and Mount Isa to discuss growth while protecting lifestyle and landscape; declared six urban development areas to provide affordable housing outside the south-east in Mackay, Townsville, Gladstone, Roma, Blackwater and Moranbah; announced three new communities to relieve pressure on South-East Queensland and deliver some 100,000 new dwellings; dedicated 57 per cent of this financial year’s $17.1 billion capital works budget outside the south-east; and progressed transit oriented developments to allow residents to live, work and play closer to the Brisbane CBD, including the UDA at Woolloongabba.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008110"></A>
We also welcome the federal Labor’s commitment to provide some $200 million to boost affordable housing in regional cities and relieve pressure from ever-growing urban centres. People continue to move to Queensland. They move to Queensland because of our strong economy, our great lifestyle and our enviable environment. But this growth needs direction. The Bligh government will continue to reduce stress on the south-east by building our regions. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. RG NOLAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport) (10.23 am): The Bligh Labor government has a strong and demonstrated commitment to public transport infrastructure. We are building busways, railways, more buses and more trains. And now, working with the Gillard Labor government, we are delivering public transport to growing communities in South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008117"></A>
Last week the Prime Minister, the Premier and the Mayor of Moreton Bay Regional Council announced an historic partnership to build the Moreton Bay rail link. After 115 years, Labor governments working together will make the $1.1 billion rail line to Redcliffe a reality. There have been lots of promises on this project by oppositions and failed candidates. But never before have three levels of government, in government, stood together and put real money on the table to make it happen.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008118"></A>
The Moreton Bay rail link will be a 12.6-kilometre dual-track connection from Petrie, on the North Coast Line, through to Redcliffe. It will include six new stations at Kallangur, Murrumba Downs, Mango Hill or North Lakes, Kinsellas Road, Rothwell and Kippa-Ring. Detailed planning, consultation, environmental assessment, geotechnical and design work will now be undertaken, with construction starting in 2012 and with completion by 2016. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008119"></A>
We know the time for this project has come. The Moreton Bay region is home to 360,000 people. By 2031, it will house over half a million. Every day, 54 per cent of people in the region leave the area for work, and 87 per cent of them use their car. This is not sustainable, and it is putting pressure on key roads, especially the Bruce Highway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008120"></A>
The Moreton Bay rail link will change all this. It will deliver an express train to the city in about 45 minutes. It now takes well over an hour to drive in the peak. Every full train takes over 600 cars off the road and cuts carbon emissions. Delivery of this project will enable the council to plan sustainable, transit oriented development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008121"></A>
It will also take pressure off the family budget. Public transport is cheaper than owning and operating a car. There will be no need for the second car that many locals currently find essential. This is a project in the best Labor traditions. A public transport project that will deliver sustainable, affordable transport for a new, growing community. It will be Labor governments working together that will build it. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. PJ LAWLOR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southport--ALP) (Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading) (10.26 am): I am pleased to announce that a recent Tourism Queensland campaign which encouraged grown-ups to unleash their inner child and splash out on Gold Coast holiday attractions at kids prices has increased overall sales by 29 per cent. The campaign ran for five weeks on national television, radio, print and online. It was a $580,000 investment from the Bligh government to protect tourism jobs and deliver on our promise to support the tourism industry through the good times and the bad. Our partners in the campaign were Tourism Queensland, Gold Coast Tourism, Flight Centre and Infinity Holidays. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008127"></A>
The Gold Coast Grown Up Deals campaign promoted a range of specials on the Gold Coast designed to entice people to rediscover the region. Approximately 50 tourism operators were involved in the campaign, which offered kids prices for Gold Coast attractions and accommodation deals, such as free nights. Some of the operators involved included Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, Q Deck, Dreamworld, Paradise Jetboating, Morning Whale Watch and a host of accommodation hotels and resorts. This is real support to the tourism industry--that is, real people, real dollars, going through the gates, taking a tour, or renting a room. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008129"></A>
In addition to sales increasing by 29 per cent, room nights increased by 30 per cent and the number of passengers who booked a Gold Coast holiday through Flight Centre increased by 47 per cent compared to the same period last year. The campaign was a continuation of our run of tourism marketing initiatives for the region. The Gold Coast Grown Up Deals campaign comes off the back of the solid Summer Stays and Gold Coast Airport Marathon campaigns that ran earlier this year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008130"></A>
The Gold Coast has also featured prominently in Queensland’s Getaway Giveaways retail campaign with the inclusion of 40 regional deals. Campaigns such as these work in partnership with other new initiatives. Just a couple of weeks ago Jetstar announced it will fly from Queenstown to the Gold Coast from December this year, contributing more than 350 seats each week into the area. This is a perfect example of the Bligh government delivering new campaigns and strengthening partnerships for the tourism industry. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. PG REEVES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mansfield--ALP) (Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport) (10.29 am): New government funding of $110,000 will allow the highly regarded Triple P program--the Positive Parenting Program--to provide training for 11 new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander family support services. This will provide an opportunity for around 40 staff members employed by Indigenous non-government organisations to receive training through two new pilot programs this October. The Triple P program is widely known and acknowledged as a leader in parenting programs, so providing this training to new family support services staff will be of enormous benefit to them and the families they work with.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008173"></A>
The Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Protection Peak is working closely with the government to identify appropriate training and development programs for staff of the new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander family support services and is fully behind this program. Triple P International employs only highly and appropriately qualified Triple P accredited trainers with postgraduate qualifications in clinical or educational psychology at a masters or doctorate level. Organisers of the Triple P program at the University of Queensland have confirmed that this program is culturally appropriate for Indigenous families and the benefits of the program for staff will be assessed at the completion of the pilot program at the end of the year. The main source of referrals to the new family support services will be Child Safety Services in conjunction with advice from recognised entities. Queensland Health and Education Queensland employees may also make referrals. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.32 am): My first question without notice is to the Premier. I assume that the Premier consulted with the Integrity Commissioner before accepting her position as president of Julia Gillard’s Labor Party, and I ask: what guidelines from the Integrity Commissioner has the Premier implemented to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest and that the interests of Queenslanders are always put ahead of the interests of the federal Labor Party?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008204"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Premier, I will allow the question as it does involve your role as Premier. I would say, however, to all honourable members that a question that relates to a federal presidency of a party is not one that you would normally have direct ministerial control over, so I am allowing it on the basis that you will confine your answer as Premier of Queensland.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1008205"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the member for the question. It does seem that my elevation to the federal presidency of the Labor Party has caused a great deal of titillation on the other side of politics. That is probably not surprising because I did a little bit of history checking and Queensland has not occupied the federal presidency of the Labor Party since 1973 when it was held by Tom Burns, and I am very proud to be in that company. I note that those opposite are so titillated by it that they have started spending their advertising money to make sure that everybody knows about it. For those who have not seen the ads, I think it is fair to say that they are ads that consciously and deliberately talk down Queensland. I believe that Queensland is the best state of Australia, and thousands of other Australians believe it too because they are moving here in droves.</Hansard-Body>

 Every single week thousands of people from every other state of Australia come to Queensland. Why? Because they believe we have got something special. Because they believe that Queensland has something special, they come here to make a better life for themselves and their families, and they have been doing it for the last decade while we have been in government. I am very pleased to have another opportunity on the national stage to promote what Queensland is doing and to tell people what a great state we are living in. I do not know why the member for Surfers Paradise continually wants to talk down Queensland. I will always be a champion for this state. I love Queensland. I proudly barrack for the Maroons.

 report shows Queensland is equal last in Australia, the Treasurer again criticised the methodology, and I ask: will the Premier finally admit that when it comes to economic management it is in fact the Labor Party that has the wrong methodology and that it makes no difference whether it is state Labor or federal Labor?</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
Here we go again. The Leader of the Opposition is taking every opportunity that he can to talk down Queensland. I am very happy to talk about Queensland’s economic performance. Let us have a look at just a couple of things. For the last 11 months consecutively we have created 75,300 jobs. We have led the nation in jobs growth in the last three months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011258"></A>
After the hit that our state took in the global financial crisis, our economic strategy has meant that we are now, and have been for the past three months, the largest job-generating state in the country. In June, we created 7,900 jobs--almost 40 per cent of the national total. Again, I say that I think Queensland is the best state in Australia and if those opposite do not believe that they should have the guts to stand up and tell people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011259"></A>
It makes you wonder what other state they would prefer to live in. Perhaps they want to live in a state led by a Liberal government. Let us have a look at the way the Liberals are running the state of Western Australia. Let us have a look at taxes. How much tax is paid per capita by West Australians? $2,842. How much in Queensland? $2,225. So you pay $600 less tax in Queensland than you do in the high-taxing hands of the Liberal government in Western Australia. If you are running a business in Western Australia, how much payroll tax will you pay? You will pay 5.5 per cent and you will start paying it as soon as your payroll reaches $750,000. What about in Queensland? You pay 4.75 per cent and you do not pay it until your payroll hits $1 million. I know exactly which state I would rather be running a business in. I know the best state to be in when it comes to payroll tax and business taxes. Queensland has the lowest payroll tax rate in Australia. That is what I love about this state. That is one of the reasons it makes it one of the best in the country and I will stand up and defend it and champion it in every corner and in every case I get and so will every member of my caucus.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011260"></A>
But they have a leader who wants to whinge and whine about how much he hates Queensland. They have a shadow Treasurer who wants to take every opportunity to pull it down. We love this state. It is the best in the country. </Hansard-Body>

 I know they do not want to hear about the jobs figures that happened while the parliament was not sitting, but I certainly think it is important to put on the record another feather in Queensland’s cap--something else that we can be proud of. We, for the third month in a row, were the job-generating capital of Australia. It takes us over halfway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011275"></A>
The biggest risk to the Queensland economy is a federal government led by Tony Abbott--a federal government determined to cut spending in Queensland, to cut public investment in the projects that we have on our books now. We know that Peter Costello says that Tony Abbott is a risk to the economy, but closer to home we have some other LNP strategists who have had a little bit of something to say about Tony Abbott. This article is titled ‘If the answer is Tony Abbott, what the hell was the question?’ It goes on to to say--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011278"></A>
Electing Tony Abbott as leader of the Liberals sends the message loud and clear that the screaming banshees have taken control of the agenda. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011280"></A>
Who could have written such an insightful observation? None other than Ross Musgrove, the chief of staff to the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Musgrove did not restrict his comments to the leadership of Tony Abbott. What did he have to say about the Leader of the Opposition? He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1011282"></A>
Who can believe what is happening in the opposition camp. John-Paul Peter Brian Fred Tinkerbell Langbroek has all the political fight of a French poodle. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011283"></A>
That is what the chief of staff has to say. So I encourage members to read the journal of the Queensland Police Union, because the person who made one of the most observant comments about Tony Abbott--that the banshees are in charge--is now the chief of staff to the Leader of the Opposition. </Hansard-Body>

Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Premier. Last week Access Economics described the Queensland economy as being at the back of the pack, CommSec ranked Queensland’s economic performance in Australia as last and Westpac also found Queensland’s economy ranked last in Australia. Is it not the case that if Queenslanders want to know how federal Labor would mismanage the economy they need look no further than state Labor’s mismanagement of Queensland’s economy and they need to be very worried?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011291"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As usual, members of the opposition in their questions have given the parliament only some of the facts and further denigrated Queensland. What else did Access Economics have to say about Queensland last week? It said that Queensland’s current growth has two key supports. What are they? The high level of federal and state public sector stimulus and the remarkable surge in sales of coal to China. What is the biggest risk? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011293"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, two supports, the first being the federal and state stimulus. There is no doubt that, on reading the Access Economics report, the single biggest threat to the Queensland economy would be the election of a Tony Abbott led federal government. We know that he will be, as Liberals always are, a cutter and a slasher. What has he committed to already? We know that he has promised to cut the NBN--the national broadband network. Which state of Australia needs the NBN more than any other state? Queensland. It will be gone under Tony Abbott. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011294"></A>
You do not have to judge Tony Abbott on what he says; you can judge him by his actions. Tony Abbott sat in John Howard’s cabinet for 12 years and how many dollars did that cabinet ever resolve to spend on a Queensland infrastructure project? Zero. Not one public transport project was ever funded--not one. Incredibly, he has come up again--again--and promised the Toowoomba bypass. They had 12 years and they never put a shovel in the ground. They would not even spend money on their National Highway, the Gateway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011296"></A>
But let us talk again about what the LNP thinks about their own leadership. If the answer is Tony Abbott, as I said, what the hell was the question? Mr Langbroek addressed the Queensland Press Club recently and his speech was woefully crafted. It was a ‘platitude-athon’--thinner than minestrone and as deep as Lake Eyre in a dry year. That is what his chief of staff believes. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 God, they are pathetic this morning. I am very happy to advise the House that just as it did to make the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project a reality, the federal Labor government has come to the party and said it will fund almost $750 million to make the Redcliffe rail link a reality. For the first time ever, all three levels of government are putting money on the table and delivering it. By the end of the day, of course, even Tony Abbott realised that he should be putting his hand in his pocket. But what did the LNP candidate for Petrie say? </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Those opposite do not want to hear what the LNP candidate for Petrie, Dean Teasdale, said. What did he say? He said now is not the right time to invest in infrastructure in his neighbourhood, now is not the right time for Tony Abbott to put money into the rail line. By the end of the day they had found money and decided it was the right time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014161"></A>
This project is important to the south-east and our entire rail network. I am delighted that the federal Labor government has delivered. These are the sorts of projects that happen when there is a state government with an agenda that goes to Canberra and puts the wood on them. Just imagine if it was Tony Abbott, who has never wanted to build a thing in his life, and a French poodle went down there to yap at his heels. Nothing would happen. Queensland can expect nothing in the way of major projects if Tony Abbott is elected. That is his record. He had 12 years to deliver something by way of a major project to Queensland and we got nothing. I will not forget it and I do not believe the voters of Queensland will forget it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014162"></A>
These projects only get delivered when there is a federal government that wants to be involved in nation building--that is not Tony Abbott; he has never wanted to build things--and a state government with a big building program that would be cut by those opposite. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the honourable the Premier. I refer the Premier to an email from an executive director of Queensland Treasury which confirms that the state government formally and deliberately gave code names to the assets to be privatised by Labor to allegedly protect confidentiality, with code names including ‘Thomas’ for Queensland Rail, ‘Popeye’ for the Port of Brisbane, ‘Road Runner’ for Queensland Motorways and ‘Tarzan’ for Forestry Plantations Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014166"></A>
Given that such contracts always have in-built confidentiality clauses without code names, will the Premier finally admit that these code names were concocted to avoid public scrutiny of her asset sale program and that, despite her so-called integrity reforms, when it comes to deceit, dishonesty and cover-up, nothing in the long-term Labor government in Queensland has changed?</Hansard-Body>

 I thank the honourable member for the question.

<A ID="pgfId-1014169"></A>
As to the question of secrecy, how does the Deputy Leader of the Opposition know these code names? Because he put in an RTI and we gave him the information. It is one of those big secrets! His enormous powers of investigation and his analytical skills were all applied to the task. </Hansard-Body>

 I assume we are going to get a Heiner question next after that nonsense. I am very pleased to again be on my feet talking about what a great state Queensland is and how well we are doing in the national stakes. Queensland Rail is going from strength to strength because it is employing more people. Why? Because demand for our resources is growing. Members will see that in towns right across Queensland. That is a sign of growing prosperity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014174"></A>
We know that there are some sectors of the Queensland economy, in places like tourism and construction, that are still feeling the after-effects of the global financial crisis. That is why, while we are pleased to see the recovery in some sectors, we are not being complacent, we are not taking our foot off the pedal. We know that we could still see some softening in the economy and our focus will be on jobs as firmly as it has been on every occasion since we were elected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014175"></A>
As I have said, the single biggest risk to the Queensland economy, to the jobs and prosperity of Queenslanders, is the election of an Abbott government. What that government would do--and this is something it has laid out in clear terms--is abolish major projects that will underpin our economy. The NBN--gone! What that means is that the regions of Queensland will be left out of the digital economy. One would expect those people who represent rural and regional Queensland to be up here screaming about it. But, no, once again they are acquiescing to Tony Abbott taking us backwards. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
I thank the honourable member for the question because this government is committed to delivering on a Sunshine Coast University Hospital whereas those opposite cannot even agree amongst themselves as to what they want to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017061"></A>
This year the government has committed funds in the budget not only for the commencement of the construction of the project but also for the ramp-up of services, which is critical, in conjunction with the clinicians of the Sunshine Coast at Nambour Hospital. We have done that as well as announcing the early opening of the extra extensions to the Nambour Hospital--the non-existent wing there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017062"></A>
What do we see on the other side of the House? We have the Leader of the Opposition--and who could forget it?--on 8 May this year, in an article entitled ‘LNP plays safe on new hospital’, refusing to give a commitment that was different to the government’s in relation to the new hospital despite the platitudes. In fact, an inside source in that same article said they could not afford it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017064"></A>
Then we had the member for Buderim. Of course, he does not even support a hospital on the site. They cannot even agree amongst themselves. The member for Buderim is out there scavenging for a different site, trying to derail the process. There is the member for Kawana, the member for Caloundra and the member for Buderim all having a fight. Then the member for Noosa gets in and says it is dependent on budget priorities. There is one party that is actually committed to doing it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017065"></A>
We know that if Tony Abbott is elected he will cut it straight out. We know that the member for Caloundra said that he would can the Queensland Children’s Hospital. That is absolutely what he would do. We will deliver more beds sooner. Indeed, the Sunshine Coast Business Council indicated the other day how important it will be for jobs creation on the Sunshine Coast. It is there. It is in the forward estimates. The ramp-up of services critically will commence under this government. That is what we announced in April and, of course, last month we spoke about the 96-bed ward. </Hansard-Body>

The last thing the member opposite would want to talk about in this chamber is health after his wonderful performance on Madonna King’s program.

Queensland is the best state in Australia. I am a proud Queenslander.

Maybe the best thing the member for Callide could do is relieve some of the pressure and go south if he does not like it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017083"></A>
What we see is an economy that is recovering from the largest global financial crisis. Yes, some parts of the Queensland economy were hit harder than other states.

I am very happy to take this opportunity to again talk about something else that Access Economics said, that the Queensland economy has been in the slow lane for a while. Part of the problem, as previously flagged, is that it is harder to get a loan in the sunshine state than elsewhere. I join with the Treasurer. If those opposite cared about Queensland, they would join in a bipartisan way. My view is that it is about time the banks in Queensland started to address the borrowing requirements because the economic analysts that the member is quoting point to that problem.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Springwood for her question and for her commitment to the government’s economic strategy, which has been delivering jobs into the Queensland economy for 11 straight months, including over the last three months--nation-leading, jobs-generating growth in this state. As a trade exposed state, it is vitally important that this state continues to promote trade. That is why we always monitor the performance of our major trading partners. Consensus Economics’s forecast, released last month, said that our major trading partners are due to grow by 4.7 per cent in 2010. That is a strong recovery, but it also shows that that growth is coming predominantly from Asia, with growth above seven per cent for non-Japan Asia, while in Europe the challenges remain, with growth at only a bit over one per cent. That highlights that the challenge is far from over and the task is far from complete. That is why we need to keep promoting our economic reform agenda and that means promoting trade. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017100"></A>
For those who did not notice, because the opposition leader scarpered out of here within moments of estimates committee hearings finishing, he once again disappeared without a trace before reappearing without a trace. For those who did not notice the vacuum of leadership because there is a general vacuum of leadership when he is here anyway, there was in fact a moment over the last couple of weeks when the Leader of the Opposition was overseas, on behalf of the Queensland taxpayer, supposedly promoting Queensland’s economic interests, promoting Queensland as an investment destination. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, you have got ‘Brutus’ of Clayfield and ‘Brutus’ of Southern Downs, who are trying to outpace each other with duelling press releases talking down the Queensland economy. The question for the Leader of the Opposition is: while he was there on behalf of the taxpayer, what was he doing? Was he talking down the Queensland economy? If he was, he should pay back the money. If he was not talking down the Queensland economy, why did he not phone home and ask ‘Brutus’ of Clayfield and ‘Brutus’ of Southern Downs to pull their heads in? The answer is that he could not. While he was away they were there posturing and posing, ready to take over. There is a vacuum of leadership that he has created on that side of the parliament over the past 12 months, fuelled by the shadow Treasurer and the deputy leader out there bagging the Queensland economy at every point. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017101"></A>
The reality is that this side of the parliament has an economic reform agenda and we know where we stand. The question for the Leader of the Opposition is: what did you tell all those investors when you met them overseas? Did you talk up the Queensland economy and, therefore, will you pull the deputy leader and the shadow Treasurer into line? Come on, Tinker Bell. What did you do? Did you talk up the Queensland economy? If you did not, you owe the taxpayers an apology and you owe them a cheque to pay back your trip. If you went over there on behalf of the taxpayers and talked down this state, you are unfit to be a leader of the opposition in this state. </Hansard-Body>

Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Premier. Daily across Queensland at 115 schools, children enter classrooms lined by Asbestolux.

 I thank the member for the question. This government takes the issue of asbestos in public buildings, particularly schools, very seriously. Asbestolux is a product that has only recently been identified. The government has acted openly, transparently and swiftly. When notified, the Minister for Education undertook a comprehensive audit of schools. All of those schools were then put up on a website and a register of that material was created. Over time we will systematically remove the material, but in the meantime the register makes it clear so that any building activity can go ahead in the appropriate way to manage asbestos. Frankly, this is a legacy of the last century--</Hansard-Body>

I am very happy to have a chance to talk about the BER program. Regularly, I have the opportunity to visit schools and I have seen a number of schools that have been the beneficiary of facilities such as libraries and halls under the BER program. I know that there are those who want to denigrate this program, but I bet they go to functions in those halls and I bet they stand up and hand out badges in those halls. For some schools, it will be the first time the kids have had the chance to have an assembly inside a covered hall. Why? It is thanks to a federal Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020165"></A>
I know of the transformative nature of those sorts of facilities in primary schools. I congratulate Julia Gillard for her efforts as education minister to give those sorts of facilities to schools right across Queensland.

Every mum, dad and teacher was talking about the difference that the hall has made. It is a story that I hear over and over again. Here we are again--the Liberals and Nationals, no money for schools; Labor, investing in schools. That is what you see at a state level and that is what you see at a federal level.

The member for Townsville would be well aware that, as part of the federal Labor government’s targeting of places in Queensland that need broadband, Townsville is the first on the list. What do we hear from the opposition? We hear absolutely nothing on this subject! Unlike the Tasmanian Tories who are well aware of the effects that will have on Tasmania and who are standing up to Tony Abbott, what do we hear from those opposite? We hear what we hear now: absolutely squat all! Why do we not hear any comment from them? Because they will never stand up for Queensland, just as they never did under John Howard.

He has a heart the size of a caraway seed. He is all mouth and no heart. He is a typical Tory. As I said this morning, he should keep his mouth closed because his silver spoon is shining in my eyes. The reality is that he has never done a day’s work in his life. He would not get hot on a forge. Here he is, standing up for Tony Abbott and his cutting of broadband to working-class people in this state. People would not be surprised about that, would they? </Hansard-Body>

 Again they are speaking about privatisation, but Abbott is going to privatise $43 billion worth of federal investment in the most telling move that I have ever seen. He will take us back to the days of the pedal wireless, in the same way that Howard did. That is what their communication strategy is. He will take away laptops from working-class kids in this state. He will take away broadband access. He believes in taking us back to the days of the pedal wireless, as do those opposite. Today I call on the shadow minister to denounce Tony Abbott and his policy to remove broadband from Queensland. Let us see if they have the ticker to do that. We all know that broadband access means equality in this state. </Hansard-Body>

 My question without notice is to the Premier. I refer the Premier to the Treasurer’s attempt to hold the Townsville City Council to ransom by threatening to withhold state government funding for a much needed entertainment centre because it had not agreed to help fund a cruise ship terminal. Has the Premier referred the Treasurer to the Integrity Commissioner or the CMC given that the local media in Townsville has interpreted this threat as blackmail, or is the Premier reluctant to do so given that the Treasurer is her last remaining supporter in cabinet? </Hansard-Body>

I believe that a cruise ship terminal for Townsville is important. That is why we have put money on the table. It is a source of great disappointment to me that the council has decided that this is not a priority. I would have thought that in a city like Townsville this would be a No. 1 priority. I think that the people of Townsville ought to be asking themselves these questions: why can the city of Cairns put $80 million on the table for a big project? Why can the city of the Gold Coast put $120 million on the table for a big project? Why can the Moreton Bay Regional Council put money on the table for a railway line to Redcliffe? Yet the Townsville City Council--one of the biggest city councils in Queensland--will not come to the party for one of the biggest economic projects. If I were a ratepayer in Townsville, I would be asking where my money is going and why a smaller town, such as the city of Cairns, can put money on the table and Townsville cannot. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020219"></A>
Frankly, I hope that the mayor reconsiders this because for as long as this continues our money remains on the table, as does the federal money. I understand that the federal Labor candidate for the area supports it, and I look forward to talking to him about it after the federal election. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1023536"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for her question and her interest in advocacy for this important issue. The government recently announced its intention to introduce a suite of legal reforms that will provide greater protection to places of remembrance in Queensland, particularly war memorials and cemeteries. We will make changes to eliminate the need to prove consent for wilful damage charges in relation to those sorts of places. We will increase the maximum penalty from five years to seven years. We will also introduce a new penalty into the Summary Offences Act for unlawfully interfering with a grave. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023538"></A>
It is not my practice normally to provide opinions on matters of law in this House, but, given what has gone on in the federal election campaign, one person who might fall foul of this new law would be the federal Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott. Even though he has declared the hated Work Choices policy ‘dead, buried and cremated’, we all know that he will resurrect it as soon as he gets a chance. It is the zombie approach to policy. I can admit to the House that I am a fan of George Romero, the director of schlock horror films such as <Hansard-Italic>
Night of the Living Dead</Hansard-Italic>
. He was prescient when he did those films because when you look at the LNP’s industrial relations policy like Work Choices you see that the zombies of the Romero films are like the LNP--they are slow, lumbering and very difficult to kill. Dead, buried and cremated was just the start of life of Romero’s zombies, and so it is for Work Choices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023544"></A>
After <Hansard-Italic>
Night of the Living Dead</Hansard-Italic>
, when Tony Abbott became the Leader of the Opposition, he claimed that the term ‘Work Choices’ was dead. But up the zombies rose, hungry for more. This was followed by Romero’s <Hansard-Italic>
Dawn of the Dead</Hansard-Italic>
, when Tony claimed on morning radio that Work Choices was dead again. Hold the phone--not for long--because up it rose in Romero’s <Hansard-Italic>
Day of the Dead</Hansard-Italic>
 a few hours later on a different morning radio station when Tony backed away from the promise that it was dead. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023550"></A>
On we go. Tony was not alone. When the zombie lurched on in <Hansard-Italic>
Land of the Dead</Hansard-Italic>
, Eric Abetz, the shadow spokesperson, let it slip that they would be tweaking the legislation, which should not come as a surprise because in <Hansard-Italic>
Diary of the Dead</Hansard-Italic>
--or, as I know it, <Hansard-Italic>
Battlelines</Hansard-Italic>
 written by Tony Abbott--he announced Work Choices was ‘good for workers’. Finally, there is Romero’s most recent addition to his great number of films, <Hansard-Italic>
Survival of the Dead</Hansard-Italic>
, which is where Tony wants the Work Choices zombie to survive his first term, wait for three years and back to life it comes. So back comes the zombie policy. I understand why the George Romero zombie policy is so attractive to the members opposite: it is slow, lumbering and mindless. It was once relevant but is now a swinging carcass. It is desperately hungry for brains but is always, always, left hungry. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs MENKENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Treasurer. I refer to the Treasurer’s attempts to hold the Townsville City Council to ransom over funding for the proposed entertainment centre and ask: have the member for Townsville or Labor’s candidate for Herbert raised concerns about this or are they happy to see Townsville ratepayers being bullied? </Hansard-Body>

Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Burdekin for her question and the chance to state this government’s utter support--$30 million, in fact $32.5 million, remains on the table in order to build a cruise ship terminal at the Port of Townsville. Who else is at that table? The federal Labor government is at that table with a commitment to infrastructure and a federal Labor candidate in Tony Mooney. We are there with $62.5 million together so that we can support this piece of economic infrastructure for the city of Townsville. But we are at the table alone because there is a chair that is spare at the table. The spare chair belongs to the mayor of Townsville--the Mayor of Townsville, ‘King Les’, who has said so many times that he wants it, who has said so many times that he supported it, who has said he wanted us to change the design and up the funding that we put in. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023563"></A>
So what did we do? We changed the design and we put the extra funding in. Then we got the federal government on board. And what happened? He did not appear. He is still not sitting at the table to support a cruise ship terminal for Townsville. Despite the fact that he has walked up and asked for money for the V8 Supercars and walked up and asked for money for the Townsville mall redevelopment--partnerships at every single level of government--he turns around and sends a letter in the middle of all of this saying, ‘In the future I’m going to ask you for a three-level partnership for another project.’ He has more front than a roundhouse, more front than a Mack truck, turning up and saying, ‘On this occasion, no, I won’t participate.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023564"></A>
The reality is that this project is good for Townsville. It is good for the Townsville economy, it is good for jobs and the mayor should stand by his word to support this project. What do I know of the position of the member for Townsville, the member for Mundingburra and the member for Thuringowa? They all support a cruise ship terminal for this city because they know that it is good for the economy and good for jobs. And are they right behind the state government’s commitment with money on the table? You bet they are. What do they think about all those other projects that are listed and every one into the future? For the record, my experience of those three members is that every single project that is good for Townsville they support, to a person, as part of the team of this government. </Hansard-Body>

People who say that they are in a partnership should be fair dinkum. He cannot pick and choose which ones he wants to be in partnership with and then send a letter of request for others. The fact of the matter is that the money is on the table. The only thing that is missing is the mayor of Townsville. </Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Minister for Main Roads. There is a hive of activity on roads in my electorate. Road crews are a familiar sight in my neck of the woods. They are out there almost every day working on the roads, making them safer and more secure for motorists. Can the minister give a guarantee to maintain the momentum on the maintenance and the road building programs around the state? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026781"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The good news for the member for Toowoomba North and every member in this House who supports roads is that the answer is yes. We are continuing our building on roads right across Queensland. As old Joh used to count the cranes on the skyline, we count the signs--‘Roadworks ahead’. Queenslanders can count on the Bligh government to deliver a bigger and better road network. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026783"></A>
Our $3.3 billion roads budget is more than three times bigger than the entire budget of the tories when they last sat on the treasury benches. Our roads budget is about building better roads right across our great state. It is a roads budget for growth. It is a roads budget that will deliver jobs for Queenslanders--around 30,000 jobs this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026784"></A>
Our roadworkers have got their hard hats on from Cairns to Coolangatta. We are delivering west of the Great Divide as well. We are able to do this because we had a plan. We had a plan and stuck to it. We made the tough choices and the tough decisions, unlike those in the opposition. They are job blockers and job knockers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026785"></A>
We have the Leader of the Opposition talking about a freeze on infrastructure. That is a freeze on building roads, a freeze on building projects, a freeze on creating jobs. He would give Queenslanders the cold shoulder. Our $18 billion road building program is kick-starting local economies and generating local jobs--30,000 of them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026786"></A>
Compare that with the Leader of the Opposition’s plan--‘Mr Three Per Cent’. If we applied his plan to our road budget, millions of dollars would go down the drain and hundreds of jobs would go down the gurgler. He says one thing but his colleagues say another. They just disagree. Take the opposition roads spokesperson as an example. She says that we are not spending enough, yet her leader wants to block spending and block jobs. We have the Leader of the Opposition with the right-hand blinker on and the roads spokesperson with the left-hand blinker on. Do members know what that means? The hazard lights are on in those members opposite. They are showing their true colours--no policies, just a lot of populist claptrap. Those opposite have not got a clue. Even their tory colleagues in New South Wales have switched on to the fact that infrastructure builds stronger economies. We will not take our pedal off the metal in Queensland. We are going to concentrate on roads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026787"></A>
I have to worry when it comes to roads. If the tories get elected in Canberra, they have already said that they will cut $1.435 billion from the infrastructure fund. That will come off roads right across our great state. That will come off roads in Cairns like the southern access corridor. That will come off roads in Townsville like the Port Access Road that we are building. That will come off the planning exercises we are doing in Mackay and Rockhampton. That will come from every Queenslander who drives on our roads every day. They will cut road funding and I am scared for the motorists of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Federal Election</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026808"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition) (11.34 am): Queenslanders are in no doubt as to what they will get if Labor is elected at the federal level. We have seen it all before: say and do anything before an election but after the votes have been counted the promises turn to dust. I say to the people of Queensland and Australia: in Queensland the real Anna Bligh stood up after the election. Julia Gillard is trying to say after just two weeks of a five-week federal election campaign that she has suddenly decided to be real. Now we are going to see the real Julia Gillard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026809"></A>
What has she been for the last 2 years as Deputy Prime Minister and for the first two weeks of this campaign? It strikes me that the Labor hierarchy said to her yesterday, ‘Now get out there and be spontaneous, Julia. Remember, learn those lines but be spontaneous about it.’ A face-change artist is what we have from the Prime Minister of Australia. She is trying to sneak to the polls saying, ‘This is the real me now; it wasn’t the real me before.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026810"></A>
That is the Labor way--con the voters; say anything and do anything. As Labor icon Graham Richardson proudly proclaims, ‘whatever it takes’. Anna Bligh and Julia Gillard are from the ‘whatever it takes’ school of politics. They are schooled by factional heavies like Bill Ludwig and they know no bounds in their thirst for power. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026814"></A>
Queenslanders cannot be fooled, however, because they have too recent a memory of what happened in March last year. The reason Labor’s polling is going backwards in this state is that voters know from bitter experience what to expect. No matter what Labor says before the election, it will not stop the waste, it will increase taxes, it will increase the cost of living and it will increase the already enormous debt. The truth is this: the only way to stop the waste, to decrease taxes, to reduce the cost of living and to reduce the debt is to vote Labor out on 21 August. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026815"></A>
It is clear that Queenslanders are very concerned about the Premier’s new role as president of the Labor Party. Queenslanders remember the Premier saying last year that Queenslanders could count on her. Now we have the Premier failing to do her job as Premier and failing to stand up to Canberra, as seen with the negotiations over the GST for the health reforms. She gave up valuable resources to Canberra. It turns out that we are losing over 40 per cent for these health reforms. The last thing the Premier needs is a second job as president of the Labor Party. The Premier should be concentrating on fixing the Queensland economy and getting tourism back on its feet. The Premier should not be taking on any other jobs until she has done the job that Queenslanders pay her to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026816"></A>
We heard again today in a question from the honourable member for Callide that business investment in Queensland is down over 20 per cent over the last year. It is up two per cent in the rest of Australia. So Queenslanders know what to expect from Julia Gillard because they have seen it all with our Premier, the member for South Brisbane. As I said, they will say and do anything to get elected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026817"></A>
Untruths are in Labor’s DNA. The Premier told untruths about asset sales. She continues to tell untruths about jobs, job creation and job growth. We saw it again in the House this morning. Bearing in mind that the Premier said last year that she was going to create 100,000 breadwinner jobs--at that time there were over 114,000 unemployed Queenslanders--the last unemployment figures show that there are nearly 131,000 unemployed Queenslanders. Yet this Premier and this Treasurer continue to go out and spread the untruths about full-time jobs and the fact that the number of unemployed people is decreasing when the number is increasing. It is up nearly 17,000 compared to March last year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026818"></A>
On another issue, the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, told untruths about global warming being the greatest moral challenge of our time. We saw that he turned his back on that. That is what the people of Queensland will remember. </Hansard-Body>

In ministerial statements this morning we saw the real Premier stand up and talk about the appropriate use of the Public Service. She said that she had issued an edict to the Public Service that there should be no politicisation of the Public Service or public sector bodies or places where politicians can go. We all remember in 2007 the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, doing press conferences in hospitals. He was given free access to Queensland hospitals to do his press conferences. Very obviously, the same opportunities were not given to other federal politicians in the last election campaign. We have the Premier today talking about the appropriate use of the Public Service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034051"></A>
Of course today we heard the Premier and the Treasurer bleating on about how their economic strategy is working. We had the Treasurer, the member for Mount Coot-tha, talking about data. He was talking about data in a way that shows he has no real contact with everyday Queenslanders--Queenslanders whom I meet as I travel around this state on the Gold Coast and in Caloundra. I am talking about people at the coalface of the empty shopfronts in Cairns, on the Sunshine Coast and on the Gold Coast where small businesses are suffering. That is the point: he is good at looking at a row of figures but he has no idea because he has never had a real job! He has no feeling for real people because he is not a real person. We have not even seen the real member for Mount Coot-tha. He has not bothered to tell us whether he is real, but he is not real because he has not even had a real job. He tells us that the recovery is underway. Tell that to the people of the Gold Coast and regional centres around Queensland where shopfronts are empty and where people are struggling to pay the bills caused by the policies that he has brought in that have raised the cost of water, electricity and tolls. This government has been in power for nearly 20 years and the Treasurer has been part of it since 2004, and all he is doing is looking to deflect the blame and do as the Premier did this morning--that is, cloak herself in ‘I’m proud to be a Queenslander’.</Hansard-Body>

I was giving hope to investors when talking about what a great Queensland it has been since I have grown up here and how much better it can be, but not under this lot.</Hansard-Body>

We know what this Labor government has given us. It has lost our AAA credit rating. It has given us increased water charges. It has given us a fuel tax. It has given us asset sales. We all know about the waste in terms of the Traveston Dam, the recycled water pipeline, the Health pay fiasco costing hundreds of millions of dollars, $9 billion spent on a water grid and a desalination plant that the government refuses to take ownership of. With regard to the federal government, in 2007 Kevin Rudd promised a Building the Education Revolution program, insulation in people’s roofs that has ended up costing people’s lives, GroceryWatch, FuelWatch and a petrol commissioner. They are the examples of what Labor has delivered federally, and we all know what it has delivered at the state level: tax, land tax reform, a fuel tax that was brought in when we did not have one and of course a waste tax in this year’s budget.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034083"></A>
At the federal level when Labor got in it said that everything was paid for, but--presto--on the eve of a federal election when it has been borrowing $100 million a day it has come up with a resources tax. Once again we do not have the details of that, but we know that after the election we will see all of the details. Very obviously Queenslanders know that we can be so much better and we are going to be much better after 21 August, and Julia Gillard is part of that sad tradition of telling untruths to voters. These Labor governments have in common incompetence, waste and a total disregard for taxpayers’ money. Queenslanders have struggled under the burden of two high-taxing, incompetent Labor governments for the past 2 years, but change is coming on 21 August. </Hansard-Body>

Community Kindergartens</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034086"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms CROFT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Broadwater--ALP) (11.44 am): I rise to draw the attention of the House to the Bligh government’s commitment to and support of community kindergartens. As the Minister for Education has already announced, three new kindergarten services opened this term at Woodford, Oonoonba and Mudgeeraba state schools, and this is just the beginning of a new wave of services--up to 240 by 2014--that are popping up around the state. Make no mistake: these new services are no accident. The Bligh government has made a critical commitment to lift the kindergarten participation rate of Queensland’s four-year-olds from 32 per cent, as it is now, to 95 per cent by 2014, and it is in everybody’s interests to see this figure realised.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034089"></A>
Providing universal access to a quality early childhood education program for four-year-olds will give our children a flying start into learning and life. It is important that as many four-year-olds as possible gain access to these services, which is why the funding model for 2012 will change slightly to encourage a focus on four-year-olds. Centres will receive almost $2,200 per child as we subsidise the cost of kindergarten programs. Funding as it currently stands is guaranteed for 2011, which creates an 18-month transition period to give centres time to make the adjustments they need. This is why the Bligh government has jointly established a business advisory service with its kindergarten partners, the Creche and Kindergarten Association of Queensland. The advisory service is for each and every kindergarten operator. The service will work with individual kindergartens to provide information, advice and strategies for making the most of the new funding model.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034091"></A>
With our ambitious kindergarten targets and the drive to establish universal access to these services, it would absolutely be counterproductive to see kindergartens close. With this advisory service we are making sure operators know the lay of the land and how to build on their offerings for 2012. This is a unique service which will help the Bligh government realise a quality education for as many four-year-olds as possible. We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that children who learn early will learn for life. We know that children can learn to love learning itself and they can find this passion in kindergarten services, which will launch them into prep, which will launch them into school.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034093"></A>
Our kindergarten pledge also means increased funding for long-day-care services so that they too can offer a kindergarten service. The second round of funding for these services was announced in June and we have had an overwhelming response since applications closed. Each participating service will receive $1,200 per eligible aged child to help offset the costs of providing the kindergarten program. This will provide a huge boost to children accessing a kindy service. Statistics show that more than half of Queensland’s kindy-aged children attend a long-day-care service but only a small number of them are taking part in a kindergarten program taught by a qualified teacher. This is an opportunity to boost that number, and the Bligh government is ready to help.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034095"></A>
Successful applications for the second round of funding will be announced shortly and the way the funding is structured means that parents who already send their children to a long-day-care service should not pay any extra for their child to access a kindergarten as well. Last year during the first round of this funding we extended the program because of the large response. This means that more than 3,900 children now have the opportunity to participate in a kindergarten program--an opportunity they otherwise would not have had. If we work together with communities and families, we can provide a first-class education system for our children. We can give our young children a flying start into the education and life that they deserve, and this is just one way the Bligh government is making sure our kids do not miss out. </Hansard-Body>

Mr KILBURN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Chatsworth--ALP) (11.48 am): I intend to address an issue of importance to the constituents of my electorate and, I am sure, other electorates around the state. I am acutely aware of the impact that the rising cost of living is having on the residents of my electorate and I acknowledge that some increased costs such as electricity and car rego have impacted on the family budget. I have constantly raised these issues with the relevant ministers and I am pleased that the Bligh government has taken some positive action to alleviate the impact of these costs on pensioners and some low-income earners. A new website launched recently will help Queenslanders make every dollar count.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034137"></A>
The Minister for Community Services, Minister Struthers, recently unveiled the new Every Dollar Counts website, which will help Queenslanders access rebates and concessions on offer throughout the state. The website is a one-stop shop for Queensland government and federal government concessions, making it easier for people to get cost-of-living subsidies that they are eligible for--and there are a number of them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034140"></A>
This government already has one of the broadest range of concessions, rebates and discounts in Australia. However, there is always a need to review and assess these rebates to ensure that they meet the ever-changing needs of Queenslanders. This website will help people know what help is available so that they can access it. The website brings together information about a number of concessions--and, as I have said already, there are many of them--and I will just mention a few. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034141"></A>
There is the increased electricity rebate--up from $190 to $216--each year to help pensioners and seniors meet the cost of essential household expenses. The ClimateSmart service can assist families save up to $325 a year on electricity costs--something that I encourage all residents to do. I am very proud of the take-up of this program by Chatsworth residents in particular. Chatsworth residents have one of the best take-up rates in the state, with over 3,400 residents taking advantage of this service--1,247 of those in the Carindale suburb alone. There is a new electricity concession of $216 each year for low-income Queenslanders who have multiple sclerosis or other chronic medical conditions who are significantly affected by changes in temperature.</Hansard-Body>

Mr KILBURN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I acknowledge the member for Brisbane Central, who I know had a lot to do with lobbying for that. I congratulate her on that. There are increased electricity life support concessions--from $388 to $440 a year for oxygen concentrators and from $260 to $294 a year for kidney dialysis machine users. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034145"></A>
There is an increase in the reticulated national gas rebate. Of particular interest to me--and I noticed this on the website when I looked at it--is that there is a subsidy to purchase specialised smoke alarms for permanent Queensland residents who are deaf or who have a hearing impairment. I can understand, from my previous career, how important that is for people who are suffering from that disability. The subsidy for the smoke alarms is $400 for a single-storey dwelling and up to $800 for dwellings of more than one storey. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034146"></A>
One subsidy that I noticed which was of particular interest is free dental treatment, including the provision of dentures, which is available at dental clinics and hospitals. This is an important issue for all Queenslanders. A number of my constituents have spoken to me about it and I have been constantly disappointed that the LNP has continued to block in the Senate the federal Labor government’s attempt to increase funding for public dental services. I have written to the LNP candidate for Bonner on two occasions asking if he will lobby his LNP colleagues to pass this important funding. Not surprisingly, I have not received a reply. It is not surprising that he has been focusing on other issues, because he does not want to discuss the Liberal Party’s blocking of the funding for the dental program. He does not want to talk about the fact that in the Wakerley and Gumdale areas in my electorate residents in new suburbs do not have access to broadband. Even given that those people are in his federal electorate, his government intends to scrap the NBN being rolled out by the Rudd-Gillard government. I think that is an absolute disgrace. I think the people of my electorate need to know that that is what he is doing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034147"></A>
 I want to contrast that to what we have from the LNP. We have a commitment to cut. We have seen their colleagues in the Liberal government in Western Australia cut $17 million in concessions for seniors and pensioners. I note with interest that the Leader of the Opposition said that he has just been overseas. I have just been overseas--and, mind you, I paid for that myself. I went to the United Kingdom, where I saw the conservative government over there cutting 600,000 jobs from the public service--scrapping entire departments and cutting budgets for every government department by 20 per cent. This is the type of response that we will see from this opposition if it is ever elected, and I hope that we do not see that. I encourage all residents to go to the Every Dollar Counts website or telephone 131304 to see what concessions may be available. </Hansard-Body>

Resource Industry</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034151"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Callide--LNP) (11.53 am): Since the parliament last met there has been a disturbing degree of community disquiet surrounding the resource industry in Queensland. As the resource extraction industry has moved into more closely settled and intensively farmed areas, the result has been the emergence of a range of issues, culminating in the protests that we saw last weekend at the Roma community cabinet meeting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034152"></A>
The government should recognise that community disquiet is a measure of the degree to which it has failed to fulfil its roles and responsibilities to administer the resource industry properly. The government should have recognised that a much different level of monitoring and supervision was required in these closely settled areas to ensure that the people in those communities were able to cope with the changes that new industries bring. People affected by such change have every right to ask questions and have every right to seek assurances and guarantees from government about a whole range of effects that they, their farms and the communities will have to deal with. The Bligh Labor government has a clear role to ensure that those people can be confident that their rights, their communities and their environment are protected and secure. Clearly, the Bligh Labor government has failed massively in that role. It has failed the people of those regional communities and it has failed the resource industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034153"></A>
Such has been the extent of that failure that now, out of the resulting confusion and concern, some people are questioning the future of some of the resource projects that should provide great rewards for Queenslanders for generations to come. One such example is the coal seam gas industry. The CSG industry today is at about the same stage of development as the coal industry was in the early 1960s, and over the next 40 years it can provide the same economic benefits to our state as our world-class coal industry has become famous for over the last four decades. Unfortunately, the coal seam gas industry has been caught up in an understandable campaign of opposition to open-cut mining on prime agricultural land and valid concerns about problems with trials of controversial new technologies such as underground coal gasification. Both of these issues have engendered considerable and perfectly valid community opposition. But the strength of that valid community opposition should not be allowed to threaten the future of what is a very different coal seam gas industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034154"></A>
This industry has already brought new life to country towns that had been decaying for decades. It has brought new jobs to many young Queenslanders with the skills to build meaningful careers. It has brought significant benefits to landholders, who have been able to successfully negotiate a mutually beneficial co-existence on their land. It has brought a new, cleaner energy source to a significant part of our electricity generation sector and it has brought a new supply of water in an area where extra water is badly needed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034155"></A>
The LNP will continue to support the coal seam gas industry as it expands to become an exporter of cleaner energy to the world. There is no doubt that the expansion of the coal seam gas industry involves issues that must be dealt with and it presents challenges that must be met successfully by the industry, by the government and by the communities themselves. We in the LNP recognise those challenges and we will work with local people to develop solutions to those issues that they have identified for their communities and to ensure that they, too, get the benefits that the CSG industry brings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034156"></A>
The LNP will protect the values of prime agricultural land: no ifs, no buts--we will do whatever it takes. The LNP will protect the irreplaceable Great Artesian Basin: no ifs, no buts--whatever it takes. The LNP will protect the property rights of local landholders: no ifs, no buts--whatever it takes. The LNP will ensure that local communities get the infrastructure they need to cope with the changes and we will ensure that they get their share of the rewards to become stronger into the future. We have long been supporters of regional development and champions of rural communities and that will never change. These things are not just in our political DNA; they are what makes us what we are.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034157"></A>
The political opportunists have been quick to try to capitalise on the community disquiet caused by the massive failure of the Bligh Labor government in its administration of the resources sector. In their quest to win a federal Senate seat, the so-called Greens and their associated subgroups have suddenly discovered regional Queensland and are running a scare campaign based on conspiracy theories and downright dishonesty. With their feigned interest in regional Queensland and their false concern for the people who live there, they represent the ultimate example of hypocritical political opportunism. They have no real interest in regional Queenslanders, their communities or the industries which will sustain them into the future. The CSG industry is one of those industries and, with proper administration, it can and will bring huge benefits to every Queenslander and, more particularly, to regional Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WENDT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich West--ALP) (11.58 am): I want to update the House on the progress of two important projects in my electorate which have involved significant announcements since the last sitting of parliament. In the first case I want to advise that the government’s development application for the proposed $150 million aerospace and aviation hub for the RAAF base at Amberley has now been approved by the Ipswich City Council. This means that the ICC has now signed off on the state government’s 183-hectare Aerospace and Defence Support Centre, which, as most people would know, is located at the south end of the base, just west of Ipswich, which adjoins the Cunningham Highway. This project is expected to create up to 3,500 high-tech jobs and promote Queensland as an aviation and defence industry hot spot. What we are planning is for the Aerospace and Defence Support Centre to be the premier destination in South-East Queensland for organisations seeking to provide services to the Australian Defence Force and, for that matter, maybe even South-East Asia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034204"></A>
Following Ipswich City Council approval, the state government can progress what will now be a hub for national defence, aviation and aerospace industries. I can advise all those who do not know that Queensland companies are already involved in major defence force projects for the delivery of the Tiger and MRH 90 helicopters, airborne early warning and control aircraft and, of course, the air-to-air refuelling planes. As such, the centre is expected to create enormous interest and become a base for firms seeking contracts to service and maintain RAAF aircraft, including the new fleet of the $6 billion F/A-18F Super Hornets of which there are now 12 at last count. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034207"></A>
With more and more defence personnel calling Amberley home, the development of an aerospace and defence support centre is an investment in the future and a downpayment in sustaining local high-tech know-how. A centre of aerospace innovation next door to the Amberley base could see Ipswich become an economic powerhouse similar to Seattle in the US, with the ability to provide maintenance, repair, overhaul and engineering support for other businesses as well as.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034208"></A>
However, this would not happen if it was not for the state government’s commitment of around $30 million from the state’s construction fund to develop the project which all of South-East Queensland, particularly Ipswich, should be extremely happy about. I would also like to comment in relation to an announcement that was made on Sunday just gone. The federal infrastructure and transport minister, Anthony Albanese, visited the electorates of Ipswich West and Blair, of which Shayne Neumann is the local federal member. He came to the Blacksoil intersection, which many people in this House would certainly be aware of. </Hansard-Body>

 I take the interjection from the member for Toowoomba North. While he was there he announced that the federal government will be supporting and putting $54 million into the upgrade of the Blacksoil intersection. The federal government is not only putting that money in because it thinks it is a great project but also because the state government is coming up with about 25 per cent of the money, which is equivalent to $16 million. I do not think it would have occurred unless the state government put its hand in its pocket. For that I thank the minister responsible. Without that it would have made it much more difficult. </Hansard-Body>

 You cannot get the smile off my face. This particular project will have a design life of about 25 years. It is a significant project in relation to future benefit. It will be designed for a speed of 110 kilometres which means it will be posted at 100 kilometres. It will provide free-flowing movement from the Warrego Highway westbound to the Brisbane Valley Highway. For anybody who knows the intersection, we have something like 40,000 vehicles using that area at the moment, with around 15,000 to 16,000 using the right hand turn out to the Brisbane Valley Highway. We are going to get rid of that dangerous intersection that is there at the moment. It will also able to be expanded to six lanes in the future. There will be minimal earthworks to maximise re-use of the existing pavement which, of course, is very important. It makes better use of the existing terrain and topography than previous design models that I have seen. It also caters for pedestrians and cyclists. There will be a dedicated path which will be outstanding. </Hansard-Body>

 Working together. It was great to have them on board. I think they will appreciate that very much. There is a construction phase of about 18 months. Since Sunday, I have spoken to Main Roads and told them that I would like to see the construction signs up on the road sooner rather than later because this is a project that has been a long time coming. As I say, if it was not for the state putting in money to drag the feds to the table, the federal government would probably have looked at other projects. But it has come to the party and I think it is tremendous. Without them this project would probably be a mile down the track. I thank the minister, particularly. </Hansard-Body>

(12.03 pm): To mention the Labor Party is to conjure up the image of debt, deficit and taxes. When it comes to economics, the record of the Labor Party at all levels is a disaster. We need to look at the state of the economy here in Queensland; we need to get that raw data to find out exactly what would happen in Australia after 21 August should the failed federal Labor government be re-elected. What happened in Queensland? The state Labor government lost the AAA credit rating. It lost it before the last election. In Queensland, before the global financial crisis hit our shores, we were $65 billion in debt. Where are we now? We have seen the budget come out in June, we have seen the Treasurer and the Premier spruik up its benefits, but what is the true state of the economy? In Queensland we are heading towards an $83.5 billion debt. Where are we heading in terms of our operating statement? We are heading towards deficits over the next four years--that is the entire future predicted outcome of the budget totalling $6 billion. Where are we with taxes and charges? Taxes and charges are on the rise. Families, households and businesses throughout the length and breadth of the state of Queensland are paying more and receiving less. One only needs to think of the fuel tax of just over 9 cents a litre that has now been imposed on every Queensland family. One only needs to think of the increases in registration charges on the family vehicle and on the business vehicle and that the transfer of that vehicle now costs more as those transfer charges go up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034219"></A>
As we look around the state at fees and charges for environmental activity, one example sees the environmental charge for a sewerage treatment plan go from $500 to $5,400. That is the legacy of the taxes, charges, debt and deficit that have been run up here in Queensland under Labor. Over the last six weeks I have been travelling around the state and I have been going to small towns and cities the length and breadth of the state talking to people about the budget and explaining to them what the budget means for them. I have explained to them how big the state economy is, the $40 billion that the government manages, how debt operates, how much we are borrowing and why that leads to increased taxes and charges. I have asked them their view of the economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034220"></A>
I listen to what the Treasurer and the Premier say and if one believes what they say we are in some rosy glorious sunlit-up lands of economic prosperity here in Queensland. But that is not the story the small businessmen and women throughout the length and breadth of this state tell me. They tell me that they are doing it tough. They tell me that customers are not coming through the door. They tell me that the customers that are coming through the door do not have as much money to spend as they once did. They say, ‘Why are we hearing all this good news from the Premier and the Treasurer when we are not experiencing it?’ It does not matter whether they are in Maryborough, Ingham, Roma, Noosa or Currumbin it is the same story. </Hansard-Body>

 It does not matter whether they are at Clayfield. Just ask members of the racing industry what they think the Bligh Labor government’s impact on the racing industry is. That impact is all negative. They are all doing it tough. As they tell me that it is tough, I say to them, ‘Well, this is how it is. This is why it is the case. You have a state government that has racked up $83 billion worth of debt and it is borrowing $1.5 billion this year because it cannot balance its books. Its expenses are going through the roof. Although revenue is growing it is not growing at a fast enough rate so what are we left with? A need to borrow more.’ </Hansard-Body>

What do other people say about it? It is not just small businessmen or me; what do other people say about it? CommSec says we are No.7--we are at the bottom of the list. What does Access Economics say? It says Queensland’s economy has been in the slow lane for a while; now the state is at the back of a pack, a position it is not used to; the state’s consumers are cautious with retail sales falling back of late; measures of job vacancies remain uninspiring; although retail growth is weak, Australia-wide the gains in Queensland are weaker still. That is what Access Economics says. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1034224"></A>
What does the Chamber of Commerce and Industry say? This quarter has seen a dramatic downturn in business confidence. What does Westpac say? It says the Queensland economy lagged the other states throughout 2009 and 2010. The decline in state final demand is telling. I do not know what planet the Treasurer resides on, but it is not the planet that small businessmen and women throughout this state reside on. He needs to do something to cut the debt and reduce the taxes. </Hansard-Body>

Chronic Disease</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034226"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Everton--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(12.08 pm): Preventable chronic disease poses a huge threat to our lifestyles, our life expectancy, our health system and our state budget. One third of all deaths in Queensland result from preventable chronic diseases. Chronic disease causes more than 22,000 deaths per annum in Queensland. Serious preventable conditions such as type two diabetes, emphysema and kidney failure cost the Queensland economy an estimated $6 billion per year. Perhaps the most frustrating thing is that these diseases are largely preventable if we eat well and get active. Seven in 10 Queenslanders still have two or more risk factors for chronic disease. Half of all adults and children do not do enough physical activity, more than half of adults and one-fifth of Queensland children are overweight or obese, one in six smoke daily and one in eight Queenslanders aged 14 years and over drink too much alcohol. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034227"></A>
Approximately 4,000 premature deaths could be prevented each year in Queensland by changing the lifestyles of Queenslanders to improve their diet, maintain a healthier weight, encourage more physical activity, stop smoking and reduce alcohol consumption. It is because of the threat posed by chronic disease that the Bligh government is planning for the future and dealing now with the health challenges we know are on the way. In 2008 the Bligh government announced its Q2 ambition to make Queenslanders Australia’s healthiest people.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034263"></A>
The Q2 chronic disease target aims to reduce by one-third rates of obesity, smoking, harmful alcohol consumption and unsafe sun exposure. If we achieve these targets or even make big steps towards meeting them, we will contribute to reducing the burden of chronic disease and ill health in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034267"></A>
The Queensland government currently invests more than $460 million annually in prevention in the Health portfolio alone. We have campaigns to encourage Queenslanders to give up smoking, drink more responsibly, find 30 minutes a day to exercise, and get their two serves of fruit and five serves of vegies a day as well as programs to monitor their blood pressure. We are also offering innovative care models through Telehealth and telephone based self-management support to improve access to services. One of the most interesting of these services I think is known as COACH. It is a system where people with certain chronic diseases are able to have regular check-ups over the phone about their condition and they are provided with ongoing support to ensure that their blood pressure does not rise or their heart disease does not become even more of a problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034270"></A>
I am pleased to say that Queensland’s investment in tackling chronic disease is strongly supported by the Gillard government and its National Partnership Agreement on Preventative Health. This agreement will provide $448 million nationally up until 2012-13 to reform Australia’s efforts to prevent chronic disease and ill health by addressing lifestyle risk factors.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034272"></A>
One of the fastest growing chronic diseases is type 2 diabetes. In relation to this disease specifically, the Gillard government has provided $436 million in a commitment to tackle diabetes. This commitment is a strong recognition by the federal government that it will lead the way in tackling diabetes and other chronic conditions. Through this initiative, the federal government is offering GP practices incentives to treat patients with diabetes and provide more regular check-ups. By having their diabetes more appropriately managed in a community setting by a primary healthcare provider of their choice, Queenslanders living with diabetes will receive improved continuity of care and will enjoy a better quality of life. This initiative will also help Queensland’s public hospital system. Better care for patients with diabetes in a community setting will reduce unnecessary hospital presentations and free up hospital services to support those who most require hospital based care.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034274"></A>
The contrast between the Gillard government’s forward-looking approach and the Tony Abbott led opposition could not be greater. What has the federal opposition offered to match this investment? Tony Abbott, a former federal health minister, has been noticeably silent on how the federal coalition would tackle the chronic disease crisis that Australia faces. But we do know what he would not do. The man who cut the health budget by $1 billion when he was the health minister has already announced he will cut another $1.5 billion of health improvements promised by the Gillard government. Tony Abbott has promised not to build 23 GP superclinics promised by Julia Gillard. These superclinics, building on those already operating, will help patients with preventable disease. These services treat people with preventable diseases, relieving pressure on our hospitals.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034276"></A>
Tony Abbott has also promised to cut Medicare Locals, which will help patients with preventable disease. He will deny patients with preventable disease assistance in obtaining allied health care through these Medicare Locals. Tony Abbott has also promised to cut e-health spending, which also helps patients with preventable disease. E-health allows patients to check their tests and medication online; ensures that information is shared between GPs, hospitals and other health services; and reduces unnecessary re-testing of patients.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034277"></A>
Tony Abbott has form. He cut $1 billion from the federal Health budget while he was health minister under Howard. He starved Queensland hospitals of money at a time when our population was exploding. We cannot afford to have him back in charge of our health system. </Hansard-Body>

Dr FLEGG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Moggill--LNP) (12.13 pm): Since I raised the issue of Asbestolux in schools, the Queensland public is now aware of what amounts to a new and serious health threat to children in our schools. This is no media beat-up nor a political scare campaign. Asbestolux is very nasty stuff indeed. What is Asbestolux? I will read from Queensland’s occupational health and safety organisation’s information guide. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Samples of low density asbestos fibre board have shown it contains up to 70 per cent ... asbestos fibres--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

almost pure asbestos--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1034285"></A>
and is generally composed of brown asbestos ... and white asbestos ... in a calcium silicate plaster. The asbestos fibres are not bound in a cement matrix as with asbestos cement sheeting. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1034286"></A>
Low density asbestos fibre board is often soft and the pressure of a fingernail pushed into the surface can leave an indentation. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I was shocked at a recent estimates hearing to discover that the minister had not even heard of its common product name, Asbestolux. This is despite a report entitled <Hansard-Italic>
Asbestolux</Hansard-Italic>
 sent to the Queensland government in December 2007 and the occupational health and safety information that I just read from. I called this a cover-up and a cover-up it is indeed that has put our children’s health at risk. This government was warned as long ago as 2007, yet it does not appear to have taken any action--at least until two years later when that workplace health and safety information was released. Inspection of schools only began in December 2009. How could it possibly take two years to react to a warning about a lethal substance in our schools? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034293"></A>
Then what did Minister Wilson do? He released a press release that, for its first 16 paragraphs, says what a great job this government is doing in relation to asbestos in schools. But then in the 17th paragraph it refers to updating identification and removal procedures to allow for recent changes to classification of ‘a particular type of wall sheeting’. The product is not even named in the minister’s press release and is not even mentioned until page 2, paragraph 17. That is a cover-up. How much more outrageous does this make the minister’s previous statement that--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1034295"></A>
It is the principal’s responsibility to ensure the safety of students and staff, particularly when it comes to asbestos related issues. Any failure ... to fulfil those obligations will result in disciplinary action. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034296"></A>
It is clearly the minister and the government who should be subject to disciplinary action after taking two years to act on warnings and then compounding the sin by being unable to even utter the name of this product in their press release when this dangerous asbestos discovery was made. My call to this government is to come clean and inform Queensland communities and, in particular, affected school communities that this substance is in their midst. This should not have been a role left to the Queensland opposition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034297"></A>
I am calling on the government to affix to every panel of this dangerous material in Queensland schools a warning sticker. We have seen time and time again accidents occur in relation to work done in schools right across this entire state when people have not realised what they were dealing with--and that was just asbestos sheeting. This is many, many times more dangerous. </Hansard-Body>

Fitzroy River Pipeline</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037964"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr HOOLIHAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Keppel--ALP) (12.20 pm): I am pleased to advise this House that the coastal region of the Keppel electorate has now been drought proofed by a water pipeline. This project confirms that major infrastructure funding is spent in the regions. It also confirms the success of council amalgamations in undertaking cooperative work with other levels of government. On 24 July 2010, together with our federal member, Kirsten Livermore, and the Mayor of the Rockhampton Regional Council, Brad Carter, I turned on the water in our $49.5 million pipeline from the Fitzroy River. The Commonwealth granted $16.5 million under its original national water initiative. Our Labor government originally granted $16.5 million, but later this was increased to $20 million, and I will deal with that later. The then Livingstone shire council was to provide $16.5 million, which would be paid by approximately 45 per cent of ratepayers who had reticulated water. This pipeline proposal had been around for nearly 50 years, but over the years had been rejected by Livingstone councils. It was even rejected by the deputy mayor at a public meeting in 2004. Sadly, the real fly in the ointment, the Livingstone shire council, has now been claimed by its former mayor as being the only successful group associated with the project. To apply the words used by my friend the member for Rockhampton, when referring to those claims at the opening, success has many fathers but failure is an orphan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037968"></A>
When I was elected in 2004, the then Livingstone shire council was still raping Waterpark Creek and Sandy Creek north of Yeppoon, because it held Orders in Council that the then mayor refused to convert to an allocation from the Fitzroy River, despite the fact that it was exceeding the environmental flows from those creeks. Without funding, the pipe dream remained a nightmare and I was determined to get approval for the funding. I must thank Graham Scott, who was on the reference group, for his input when he raised the spectre of sandbagging the mouth of Waterpark Creek because of the inflow of sea water at high tide. This destruction appalled me and I spoke with the then minister, who indicated the Labor government would support an application for funding to $49.5 million, which would require one-third of the cost from each level of government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037972"></A>
After Commonwealth funding was granted, and through the work of the area consultative committee chair Kym Mobbs, state funding was granted, but I noted that the budgetary funding for the Livingstone shire council would be strained by finding its share. I spoke to the mayor and offered to endeavour to increase the state share to 40 per cent, which was the funding arrangement at that time for councils. He pooh-poohed that offer and denied it could be done. After discussion with the relevant ministers, the amount was considered for increase to $20 million, thereby saving the ratepayers $3.5 million. In fact, that amount was announced as an election promise during the 2006 campaign. I was returned to this House at that election and subsequent action regarding the implementation of the construction was difficult, as the Livingstone shire council would not confirm its funding. I also tried to get the Commonwealth to increase its funding, but was told that that was not on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037974"></A>
In April 2007 Treasurer Andrew Fraser and I handed over a $20 million cheque to the Livingstone shire council deputy mayor and infrastructure chair, but still the council had not finalised its funding. I must say that, despite the great work done by the staff of both the then Rockhampton city council and the Livingstone shire council to get the mayor of Livingstone to work constructively, it was not possible. As the final Treasury report on council amalgamations showed, the Livingstone shire council had budgeted for a deficit in excess of $2 million for each of the next 10 years, at a total of $28.2 million. Therefore, how would the council find a further $13.5 million? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037975"></A>
With council amalgamation, the obstructive approach of the Livingstone shire council disappeared as the Rockhampton Regional Council became the operator for the whole of the pipeline construction area and also the water provider. Things could happen as there was only one council and the staff, who had worked to bring this project about, could work constructively. Forty-three kilometres of pipe comprised of 600 millimetre and 750 millimetre pipe, a new pumping station at Ibis Avenue in north Rockhampton, a new reservoir to allow the rechlorination of pumped water and additional pumping capacity in Yeppoon with a valve facility at Yeppoon West, to allow pumping to St Faith’s Reservoirs and switching with Taranganba Reservoir, have all been completed on budget. I congratulate the staff of Fitzroy River Water, under its chair Greg Belz, and the construction staff on the successful completion of their work, which also required seven road crossings. An investment of $20 million by the state Labor government, along with the other infrastructure spending on the police station and hospital, Commonwealth and state spending on schools and roads, and other projects worth in excess of $100 million in Keppel alone has contributed to regional prosperity and demolishes any claims that funding is not provided to our regions. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind) (12.24 pm): Since the last sitting of this parliament, an overseas trained doctor, Jayant Patel, whom a royal commission found was not properly credentialled, privileged or registered and who was negligently employed by this government, was found guilty of three counts of manslaughter and one count of GBH and sentenced to only seven years of jail. While the guilty verdict was welcome, the seven-year sentence is a huge disappointment and a blow for Patel’s former patients, their families and the people of Burnett and Bundaberg. This sentence is being appealed by the Attorney-General, who deserves praise for this action.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037986"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>
(Mr Ryan): Order! Member for Burnett, we will pause the clock while I receive advice. There are some matters subject to an appeal. Member for Burnett, I ask you to avoid discussing those matters under the sub judice rule. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037987"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you for your direction, Mr Deputy Speaker. Other people who deserve praise in relation to the successful capture and conviction of Patel are, of course, tenacious and courageous nurse whistleblower Toni Hoffman, journalist Hedley Thomas, countless numbers of police and CMC officers, legal professionals including retired Supreme Court Justice Davies, Special Counsel Tony Morris and prosecutor Ross Martin, who gave their very best in order to bring justice to the people of Burnett and Bundaberg.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037988"></A>
Most people do not have an appreciation of the size of the damage caused by (1) Patel; (2) the bureaucrats who recruited, approved and hired him, that is, the Wavelength recruiting agency, the Medical Board of Queensland and Dr Kees Nydam; and (3) the bureaucrats and politicians who protected and covered up for him and then flew him out of the country using taxpayers’ money, that is, Leck, Keating, Nuttall and Beattie, most of whom have led charmed and profitable lives since. Most people do not realise that the Davies royal commission, at page 184 paragraph 3.418, subparagraphs (d) and (e), reports that a medical review team, ‘Ascertained that Dr Patel saw some 1,450 patients during his time at Bundaberg’ and ‘Identified 221 cases (including 88 deaths) ... who were the subject of a complaint or who had been transferred to another institution.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037991"></A>
Those are important figures--1,450 patients, 88 deaths and two years--because they prove that, unfortunately, for many victims the three counts of manslaughter and one count of GBH that Patel was found guilty of were just the tip of the iceberg. The figures of 1,450 patients, 88 deaths and two years also prove that many victims and their families have completely missed out on compensation, considering that this government has admitted that less than 300 victims have officially received special payments. What about the other 1,150 people who died, were operated on or treated by a Queensland Health employee who was not a properly registered or qualified doctor? Do they deserve compensation?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037992"></A>
Many of the almost 300 official victims who were paid damages are claiming that they were unfairly and unconscionably compensated; that this government has ripped them off. It is difficult for them to speak out because of their fear that the government will enforce the non-disclosure conditions of their contracts and take the meagre compensation sums away from them. However, one victim, a widow whose husband died at the Bundaberg Base Hospital while under the care of Patel, has asked that I make her voice heard in this chamber. I table some de-identified correspondence; firstly, a letter from her lawyer and also statements that she made to me. She says--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms van LITSENBURG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Redcliffe--ALP) (12.29 pm): The Redcliffe and surrounding communities exploded with excitement at the announcement that the federal government would partner with the state government and the Moreton Bay Regional Council to fund the rail from Petrie to Kippa-Ring. This has been a long-awaited piece of infrastructure which will round off Redcliffe’s public transport options after the huge advantages the Ted Smout bridge has delivered. This rail will be a huge asset for the whole Moreton Bay region. The Queensland Labor government is putting up $300 million plus the land in the rail corridor, the federal government is contributing $740 million and the Moreton Bay Regional Council will tip in $105 million. This partnership has only been possible because of the amalgamation of councils to form large regional councils, allowing them to focus on regional planning and giving them the budgets to develop infrastructure for the first time in their history. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038034"></A>
No sooner had Prime Minister Gillard announced their contribution than the local LNP candidate was on radio denouncing it and stating over and over again that the cost of delivering this rail was too high at this time--this after his party had promised this very rail for the last two elections, although there was a large provision to let them out of it at the last election. With last week’s promise from state and federal Labor and council, the LNP initially found the cost was too high but by the end of the day they had promised it. Can we believe them this time? This is part of a longstanding pattern. For many years the local federal LNP member ran her campaigns on ‘we need a new bridge’ until this state Labor government promised to deliver it. The LNP state candidate who ran against me was warned not to promise the bridge because they would not be delivering a bridge. Instead, they started on their rail to Redcliffe campaign. But they were never any more serious about the rail than they were about the bridge. They ran on their promise of the rail to Redcliffe again at the last election without any real intention to deliver. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038037"></A>
Tony Abbott is belatedly promising the rail in this federal election. Was it just a statement he made off the cuff when he was overexcited? Or is this a real policy? Has he contacted either the state or the local government to back up his media announcement? Is this even a core promise? Can we afford to risk the future economic and social wellbeing of Redcliffe people and people right across the Moreton Bay region on that history? The Bligh government stands behind its promises and we do not promise what we will not deliver. For the Bligh government this rail is an intrinsic part of our plan to deliver better quality public transport for South-East Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038040"></A>
The limited sale and leasing of assets has ensured that the Queensland government can invest in this vital public transport to improve the lifestyles of all South-East Queenslanders, ensuring that people across this high-growth area will have effective public transport, cutting congestion on the roads from the north and giving a wider range of people the opportunity to take up employment across the south-east region. And this, for our region, is very important for youth to be able to get employment. This rail is a win for all of the people of Redcliffe and right across the Moreton Bay Regional Council area. I am proud to be a part of the Bligh Labor government that has delivered it, ensuring Queenslanders get the best public transport system in the country and have the infrastructure we need to keep our state moving ahead. </Hansard-Body>

This bill is the first of three bills that I will be introducing today. Together, these bills represent the second stage of a comprehensive suite of legislative reforms that this government committed to implementing in 2009 in the <Hansard-Italic>
Response to Integrity and Accountability in Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038060"></A>
The Ministerial and Other Office Holder Staff Bill 2010 delivers on our commitment to introduce new stand-alone legislation for the employment of ministerial staff. As our system of government has evolved, so, too, have the roles of ministerial staff. Ministerial staff play an important role which is different from but complementary to the independent and apolitical nature of the Public Service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038061"></A>
Queensland is again proving to be a leader among Australian state and territory governments by laying down a formal legislative framework which recognises the realities of the working relationship between the administrative and political arms of government. The bill provides a discrete framework for the employment of ministerial staff distinct from the Public Service, thus reflecting the differing and quite separate roles of ministerial staff and public servants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038062"></A>
The bill provides for the appointment of ministerial staff, staff of the Leader of the Opposition and staff of other non-government members of parliament where appropriate. Currently these staff are employed under the Public Service Act 2008 without recognition of the very distinct roles these staff play from the rest of the Public Service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038063"></A>
Ministerial staff members will be appointed by the director-general of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet, upon recommendations from the Premier, the Leader of the Opposition or the relevant member of parliament. The bill sets out explicit parameters around the powers, roles and responsibilities of these staff. Importantly, the bill specifically provides that ministerial staff are not empowered to direct public servants in their own right. The bill includes work performance obligations which supplement the ethics values in the Public Sector Ethics Act 1994 and create obligations for staff members to act honestly, efficiently, with integrity and in the public interest. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038064"></A>
While the employment regime will be separated from the Public Service, the conditions of employment of staff members will remain aligned with those which apply to public servants. The bill includes provision for: ministerial staff members to provide annual declarations of interest; application of codes of conduct to ministerial staff; and continuation of the current application of the Crime and Misconduct Commission, Ombudsman and offences under the Criminal Code. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038065"></A>
Positive interactions between the Public Service and ministerial staff can contribute to effective governance and maximise the efficient and effective delivery of government services. This bill provides a firm foundation upon which this can continue to occur with due regard for the need to preserve the apolitical and independent character of the Queensland Public Service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038066"></A>
This bill emphasises the government’s commitment to ensuring that appropriate frameworks are in place to guide the interactions between ministerial staff and Public Service employees. In addition to introducing this bill, we have implemented a range of complementary measures, including amending standard employment contracts and issuing a communique to clearly articulate my expectations of the standards of conduct in interactions between ministerial staff and public servants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038067"></A>
This bill recognises that ministerial staff perform an important role in the business of government by facilitating communication of ministerial priorities to departments and acting as a conduit between ministers and Public Service employees, including communicating ministerial views and decisions or requesting advice or other work to be undertaken to assist the minister in the performance of their duties and responsibilities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038068"></A>
As the way in which government business is done continues to evolve and change, so, too, must our governance structures evolve and change to ensure that everyone, from ministers to ministerial staff, chief executives and Public Service employees, clearly understands their powers, roles and responsibilities. This bill is therefore an important next step in this government’s continued commitment to a contemporary and robust integrity and accountability framework. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

The Public Interest Disclosure Bill 2010 is one of three bills introduced today which represents the second stage of integrity reforms announced in the <Hansard-Italic>
Response to Integrity and Accountability in Queensland </Hansard-Italic>
last year. This bill delivers on our commitment to reform whistleblowers protection legislation. The bill replaces the Whistleblowers Protection Act 1994 and puts in place significant reforms following consideration of the recommendations of the Whistling While They Work project. This bill builds upon the framework established under the existing Whistleblowers Protection Act and maintains the protections and rights of disclosers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042344"></A>
Additionally and importantly, the bill will expand the scope of Queensland’s whistleblower legislation so that, for the first time in Queensland, it will also provide protection for disclosures to the media in certain circumstances. While the government still believes that public interest disclosures should be made to, investigated and dealt with by the public sector, we also acknowledge that there will be some circumstances where providing information about wrongdoing to the media is in the public interest to ensure inappropriate behaviour can be uncovered and appropriately dealt with. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042345"></A>
Protection will therefore be provided for people to make disclosures to the media if they have not been able to have the matter resolved through disclosure to the appropriate public sector entity. This avenue provides further assurances that this government is committed to protecting its whistleblowers and ensuring that they can have the confidence to report corrupt or inappropriate practices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042346"></A>
The bill also strengthens processes around the management of public interest disclosures by creating a new independent oversight role for the Public Service Commission. All chief executives will be required to ensure that minimum standards are in place within their agencies, including ensuring that appropriate action is taken on all public interest disclosures and ensuring support and protection is offered to disclosers, as well as developing and implementing management programs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042347"></A>
In addition, we are extending the operation of the act to government owned corporations for disclosures relating to official misconduct, to match the recent expansion in the jurisdiction of the CMC; creating a new vicarious liability provision which will hold public sector agencies liable where they allow employees to take reprisal against a whistleblower; and establishing a new cost effective avenue for any person who has suffered a reprisal to make a claim under the Anti-Discrimination Act 1991, in addition to seeking damages through the Supreme Court.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042348"></A>
The Public Interest Disclosure Bill provides an important mechanism for facilitating scrutiny and supporting people who do the right thing and stand up to wrongdoing. This bill is a crucial part of maintaining a strong ethical culture in the Queensland public sector. This bill ensures that Queensland’s legislation is of the highest standard. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1042362"></A>
The final bill in this legislative reform package I am introducing today, the Integrity Reform (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2010, implements a range of reforms through amendments to a number of Queensland acts. As part of the government’s <Hansard-Italic>
Response to Integrity and Accountability in Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
, we announced that we would introduce a single code of conduct for the Public Service. We made the decision after considering more than 200 submissions received in response to the integrity and accountability discussion paper. This consultation process revealed support for a single code of conduct for the Public Service that focused on the positive expression of public sector values. The code has now been drafted and is currently the subject of extensive consultation. Amendments to the Public Sector Ethics Act contained in this bill will allow the single code to be adopted across government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042363"></A>
In line with our ongoing commitment to continuously improve and strengthen our integrity framework, the bill also introduces a revised set of the ethics principles that form the core of the Public Sector Ethics Act. This will ensure the ethics principles remain contemporary and relevant for a modern Public Service and will ensure that the Queensland public sector is working towards the very important principles of integrity and accountability, promoting the public good, commitment to the system of government and accountability and transparency.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042364"></A>
The ethics principles will be supported by the more detailed ethics values including a commitment to the highest ethical standards; showing respect to all persons; accepting a duty to manage public resources effectively, efficiently and economically; and a commitment to managing information as openly as practicable. The ethics principles will be clearly articulated in the new single code of conduct for the Public Service. The bill also allows for agency specific standards of practice to be adopted where there is a need for more specific guidance for employees of particular agencies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042365"></A>
The new code will take effect from 1 January 2011, and other public sector entities, such as local governments, will have until 1 July 2011 to revise their codes to reflect the new ethics principles. The bill also includes amendments to the Public Service Act 2008 which reflect the enhanced role of the Public Service Commission to promote an ethical culture in the Public Service and promote leadership and management capability in relation to disciplinary matters. The bill creates a revised model for Public Service appeals through the creation of a new statutory position of appeals officer and extends disciplinary provisions to all Public Service employees.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042366"></A>
In addition, amendments to the Fire and Rescue Service Act and the Ambulance Service Act are the final step in ensuring the post separation disciplinary regime applies to all public servants by extending coverage to fire and ambulance service officers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042367"></A>
We are also strengthening the requirements around disclosures of personal interests to ensure that potential conflicts of interest are appropriately managed. The Ombudsman, the Information Commissioner, the Integrity Commissioner and the Auditor-General will be subject to new and consistent requirements to provide declarations of interests to the Speaker.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042368"></A>
Amendments to the Integrity Act 2009 will create new obligations for certain statutory office holders to declare their interests to their ministers and the Integrity Commissioner, ensuring independent oversight. This process will be consistent with that which applies to chief executives of government departments under the Public Service Act 2008. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042369"></A>
The bill also amends the Parliament of Queensland Act 2001 to institute statutory requirements for members of parliament to provide declarations of interest for the Register of Members’ Interests and the Register of Related Persons’ Interests. These procedures have previously been required under standing orders only, and these amendments will enshrine this standard in legislation. Detailed procedural requirements for completion of statements of interests will remain in standing orders to promote administrative flexibility. Failure to comply with the requirements in relation to declarations of interests will be a contempt of the assembly and may be dealt with accordingly. These amendments complement transparency measures already introduced which see the Register of Members’ Interests available online. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042371"></A>
Further, this bill will amend the Civil Liability Act to allow apologies to be made without being taken as an admission of legal liability. This amendment will allow the government, as well as any other person, to acknowledge mistakes through an apology where the actions may have caused harm. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042372"></A>
The government is also continuing its commitment to the strongest oversight of the lobbying industry in Australia through further improvements to the lobbying regulations under the Integrity Act, taking on board suggestions from the Integrity Commissioner. These amendments include requiring that unregistered lobbying activity be reported to the Integrity Commissioner and expanding options available for the Integrity Commissioner to deal with breaches of the lobbying regulations through a new system of warnings and suspensions against lobbyists. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042373"></A>
As national leaders in lobbying regulation, this government is committed to continually improving the operation of the Integrity Act to ensure that we continue to have the most effective, fair and transparent system of monitoring the operation of the lobbying industry in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042374"></A>
This bill along with the Ministerial and Other Office Holders Staff Bill and the Public Interest Disclosure Bill that I have introduced today are an important next step in this government’s commitment to a robust integrity and accountability framework. The bills reaffirm our unwavering commitment to ongoing and continuous improvement to our integrity system. They ensure that Queensland continues to lead the nation in delivering open and accountable government. I commend these bills to the House. </Hansard-Body>

The criminal justice system plays an important role in creating a safe community for all Queenslanders. Central to our criminal justice system must be a strong and fair sentencing regime. This bill introduces significant initiatives to strengthen criminal justice sentencing in Queensland, ensuring that it provides greater clarity, greater transparency and a more robust foundation upon which our courts can undertake the sometimes difficult and complex task of sentencing offenders. This bill seeks to enhance public knowledge and understanding of sentencing matters; to fortify community confidence in the sentencing process; and to strengthen the penalties imposed upon repeat offenders, persons who commit sexual offences against children and offenders who harm young children through the use of violence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042434"></A>
The Queensland Penalties and Sentences Act 1992 provides the framework for the courts when sentencing adults in Queensland. The act sets out not only the broader purposes which sentencing is intended to achieve but also the detailed structure and rules concerning the sentencing of different offenders. This bill amends the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992. The amendments are best understood in two parts, but parts that form a continuum of reforms to the sentencing regime in the state aimed at improving the clarity and transparency of our sentencing processes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042436"></A>
The first part of the amendments creates a Sentencing Advisory Council for Queensland that will help to bridge any gap between community expectation, the courts and government on the issue of sentencing in the criminal justice system. The Queensland Sentencing Advisory Council will seek to further promote consistency in sentencing; to stimulate balanced public debate on sentencing issues; and to incorporate informed community opinion into the sentencing process, thereby enhancing confidence in Queensland’s sentencing regime. The Sentencing Advisory Council will achieve these objectives through its functions of advising, informing, researching and educating on sentencing issues. In performing its functions, it is anticipated that the Queensland council will consult widely, including with the judiciary, the legal profession, government agencies and the community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042437"></A>
The composition of this new body will ensure a broad range of membership, including community representation. It will recognise the impact of sentencing options on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Queensland and vulnerable persons facing the criminal justice system. The members will have expertise or experience in the areas, for example, of victims of crime, justice matters relating to Indigenous people and vulnerable persons facing the criminal justice system, justice matters relating to domestic and family violence, law enforcement, crime prevention, criminal prosecution and criminal defence representation, civil liberties, corrective service, juvenile justice matters, and criminology and criminal law, including sentencing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042438"></A>
One of the functions of the Sentencing Advisory Council will be to state its views to the Queensland Court of Appeal when the court is considering giving or reviewing guideline judgements. This offers an important new mechanism by which properly gauged and informed public opinion can inform our state’s sentencing system. The bill confers jurisdiction on the Queensland Court of Appeal to give or review guideline judgements. A guideline judgement is a means by which the Court of Appeal can give guidance to sentencing courts, thereby supporting a consistency of approach to sentencing and enhancing public confidence in the integrity of Queensland’s sentencing regime.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042439"></A>
The second part of this reform bill aims to strengthen the penalties imposed upon repeat offenders, those who commit sexual offences against children, and offenders who are violent to young children or who cause the death of a young child. Two judicial sentencing principles currently applied by the Queensland courts will be inserted into the Penalties and Sentences Act. There is significant utility in adopting existing common law sentencing principles into statute, primarily to place beyond all doubt the intent of the parliament that courts must adopt and apply such principles in all appropriate cases. By enshrining these principles in statute law, the parliament is sending a clear message to the courts and to offenders as to the expectations of the community in this regard while also giving the community greater certainty and confidence as to the principles courts must apply in sentencing offenders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042441"></A>
The first principle complements the existing legislative measures aimed at protecting the most vulnerable members of our community from sexual abuse. The bill provides that an offender convicted of an offence of a sexual nature committed in relation to a child must serve an actual term of imprisonment unless there are exceptional circumstances in the case. Sexual offences against children are some of the most disturbing criminal offences in our community, and enshrining this principle into law will ensure that the imposition of an actual jail term is required when sentencing an offender under the Penalties and Sentences Act for any offence of a sexual nature committed in relation to a child under 16 years. Judicial discretion is retained, but it will only be where it can be demonstrated that the most extraordinary circumstances exist that an offender may be sentenced to anything other than an actual term of imprisonment. The term ‘actual term of imprisonment’ is defined in the bill to mean a term of imprisonment served wholly or partly in a corrective services facility.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042443"></A>
The inclusion of the exceptional circumstances provision is important. While it is difficult, if not impossible, to envisage circumstances in which a violent sexual offender might satisfy such a provision and, in doing so, not be sentenced to an actual term of imprisonment, there may be some offences that will be caught by this provision which involve circumstances that warrant further careful consideration. For example, where a 17-year-old and 15-year-old were in a consensual relationship, it might seem unjust that one of them be imprisoned for conduct in the course of the relationship that raised no other inference of criminality but for the fact of their respective ages. These are not easy cases, and nor are they cases in which the appropriate sentence in each case will be non-custodial. As such, the law must be capable of providing a just and appropriate sentence based upon all the facts in a case, most notably where those facts are unusual and differ from more straightforward examples. As a general principle, the strength of our legal system must be measured not only by its capacity to imprison those who transgress the law but also by whether it is sufficiently robust and fair so as to guard against injustice that might be visited upon the few.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042444"></A>
The second principle reflects the community expectation that repeat offenders should be punished with reference to their previous convictions and reinforces the government’s and the community’s denunciation of recidivists who continue to disobey the law. The bill ensures that, when sentencing a repeat offender, the court must treat previous relevant convictions as an aggravating factor in determining the appropriate sentence. The result of this amendment is that the court will increase the penalty to be given to the offender within the established common law sentencing range for that conduct. The penalty must, however, still be proportionate to the gravity of the current offence.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042445"></A>
Finally, the bill makes an important amendment to the serious violent offence provisions of the Penalties and Sentences Act. Currently, an offender convicted of a serious violent offence must serve 80 per cent of their sentence before being eligible to apply for parole release. The bill provides that, in the case of an offender convicted of an offence of violence committed against a young child or an offence that caused the death of a young child, the court must treat the age of the child as an aggravating factor when determining whether a serious violent offender declaration should be made. The amendment will strengthen the penalties imposed on such offenders and will ensure that genuine regard is had to the special vulnerability of these young victims. This bill continues the Bligh government’s commitment to the ongoing modernisation and reform of Queensland’s legal system. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southern Downs--LNP) (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (12.58 pm): 2008 was supposed to mark the first steps in a modernisation of Queensland courts. In announcing a review of our court system the former Attorney-General said that it was aimed at improving the way civil and criminal cases are dealt with by the courts. After the review was finalised but before any bill had been put out to consultation, the current Attorney was jumping the gun, claiming the so-called changes as sweeping reforms as if parliament had already passed the changes. We were told initially that the reforms aimed to ensure that delivery of justice in our state is timely, equitable and reflects the Queensland of the 21st century. But what we have in this bill does not truly achieve that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042464"></A>
The purpose of the original review was to examine and report on the working of Queensland courts in the civil and criminal jurisdictions with a view to making more effective use of public resources. The terms of reference referred to factors including the increasing volume and complexity of demands on the state’s civil court system and increases in the time and resources consumed by the litigation process, meaning that it is timely to examine whether the current jurisdictional limits of Queensland courts are appropriate. In the desirability of early identification and encouragement of pleas of guilty in the District and Supreme courts and the potential for a number of less serious indictable offences to be finalised in the Magistrates Court, it is timely to review the criminal jurisdiction, including the jurisdictional limits of Queensland courts, and to consider new models for progressing criminal matters. In his review Mr Moynihan wrote--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1042467"></A>
The criminal justice system is an essential component of the rule of law. An effective criminal justice system should provide equal justice to all according to law by disposing of cases impartially, fairly, expeditiously, with the minimum of unavoidable delay and with the minimum but necessary use of public resources.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1042468"></A>
Like so many things wrong with this government, the failure to collect reliable data impacted heavily on Mr Moynihan’s review, and he wrote--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1042470"></A>
Most significant of these considerations is the lack of reliable, comprehensive data. It is, for example, impossible to track a person through the justice system from arrest and charge through to the courts and corrective services. Although a number of different agencies have systems to collect data for their own specific purposes, this has not yet yielded relevant data to enable the review to accurately map the criminal justice system as a whole or to track the various processes in that system that nearly always involve multiple agencies.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This issue is a very concerning one, considering that millions of taxpayers’ dollars have been spent on the Integrated Justice Information Strategy, IJIS, yet it has failed to deliver a coordinated whole-of-government information process. The dismal state of Queensland’s courts has been regularly highlighted in both public forums and the Australian Productivity Commission report, which confirmed that the Queensland justice system has been in gridlock for the last three years. The 2010 report on government services paints a disturbing picture of Labor’s mismanagement of our court system. At the end of the 2008-09 financial year, there were more than 32,300 criminal cases and more than 35,000 civil matters caught up in the Queensland justice system bottleneck. There is a very serious problem in the court system and it is as a result of poor planning and poor management. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049295"></A>
Queensland now has one of the worst court congestion problems in Australia, and the proposed reforms being put forward today will put further pressure on the Magistrates Court and the District Court. This bill will extend the number of matters that can be heard in each of those jurisdictions, which are already struggling under existing workloads. But there is no indication that quality additional magistrates or judges will be appointed at either level to help reduce the backlog. I note that this concern has also been raised by His Honour the Chief Justice in public forums. I will expand on that for a moment. I think that is of grave concern. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049296"></A>
Certainly, I have heard from members of the profession, regional law associations and members of that representative body about their worries with regard to jurisdictional competence when it comes to managing the matters that are going to be delegated from the higher jurisdictions in Queensland. If we look at the Supreme Court in particular we see that they have very specialist and defined lists which in many cases are the envy of other jurisdictions throughout Australia. That is certainly the case with regard to the commercial list of the Supreme Court. But there are very serious concerns about the capabilities and the capacities of the Magistrates Court and the District Court to deal with complex matters that are delegated to them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049297"></A>
The Magistrates Court in particular is attuned to dealing with matters as part of a sausage machine. It deals with many criminal justice issues very expeditiously. Magistrates are now going to be caught up in civil matters, with the monetary limit lifted from $50,000 to $150,000. The limit in the District Court is going to be lifted to three quarters of a million dollars. I think that is going to put particular pressures on the heads of those jurisdictions to make sure that their jurisdictions deal with those matters in more specialist ways. I think there are some real issues in doing that when we compare the way in which those jurisdictions deal with matters with the way in which the Supreme Court is established and functions and the level of responsibility that it has. I think that is a space that we are going to have to continue to watch, because there are some serious concerns with regard to that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049298"></A>
As I have stated already, at the end of the 2008-09 financial year there were more than 32,300 criminal cases and more than 35,000 civil matters caught up in the Queensland justice system bottleneck. There is a very serious problem in the court system. The introduction of this legislation will see a substantial increase in the workload of magistrates, in terms of both the number of matters heard and the complexity of matters that will now be capable of disposition in a summary jurisdiction. The Law Society notes--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1049301"></A>
... at present, approximately 99% of summary matters are resolved by way of a plea of guilty. Any reduction in this trend will accordingly have a huge impact on the court e.g. a 1% reduction in the plea rate would double the existing trial work of the court and clearly place the system under pressure which it could not sustain without increased resources. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049302"></A>
Queensland’s Magistrates Courts are already feeling the pressure of increased workloads through the QCAT changes. The regional Magistrates Courts could grind to a halt if we allow these proposed changes to place greater pressure on an already stretched system. According to the latest Magistrates Court annual report, ‘in the criminal jurisdiction, adult and juvenile combined, the number of matters lodged (by defendant) increased by 4.12 per cent statewide. This is the fourth year of increased workloads with an 18.75 per cent increase occurring over the four years since 2004-05’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049303"></A>
One of the other concerning factors of this legislation is the attack on the committal process that is a longstanding part of our robust justice system. Previous research into committal proceedings focused on the importance of pretrial examination had one academic write--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1049304"></A>
•	it is an important source of notice to the accused, both of the charges and of the evidence. The accused can obtain a picture of the prosecution’s case, and cross examine prosecution witnesses to test their evidence;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1049305"></A>
•	the prosecution case may be weakened by cross-examination, so that it is dismissed by the magistrate, or with the effect that the prosecution proceeds on a lesser charge. If the matter proceeds to trial, the accused is at least better placed tactically. He or she can also test the character of prosecution witnesses, including their prior convictions, to an extent which would be dangerous at the trial; </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1049306"></A>
•	the preliminary examination provides information for use at the trial. Evidence is recorded, and can be adduced at the trial; a witness who changes his or her evidence can have any discrepancy put at the trial. These depositions are also available for admission at the trial if, for instance, the witness has died, or if the evidence is not in dispute; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1049307"></A>
•	there are also advantages for the prosecution. The preliminary examination can clarify the issues in dispute, and it provides the prosecution with an opportunity to test its case. It may be that, faced with a manifestly strong case, an accused will decide to plead guilty.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049308"></A>
In 1989, when the issue of abolishing committals was last raised, Terry O’Gorman, who is a larger-than-life figure within the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties and well known to many members in this place--if not personally then certainly by his reputation--wrote--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1049311"></A>
The system which now operates is that, three weeks after committal, the entire committal transcript is available. An indictment is presented at a special listing call-over held before the listing judge within about seven weeks of the end of the committal. Usually, on this occasion, a trial date is set. Trials are invariably heard within six months of committal and, often, in a much shorter period. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1049312"></A>
The listing system operates very effectively due to the fact that Mr Justice Carter and Judge Helman respectively have held the listing judges’ position for a number of years--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1049313"></A>
and I say by way of clarification that I am talking in the past tense with regard to those listing judges--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1049315"></A>
and consequently, have instituted and maintained a system that is both flexible and definite. Where a committal is abolished or significantly restricted, it would inevitably lengthen the list in the Superior Court with a resultant economic penalty to be paid as it is now well accepted that Superior Courts are considerably more costly to run than Magistrate’s Courts. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053182"></A>
The question for the Attorney is: what is the current wait time from a committal to a trial listing to an actual trial date? I find it interesting that 20 years later we have come full circle and are now debating the worth of a committal hearing here in Queensland. Clearly something has gone awry in that time. I think a great part of that must rest with the fact that Labor has been in power for all but a short period in the mid 1990s. Delays in trials and court processes have changed since 1989 when Mr O’Gorman made those statements. I reiterate that it has been the fault of this Labor government. There is nothing in this bill that will address the fundamental underresourcing and poor management of our court system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053183"></A>
The then Deputy Director of Legal Aid Victoria, Mick O’Brien, was right when he said that the value of committals is recognised when they are utilised effectively and that by and large a necessary precondition to their effective utilisation is legal representation. He went on to say that this means in reality that unless legal assistance is readily available persons appearing at committal proceedings will be unrepresented. With the current demise of legal aid in Queensland under this Labor government it is clear that the committal system has been set up to fail. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053184"></A>
This is an issue of significant concern to many people. I think it may also be an issue of concern to the Attorney. I certainly hope that it is. One of the problems when it comes to a government considering whether to put money into legal aid is that it often considers that that is not something which is noticed by the community at large and therefore it is something that goes significantly unsupported. However, if one looks at the research that the Law Council of Australia and other esteemed bodies have done, there seems to be a real body of evidence which indicates that if a dollar is spent on legal aid to ensure that there is proper legal representation for a person who does not have the resources to pay for it themselves then a multiple of that can be saved in the courts, maybe up to even $3 or $4. So a dollar spent in that way can actually save a significant amount of money in addressing the issue in the courts. An unrepresented litigant, somebody who is trying to defend themselves, has to be considered differently from someone who is properly legally represented in the court. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053185"></A>
The other issue in relation to courts is restraining legal aid. That is something that will happen in this budget, if not in dollar terms then in terms of the number of cases of legal aid being granted to people who request it in Queensland. It will be down thousands on last year. That can actually have the effect of forcing people to plead guilty to something when they arguably might not be guilty of that particular offence. If anyone believes that does not happen they need to speak to people in legal circles. People might ask how that could happen. Rather than plead not guilty and face a trial and the possibility of a much more severe penalty in a higher jurisdiction, if a person actually pleads guilty and can be dealt with in the lower jurisdiction, the Magistrates Court, it may mean that they may not have a conviction recorded and the penalty may be much less than if it went to trial. We have to be very, very careful about a system that seeks to take away a person’s right to be able to have a trial and something which, in many cases due to the lack of appropriate resourcing, restricts access to legal representation. I might speak in a little while about some of the concerns within the DPP which, on the other side, is also creating issues within the justice system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053186"></A>
The proposed changes to the existing section 525A of the Criminal Code effectively mean a rewrite of the entire section. The proposed section 525A provides that the following offences must be fully and finally dealt with in the Magistrates Court: any offence where the maximum penalty is not more than three years imprisonment--for example, sedition, electoral offences, official secrets offences and offences relating to the procurement of abortion; and any offence relating to property and contracts that is not a serious offence, which typically includes offences with a prescribed value of under $30,000, including theft, fraud, forgery, wilful damage and burglary. This means that an accused person will no longer have the ability to elect to have a trial by jury for a large number of offences.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053187"></A>
I want to express my serious concern, shared by the Queensland Law Society, at the fact that the jurisdictional change will result in sections 98E, 98F and 98G of the Criminal Code being required to be heard and decided summarily. This Labor government explicitly removed these offences from the Electoral Act and inserted them into the Criminal Code after the CMC Shepherdson inquiry due to the serious nature of the offences. I wonder if the Deputy Premier had any input into this decision, given his history with the Shepherdson inquiry and a technicality that has kept him in this parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053188"></A>
I can accept the widening of the summary jurisdiction and that it will see many more accused people plead guilty in the Magistrates Court rather than face the cost and delay of being sentenced in the District Court. The earlier disposition of appropriate cases in the Magistrates Court can--and I say can--better achieve resource efficiency and cost savings. In speaking to the removal of right to trial by jury, the Moynihan report observes that--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1053189"></A>
...there is a lack of reliable data to indicate how many matters that could be dealt with by the Magistrates Court are currently being dealt with in the District and Supreme Courts. In the absence of the availability of figures but relying on such data as is, and on anecdotal evidence, it would appear that something in the region of half to three quarters of the matters presently heard in the District and Supreme Court could be dealt with in the Magistrates Court. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053190"></A>
A general observation by the Law Society in its submission on this reform is that it represents a substantial reduction in the centuries’ old right to elect trial by jury. I agree with the society when it says that not only is the removal of this right for individuals charged with certain categories of offences deeply concerning; the lack of sound evidence based justification for such a reform is equally troubling. The Law Society notes that at no stage did the Moynihan report directly imply that people are currently abusing their right to elect trial by jury by having minor matters inappropriately heard in the District Court. With a lack of proper detail from the government of any such abuse, the society queries--and I agree--the necessity for such a substantial reform. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053191"></A>
When one is dealing with serious offences of dishonesty, where the offender is not being judged by a group of their peers, I am not saying the evidentiary standard is less, but certainly the capacity to be able to question, the capacity to be able to influence and the capacity to be able to adduce all aspects of the case can be somewhat reduced, in my opinion and in the opinion of others, if this matter is dealt with summarily vis-à-vis being tried in a higher jurisdiction before a jury.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057046"></A>
Let us look at those offences of dishonesty and others which have now been taken out and, as I understand, are being called chapter 6 offences and are being put into the summary jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court. A finding of guilt at that level if the matter is dealt with summarily can really impact upon that person’s standing for a long period. A dishonesty offence is something that hangs around for a long period; it goes on for life. Notwithstanding the statutory limitations that exist with regard to the determination of criminal offences in Queensland, if people have been reported as being involved in a crime of dishonesty then, frankly, that is going to affect the personal and professional reputation of those persons for a very, very long period. I have some serious concerns with regard to that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057048"></A>
The Queensland Police Union has raised some concerns in its discussions. I understand that a number of concerns could have been raised by the Queensland Police Service as well which may not necessarily be on the public record. They are matters on which I would like to hear from the Attorney-General when he speaks in reply a little later on. It is very important that this parliament gets a clear indication of that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057050"></A>
It has been recognised by the Police Union that there is a need to streamline committals. It identified that it is not unusual for police to summon all witnesses for their case only to be told on the day that a full hand-up has been negotiated. The Police Union acknowledged that, in theory, the proposed changes indicate a streamlining of court process. There appears to be a greater amount of faith placed in magistrates that they will follow the intent of the changes and limit the number of full committals to where necessary. Based on its submission, the Police Union is of the view that, based on precedent from the High Court surrounding committals and the reasons for witnesses to be called, it seems unlikely that such applications for full committals would be denied. So, again, the Queensland Police Union is somewhat sceptical about this process, which is seeking to basically restrict to a negligible level the number of full committal hearings which are going to be granted to those people in question. Based on those indications from the High Court, there is every reason to have that particular concern. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057053"></A>
One very real concern that has been raised by the Police Union in its assessment of the proposed changes is that of different magistrates appearing on the original application for leave to have a witness give oral evidence and at the subsequent committal hearing itself. As the union points out, magistrates are not bound by the decisions of fellow magistrates. This is exampled through existing issues around section 83A directions to enable a witness to give evidence by phone. Currently, directions hearings are finding that one magistrate approves the request only for the matter to be listed before another magistrate who then refuses evidence by telephone, stating clearly that they are not bound by the previous magistrate’s decision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057056"></A>
I now turn to the proposed amendments to the Bail Act. These amendments will have two separate outcomes. The first will see bail applications able to be heard by remote communication device, even if the application is made outside the relevant jurisdiction. The second part will introduce bail variations by way of a registry committal. Given that the government is proposing to strip away the right of an accused to a committal, which is not supported by the LNP, we could not support the proposed changes to bail variations through a registry committal. We were promised reform, yet the government has failed to adequately give us any real reform in the area of bail. Will these amendments in any way afford the community any greater protection from repeat and serial offenders, or will this expedite matters more quickly? Perhaps in a small number of remote areas it will make bail applications easier, but it will trivialise bail applications and variations to nothing more than administrative processes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057058"></A>
In turning to the proposed changes to the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997, I have to ask why there are large parts of the bill that are totally unrelated to court reform. These amendments are just that. Once again, we are correcting errors made previously in relation to the QCAT jurisdiction. This amendment should be debated on its own merits and not tied to this government’s court jurisdiction shuffle. It effectively states in law that adjudicators do not have jurisdiction to hear their disputes. Disclosure issues are one issue that to date have not been properly defined, properly explained or properly thought out. The proposed changes in relation to disclosure provide no guidance to police, defence, DPP or our courts on what precisely this is. The Police Service will be placed in a very difficult position when working to meet this objective. The question has been raised as to why issues of disclosure have not been extended to include the defence so that they may disclose evidence that could resolve a matter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057061"></A>
I want to again highlight the issue of data gathering in the justice system. In his review of the civil and criminal jurisdictions, Moynihan has levelled criticism at information management and lack of information through the justice system. He wrote that reliable, up-to-date, accurate and accessible data is the lifeblood of a criminal justice system. It challenges entrenched beliefs and perceptions and it provides a foundation to secure funding. What was found was that available data was fragmented, unreliable and incoherent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057063"></A>
The bill also deals with the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2003. In speaking to the amendment to this act, I have to start by acknowledging the incredible mess this government has created in WorkCover by its mismanagement of this act and the organisation charged with its administration. It says that this amendment will go some way to reducing the workload of matters coming into our courts but puts additional pressures on the industrial commission. But given that this Labor government sold out our IR system, perhaps the commission is struggling to find meaning and this transfer will go some way to justifying its existence, especially when nothing has been done to prosecute this government for failing to properly pay its own workers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057066"></A>
Further, the bill seeks to amend the Youth Justice Act 1992. The amendments to the Youth Justice Act are linked with the jurisdictional changes proposed in terms of what offences can be heard summarily. We have to realise that the Children’s Court in Queensland is not performing very well. When we consider its court backlog, serious questions need to be asked about how these changes will do anything to combat the congestion. The most telling sign of the Children’s Court problems is the fact that around 75 per cent of children in youth detention are there on remand, held in custody without conviction. Many of these children are never sentenced to actual terms of detention at the conclusion of their matters. This raises the issue of the sentencing principle of young offenders and the need to access rehabilitation for young offenders. Many of them cannot access rehabilitation until their matter is finalised. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057069"></A>
This is an extremely serious matter. It is not unusual in a youth detention facility to find a young person who has been held on remand there for a matter of weeks or some months. When they actually go before the Children’s Court, an order is made that that child be released immediately--that there is guilt surrounding their particular offence but that the penalty is the time that young person, that child, has been held in custody and so they are ordered to be released immediately. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057070"></A>
Let me outline one of the problems with that. Let us say that young offender is found to have actually committed serious offences, maybe sexual offences against others. The fact that they had not been found guilty when they were on remand--of course they could not be, but they were in there; they were basically being held--meant that they were not able to undertake any programs to help them or address the particular offending behaviour. They are found guilty, but the time they have spent on remand is considered their penalty. They are released into the community but there has been no practical rehabilitation of their offending behaviour. This is an extremely serious issue which is being swept under the carpet by this government. It does need to be dealt with in some way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057108"></A>
There needs to be some capacity for orders to be made to assist those children in a rehabilitative sense to address their offending behaviour. Being on remand without access to programs does not address that. All it does is unfairly condemn the young offender to an endless cycle of criminality. They have to have access to programs that address their offending behaviour in the early stages of that offending behaviour. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057109"></A>
Finally, I want to turn to a very concerning element of this bill, which has nothing to do with the proposed civil and criminal jurisdiction reform. It is the sneaky money grabbing by the government to prop up the consolidated revenue with unclaimed moneys currently being held in the Public Trust Office. Last year the public trustee returned a $9.5 million operating deficit. It is not clear how and where this money will go, or how much is currently held and will be transferred. I would like the Attorney-General to tell us how much of the money that is held currently by the public trustee will be transferred when this bill is given royal assent. How much money will move across? Is it a matter of hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057110"></A>
The government tries to assuage these concerns by saying that only moneys that have been unclaimed for a period of five years will be transferred to consolidated revenue. Of course, the government then says that the money to be transferred across to consolidated revenue can be claimed back if somebody can legitimately establish that they have a right to that money. That sounds fair enough. The government is going to argue that we can use this money until such time as it is claimed. The fact that this government has gone broke in a broom, has lost its AAA rating and is now bumping around the bottom of the barrel with New South Wales when it comes to economic performance is driving this government to raid all the hollow logs it possibly can. This is vintage Labor. In particular, it is vintage long-term Labor. If there is a hollow log, if there is an amount of money available, it will grab it and put it somewhere else so that it can spend it. Then what happens? When a call is made on that money, it has to find it somewhere else. We need only look at the Treasurer’s advance fund, which always contained several hundreds of millions of dollars, but which has been progressively whittled away by the government. The government works on the basis that if there is an unforeseen issue, it can vote itself more money, borrow more money or whatever the case may be. That is not prudent financial management. Therefore, I would like the Attorney-General to tell us how much money is sitting in the fund now and how much of it has been sitting there for longer than five years. The parliament would like to hear the answer to that question and, certainly, I would like to hear it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057111"></A>
Our other concern relates to the provision that states there will be no public register showing amounts of money unclaimed for 25 years or more. If money has been unclaimed for more than 25 years, there will be no public register of it. Some people might say, ‘That’s fair enough because after 25 years really it’s dead money, they mustn’t really want it and who really cares?’ However, situations can arise, and they are rare but quite spectacular, where people claim moneys after just such a long period. Of course, under the law in Queensland the capacity will still exist for a person to make a claim for an amount that has been removed from the register after 25 years, but they will have no immediate way of knowing if there is an amount sitting on the register because there will be no register for amounts that have been sitting there for more than 25 years. You will not be able to go into a registry and look at the amounts that have been sitting there for more than 25 years. Automatically that becomes a deterrent, as people will not be able to search easily for amounts that have been sitting there for more than 25 years, even if they believe that they have a justifiable claim on an amount of unclaimed money. We are not talking about gold diggers or people who are making some sort of ambit claim. We are talking about people who have to establish a very serious commitment and a very serious association with an amount of money. There is no automatic handout. They have to clearly establish, through identification and a range of other factual measures, that they have a claim on that amount of money. However, the public registry will no longer list amounts that have been there for longer than 25 years. I do not think that is right and I do not think there is a justification for it. It may very well be that the majority of that money remains unclaimed or, indeed, is never claimed, but we have to be very careful about making it more difficult for people to claim what could be reasonably theirs. The LNP is most concerned about that provision. </Hansard-Body>

Like much in the Labor Party, the Civil and Criminal Justice Reform and the Modernisation Amendment Bill 2010 promises much, but the reality is that it will not deliver very much at all. If we look at some of the fundamental departures from established centuries-old legal precedents and people’s right to trial by jury and the ability to comprehensively adduce and test the evidence against them, there has been a diminution of those rights as proposed in the legislation before the parliament. In order for a parliament to make a proper decision on these things, we need more evidence than we have been given today and over the past couple of years. Former Justice Moynihan, who made these recommendations, said that he had great difficulty in comprehensively finding supporting data to assist him along the way, so we need to be extremely concerned. We wish to ask some extremely serious questions about the practicalities of this and the effect that it will have. For example, it may increase the workload of the courts in many areas. Can the government comprehensively address the issue of access? As the population of Queensland grows, will access grow proportionately compared to what we have now? Will access to legal aid increase, so that people have help defending themselves and will know clearly what they are getting themselves in for? As you reduce trial by jury, you go towards paper committals. They are the reasons we are extremely concerned about this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057113"></A>
On the other hand, our prosecution service, the Queensland Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, is staffed by extremely competent, diligent professionals who feel that they have been left unheard by their political masters when it comes to the resources that they need to competently do their job on behalf of the people of Queensland, which is prosecuting those people who have been accused of offences. We have seen the growing practice of plea bargaining, which downgrades more serious charges to lesser charges to ensure a plea of guilty or a potential conviction. I do not think that that is the way the system should work. There is some significant evidence to support that view. There is an almost 30 per cent turnover in the Queensland Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. A term that is used by people in the DPP is the ‘juniorisation’ of the service, which has a case load twice that of New South Wales. Junior prosecutors are handling matters that they have only had in their hands for a relatively short period. They are going up against extremely well funded and experienced senior counsel for the defence. That can lead to the justice system being tipped the wrong way. It does not enhance the effective prosecution of serious criminal matters against the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057114"></A>
Based on that, the LNP has some extremely serious concerns about the bill before the parliament. We are not alone in expressing those concerns. Certainly, the Criminal Law Division of the Queensland Law Society and the Queensland Police Union are concerned. We understand the Police Service is also concerned, as are a whole range of legally qualified practitioners and legal academics throughout Queensland and Australia. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (3.08 pm): I rise today to make a contribution to the Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction Reform and Modernisation Amendment Bill, tabled in this parliament by the Attorney-General. The objectives of the bill are to expand the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Courts to determine indictable offences under the Criminal Code and Drugs Misuse Act 1986; to increase the general criminal jurisdiction of the District Court from offences with a maximum penalty of 14 years or less to those with a maximum of 20 years or less; and to increase the monetary limit for civil disputes in the District Court to $750,000 and in the Magistrates Court to $150,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061160"></A>
The bill also provides specific powers for the courts to deal with noncompliance with disclosure obligations in criminal cases and to streamline the committal process and the management of matters in the Magistrates Courts which proceed by way of ex-officio indictment. In short, the aim of this legislation is to provide a detailed overview of the proposed changes to jurisdictional matters in both the criminal and civil courts.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061161"></A>
The bill makes amendments to more than 20 acts. The bill makes amendments to allow for the transfer of unclaimed moneys in the public trust account into consolidated revenue and amends the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act regarding disputes, and changes the jurisdiction in which some workers compensation matters can be heard.</Hansard-Body>

In July 2008 the Hon. Martin Moynihan AO QC was appointed to conduct a review of the civil and criminal justice system in Queensland and to report on the workings of the courts in the civil and criminal jurisdictions with a view to making more effective use of public resources. This report was publicly released on 21 July 2009. From the outset, the Liberal National Party has grave concerns with this legislation. It does not reform or modernise the courts in the state of Queensland, and the changes proposed do not streamline court proceedings. This is yet another example of a Labor government shifting the deck chairs on the <Hansard-Italic>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061163"></A>
The courts in Queensland already handle over 300,000 matters each year, and it is no secret that there is a significant backlog of cases, in particular in criminal proceedings, where almost 30 per cent of these matters have been delayed, and a further 42 per cent of civil matters were delayed in the past year. This Labor government has made no commitment to increasing resources to either police prosecutors or Legal Aid, both of whom have had a significant increase in their workloads. This legislation will increase the workload of the Magistrates Court, and there is no significant increase in funding, as I said, to police prosecutors to manage the expected workload increase. This is yet another example of a government which is not listening to recommendations as a result of inquiries that the government itself asked for.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061164"></A>
The local community in Mudgeeraba has a zero tolerance to crime, as clearly shown by the uptake of incentives such as Hoon Watch and Graffiti Watch to empower locals to assist police. What is the point of communities working hand in hand with the police when either cases do not get to court in a timely manner or, worse still, pathetic slap-on-the-wrist judgements are given to offenders who are back out on the street the very next day committing the same offences all over again? Queenslanders are sick of the sleight of hand trickery of this Labor government and they want to see real and honest reforms that do not tie the system up with more red tape. They want a system where justice and penalties are meted out as deserved and in a time frame that is relevant to both the crime itself and the community as a whole.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061165"></A>
Queensland is vying for the top position with states with a bigger population, such as Victoria and New South Wales, for the biggest backlog of cases. A media release put out by the Victorian shadow Attorney-General, Robert Clark, on 2 February this year demonstrates that every state Labor government has presided over blowouts in this area, and even with legislation such as that which we are debating here in this House today, the backlog of cases will not clear if moneys are not provided to increase the number of prosecutors to facilitate faster resolution of cases. The media release states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1061168"></A>
“Years of delays are creating trauma and distress for victims, their families and witnesses, while thousands likely to be found guilty of violent crimes are walking free and unpunished,” Mr Clark said. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1061169"></A>
“Long delays are undermining respect for the law and public confidence in the justice system. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1061170"></A>
“These delays mean the community is not being protected from violent thugs, sentences applied long after the crime are having little deterrent effect, and any rehabilitation measures are years too late. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1061171"></A>
“Delays increase the chances of guilty persons escaping justice due to witnesses’ memories fading or other evidence being lost, while on the other hand innocent people can have serious charges hanging over their heads for years. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061172"></A>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr BLEIJIE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kawana--LNP) (3.13 pm): I rise to speak to the Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction Reform and Modernisation Amendment Bill 2010, which is before the House today. I must say at the outset that I am quite surprised that this bill has come before the House today in the midst of a federal election campaign. With all the issues facing Queenslanders, we are debating this bill today. I would have thought there would be more pressing issues. Perhaps we will put it down to the real Julia Gillard asking the real Bligh government to lay low for the next few weeks--nothing too controversial. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061175"></A>
The bill will significantly alter the jurisdiction of the magistrates, district and supreme courts; remove the right to trial by jury; and remove the right to cross-examine at the committal stage. The bill is a response to a review of the operation of the civil and criminal jurisdictions in Queensland conducted by the Hon. Martin Moynihan AO QC and his report that was released on 21 July 2009. The bill will amend some 22 pieces of legislation including the Criminal Code, the Drugs Misuse Act and the Justices Act 1886. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061177"></A>
The bill seeks to expand the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Courts to determine indictable offences under the Criminal Code and Drugs Misuse Act. It also increases the monetary limit for civil disputes in the District Court to $750,000 and in the Magistrates Court to $150,000. In the Attorney-General’s second reading speech, he stated that these ‘reforms aim to make more effective use of public resources to deliver improvements across the justice system, thereby delivering improved justice to Queenslanders’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061182"></A>
The Moynihan report states that ‘it would appear that something in the region of half to three-quarters of the matters presently heard in the District and Supreme Court could be dealt with in the Magistrates Court’. In the Australian Productivity Commission’s 2010 report on government services, we saw that the Queensland Magistrates Court system had a backlog of a total of 67,413 matters comprised of 32,304 criminal matters and 35,109 civil matters, making Queensland’s Magistrates Court system the most inefficient in Australia. We can just add it to the list of the things that this state Labor government cannot manage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061186"></A>
The expansion of the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court to deal with indictable offences and to deal with civil disputes of increased monetary limits is in no way an effective use of public resources and will in no way deliver improved justice to Queenslanders. For this government to add more cases to this already congested system shows that the Bligh government has no consideration or understanding of how overworked and gridlocked the system is already. In 2009, the backlog of the Queensland Magistrates Court increased from an already high case load in 2008 of 69,619 matters. This was with the assistance of the judicial registrar scheme, which was set up as a two-year trial in an effort to ease the pressure on Queensland’s busiest Magistrates Courts. The judicial registrars were appointed to hear minor court matters that had previously been heard by a magistrate, including matters such as minor debt claims and small claims, civil chamber applications and domestic violence adjournments, temporary orders and orders by consent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061193"></A>
Instead of looking at ways to actually make the congested Queensland justice system more efficient, the Bligh government is simply shifting the jurisdiction goal posts and removing personal rights and liberties for all Queenslanders. This bill is a campaign by the government to appear to bring about a more efficient justice system. But, in effect, this bill removes fundamental rights and freedoms of the people of Queensland. Last year we saw the Bligh government strip away the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people of Queensland through the passing of the Criminal Organisation Bill 2009. At the time we debated those laws I reminded the House that it was actually Kevin Rudd who said that Labor believes in the freedom of association as a democratic right for all Australians. He made that comment in 2007 in the document ‘Forward with fairness’. It appears Kevin Rudd was moving forward well prior to Julia Gillard. But, if he had known that he was moving forward to a sharp knife in the back, he may have taken another road at the time. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061196"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 They are forwards, backwards, sideways. Through the bill that is before the House today, we are witnessing the Bligh government’s further attack on these fundamental rights and freedoms--the right to a jury trial, a right first established by the Magna Carta in 1215, and the right to cross-examine during committal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061197"></A>
In the Queensland Law Society’s submission to the draft bill in 2009, the society stated that it is ‘strongly opposed to the indiscriminate removal of the fundamental and historical right of an accused to elect to be tried by a jury of his peers. Reformation of the criminal justice system should restate and reaffirm fundamental rights, not remove them’. I absolutely agree with this statement. I note that on the speaking list we have most of the lefty libertarian lawyers on the other side of the House. I am very interested to hear their contribution in relation to limiting rights of defendants to a fair trial and the right to trial by jury, as is the case now. I am very much looking forward to those hot topics when those members get up and speak later today. I hope that we will hear the members’ real opinions on these matters, particularly the lawyers--the ones who call themselves libertarian lawyers from the Left. I do hope that we hear the members’ real opinions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061236"></A>
The society goes on to state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1061238"></A>
At no time does the Moynihan Report directly suggest that citizens are currently abusing their right to elect Trial by Jury by having minor matters inappropriately heard in the District Court. If such abuse is not occurring, the Society queries the need for such a substantial reform. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061239"></A>
Through this bill we are witnessing the stripping away of the right to a trial by jury without a clear basis for its removal. Both the Queensland Law Society and the Council for Civil Liberties have suggested that the efficiency sought by the government could be achieved by providing defendants the right to choose to have offences dealt with by the Magistrates Court without a jury rather than in the Supreme Court and District Court. It is suggested that many defendants would elect to have their offences dealt with by a magistrate in the Magistrates Court for reasons of speed and to reduce the legal costs. But that is a right that they should maintain. This proposal of election, rather than the government’s proposal to merely strip away the right to a trial by jury, would most likely result in the number of matters dealt with by the District Court and Supreme Court decreasing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061242"></A>
Another essential freedom, and one that runs to the heart of the legal system, is the fundamental right to a fair trial. This bill will amend the Justices Act to remove the right to be cross-examined during committal--a process that is used to clarify issues, refine charges, negotiate pleas and identify weak cases and processes that support a fundamental right to a fair trial. This was clearly outlined by the honourable shadow Attorney-General. The amendments will restrict the right to call and cross-examine a prosecution witness unless the prosecution consents or the magistrate is satisfied that there are substantial reasons why the witness should be called. In the Queensland Law Society submission the society set out that--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1061247"></A>
... in the majority of committals where cross examination occurs, one or more witnesses will alter their account, will offer new evidence that has not been told to the police, or will depart from the evidence given in their statement. If such evidence is given at trial, in many cases the jury will need to be discharged and a retrial ordered, substantially increasing costs and inefficiencies in the superior courts. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061248"></A>
These particular parts of this legislation may have the opposite impact on our judicial and court system in Queensland than the government intends. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061249"></A>
Accordingly, the restriction of the right to cross-examine witnesses at committal will result in issues arising in superior courts as a result of untested evidence and superior courts dealing with issues that could have been flushed out through cross-examination during the committal process. This will result in delays for Queenslanders and additional costs to Queenslanders and all taxpayers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061250"></A>
This bill will have a significant impact not only on the Magistrates Court case load but also on the workload for Legal Aid and police prosecutors. The government has not proposed any additional funding to meet the expected increased workload for Legal Aid or police prosecutors. However, after witnessing the cost of living expenses spiral out of control over the past 16 months under the Bligh government, I am sure that the people of Queensland can expect to be hit with a levy or tax to cover the cost of this so-called reform. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061252"></A>
Once again, I challenge the members of the government to simply not toe the party line but for once to actually think about the people in their electorates, whom they are elected to represent, and to stand up for the rights of Queensland citizens today by voting against the aspects and parts of this bill that blatantly disregards the freedoms that the people of Queensland should have the right to enjoy. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SHINE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba North--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.23 pm): It is a pleasure to speak on the Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction Reform and Modernisation Amendment Bill 2010. As we all know, the old saying goes that justice delayed is justice denied. This bill is all about trying to do something to remedy that situation and that explains why we are debating this subject matter here today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061255"></A>
Certainly after listening to the previous speaker one would get the impression that delays in the administration of justice are a recent phenomenon. I can assure the honourable gentleman that since I first joined a legal firm in 1967 the problems with delays in the hearing of trials in Queensland have always been there. Of course, from 1967 to 1989 the administration of justice in Queensland was under the honourable member’s side of politics. However, Queensland was not much different in reality to the other states and Australia was not much different to other countries. It is one of those things we have had to put up with. Nevertheless, there comes a time when these issues should be tackled properly. With the increase in litigation over the last couple of decades, the time to do so has certainly arisen. I congratulate the Attorney for proceeding with this bill at this time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061256"></A>
I suppose over that time the reasons for delays in the hearing of cases have been varied. They might relate to simply the volume of cases awaiting hearing. They might relate to the complexity or length of some cases. They may be criminal matters, fraud cases or very complex commercial cases that literally go for months. In some cases over the years it certainly has related to the availability or the unavailability, if you like, of judges. Too few judges had been appointed. In many cases I think it related to the aptitude, the attitude and the integrity of lawyers of different qualities. In some instances, it certainly related to the conscientiousness and efficiency of those hearing the cases--the judges--as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061257"></A>
I remember when I was an articled clerk that it was of some remark in the profession that a very senior member of the Supreme Court bench had to come back from retirement to deliver a judgement, the trial of which had been heard several years before his retirement. It gave an instance of even a person in that exalted position really failing to do his part in terms of the expeditious administration of justice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061258"></A>
Another instance I am aware of--and I will not mention his name--is of a person who rose to one of the highest, and I mean one of the highest, positions of judiciary in Australia and took two to three years to deliver an opinion to a solicitor for whom I worked at one stage. When he did deliver the opinion he put a note on the bottom saying, ‘I apologise for the inordinate delay.’ That was the end of that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061259"></A>
The effect of delay is not just inconvenience, it is huge cost. It is inevitable that the longer a case takes to be dealt with in any court--whether the Magistrates Court, District Court, Supreme Court or Federal Court--due to frequent adjournments because of the need to see people again, retake statements, rewrite letters, make telephone calls and all the rest of it, the more the costs of litigation increase substantially. The reasons for delay are varied. There are probably many more situations than just the ones I have mentioned. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061260"></A>
I had the prospect of having to do something about that when I was appointed Attorney in 2006. There were increasing delays, as I recall, in the District Court. I knew that something had to be done about it. In the Supreme Court the position was fairly well fixed by the appointment of the appropriate number of judges, particularly judges who were qualified to deal with complex matters in relation to the commercial area. That was done over a fairly short period of time. The Attorney will comment on this, but I think the situation with the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal is quite respectable. I congratulate the justices in that regard, and particularly the Chief Justice and current judge administrator, Justice Byrne, on what they have been able to achieve. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061262"></A>
The District Court is an extremely busy court. The problems there were addressed likewise with the appointment of extra judges. Likewise, extra magistrates have been appointed to the Magistrates Court since 2006. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065503"></A>
There is a limit to the number of judges and magistrates one should appoint. There is the extra cost to the public purse from not just the judges and magistrates but also the attendant officers and clerks that go with those positions. There is also the office space, capital expense and so on associated with those extra appointments. The government of the day has to be conscious of its responsibility to the public purse in relation to how many judges and magistrates should or can be appointed. It is therefore imperative that one looks elsewhere to create efficiencies and one looks elsewhere to see what is happening in other jurisdictions that might be dealing with the matter in some other more inventive way. Those efficiencies elsewhere might relate to how indictable offences are dealt with other than in the District Court or Supreme Court; how committals are dealt with or how they are shortened or made more efficient; how disclosure of cases, particularly by the prosecution, is dealt with; and such things as conferencing between the prosecuting body--in our case, the DPP--and the defence, and I am largely speaking in that regard about Legal Aid.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065506"></A>
It was with these thoughts in mind that the government appointed the Hon. Justice Moynihan in 2008. He had just retired early from the Supreme Court bench and he had been the Judge Administrator in that jurisdiction for some time. He was an extremely highly regarded justice and lawyer in Queensland and his appointment was universally applauded. As a result he came up with recommendations, many of which are the subject of this bill today. I place on record my thanks as a member of parliament and a member of the community to former Justice Martin Moynihan for the extremely diligent way in which he performed the task of preparing such a valuable document. As has been mentioned--certainly it has been the subject of comment in the Queensland Parliamentary Library research brief--not all of the Hon. Moynihan’s recommendations were adopted. Some were not adopted in relation to prosecution disclosure as I understand it, although from my reading of the material the disclosure, the compulsory disclosure and the sanctions against nondisclosure go a great deal further than the current situation that applies. So it is a very substantial reform overall. He did recommend some matters that the government did not take up or gave qualified support to or supported but said it would not do anything about quite yet.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065510"></A>
Former Justice Moynihan referred to the need to strengthen the committal test. At the moment under the Justices Act the magistrate has to decide whether the evidence is sufficient to put the defendant on trial. In other words, is there a prima facie case against the defendant and has it been made out? Former Justice Moynihan in his report suggested that the New South Wales position be adopted where the magistrate determines whether or not there is a reasonable prospect that a reasonable jury properly instructed would convict the defendant of an indictable offence. That is a higher threshold which, logically one would think, would mean fewer committals. As I understand it, the government’s response indicates that the facts do not indicate that. The Attorney might be able to give us a little more insight into why that was not adopted. It would seem to me to be a fairly cost-effective reform with, on the face of it, some real benefits. So I would certainly ask the Attorney to give us a greater insight as to why that reform was not proceeded further, likewise with the recommendation for case conferencing. Most trials, even in the criminal area and certainly in the civil area, are unfortunately still settled on the door of the court after a period of time when all of the costs have been built up, all of the work has been done and all of the time and the delays that I spoke about earlier have taken place.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065515"></A>
If we could have a system similar to what operates in a compulsory way in the civil jurisdiction with respect to compulsory conferences, we could have a system in the criminal area where the Crown, or the DPP, and Legal Aid and the defence are required to have meaningful discussions to try to limit the issues involved, perhaps to arrive at a compromise where pleas might be agreed to. At an early stage this would appear to me to make eminent sense, and that certainly was in the thinking of those involved with me in considering ways and means of streamlining the system. It may be that the DPP was opposed to this. I can certainly recall that the Legal Aid Commission was very much an advocate of it, as was the profession generally. I would also ask the Attorney to expand on why that case conferencing recommendation was not adopted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065519"></A>
The increased role of the ODPP and prosecutions and the advice and support role for the ODPP given to police seemed eminently sensible and in my mind would enhance the integrity of the Police Service in terms of its prosecutory role and the regard in which the justice system is held in the public eye. These all seemed to me to be worthwhile suggestions and I am really unclear as to why they were not proceeded with. Hopefully they have not been ruled out but are matters which the government is still considering or may revisit down the track. I hope that is the case, but, nevertheless, I would appreciate the Attorney spending a bit of time explaining to the House the reasoning behind the government’s views in relation to its response.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065522"></A>
Finally, I do note that the number of cases now to be dealt with in the Magistrates Court summarily, as opposed to on indictment before a jury in the Supreme and District Court, is to be further limited, in particular Drugs Misuse Act matters for example. The realities of life are that there has to be some restriction of rights in order to ensure that the administration of justice does proceed expeditiously. There is a balancing act to be undertaken here, and in that process I would have thought it is proper for the government to look elsewhere as to what happens in other jurisdictions and other parts of the world to ensure that Queensland remains in step so far as the civil liberties of its citizens are concerned. I certainly do not have any worries about that after looking at this legislation. We can always regret what might have been in the old days, but we do not live in the old days; we live in the 21st century. And it is the responsibility of governments and this government--and I congratulate the Attorney for taking up the responsibility that he has--to address the realities of life in 21st century legal life. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs SCOTT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Woodridge--ALP) (3.38 pm): I stand to speak on the Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction Reform and Modernisation Amendment Bill 2010 as a member without any special legal training but a member of the Attorney-General’s committee who has a high interest in seeing our justice system keep abreast of the times and adopt recommendations and observations of other jurisdictions which will ensure the most efficient and fair administration of justice in our state. The Hon. Martin Moynihan AO, QC was tasked with conducting a substantial review of the civil and justice system in Queensland, and this bill--the first stage of a modernisation program--has adopted many of his recommendations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069615"></A>
This is indicative of many of our departments as part of the reforms being undertaken by this Bligh Labor government. In so many of our departments we are seeing considerable reform and renewal and, in many instances, government departments working in a much more collaborative way. Following Mr Moynihan’s report, extensive consultation took place and public comment was sought following the preparation of the draft bill. The final result will see the expansion of the matters dealt with on a summary basis in the Magistrates Court to include indictable offences in the Criminal Code that may attract penalties of up to three years, property offences where the amount involved is less than $30,000, or when the defendant pleads guilty. I note that flexibility will still reside with the magistrate and that the serious matters of robbery, arson and corruption will be excluded from the new mandatory summary disposition category. These measures will mean a saving in court time and in the expense of professional and judicial officers and will lead to more efficiencies and improved outcomes for the victims of crime, with cases resolved much earlier. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069616"></A>
The expansion of matters dealt with by the Magistrates Court will also apply to drug issues, which could result in imprisonment in excess of 15 years with the exception of an offence for commercial dealing. At the present time the Supreme Court is the jurisdiction tasked with dealing with possession of three grams of ecstasy for personal use for a first-time offence. This type of offence will now be transferred to the Magistrates Court and will have the added benefit of enabling many more drug users to be subject to the Drug Court and drug diversionary procedures. This very intensive program has resulted in many successful outcomes for defendants, with services wrapped around them and the opportunity to turn their lives around and start a new life. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069618"></A>
Other changes to be effected include the transference of workers’ compensation appeals to the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission, thus freeing up additional capacity in the Magistrates Court. In recognition of the change in monetary values, the District Court jurisdiction will now deal with matters up to $750,000--increased from $250,000--while the Magistrates Court will have jurisdiction to deal with matters to $150,000, increased from $50,000. These reforms will appropriately allow increased capacity for the Supreme Court to deal with the higher end of the judicial process. Other issues dealt with include the committal process being more restrictive, bail applications being made from remote locations, the recovery of unclaimed funds through the Public Trustee, body corporate matters and the suspension of driver’s licences. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069621"></A>
Before I resume my seat I wish to thank the Attorney-General for recently visiting my electorate to discuss the issues of shared services and to address issues within the area. Importantly, for a number of years there has been a desire to have a Murri Court to allow our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who come before the court access to culturally appropriate justice involving our elders.</Hansard-Body>

 Yes, and one in Richlands and one in Brisbane, but none in Logan, unfortunately.

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind) (3.43 pm): I rise to contribute to the debate on the Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction Reform and Modernisation Amendment Bill. I note that the objectives of the bill are to expand the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court to determine indictable offences in the Criminal Code and the Drugs Misuse Act 1986, to increase the general criminal jurisdiction of the District Court from offences with a maximum penalty of 14 years or less to those with a maximum of 20 years or less and to increase the monetary limit for civil disputes in the District Court to $750,000 and in the Magistrates Court to $150,000. There are a range of other objectives that other members have also commented on and I will not put the House through that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069627"></A>
In terms of the reasons for the bill, as we have heard, in 2008 the Hon. Martin Moynihan AO, QC was appointed to conduct a review of the civil and criminal justice system in Queensland with the aim of making recommendations for the possible improvement of our justice system to ensure a more effective use of public resources. The review examined monetary limits for the civil jurisdiction of the District and Magistrates courts, the summary disposition of indictable offences, sentencing discounts for an early plea of guilty, possible reform of the committal proceedings process and case conferencing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069628"></A>
A number of important stakeholder comments are worth repeating in the debate today. The past president of the Queensland Law Society, Ian Berry, said that the society had for some months been heavily involved and had provided very detailed submissions to Martin Moynihan in the course of his review. He stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069631"></A>
Generally speaking, we support increasing the range of offences that can be dealt with by magistrates, again provided accused persons retain the right to choose to have indictable offences dealt with by a jury if they wish. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069632"></A>
We have also made detailed submissions in relation to the issues of prosecution disclosure and reform of the committal process. We believe the current prosecution disclosure regime has not been a success, and requires a significant overhaul. Increased disclosure obligations and compliance measures directed towards police, combined with better training of police, will assist with this. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069633"></A>
I will touch on this matter briefly in a few moments. The Queensland Law Society’s executive summary in its submission to the response has a number of comments that are worth repeating as well. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069635"></A>
It is our opinion that the Government’s response to the Moynihan Report and the Draft Bill itself are a product of selective and narrow consultation and we have little confidence that, in its current form, the result will be an efficient, cost-effective and fair civil and criminal justice system for the benefit of all Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069636"></A>
The society goes on to say--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069638"></A>
The Society is simply concerned that reforms should not prefer the convenience of the Government and its officers to the plight of consumers in the system. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069640"></A>
Fundamentally the Society expects that the proposed reforms will have vastly greater resource and cost implications than anticipated by the Government. In our view these reforms will in no way achieve cost neutrality. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069641"></A>
These are quite serious concerns and I ask that the Attorney-General address these very serious concerns in his summation. The Law Society also goes on to state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069643"></A>
The criminal law reforms will place significant pressure on the resources of the Magistrates Court, legal aid service providers and the police prosecution systems. It is particularly concerning that the Government does not appear to acknowledge this and has not provided any indication that additional funding will accompany the commencement of the legislation. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069644"></A>
Once again, that is another issue that I hope the Attorney-General addresses and details to the House exactly how much extra funding--or if any funding--is available to ensure that, should this legislation pass, and I assume that it will, the government will back this legislation with hard cash. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069645"></A>
A media article suggested that Queenslanders risk losing the right to trial by jury. The President of the Queensland Law Society, Peter Eardley, voiced the society’s objections to the proposed reforms under this legislation by stating--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1069648"></A>
Having your case heard by a jury is one of our most fundamental rights. Removing this right for so many serious offences is a direct attack on an essential element of our democracy. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069649"></A>
Once again, that is an important point that should be addressed in the Attorney-General’s summation of this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069650"></A>
There are more concerns, but the speakers before me have addressed many of those concerns and I look forward to listening intently to the summation by the Attorney-General. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069651"></A>
There are a number of issues that have relevance to people in the Burnett and Bundaberg. We all use the Bundaberg Court House for legal matters. For a layperson, it came as a bit of a shock to realise that a police prosecutor does not have a law degree--that they were police officers who graduated, had some general experience and then did a six-month course before becoming police prosecutors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073884"></A>
I have had the pleasure of speaking to a number of police prosecutors during my parliamentary career. They are very wily people who are very knowledgeable on the law. They know all the short cuts, and certainly the shortcomings, within our legal system. I really think there could be a greater incentive for those people to obtain law degrees. I believe that they are underpaid when compared with other legal professionals that they are doing battle with in our courts trying to deliver justice. I think they are even underpaid when compared to other public servants. I remember a recent conversation with a former police prosecutor who is now a solicitor. They said to me that a first-year police officer receives around $35,000 to $40,000; a first-year teacher receives $50,000 on graduating. They also said that there should be greater incentives. I believe they have to pay for their own books. One thing that struck me was that police prosecutors in Brisbane allegedly have access to only two laptops. One would think that in this day and age more than two laptops would be made available to such important people as police prosecutors to access information to undertake their duties. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073885"></A>
Speakers before me talked about the principle of restraining access to legal aid. A number of people have come to me for help. Maybe in the future I will bring their issues before the parliament; let us hope I do not have to. One of the issues deals with the restraint of legal aid. One particular person who came to me in a very serious situation fell out with the legal aid provider that she accessed in Bundaberg. Because of that disagreement between her and her solicitor she went unrepresented for a little while and then found another legal aid provider in another town. According to information I have received, because this person then went to another town to find a solicitor who could represent her she is no longer eligible for legal aid. I believe that that is a fault in our system. I believe that people should be able to access legal aid not only from the people in their local town but they should, with a degree of reasonableness, especially in rural and regional areas that have limited access to legal professionals, be able to access help from other legal aid providers outside their town. I believe that that would improve the delivery of justice. If this person had not met a very kind, caring member of the community, who to this date has contributed almost $10,000 of their own money to this person, this person would certainly be in a world of trouble and certainly not getting good legal advice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073886"></A>
The issue of youth detention was also raised during this debate and is referred to in this legislation. The sentencing and rehabilitation of our young offenders is of utmost importance. After speaking with members of the wider Burnett-Bundaberg community, I believe that there is a lack of effective rehabilitation. Surely every dollar that we as a state invest in effective rehabilitation will reap many benefits down the track. It would save us tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars if we were to catch offenders young and rehabilitate them to change behaviours and stop the criminal activity. Down the track we will benefit as a society. We will not have costly legal battles and suffer the cost of crime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073887"></A>
I have spoken to a number of people about the issue of effective rehabilitation. One of those people I have spoken to is Bob Davies. Bob is an ex-SAS instructor based in Susan River. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073888"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Interjected>
Mr Foley</Hansard-Member-Interjected>
 interjected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073889"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from my independent colleague, the member for Maryborough. I believe that he has attended a graduation ceremony. Bob has devised a course called Hard Yakka. I prefer to call them tough-love courses, but some people might call them boot camps. As soon as you say ‘boot camp’ there are people of a certain political persuasion or ideology whose eyes roll back in their heads and they do not want to hear anything more. The reality is that Bob Davies has had magnificent results with one course he has run. Bob runs smaller courses. The Hard Yakka course is a 29-night, 30-day course. He takes these young offenders, for whom the next step will be jail or detention, through a series of learning experiences. He teaches them about the Australian flag, how to march, how to be part of a team and active listening skills. He takes them out into the bush and teaches them survival techniques. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073890"></A>
While he is teaching them these skills he is actually affecting their attitudes towards life and broader society. From the 13 or 14 people who went through Bob’s course there are many, many success stories. One person went on to do a music degree, another one got a trade, another one joined the Army; other people went on to successfully complete university degrees. I believe that Bob Davies and people similar to him, with military and humanistic backgrounds, are able to provide effective rehabilitation. It is all about changing attitudes. I heard stories about mothers weeping, coming up to Bob and other people at the graduation saying, ‘Thank you. You have given me back my son.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073891"></A>
I believe that this government should actively look at people like Bob Davies and the Hard Yakka program. I brought Bob Davies here to parliament and we spoke to the Minister for Community Services. I thank her for her time and for actively considering the issue. The minister said that there was no money for this program; however, a few breaths later the minister went on to inform us that the cost of transporting a young person who is bound for detention from Bundaberg to Brisbane with two police officers was around $8,000. The point I am making here is that 30 days of a Hard Yakka course would cost $7,000 per student. That is what Bob Davies is after. This is what we are up against. In some cases detention is an appropriate response, but we must always look at more effective rehabilitation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073892"></A>
I remember having a very powerful and sad conversation with grandparents from the Burnett. The grandmother told me that she woke up one night and saw this figure in a black ninja suit crawling around her bedroom floor. It happened to be her grandson whom they were looking after. He had a drug addiction. They aged 20 years in 2 years trying to look after their grandson. They were pleading for effective courses to, first of all, detox him and then find a way of changing his attitude because, quite honestly, he had a lousy attitude in relation to his respect for older people and for the laws of our land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073893"></A>
Also mentioned in this legislation are monetary limits for the civil jurisdiction of the District and Magistrates courts. It will increase the monetary limits for civil disputes in the District Court to $750,000 and in the Magistrates Court to $150,000. It is a mystery to me why and how much compensation is granted by civil courts for pecuniary damages. I have a particular interest in this due to my advocacy work for the victims of Patel. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078056"></A>
As outlined in the media article that I tabled earlier today, 11 schoolchildren shared in around $1 million in compensation. These were secret payments made by this government. They were awarded an average of about $52,000 in secret payments for being cut on glass at school. As I said, good luck to them. Just the other day there was news that a lady who fell off her stool was pursuing $420,000 in damages. A teacher from Bundaberg, no less, was suing the state for damage to her voice box caused by yelling at students. She was looking at damages of over $400,000. There was another lady in the media recently who was suing a large department store for $37 million for sexual harassment. I note that a Western Australian court, quite rightly, awarded a family of an Indigenous man who died while being transported in the back of a prison car or van $3 million for his death. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078057"></A>
The reason that I mention this is that I would like to foreshadow and forewarn this government that there are widows who have lost their husbands because that husband was operated on by a medical professional who was not properly qualified, properly credentialled, properly registered and was employed negligently by this government, and those widows were given $5,000. They were given the cost of a funeral for their partner. It is an injustice; it is an outrage. I hope this legislation does not prevent those people from getting fair and just compensation. It is a fight that I am going to have. I will not stop mentioning it. I will keep going on until some justice and fairness has been achieved with regard to Patel widows and Patel victims. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078058"></A>
I am looking forward to hearing the minister’s summation before voting on this legislation. Many valid, serious and concerning points have been raised in the debate. They need to be properly answered and addressed before I vote for this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078060"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr FOLEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maryborough--Ind) (4.01 pm): I rise to participate in the debate today on this very important legal reform that is before the House. One could surmise by reading the newspapers of the day that when it comes to the legal system in the Western World we live in somewhat of a parallel universe. We have only to look at the headlines of articles about people like Lindsay Lohan serving 14 days out of a 90-day sentence, Paris Hilton serving a couple of days out of a 45-day sentence and today we read that Charlie Sheen has agreed to serve 30 days of rehab in Malibu’s luxury Promises celebrity rehab centre. He has already spent a month there at what they call ‘the retreat’ and that will be credited as time served. The average person looking at the legislative system and seeing world-wide some of these incredible disparities between what people are charged with and what they are sentenced to would be fairly happy to believe that there is one set of laws for rich people and one set of laws for poor people. I will be talking a little bit further about that in my contribution today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078067"></A>
I, like many other regional members, see all the time people who are trying to access legal aid and find it very difficult. It is an area that is grossly underfunded. It is next to impossible. Quite often the people who need that legal aid simply do not have the transport or the funds to be able to travel to get it. It is so limited that I would really ask the minister to comment on the availability of legal aid, particularly in regional centres. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078068"></A>
Obviously, this particular bill prescribes a massive uplift in workload for the Magistrates Court. My concern, of course, is that there is not also any particularly huge lift in terms of funding to achieve this. One of the real worries in this particular matter--and, again, I will touch on this in a little more detail--is the civil cases. I have quite a few friends who are in the legal profession. The feedback they give me is that they are very concerned about the uplift in thresholds for civil cases heard in the Magistrates Court. Magistrates--and I am not in any way casting aspersions on their abilities--are hard pressed sometimes to follow the intricacies of some of these cases that are normally heard in the District Court and could now be put down to the Magistrates Court. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078072"></A>
The bill is intended in its legislative purpose to expand the jurisdiction of Magistrates Courts to determine indictable offences under the Criminal Code and Drugs Misuse Act of 1986, to increase the District Court’s jurisdiction regarding general criminal offences to those with a maximum penalty of 20 years or less and also, as I said, to increase the monetary limit for civil disputes in the District Court to $750,000 and in the Magistrates Court to $150,000. At that level obviously there are some very sophisticated cases being heard with some very complex legal precedents being offered by defence barristers in particular. The bill also aims to provide the courts with specific powers to address failures to comply with disclosure obligations in criminal cases, to streamline the committal process and the management of matters in the Magistrates Courts proceeding by way of ex-officio indictment and also to improve the operation of Queensland courts and effect miscellaneous amendments to justice legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078078"></A>
All of these things sound good, and many other speakers have spoken about the very comprehensive Moynihan report, to which the Law Society in particular provided a number of detailed submissions that considered various facets of the review. They participated in roundtable discussions and, ultimately, provided very detailed submissions to Mr Moynihan regarding the discussion paper reform of the committal proceedings process which is referred to as the Moynihan report. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078080"></A>
The Law Society believes that the government’s response to the Moynihan report and to the draft bill itself are a product of selective and narrow consultation. They say that they have little confidence in the current form that the result will end in an efficient, cost-effective and fair civil and criminal justice system for the benefit of all Queenslanders. I would think if there was one concern I have it is that this is a massive undertaking for the Magistrates Court. What is being proposed here is such a radical increase that anyone with any management experience whatsoever would know that you cannot have that kind of uplift in workload without funding it properly and efficiently and having a detailed implementation plan. To just jump in and say that one-third of the court system is about to absorb an incredible increase in cases but not to have funding specifically set aside and planning for that implementation risks quite a chaotic environment. The last thing that we need when we have a backlog of cases in our court systems is any further chaos introduced. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078083"></A>
The criminal law reforms will place significant pressure on the resources of the Magistrates Court, legal aid service providers and the police prosecutions systems, which are already--and I make this point strongly--straining at the seams. To turn around then and increase the workload of one sector of that legal community is fraught with danger. In reading its position paper, I believe that the Law Society generally commends the government’s decision to widen the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court, and I certainly would not argue with that. I just make the point that that needs to be funded adequately. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078086"></A>
The Moynihan report talks about eight key features of a streamlined criminal justice process. However, I will not go into those eight key features for the sake of brevity. These key features that Martin Moynihan put together were recommended as a cohesive, interconnected system designed to interact together to facilitate the earlier resolution of criminal matters and achieve a more effective use of public resources across the system. I think in some ways that cohesive system of eight recommendations was already very reliant on a full implementation of the program. Once you start taking out various legs from that program, then the whole thing has a somewhat disappointing result. It is history that only five of the eight key recommendations proposed in the report were adopted. The government’s outright rejection without substantive justification of Mr Moynihan’s recommendation to require an arresting officer to swear a certificate as to their compliance with the disclosure obligations is concerning, as is the dismissal of his recommendations regarding the introduction of a strengthened committals test and case conferencing system until analysis of the adopted reforms is completed in the future. That is why I talk about a process of streamlining and a process of making sure that these changes can be implemented in a way that is efficient and will last. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078124"></A>
Most people would be aware of the benefits of a properly conducted committal hearing. In an adversarial criminal justice system, the principles of fairness, efficiency and access to justice require the existence of and ability to access a pretrial court in which to conduct an independent examination of the case of the accused. A committal hearing is the ideal forum for such an examination to occur. Earlier this year I brought to the attention of the Attorney-General the case of a gentleman in my electorate who was charged with some very serious child related offences. It turned out that the person who had laid the complaint withdrew those charges, saying, ‘I made them all up. I was just trying to get back at that person because I was angry.’ However, the laying of those charges alone destroyed the family’s life and cost them their house. Every time the man applies for a job, he is asked if he has been convicted of any criminal offence and he can answer, ‘No, I have not’. However, he is then asked if he has been charged with any serious criminal offence and, in disclosing that he has, he cannot get an employer to look at him, yet he has done nothing wrong. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078125"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Shine:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Not good. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078126"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FOLEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No, it is not. It is a very serious situation. In such situations I urge the Attorney-General--and I know it is not an easy thing--to acknowledge that we need to come up with a system that provides fundamental fairness, so that if a person has not been convicted of a crime the stain on their name does not continue in a de facto sense. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078128"></A>
The Moynihan report acknowledges the various functions that committal proceedings perform and the substantial benefits they bring to the pretrial process. The report highlights the fact that numerous courts have acknowledged the fundamental contribution of a properly conducted committal hearing. Happily, I have never faced a court. However, I know that for many people the stress of being charged, even before they get to a committal hearing, is a shattering thing. If an innocent person who has been wrongfully charged faces a committal hearing where it is found that there is not enough evidence to proceed to trial with a reasonable degree of being sure that a conviction could be gained, the relief to the people concerned is massive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078129"></A>
I turn to the cross-examination of witnesses at committal. Recently a member of the Law Society’s criminal law section conducted a committal in a suburban court where the identity of the person responsible for breaking into and trashing an apartment was central to the prosecution case. In a statement taken by the police, the apartment owner identified--or supposedly identified--the defendant from closed-circuit TV footage of the incident. Cross-examination of the principal investigating officer at committal later revealed that on initially being questioned the apartment owner told police that he had no idea who was responsible for the break-in and the subsequent significant wilful damage of the apartment. Cross-examination also revealed that the apartment owner told police this after he had viewed the CCTV footage, despite later claiming in his statement to be able to identify the defendant from the footage. The arresting officer failed to reveal in his statement or in any other material in the prosecution brief that the apartment owner had told police straight out that he was unable to identify the defendant, and that is a statement that is fundamental to the probity of that particular defence case. </Hansard-Body>

Another key element of the Moynihan recommendations is the adoption of the New South Wales system whereby a magistrate applies a test in deciding whether or not to commit an accused person for trial. The magistrate must consider all the evidence and determine whether or not there is a reasonable prospect that a reasonable jury, properly instructed, would convict the accused person of an indictable offence. A friend of mine was involved in a very unfortunate accident that resulted in the death of a small boy. I sat through the trial with him, to support him. I was absolutely amazed at how, over a number of days, the magistrate listened intently to evidence and questioned the process. There was no yawning, there was no going to sleep. I was mightily impressed with the level of attention that he gave in that committal test. Therefore, before we change the system in such a radical way, we need to look at the entirety of the Moynihan report and its interconnectedness. As I have already said, once you start taking various legs out of it, the whole thing does not sit as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078131"></A>
Moynihan states that there is a lack of reliable data to indicate how many matters that could be dealt with by the Magistrates Court are currently dealt with in the District and Supreme courts. In the absence of the availability of figures, but relying on such data as is and on anecdotal evidence, it would appear that something in the region of half to three-quarters of the matters presently heard in the District and Supreme courts could be dealt with in the Magistrates Court. Again, the reform represents a substantial reduction in the centuries-old right to elect a trial by jury. However, with any of these things, if you are going to change the system and move sideways, apart from bearing in mind the philosophical point of the centuries-old tradition to trial by jury, you must adequately fund the substantial up-ramping of the work that that will create. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1078132"></A>
I have spoken about legal aid. I have very grave concerns about whether justice is properly served if people simply cannot access legal aid in a timely manner and in a manner that is fitting for the seriousness of the charges that they are facing. Many people have come into my office crying because they have been charged with an offence and need legal advice. Generally they are substantially unskilled in understanding the complexities of even the simplest of our courts, the Magistrates Court. They feel extra stress because they cannot access timely and appropriate legal information, advice and guidance. I have known of people who committed suicide because it all became too much for them. I cannot stress too heavily how important it is that legal aid is available. If we have a justice system that favours the rich at the expense of the poor, we do ourselves no credit whatsoever. We need a system that looks after the less wealthy people in our society. We have all seen people get off with a tap on the wrist because they had the funds to afford expensive lawyers. However, the people who cannot afford expensive lawyers really need legal aid. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078133"></A>
I close my contribution by saying that what the Attorney-General is trying to do in terms of reforms is very noble. I commend him for his work. However, again I stress that the issue of funding the uplift in the work of the Magistrates Courts and Legal Aid needs to be addressed. </Hansard-Body>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (4.18 pm): This is the Labor government’s response to the Moynihan report. As has been stated, the honourable Martin Moynihan AO, QC reported after being set specific terms of inquiry by the Bligh Labor government. There was a heavy emphasis on the terms of inquiry for advice regarding the more effective use of public resources in civil and criminal jurisdictions in Queensland courts. I highlight that the inquiry was commissioned by the former Attorney-General, who is here today, the member for Toowoomba North. The government’s response is couched in heavy tones, with a basis of cut-price justice. In his second reading speech, the minister has stated that the ALP and the Bligh Labor government have a well-deserved reputation for reform and seek to respond to emerging challenges and to make decisions that will help build a safe, modern and progressive state. I knowledge that this is the government’s first stage response. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082531"></A>
If this is the mission statement of the bill then, critically, those sentiments need to be examined closely, and where the bill appears not to reflect those lofty ideals it is appropriate for opposition members to question whether this bill truly is reflective of those stated goals. On close examination I see insufficient evidence that the bill is indeed progressive reform. It is a response to challenges but it takes the lowest common denominator approach to a solution in too many harder areas. In doing so, it makes neither the state nor the public any safer or better provided for. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082532"></A>
In list form, the evidence supporting my position would be on the following changes, and I will expand on all (1) the transition of significant criminal issues from the District Court to the Magistrates Court, removing the right to trial by jury; (2) the requirement to generate a new group of indictable offences that will be heard by a magistrate and only by a higher court where it is not able to adequately sentence the person; (3) the expansion of the Drugs Misuse Act 1986 to expand the prosecution’s current election to have matters dealt with by a Magistrates Court; (4) the new monetary limits for civil jurisdictions; (5) the changes to the committal process; (6) the issue of the commitment to case conferencing and giving it teeth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082537"></A>
In his speech the minister gave some pretty shallow reasons to support both his claims and his justification for the changes to be implemented as a result of this bill. The Moynihan report was continually referred to throughout his speech but, on the majority of points raised above, the detail of his report does not appear to support the changes implemented. In other words, there is a wide gap between intent and action. In the formulation of a response when presented with a rational review, if the recommendation is a Holden Commodore but one delivers a Mini Moke then you have not delivered and there is an inconsistency, and there is a major problem in that inconsistency. If law is about fact, consistency and at least an attempt at justice then this is not the way to do it in response to a senior legal adviser. I say this on the basis of that inconsistency between intent and action in this bill, reflecting in a recurring manner back to the mission statement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082539"></A>
The major concern must be the same issue as that expressed by the Queensland Law Society--that is, the concern that all rightfully have at removing the right of an accused to elect trial by jury by removing a significant number of those cases from other courts to the Magistrates Court. Legal Aid has the same view. The Moynihan report on this point says that no entrenched right to trial by jury exists and it is a matter for parliaments to decide. Parliaments are under no constraint and can lawfully determine whether there can be trial by judge or magistrate alone. However, there is a widely held view that trial by jury should not be lightly dispensed with given the serious consequences that may follow. It was based on the concept of proportionality. That is, the processes and resources that are employed in response to particular offences must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence from the aspect of the community and from the aspect of the consequences on the accused if convicted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082543"></A>
So what is the detail of the implementation step proposed by the Attorney-General in this bill? Without a preliminary step of improving the training and clarification of skills available for Queensland magistrates and a significant component of funds to apply to it, as has been previously canvassed at great length by the member for Maryborough, the minister is proposing to grandfather quite an extensive range of cases dealt with as summary justice by the Magistrates Court and add quite a range of new ones. When that is added to all those indictable offences in the Criminal Code with a maximum penalty of three years or less and property offences where the value of the property involved is less than $30,000--reasonably it does exclude robbery, arson and corruption, as has been raised earlier--this new summary disposition category is very broad. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082545"></A>
I accept, but I need to emphasise, that, in law, summary matters are matters dealt with by the Magistrates Court. The current Queensland Magistrates Court handles almost 300,000 matters every year and is currently experiencing significant backlogs of 30 per cent of criminal matters and 42 per cent of civil matters alone--and that was in 2009. Has anyone in the Attorney-General’s department or the Attorney-General himself just paused for reflection here and thought to themselves, ‘Are we creating a rod for our own back here?’ or, ‘By creating a whole new gridlock, are we perhaps making the idea of justice for all just a little bit harder to attain?’</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082549"></A>
The other changes to be implemented as a result of the bill that need a little bit more discussion are points 3 to 6 that I raised earlier. The first of those is the change to the Drugs Misuse Act 1986. It involves the change of many drug related offences by law having to be heard in at least the District Court previously to now being heard in the Magistrates Court on the basis of the Moynihan report finding the majority of these cases being within the current three-year maximum penalty that a magistrate may impose. Moynihan’s justification was that there was a need to simplify the charges of possession and supply but the majority of these could be better placed or heard by a Magistrates Court. He was influenced by the high number of multiple charges, recidivist behaviour and the recurrent theme of a guilty plea. He quoted Judge Patsy Wolfe’s submission on page 144 on the matter. Correctly he excused all places of commerciality from a Magistrates Court hearing. His summary justification for earlier diversionary treatment and rehabilitation is reasonable and of course should be supported. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082556"></A>
With regard to the monetary limits, I accept Moynihan’s justification on the basis of research, but it does seem that the $750,000 limit set for District Court hearings implies that the level of expertise demanded of those judicial officers must be of very high order because this quantum can imply that if judgement of that amount is awarded against an individual in a civil case then it may be that that individual may never recover financially. This needs to be carefully considered. The committal process and the issue of case conferencing have been dealt with very well by the member for Southern Downs, and I do not propose to move on with that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082560"></A>
The changes being proposed by Labor will do nothing to streamline the courts; they just shuffle the deck of where the matters are heard. If this is the case, then this is not progress. This is not what Moynihan proposed and this is not justice. If the intention in truth by Labor is to take short cuts and overload our magistrates courts with cases that include cases where the accused has been denied the right to trial by jury, then the end result will be bad precedents, inconsistent sentencing, possible incompetence, excessive delay and very little justice. I see absolutely no evidence from any government statement released from the Attorney-General’s office nor in the Attorney-General’s second reading speech that mentions greater resourcing for the overloaded magistrates courts. The police in their submission are saying that this bill will increase their costs because the addition of another layer to the process without mandatory case conferencing before they have to prepare a brief of evidence will lead to much heavier costs and workload. Moynihan’s report avoided the issue of the broader use of disclosure in this area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082567"></A>
Even Chief Justice Paul de Jersey, himself a former eminent silk, has said that these changes will also mean a need to maintain the quality of appointments to the District Court. For those who do not understand this, this means that the Chief Justice is saying that we will just have to increase those costs because, with senior silks already earning in excess of $1 million after costs annually, the state is going to have to offer much increased salaries for all levels of the judiciary but especially at the District Court level and above which previously may have been considered to be of lesser importance and therefore remunerated at a lower rate than that of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082571"></A>
Minister, by application of a dumbing down process--consistent with the views that I previously expressed about the use of legal clerks becoming judicial registrars under the new changes implemented in the earlier State Penalties Enforcement and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009--we are weakening our courts and diminishing the trust that the public will have in this process. Ultimately, it is a failure of the process itself. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082611"></A>
There will be case gridlock in the Magistrates Court and an overall cost increase in the system. In contrast to the Attorney-General’s concluding statement in his second reading speech, this significant step is not progressive nor does it take us forward. It does not ensure the more efficient and effective delivery of justice to our state in the future. If this is not a step forward then why are we as a state doing it? I dispute the Attorney-General’s selective use of comparing and contrasting those changes in other states to support his arguments when the justification for the base level of the legislative step required some selective verifiable evidence to support the changes that have been made. This is not reform. This is not just looking backwards. It is moving in that direction--backwards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082612"></A>
Isn’t the Labor campaign slogan federally ‘Moving forwards together’? This is exactly the kind of hypocrisy that Labor brings upon itself by its repeated actions in contrast to its public statements. This bill had at its core an attempt to streamline committals but its actions are all about putting further, unreasonable pressure on lower courts. This is occurring at a time of a second wave of economic decline, a rapid rise in cost of living pressures and Queensland’s rising unemployment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082613"></A>
The government response is economically driven because the state under Labor racked up massive debt and an inability to charge enough taxes to pay for all this. What we see then in response is yet another wasteful step that ultimately just cost us all a lot more. Did anyone ever think to ask the devil’s advocate question? Will this cost us more for an equivalent level of justice? I suspect that if anyone did ask that question they were ignored because Labor’s preferred response to all such questions is to ultimately throw money at crises that it alone creates. Are we seeing the creation of a justice crisis to follow the Health payroll crisis, the water crisis and ultimately a credibility crisis? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082614"></A>
I totally concur with the Police Union response which was summarised as ‘be careful what you wish for’. Sometimes reform driven ideologues never get the idea of balance. Just ask Peter Garrett and federal Labor about when they pushed for federally subsidised, insufficiently qualified people to install batts in people’s roofs. I am sure they never believed that houses would burn down. But tradesmen and homeowners also lost their lives. All changes to law must have as part of their mission statement ‘first do no harm’. This bill today has considerable potential to do a lot of harm. I urge all to beware when all seems rosy. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr MOORHEAD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Waterford--ALP) (4.32 pm): I would like to take issue with some of the points made in the brief contribution from the member for Gaven. I do not know whether the member for Gaven listens most mornings given the allegation he made in his speech that this is a state with rising unemployment. It is quite clear this morning that for 11 months, and particularly the last three months, this state has led the nation in creating jobs. This is the same LNP that has ridiculed the target of creating 100,000 new jobs. Halfway through our term we are more than halfway to that target. This is another dimension that some of these people live in. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082617"></A>
Our legal system is based on centuries of history, precedent and convention but we must always be vigilant to ensure that our justice system continues to provide a fair go for all who come into contact with it. This means we cannot stand still. I am surprised by some of the contributions from LNP members today. They run a scare campaign. Last year we debated a criminal organisations bill. We heard that the Pensioners and Superannuants League and soccer clubs were all going to be outlawed and that we were cracking down on these people. Nine months on we have seen nothing of the sort. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082619"></A>
I think that is what we will see with this bill. This bill is a sensible reform that provides access to justice. This bill will mean that our court system will deal with both criminal and civil matters in the most accessible court jurisdiction that is appropriate, given the gravity of the decision the court is taking. Our court system provides a strong and robust network of Magistrates Courts that are in our suburbs and towns where people live, providing ready access to justice and resolution of civil disputes. At the same time, our District Courts and Supreme Courts ensure that matters of greater significance are given the careful consideration and scrutiny required. Ensuring that matters are dealt with at the most suitable court means quicker hearing times, reduced delays for victims and less time for accused persons on remand. That is important. That means fewer people spending time in jail before they are found guilty by a court and before they are sentenced. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082621"></A>
This bill will create a new category of offences in the Criminal Code and Drugs Misuse Act. Offences that have a maximum penalty of three years or less and property offences involving a value of $30,000 or less must now be dealt with by the Magistrates Court unless the magistrate is not able to adequately deal with the matter. Where the defendant pleads guilty to property offences involving property valued beyond $30,000 they can be dealt with summarily as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082623"></A>
Allowing more drug offences to be dealt with by the Magistrates Court allows a greater role for drug diversionary initiatives. The Southern Districts Court House in Beenleigh has had this program for some time. It has proven successful in stopping people reoffending on drug charges and stopping people using drugs. That should be the aim of our enforcement of drug misuse laws. This is an important initiative that helps families that might have a loved one using drugs, rather than simply jailing people for a first offence. This is a great Labor initiative that has delivered real outcomes for families in my area. This is a world apart from the meaningless posturing of the LNP when it comes to community safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082626"></A>
The last part of the bill that I wanted to touch on is the initiatives that provide for the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission to take sole responsibility for the workers compensation appeals from Q-Comp decisions, relieving industrial magistrates of the current workload that they have. Currently, WorkCover or an injured worker can choose to appeal to either the QIRC or industrial magistrates. The advice I have received from participants in this area is that since the QIRC took over this power in 2007 it has proven very successful in resolving and determining these matters quickly and at minimal cost. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082629"></A>
This bill provides much more accessible justice to the people that I represent and reduces barriers to resolve matters before the courts. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Ms NELSON-CARR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mundingburra--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.37 pm): I would also like to speak in support of the Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction Reform and Modernisation Amendment Bill 2010 which represents some of the most significant changes to the justice system in decades and marks the culmination of a significant body of work undertaken by the Department of Justice and Attorney-General and former Supreme Court judge administrator, Mr Martin Moynihan AO QC. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082633"></A>
I would like to speak about the summary disposition of indictable offences. The amendments contained in the bill provide that a number of indictable offences in the Criminal Code must be dealt with summarily--that is, in the Magistrates Court. The amendments will also extend the offences under the Drugs Misuse Act 1986 for possession of a dangerous drug that the prosecution can elect to be dealt with in the Magistrates Court. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082635"></A>
These combined reforms will have the effect of increasing the number of indictable offences heard and determined summarily. This means that the defendants in those matters will no longer be entitled to a trial by jury. However, in practice only a small percentage of matters committed from the Magistrates Court to the Supreme Court or District Court actually result in a trial by jury. Members would need to refer to pages 59 to 60 of the report for a full expansion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082638"></A>
Under the new proposed section 552D of the Criminal Code defendants will also be able to make an application to a magistrate for a matter to be sent to a higher court. If the magistrate is satisfied there are exceptional circumstances that mean that the matter should not be dealt with summarily they will commit the matter for trial. The current restriction in section 552D of the Criminal Code will also be retained. This provision requires magistrates to abstain from dealing with an offence summarily if they are satisfied that the defendant may not be adequately punished in the Magistrates Court. This can be because of the nature or seriousness of the offence or any other relevant consideration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082668"></A>
This is because under section 552H of the Criminal Code generally magistrates only have jurisdiction to impose a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment for indictable offences. Further, section 552J of the Criminal Code as amended by the bill provides that grounds on which a person may appeal against a decision of a magistrate will include that the Magistrates Court erred by deciding the conviction or sentence summarily. The provisions in this bill that extend the ability of the prosecution to elect to have matters under the Drugs Misuse Act 1986 dealt with in the Magistrates Court only apply where the prosecution is not alleging any commercial purpose in the enterprise. Also, section 118 of the Drugs Misuse Act already provides that if a magistrate forms the opinion that the charge ought to be dealt with in the District or Supreme Court the magistrate must deal with the proceedings with a view to the committal of the defendant for trial or sentence. These reforms in relation to the summary disposition of indictable offences will lead to greater efficiency of the disposal of charges and this will be of benefit to defendants, to witnesses and to victims and will improve the criminal justice system for the benefit of the community more generally.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082677"></A>
Much has been said publicly about the proposals contained in this bill relating to the committals process. The amendments to the Justices Act 1886 will restrict the right of a defendant to require a person to attend to give oral evidence and be cross-examined at committal. This does not remove that right entirely and is an appropriate reform to a system that contains a number of inefficiencies. Most jurisdictions around Australia have reformed the process of calling witnesses to give oral evidence in pretrial hearings, with these generally restricted or restricted in relation to particular witnesses. Some jurisdictions have abolished the committal processes altogether. Because of the very strong views expressed on this topic, the question of committals was given extensive attention by the Moynihan process. Mr Moynihan has extensive experience in the Queensland criminal justice system and his views have been formed after extensive consultation and also his observations of the system at work over many decades. The conclusion he came to in his report was--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1082680"></A>
Ultimately, I have not been persuaded that the retention of an unrestricted right to call and cross-examine witnesses should be sustained.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WETTENHALL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Barron River--ALP) (4.41 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction Reform and Modernisation Amendment Bill 2010. The Bligh government is committed to a justice system that is transparent, accessible, open and understandable to the broad cross-section of the Queensland community. The government has already proven itself in respect of those matters by progressing a streamlining of laws and procedures aimed at achieving a more efficient and cost-effective legal system but while achieving those aims balancing the rights of all of the participants in our legal system to ensure that justice and fair and equitable outcomes are at the centre of our reforms. In the recent past we have established the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal and Victim Assist Queensland and today that is reflected in this bill which follows from the Hon. Martin Moynihan AO, QC’s review of the civil and criminal justice system in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082689"></A>
The bill significantly updates Queensland’s criminal law and procedure in accordance with the social, technological and legal demands of the 21st century, and no system of justice can or should remain frozen in time. One of the truly important reforms in this bill is a streamlining of the committals process, and we have heard a bit from various speakers, particularly those from the other side of the House, in respect of this, and it is one of the more contentious aspects of the bill. As the government spelled out in its response to the Moynihan review, the reforms to the committal process will be achieved by giving the magistracy overall responsibility for supervising the committal process and intervening when justified; by making it mandatory for evidence of witnesses to be given in statement form, subject to specified exceptions; and by making administrative committals the default position, with witnesses only being called either by the prosecution, by consent or by order of a magistrate who is satisfied that it is justified and sets the parameters for cross-examination.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082691"></A>
It is worth having a look at what that means, because if one had accepted what we have heard from members opposite one could be forgiven for thinking that access to committals and cross-examination of witnesses by the defence in committals has been abolished in Queensland, which of course is not the case at all. The magistrate retains the powers to allow witnesses to be cross-examined by the defence when, as I have said, the magistrate is satisfied that it is justified in the circumstances. The wording of the clause is that ‘there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the maker should attend to give oral evidence or be made available for cross-examination on the written statement’. Case law has established in other jurisdictions--namely, New South Wales--precisely what the considerations for a judicial officer will be in applying a provision carrying that terminology.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082693"></A>
The law in New South Wales is that in interpreting those provisions each case will depend on its own facts and circumstances and the issues likely to arise at trial, and it is not possible to define what might in a particular case constitute substantial reasons. The reasons advanced must have substance in the context of committal proceedings, and these points are noted in the explanatory notes to the bill at pages 6 and 7. The categories of substantial reasons are not closed and flexibility of approach is required. It may be where the defence believes that cross-examination may result in the discharge of the defendant because the evidence does not justify committal; cross-examining certain witnesses may expose a weakness in the prosecution case, giving rise to a no-case submission; cross-examination is likely to substantially undermine the credit of an important witness; cross-examination is necessary to avoid the defendant being taken by surprise at trial; or the attendance of a witness will enable cross-examination in respect of a matter which itself might give rise to a discretion or determination to reject evidence at trial.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082695"></A>
Although there are certain preconditions set out, quite properly, in the bill before a magistrate can consider those matters and it is quite proper that in the circumstances those types of notifications are exchanged between the prosecution and defence, as it can be seen from the plain words of the bill and supported by the interpretation of similar words in other jurisdictions, the circumstances in which witnesses can be cross-examined are quite wide. They are well understood in terms of the language of the bill, and certainly it is quite wrong and quite misleading, whether it be in debate here or elsewhere, to characterise these reforms as taking away a right to cross-examination.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082697"></A>
There are a number of other provisions in the bill that will streamline the proceedings in the criminal courts in addition to the reforms to the committal process. One of those is enabling ex-officio matters to be dealt with by the clerk of the court or by the registry. At the present time where ex-officio indictments are agreed to be presented in the District or Supreme Court--which is a mechanism in essence to fast-track charges that cannot be dealt with summarily and bypass the committal process as it currently exists--the charges having been commenced in the Magistrates Court remain live, as it were, in the Magistrates Court until disposed of on that ex-officio indictment in the higher court, necessitating under the current arrangements what can be numerous mentions before a magistrate when the matter is effectively being dealt with in another court. Those involve appearances by defendants, prosecutors and defence lawyers and are a complete and utter waste of time. These reforms will enable those matters to be dealt with in a common-sense, practical and efficient way by the registry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087439"></A>
Similarly, in respect of the committal proceedings themselves, where matters are not contentious, where they are to proceed on the written statements rather than any oral testimony and where it is agreed between the prosecution and the defence that no submissions need to be made in respect of the charges or whether a defendant has a case to answer, those matters can be dealt with by a clerk rather than clogging up a Magistrates Court with not contentious administrative matters. These are common-sense, practical matters that are going to free up the time and the resources of the Magistrates Court to deal with the contested issues that are of importance to all parties. Importantly, as has been mentioned quite sensibly by contributors on this side of the House, that will significantly reduce the delays in all of the jurisdictions. As has been mentioned before, justice delayed is justice denied. As I have mentioned, registry committals can be performed in the absence of the parties. The clerk will commit the case for trial or sentence according to the advice provided by the defendant’s legal representatives about whether the defendant pleads guilty or not. The clerk of the court does not have to consider the evidence, nor will the clerk of the court have powers in respect of bail. </Hansard-Body>

As I said, another important initiative that has been designed to streamline the committal process is the restriction of the calling and cross-examination of prosecution witnesses. That happens when the prosecution does not rely on written statements for all of its witnesses. In that case, the witness or witnesses will attend to give oral evidence by way of examination-in-chief and cross-examination. Where the prosecution agrees with the defence that the prosecution witness or witnesses are to be present for cross-examination, in that case the witness or witnesses will attend. Their statements will be tendered by the prosecution as evidence-in-chief and the witness or witnesses will be cross-examined by the defence. A magistrate can direct that a witness or witnesses must attend to give evidence or be made available for cross-examination on their written statement if the magistrate is satisfied that there are substantial reasons--and I have explained how those provisions will be interpreted. If a court directs that a witness attend court, cross-examination will be limited to the reasons outlined by the magistrate for giving the direction unless the magistrate hearing the committal is satisfied that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the cross-examination should be allowed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087441"></A>
Where a defendant is not successful in their application for a direction or is in custody, the magistrate may proceed with a full paper committal in the same way as the committals that currently exist under section 110A(6) of the Justices Act 1886 proceed. That, of course, is known as a hand-up committal. No witnesses attend or are subject to cross-examination and the magistrate, with the consent of the defendant’s lawyer, commits the matter without consideration of the content of the statements. A defendant who is not legally represented may be able to proceed by way of a full paper committal by a magistrate or justices provided that the court is satisfied of certain things and the evidentiary threshold must be considered in those circumstances. At the present time, if a defendant is not legally represented at committal proceedings the only way that that committal can proceed, regardless of the defendant’s intention, is if all witnesses are called to give full oral evidence. The amendments in this bill enable paper committals to proceed where the defendant is not legally represented but where their right to make an application to the court to have oral evidence given or be cross-examined is explained to them. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1087444"></A>
Like all important matters in the administration of justice, the optimum outcome is never achieved by adopting positions that fulfil all of the concerns and requirements of one particular interest group or another. It is about balancing the competing interests. That is what the reforms in this bill achieve. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087445"></A>
I want to conclude by mentioning that the extended jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court to hear and determine a wider range of offences will possibly increase the workload of that court. It will certainly increase the range and type of matters that will be heard by the legal representatives who assist defendants, particularly in the Magistrates Court, through the various duty lawyer services that operate in this state. I want to take this opportunity to commend the good work of duty lawyers. Not only are duty lawyers provided by Legal Aid Queensland but also they are provided through a network of preferred suppliers to Legal Aid Queensland. So there are lawyers throughout Queensland who, for very limited reward, undertake the very important task of representing defendants in our Magistrates Court. In consequence of these amendments, the range of matters on which duty lawyers will be called upon to give advice and to represent people will be expanded. Certainly, in some cases the seriousness of the matters on which they will be called upon to give advice will be expanded. That is the case whether the defendants plead guilty or not guilty. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087447"></A>
It certainly is the case that there may be ramifications in terms of the resources and the workload, particularly on duty lawyers. Having performed duty lawyer services for many years I know only too well the important role they play in the administration of justice. That is something that the government will have to keep a very close eye on. The circumstances in which not only duty lawyer services are provided but also grants of legal aid are made for representation in more serious cases in the Magistrates Court have to be monitored very carefully. Those are matters that I know the Attorney-General is very aware of. Those are also matters that I know concern members on both sides of the House, and quite properly. Those are matters that I am very confident the government will monitor closely and will be able to address as the full implications of these reforms become apparent in practice. I commend the current Attorney-General and the former Attorney-General for the part that each of them played in steering the development of these important reforms and for bringing this legislation before the House. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (4.58 pm), in reply: At the outset I want to thank that all honourable members for their contributions to this debate on the Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction Reform and Modernisation Amendment Bill. This bill is the first stage of a legislative response to the review by the Hon. Martin Moynihan AO QC of the civil and criminal justice system in Queensland. The bill introduces a range of reforms designed to achieve a more efficient and effective civil and criminal justice system in Queensland. I and the other members of the Bligh government are committed to ongoing reform to ensure that this state has a contemporary and responsive justice system that can be accessed easily by the community. I particularly want to thank the government members for their thoughtful contributions to the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087450"></A>
I now wish to address some of the matters raised by honourable members during the course of the debate. The member for Southern Downs commented that the reforms do not meet the expectations and the promises made by the government. Nothing could be further from the truth. I can reaffirm that the Bligh government has decided on a staged rollout of reforms based on Mr Moynihan’s report, given the extensive and significant nature of the reforms. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091952"></A>
Mr Moynihan recognised the need for such a staged, prioritised and structured approach to the implementation of any recommendations. The government has also committed to ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of the reforms. This will help ensure that there is a solid evidence base for consideration of future reform and change. Consultation undertaken by the government on a draft of the proposed reforms highlighted divergent views on what are extensive reforms. The concerns raised by stakeholders support the government’s decision to adopt a staged, incremental and prioritised approach to implementation of these changes. Where possible, changes were made to the reforms originally proposed for the first stage to address the issues and concerns raised by stakeholders during consultation. The amendments made in this bill seek to represent a compromise solution, the government having listened and heard stakeholders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091953"></A>
While Mr Moynihan identifies a number of problems with data and information management, following extensive consultation with stakeholders he established a need for reform in a large number of areas and his recommendations are based on those findings. In terms of the data issues identified by Mr Moynihan, the government has already developed and implemented a number of initiatives aimed at ensuring the collection of accurate, reliable, coherent and compatible information. Work has also already commenced on a number of the short-term initiatives recommended in the report, including cleansing of single person identifier data by the Queensland Police Service. The government is committed to the examination and development of further innovative and integrated strategies to make more effective use of existing criminal justice information. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091954"></A>
The government also supports the increased use of technology and has made a significant investment in court technology in recent years. As part of the second stage of reforms, the government will also be considering the recommendation for the establishment of a criminal justice procedure coordination council for Queensland. It is envisaged that the role of this new body would include facilitation of the development of integrated, valid and consistent data across the criminal justice system, implementation of effective electronic data collection, management and use across the criminal justice system and the development of process and data systems for sound evidence based decisions to evaluate the effectiveness of criminal justice practices and procedures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091955"></A>
The member for Southern Downs raised concerns over the capacity of the District and Magistrates Court to deal with the more complex civil matters that may present before these courts due to the changes in the civil jurisdiction limits. I hold no such concerns. I have fullest confidence in the capacity of both our judges and magistrates to deal with matters listed before them and in the respective heads of jurisdiction in managing both the lists and the judicial officers to achieve the best results. With respect to the District Court, I would note for the member for Southern Downs that there is a wide depth and range of experienced judges on our state’s District Court. In February this year I appointed four new judges to the district whose combined experience totalled 127 years of legal practice. All appointees have broad backgrounds with particular strengths in civil matters. The organisation of the court’s workload is a matter for the District Court. In particular, the Judge Administrator is responsible for the administration of the District Court and for ensuring the orderly and expeditious exercise of the jurisdiction and powers of the District Court. The Judge Administrator must consult with the Chief Judge in carrying out the Judge Administrator’s functions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091956"></A>
In recommending the increase to the civil jurisdictional limit of the Magistrates Court, Mr Moynihan had specific regard to the changes in the professional qualification and the increasingly broader range of professional experience of appointees to the Magistrates Courts over the last 10 years during the stewardship of Labor governments. The member for Southern Downs also asked what impact the reforms are likely to have upon the workload of a Magistrates Court. There are a number of issues and difficulties which make any precise assessment of the impact of the reforms difficult. The government is therefore committed to closely monitoring the impacts of the reforms. The bill provides that the reforms will only apply to new prosecutions started after commencement so that the impacts are incremental and gradual. An evaluation of the impacts will also be conducted following implementation of the second stage of reforms. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091957"></A>
The member for Southern Downs raised a concern that the committals process was being interfered with and substantially reformed. That was rebutted in considerable detail by the member for Barron River in his contribution to the debate. The information collected by Mr Moynihan during the course of his review led him to conclude that the current system does not make effective use of public resources and has adverse effects for many. The bill’s reforms, based on Mr Moynihan’s recommendations, are aimed at providing a more focused, streamlined and effective committal process. A particular concern identified by Mr Moynihan was the number of matters listed for committal hearing which turn into a full hand-up committal on the day of the hearing or proceed with only one or two witnesses being called. This is clearly an inefficient and expensive use of the court’s, as well as the parties’, time and puts witnesses to considerable inconvenience. For those of us who have practised criminal law we know the costs and expenses this can cause to all participants in the criminal justice system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091958"></A>
Mr Moynihan also noted that the accused can require the prosecution to call every witness to be available for cross-examination no matter how trivial or insubstantial their evidence may be and without the need to prove any justification. The committal hearing has also on occasion been used for the purpose of intimidating a witness before trial so as not to incur a jury’s disapproval. The limitation, not removal, on the cross-examination of prosecution witnesses contained in the bill is designed to reduce these problems and ensure that the parties put their minds to the issues involved in the case at an earlier stage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091959"></A>
It is important also to note that the reforms to the committal process contained in this bill will align Queensland with the approach taken by most other Australian jurisdictions. The committal proceedings process has been the subject of extensive reform across Australian jurisdictions. West Australia and Tasmania have introduced significant reforms effectively abolishing the committal. Other jurisdictions have retained hand-up committals whilst making provision for the cross-examination of witnesses in exceptional cases only. In Queensland, amendments to the Evidence Act 1977 which commenced in 2004 imposed restrictions on the right of an accused to call a child witness at a committal hearing in relation to a sexual offence. The changes brought about by the bill imposing restrictions on the cross-examination of prosecution witnesses generally are based on the New South Wales Criminal Procedure Act 1986. This legislation has been in place for a number of years, has been tested by judicial considerations and is generally regarded as working satisfactorily. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091960"></A>
The member for Southern Downs raised concerns about summary disposition and queried the perception that these reforms removed a right to trial to certain accused persons. The reforms in the bill introduce increased clarity and structure by creating a new and distinct category of offences which must be determined summarily subject to some limited exceptions. These amendments will go some way to addressing the current haphazard selection of matters being heard in the District Court for a number of offences.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091961"></A>
The government will monitor the impacts of the reforms and conduct an evaluation. A combination of factors influence the decision not to have a matter heard in the Magistrates Court. There are a number of undesirable consequences of the current framework, including that pleas of guilty are not made at the earliest opportunity. Mr Moynihan found that there is no clear rationale as to why certain offences attract a prosecution election and others a defence election. He considered that this is evidence that there is a genuine need for modification with regard to who has the right to elect and the types of offences that can be dealt with summarily to provide a coherent system with clarity and certainty for all involved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091962"></A>
Under the amendments in the bill, all Criminal Code offences carrying a maximum penalty of three years or less, as well as most property offences, must be dealt with summarily. The defendant’s right to a trial by jury is safeguarded by the amendments to section 552D in the bill which allow the defendant to apply to a magistrate to have a matter referred to a higher court where exceptional circumstances exist. As is currently provided for under 552D, magistrates will also be required to abstain from dealing with a matter summarily where the magistrate considers that the defendant will not be able to be adequately punished on summary conviction. In addition, the bill amends the Drugs Misuse Act 1986 to expand the current prosecution election for summary disposition of possession offences to those offences carrying a maximum penalty of more than 15 years where no commercial element is alleged. Under section 118 of the Drugs Misuse Act a magistrate must, however, abstain from dealing with a matter summarily if the magistrate forms the view that the charge ought to be prosecuted on indictment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091963"></A>
The bill’s reforms to the summary disposition regimes in the Criminal Code and the Drugs Misuse Act seek to balance the rights and interests of all parties in a way that is fair, equitable and efficient. Defendants, as well as witnesses, victims and the broader community will benefit from the expeditious disposal of appropriate matters in the Magistrates Court. Defendants can expect to spend less time on remand and will be able to access specialist services such as the Murri Court, the Queensland Indigenous Alcohol Diversion Program, the Special Circumstances Court and Drug Court services which are not available in the higher courts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091964"></A>
In appropriate cases, however, defendants will continue to be able to have their matters heard in the higher courts. I would note for the benefit of honourable members opposite that one of the objectives of the reforms to summary disposition proposed by Mr Moynihan was to bring Queensland into line with other Australian jurisdictions. Mr Moynihan noted that there were more cases dealt with in the Queensland District and Supreme courts than in higher courts in any other Australian jurisdiction. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions noted that matters that would be dealt with in the Magistrates Court in other states, such as minor assault, minor drug possession, petty theft, motor vehicle crime, minor fraud and lesser property offences, are required to be dealt with in the District or Supreme Court. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091965"></A>
What was surprising during the course of the debate was the lack of analysis by those members opposite. There has been a significant process involved here: the report from Mr Moynihan, the response by the government, a draft bill put out for consultation, a final bill coming before the parliament. There has been no comment until today by the state opposition on any matters relevant to this important reform process. There has been no acknowledgement of the changes implemented by the government as we move forward on this, consulting closely with legal stakeholders and other stakeholders in the community who have an interest in this. We have listened to the community and we have modified our position to ensure that these reforms are effective, that they will take hold and that they will be subject to review in the future. We will proceed down this path in a staged fashion to ensure the reforms take hold and are effective. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096486"></A>
The member for Southern Downs also included in his address a misguided effort at muddying the debate with allegations and suspicions of conspiracies concerning amendments to the Public Trustee Act. I would note for the benefit of the member that, until recently, all unclaimed money held by the state was paid into the Treasurer’s unclaimed moneys fund. On 1 July 2010 the Treasurer’s unclaimed moneys fund closed due to the operation of section 97 of the Financial Accountability Act 2009. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096490"></A>
The amendments to the Public Trustee Act 1978 that are contained in this bill will ensure that all unclaimed money in Queensland, both public and private, is paid to the Public Trustee Office’s unclaimed moneys fund. As a result of the amendments, Queenslanders will be able to search a single online database for all unclaimed money in Queensland. The amendments will allow the Public Trustee to move unclaimed money that has been in the unclaimed moneys fund for more than 25 years from the public register of unclaimed moneys. This amendment is being made due to operational reasons. Given that it is reasonable to presume that a person who has not made a claim in more than 25 years will more than likely never make a claim, the amendment will ensure that the public register does not become clogged with obsolete information. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096491"></A>
I would note most importantly for the member for Southern Downs--and I hope this assuages his concerns--that removal of a person’s name from the register will not prevent the person from later claiming any money that they are owed. Further, the proposed amendments will remove my discretion to direct that moneys remaining unclaimed for 20 years or more be credited to the Consolidated Fund and will instead require me to direct that moneys remaining unclaimed for six years or more be paid to the Consolidated Fund. I am advised that as at 1 July 2010 approximately $36.152 million in the unclaimed moneys fund qualified to be remitted to consolidated revenue as a result of these amendments where it will be held for individuals to claim if they so desire. There will be no restrictions on individuals making claims on those unclaimed moneys. Transfer to the Consolidated Fund will not prevent a person from claiming the money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096495"></A>
The mandatory transfer to the Consolidated Fund is consistent with the approach previously taken of the Financial Administration and Audit Act 1977. This is also consistent with the approach taken in other jurisdictions, again bringing Queensland into line with what happens around the rest of Australia where unclaimed moneys are accepted by the state as part of consolidated revenue. I consider that the Consolidated Fund is the most appropriate place for this money to be held.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096498"></A>
The member for Southern Downs queried the summary disposition of the electoral offences in section 96E to 96G of the Criminal Code. While it may suit the honourable member’s penchant for the paranoid to suggest some dark and mysterious reason for dealing with these offences summarily, I would note for the benefit of the honourable member that these offences are already capable of being dealt with summarily. A cursory reading of the law would have demonstrated that. As each are punishable by a maximum sentence of three years, there is no possibility of a diminution of penalty by hearing them in the Magistrates Court. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096502"></A>
The member for Southern Downs concluded his address with a broadside at the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, drawing a tenuous connection between the capacities of the DPP and the validity of the reforms in question. I will not glorify the member’s comments with a lengthy reply beyond stating that, unlike the member opposite, I remain an unwavering supporter of the Director of Public Prosecutions, his office and his staff, confident in the quality and professionalism of the advice I receive and the work that they undertake each and every day and am staunchly opposed to any interference in the independence of the office, unlike the member for Southern Downs, who has sought to pass a motion in this parliament that would apply direct political pressure to the DPP on issues of his choosing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096503"></A>
As usual, the member for Kawana made a sterling contribution to the debate and dismissed the most significant reforms to criminal and civil justice in Queensland in a generation as unworthy of his precious time in this parliament. As ever with the member for Kawana, there is no beginning to his talents when contributing to the debate and yet further evidence of his delusions of adequacy with respect to an understanding of the law. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096504"></A>
The honourable member for Toowoomba North asked about the adoption of further case conferencing and the strengthened committal test. I thank the honourable member for his question. With respect to the implementation of a strengthened committal test--recommendation 55 of the report--Mr Moynihan was of the view that this would help to dispose of more cases at an earlier stage. Given that case conferencing is also focused on narrowing the issues and filtering out weak cases before reaching committal, the government considers it important that these recommendations are implemented together. The government will give further consideration to the implementation of both these recommendations following the evaluation of the reforms. This will allow a consideration of the outcomes of the mandatory case conferencing trial held in New South Wales. This was outlined in the initial government response to the report. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096506"></A>
Agencies including the Queensland Police Service are currently examining the introduction of a case conferencing system as part of a development of administrative arrangements to support the new committal process. The amendment ensures that police prosecutors will be able to be delegated sufficient authority to participate in the proposed voluntary case conferences. The government has determined to delay the implementation of compulsory case conferencing until the initial reforms to the committal process contained in the bill have been implemented. This will also allow the new voluntary case conferencing regime to be formalised and its effectiveness to be assessed prior to consideration being given to the implementation of a formal and compulsory case conferencing process. The outcomes of the New South Wales case conferencing trial, published recently by the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research, show that the trial had only a limited effect in reducing the number of late guilty pleas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096508"></A>
In conclusion, I would like to place on record my sincere appreciation for all of the work undertaken by a large number of people in bringing this substantial reform body of work before the House--firstly to Mr Moynihan, whose dedication to the project is evidenced by his comprehensive report. I would like to acknowledge the stakeholders, who have improved the quality of the bill by their generosity in the consultation process, including the Bar Association of Queensland, the Queensland Law Society, the Queensland Police Service, Legal Aid Queensland and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. I also want to thank the judiciary, particularly the Chief Justice, the Chief Judge and, more particularly, the Chief Magistrate, who has been conducting a round table in relation to implementing the reforms. I thank them for their ongoing leadership in the justice system in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096511"></A>
I also want to acknowledge the officers of the Department of Justice and Attorney-General who have played such a significant role in developing this reform bill. In particular, I want to thank the acting Director-General, Phil Clarke; the acting Director of Strategic Policy, Jenny Lang; the acting Director-General, Terry Ryan; and the court staff who have been involved. There are many officers in the Department of Justice and Attorney-General who have been involved in this project. One I would like to mention is Julie Harvey, who has committed a very large part of the last two years to the comprehensive consultation process and preparation of this legislation. Without her dedication we would not be debating this legislation today. It is rare that I have worked with an officer in the Public Service who is so dedicated, enthusiastic and thorough as Julie Harvey. I want to thank her particularly for her contribution to this important reform. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (5.24 pm): I believe clause 17 expands the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court to determine indictable offences under the Criminal Code and the Drugs Misuse Act 1986. I stand to be corrected, if the Attorney-General wants to offer more advice. I have been speaking to different legal officers, former police prosecutors and lawyers, and the general feedback that I get--and, of course, I am not a legal professional--is that they are wary of this idea, especially since sentencing penalties in the Magistrates Court are always lower than in the higher courts. That means that an offender will get a lesser penalty in the Magistrates Court, increasing the chance of repeat offending. It will also mean an increased workload for the Magistrates Court. In many areas, certainly within the Burnett and Bundaberg area, the Magistrates Court already has a very heavy workload, so this could increase the length of time it will take for matters to be finalised. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096557"></A>
There are further concerns that the victims will not have as much involvement in a matter before a Magistrates Court, because it is more likely to be pleaded out without their knowledge, especially if the case involves child victims. The people whom I have spoken to have a general concern that victims will become more frustrated with a matter being handled in the Magistrates Court, as the penalty cannot be as high as it may have been if it were dealt with in the District Court. Can the Attorney-General address the points that, in summary, there will be a tendency for a lesser penalty in the Magistrates Court rather than the District Court and that victims may not be as informed or involved? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096558"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for his question. The proposal that the government has before the parliament is to increase the number of matters dealt with on a summary basis. At the same time, we are not increasing the power of the magistracy to sentence for more than three years. Three years remains the maximum period of imprisonment that a magistrate will be able to impose. We are streamlining the criminal justice process by having all of those Criminal Code matters dealt with on a summary basis in the Magistrates Court. Similarly, possession offences under the Drugs Misuse Act can be dealt with in the Magistrates Court. I will give a bit of the background as to why we are doing that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096559"></A>
Mr Moynihan indicated that a larger number of matters should be dealt with on a summary basis. In his report his recommendations to government were that a very large number of matters should be dealt on a summary basis. Effectively, all serious criminal matters in the Criminal Code, except for the most serious cases, should be dealt with summarily and, effectively, all matters under the Drugs Misuse Act should be dealt with on a summary base. The government took the view that we needed a staged, prioritised implementation process. We want to see that this works. We have limited it down from the recommendations of the report. We limited that in our draft bill and, following consultation, we have limited it even further so it can be effective.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096560"></A>
In relation to the member’s concern about penalties, the fact remains that magistrates will only be able to sentence up to a maximum of three years imprisonment. The provisions in section 552D of the Criminal Code, which will be bolstered by this bill, indicate that a magistrate effectively should abstain from dealing with a matter if he forms the view that he cannot properly deal with it in the Magistrates Court. That is currently the law in Queensland and we are bolstering it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096562"></A>
The aim of the reforms is to take the minor matters in the higher courts away from the higher courts and put them into the lower courts. That is appropriate because, frankly, the District and the Supreme Courts should not be dealing with minor or lower level criminal matters, as I have touched on in my response in the second reading debate. Minor assaults, drugs possession charges and drugs matters in particular, in certain cases, should not be dealt with in the Supreme Court. Ours is the only jurisdiction in Australia where the Supreme Court has such a large jurisdiction in relation to drugs matters. It is appropriate that those minor matters be moved. If a magistrate cannot deal with it effectively, then it should go to a higher court. That will be the case. Defendants can also make application that a matter be dealt with in a higher court. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096563"></A>
Therefore, I am not concerned that there will be any compression of penalties. We will look at that closely and carefully, but the view that the government has formed is that that is the appropriate forum and the Magistrates Court is the appropriate jurisdiction to deal with those matters. I am not as concerned as the honourable member may be in relation to the role of victims. Again, these are minor level matters that broadly are dealt with in the Magistrates Court today for a whole range of criminal offending. We are streamlining that and bringing certainty to it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101232"></A>
In relation to the pressure on the Magistrates Court--there has been a lot of comment about that in the debate--the reality is that we are streamlining committals. Committals take up a very large amount of time of the Magistrates Court. As I have indicated, the prosecution has to prepare for the committal. All witnesses have to be prepared. Statements have to be prepared. Everyone has to be ready to go. On the day, more often than not in an overwhelming number of cases, it turns into a hand-up committal. It is waste of resources. It takes longer for matters to be determined. It keeps people in the justice system for longer. It wastes courts’ time. It wastes prosecutors’ time. That is not good for the system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101233"></A>
We are not abolishing committals. Committals will remain. What we are doing is ensuring that there is a streamlined process. You have to make an application, as the act provides, for a committal to occur. There will be a larger number of summary matters but a lower number of committal matters. We are going to keep this under very close scrutiny. It is not possible to do a precise mathematical calculation of what the various pressures will be on each court. But I can assure all honourable members--and I have said this from the start in this process--that we will monitor this very closely. We are going to watch implementation very carefully. We will divert resources within the funding envelope for the courts to those courts which need funding to ensure that these reforms take effect, and that is why we have limited the reforms in the first instance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101234"></A>
We are out consulting about the second stage of reforms now. That is to streamline criminal justice procedures. Much of that goes back to the 19th century in Queensland. We want to bring that up to the 21st century--one act, one set of rules, one set of regulations, one set of forms so everyone knows how the criminal justice system works. We are also consulting on whether the power of the Magistrates Court to sentence should be increased from three years to five years. We are listening to the community. The government has no predetermined view on that. It is something that was raised in the first round. We thought we would consult further about that. We have gone out to the community. I do not think there will be a compression on penalties. I do not think victims will be frustrated. In fact, I think victims will see justice done faster for those lower order matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101236"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the Attorney-General, and I acknowledge the reforming spirit and genuine desire to provide streamlined justice for people in Queensland. I am not convinced though that he has made the case that he is properly funding and resourcing these changes that are going through the parliament. I am thinking of the Bundaberg courts--the District Court and also the Magistrates Court. I know of the incredible pressures being placed on magistrates themselves, the court staff and also the solicitors and legal aid providers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101238"></A>
I would hope that the Attorney-General would be able to demonstrate a significant increase or a genuine increase in the budgets available for better staffing and more magistrates for regional and rural areas, especially in the areas of legal aid. I know that my Independent colleague from Maryborough spoke about how difficult it is for people to access legal aid. I know the Legal Aid staff in the Bundaberg WIN building are run off their feet all the time. By way of assuring me, other members and also the community that these reforms are not just being brought in to look good on paper--we need to prepare the way properly and properly resource all of those areas that we have spoken about--can the Attorney-General simply say whether there is going to be an increase in magistrate numbers and whether there is going to be an increase in the Legal Aid budget, which is under stress, and there are also problems, as I spoke about in my speech on the second reading, with people getting different lawyers and with being able to provide them with legal aid options. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101245"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I assure the honourable member that we will keep these reforms under close scrutiny. We need to see how they work their way through the system first of all. We need to see in particular what the impact will be on the Magistrates Court. As I say, there will be a diminution in the number of committals and there will be an increase in the number of summary trials. In the District Court, there will be a reduction in the number of criminal matters. Some of those will be sent down, in a sense, and dealt with in the Magistrates Court, but there will be an increase in the civil jurisdiction of the District Court.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101247"></A>
It is not, as I said, possible on a mathematical basis to determine the numbers, but we will keep it under close review. Where there have been funding pressures, we have injected more money. That is what we do. In this year’s budget, for example, we have put more money into the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal. We have put more money into the Office of the Adult Guardian. In relation to Legal Aid--and it is a good point that the honourable member makes in relation to regional and rural places in Queensland--we need to ensure that they are appropriately resourced. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101251"></A>
In this budget, we responded to Legal Aid’s financial problems because of the significant impact the global financial crisis had on the Legal Practitioner Interest on Trust Accounts Fund. The interest on that account is used to fund Legal Aid. That took a big hit from the GFC. So the government has committed $61 million over four years to provide a solid platform for the future for Legal Aid--basically to supplement and to respond to Legal Aid, to respond to the reduction in LPITAF and to provide, for one of the first times ever, a very solid funding base. We will continue to watch LPITAF. We will put more money in when we need to. This is the first stage in further funding for Legal Aid. But this is money coming from the Consolidated Fund--$61 million over four years to support Legal Aid. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101257"></A>
I give the undertaking to the honourable member, as I do to all members, that I will keep a close eye on this around Queensland. I do travel widely. I was in Roma recently with the community cabinet. I went to the court and I spoke to the court staff. I do that wherever I go, and I will continue to do that to ensure that those courts and those people providing legal aid are appropriately resourced. </Hansard-Body>

Mr JOHNSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gregory--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.39 pm): In rising to speak to the Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Bill--the one that we thought was never going to be debated here; finally the day has come, some 12 months after it was introduced--I can say that the opposition has some reservations regarding the bill. We will be moving two amendments in the consideration in detail stage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101313"></A>
This bill is the hallmark of this spin government. A review of outcall services was conducted and a report presented to this parliament in late 2006. Almost three years later, after a spate of bad headlines, this bill suddenly appears in the parliament. Whilst the content is not being disputed, it is nothing more than a diversion from the fact that research has emerged that shows that in Queensland, despite legislation regarding brothels, only 10 per cent of prostitution is conducted legally. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101314"></A>
During the late 1980s the Fitzgerald inquiry highlighted the entrenched nature of organised crime and illegal prostitution in Queensland. In 1992, after a review by the then CJC, the rights of sole operators were recognised. But at that stage no steps were taken to legalise any form of prostitution. It was not until 1999 that the Prostitution Act was enacted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101315"></A>
At the time of the three-year review of the Prostitution Act the CMC found that there were far fewer legal brothels than had been forecast. This meant that only about 10 per cent of all prostitution services available in Queensland were at that time operating through the legal brothel system. According to <Hansard-Italic>
Selling sex--regulating prostitution in Queensland, </Hansard-Italic>
a report of the Prostitution Licensing Authority in Queensland, a small brothel industry is being regulated but it operates in the context of a much larger industry comprising both sole operators and escort agencies which continue to operate illegally and outside legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101318"></A>
Whilst the broader issue has once again been avoided, the bill can be divided into four parts. The first part of the bill deals with the prohibition of outcall service prostitutes other than sole operators. The second part of the bill deals with the advertising restrictions for social escort services. The third part of the bill deals with prosecuting illegal operators and seeking asset confiscation. The fourth part of the bill deals with improving safety for sole operators. In its report on outcall services the CMC wrote--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101320"></A>
An examination of outcall prostitution services in other jurisdictions, both interstate and overseas, was considered important for the inquiry. Its aim was to provide an understanding of the possible implications for Queensland should these services be legalised for licensed brothels and independent escort agencies. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1101321"></A>
The CMC went on to say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101324"></A>
Common arguments put forward for legalising outcall prostitution services in Queensland are that the legalisation of these services elsewhere (nationally or internationally) has either improved the health and safety of the workers or has minimised the size of the illegal industry. We have found no evidence, and none has been submitted to us, to support these arguments. In fact, the available evidence appears to be to the contrary. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101325"></A>
For Queensland, unlike some other states and jurisdictions, sole operators provide legal incalls and outcalls. Licensed brothels provide legal incalls only, and all other outcall prostitution services--for example, escort agencies and street based prostitution--are illegal. Enforcement of the legislation by the police is largely complaint driven. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101326"></A>
In trying to quantify the number of sole operators, the CMC has found that it is not known how many sole operators are currently working in Queensland. There is no requirement for sole operators to be registered or licensed and, therefore, no means of determining the number of participants. With regard to the percentage of workers who operate within the law, the CMC concluded by saying--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101328"></A>
Nevertheless, it is clear that the illegal industry does exist in Queensland and, even if the stakeholders cannot agree on its size, they do agree that measures should be taken against it. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1101329"></A>
When reflecting on prostitution services overseas, the CMC found--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101331"></A>
Internationally, few countries have legalised outcall prostitution services and those that have (e.g. the Netherlands and Germany) now appear to be recognising the difficulties associated with monitoring and policing such services. There also appear to have been some increases in sex trafficking and child prostitution. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1101332"></A>
In focusing on the issue of health and welfare, the CMC found--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101333"></A>
All those who participated in the escort inquiry agreed that a primary consideration in deciding whether to legalise outcall services from licensed brothels and/or escort agencies was whether the health and safety of the sex workers providing those services could be assured. This has been the motivating factor in most prostitution law reform, including the introduction of the <Hansard-Italic>
Prostitution Act 1999</Hansard-Italic>
. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1101334"></A>
In turning to the issue of advertising for social escorts, the CMC found in its review--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101336"></A>
Our research suggests that the small number of legitimate social escorts are already complying with the requirements recommended. The reason for the recommendations is to target illegal prostitution providers. If there is a set of regulations defining the advertising and other activities of ‘social escorts’, illegal prostitution providers will no longer be able to masquerade as ‘social’ escorts and thereby obtain a competitive advantage over the legal prostitution industry. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1101337"></A>
One significant issue that the CMC found in 2006 which is very concerning is only being addressed some three years later. The CMC found--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101339"></A>
Currently, there is no law in any jurisdiction of Australia to prevent people under the age of 18 years from providing social escort services. We believe there should be a prohibition on employing or contracting a person under the age of 18 years for the purpose of providing social escort services. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101340"></A>
The facts are that between 2003 and 2008, 2,038 public soliciting offences were reported. Between 2003 and 2008 there has been a 264 per cent increase in the number of reported offences of knowingly participating in the provision of prostitution. Between 2003 and 2008 there were over 3,000 prostitution related offences reported to the police.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101341"></A>
Brothel data for 2007-08 shows that 23 licensed brothels operated in Queensland, down from 24 the previous year. During 2007-08, 184 licence and certificate applications were investigated and 157 were decided. Some 31 police entries were made to 15 licensed brothels during 2007-08. I refer to table 10 in the report which details the brothels that were visited by police and the number of occasions on which those brothels were visited. The table relates to police entries to licensed brothels. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101343"></A>
During the year we received advice from police and licensees, as required under section 61 of the Act and the conditions of licence, of 31 entities to 15 licensed brothels, detailed below. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101345"></A>
Some 9,349 advertisements for prostitution were approved by the Prostitution Licensing Authority in 2007-08. Over a four-month period during 2007-08 approximately 1,299 inquiries were responded to. Some 61 complaints relating to prostitution were received during 2007-08 compared to 75 complaints in 2006-07. The majority of the complaints were about licensed brothel operations and illegal prostitution activities. In respect of amenity, the Prostitution Licensing Authority has not received any complaints from the public about operating brothels. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106202"></A>
I want to speak to the lack of strength in the current criminal sanctions for those who illegally operate a business of prostitution. It concerns me that a person found guilty after a raid on an illegal brothel is fined $2,000 by the court and yet a legal brothel owner is forced to pay in excess of $25,000 for a licence. I ask the minister to comment on that in his summary because that seems to be an inequity that is totally unfair--that is, unlicensed operators are only subjected to a $2,000 court fine when a licence costs in excess of $25,000. The sentencing system for these types of offences is offering no deterrent whatsoever to anyone operating or thinking of operating an illegal brothel. That is why during the consideration in detail stage I will be introducing a minimum fine of $100,000 for a person found guilty of unlawfully conducting the business of prostitution. Even with the government’s proposed confiscation measures, it still requires the court to approve the seizure of property. The proposed measures put forward by the LNP will ensure a real deterrent. Anything less would be a failure to achieve the desired outcome of stopping illegal brothels.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106203"></A>
The final point I want to speak about relates to council and local community involvement in deciding the location of a legal brothel in a town. Currently, the council and the local community in towns with a population of 25,000 or more are held to ransom by a board of faceless bureaucrats at the Prostitution Licensing Authority, made up of many former Labor members of parliament and councils who are not representatives of the local community. I can hardly see how former minister and former member of the Labor Party the Hon. Wendy Edmond represents the views of the people of Toowoomba who objected to a legal brothel yet had no say in the final decision. That is why I will be moving an amendment that will remove the population limit and the ministerial veto power and allow councils and local authorities to have the final say as to whether a legal brothel should be approved in their community. This is how it should be done. Local decisions should be made by local leaders who know the workings of their local community, and that is why the opposition will be moving that amendment during the consideration in detail stage of this legislation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106206"></A>
In examining prostitution it must be remembered that most women involved in street based prostitution are not there through choice. They are amongst the most vulnerable people in our society. Many illegal prostitutes are addicted to drugs or alcohol. Many need help to rescue their lives from this misery. I hope the low-life men who pursue these women to give themselves pleasure look at themselves and think in time that these girls need some sort of professional assistance and do not need to be subjected to this life of vice to pleasure some people who take advantage of the unfortunate. Some of those women have been trafficked into this country by criminals and are held against their will. Many were abused as children and many are homeless. Many of these criminals are the Mr Bigs in the organised crime activities of our state, particularly the illegal influx of Asian women.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106209"></A>
The most important function of brothels is that they can operate safely and be exposed to the scrutiny of police, the most important people in providing that mantle of safety for the people who operate in this industry. However, prostitution is a running sore for the police in this state. They never looked at the people in the industry who had connections. The people in that industry in the past who have been connected to illegal brothels need to be looked at. Those people historically could not get a licence so they are still there. Whether they are in unlicensed brothels or somewhere else, these people are still the scourge of police.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106210"></A>
The prostitution unit is still as busy as always, and this leads me to an issue that concerns me greatly. Compared to other major cities throughout Queensland, there is no fraud squad on the Gold Coast. There is no Drug Squad on the Gold Coast. There is no organised crime squad on the Gold Coast. There is no major crime squad. The AFP is there with about 20 officers working with the Queensland police. By 2020 the Gold Coast will be Australia’s fifth largest city. By 2050 it will be as big as Melbourne, if not bigger. When the drug squads were rolled out in the early 1990s Cairns and Townsville got their drug squads but the Gold Coast did not. Instead, the Gold Coast Drug Squad is still operating out of Brisbane. This is certainly an issue that needs to be addressed to assist the police on the Gold Coast to intercept some of this activity. There are the Russian Mafia and motorcycle gangs in that area, and anywhere there is vice in relation to prostitution you can bet this element of society will come to the fore. I know the government is working to try to get outcomes in relation to these issues on not only the Gold Coast but right across Queensland. We must give our police the support that they need at this time to comprehend the problems that they are being subjected to by this element of society.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106219"></A>
The history of legal regulation of prostitution in the United Kingdom and Australia, according to Dr Linda Hancock, is one of state intervention which in Australia dates from attempts to curb prostitution under public nuisance provisions in the early colonies of the 1850s and the efforts to introduce the English Contagious Diseases Act into some Australian states in the 1870s and 1880s. From about 1910 all Australian states introduced criminal laws on prostitution whereby Dr Hancock wrote that the act of prostitution itself is not an offence but certain prostitution related activities are. These laws were based on English laws of soliciting, prohibiting under-age persons on premises used for prostitution, brothel keeping and leasing accommodation to prostitutes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106223"></A>
It has been reported that under Labor prostitution laws are failing to protect sex workers and are forcing them into illegal brothels. This has been backed by a team of Brisbane academics and its findings. Former Premier Peter Beattie introduced the Prostitution Bill in December 1999 which allowed boutique brothels with up to five rooms at the time. He said that if such rules had been put in place there never would have been a Fitzgerald inquiry which had detailed the link between illegal prostitution and organised crime. The new law established the Prostitution Licensing Authority to oversee the sex industry, but almost 10 years since the Prostitution Act was passed a major study has found that the laws are failing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106226"></A>
Trafficking in human beings--and what a deplorable situation that is--is a growing transnational, multimillion-dollar criminal activity. Although it is not a new phenomenon, the last decade has seen a significant change in the extent and nature of the problem. As has been previously reported, another murky area of Queensland’s prostitution laws is the emerging issue of human trafficking and sex slavery. Professor Schloenhardt found that there is no legal protection to prevent migrants being exploited or forced into prostitution against their will. He has been reported as saying--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1106230"></A>
We know of a number of cases in Victoria and New South Wales. Perhaps we are lucky that we haven’t seen any in Queensland. Perhaps we haven’t found them yet, but it’s again an area that the legislation currently leaves completely unaddressed. The longer we turn a blind eye to these issues, the longer we tolerate a large clandestine industry, the more vulnerable we make some people to human trafficking.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106232"></A>
Further reports from the ABC by Candy Forrest, who works with the Brisbane based Crimson Coalition, an advocacy group for sex workers, shows that she agrees with Professor Schloenhardt that the laws must be changed to provide better protection for workers. She said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1106235"></A>
A lot of people working in the industry are unhappy with the laws ... The workers who work in the licensed brothels generally feel physically safe most of the time, but we do get a lot of reports from workers in the licensed brothels where they feel like they’re being coerced into working under conditions that they may not have chosen for themselves.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111007"></A>
This bill does not expand or change the existing legislation surrounding outcall services; it is focused on strengthening social escort services, and that means that only non-sexual escort services can advertise legally. That is a good aspect of this legislation and one that I hope will certainly protect the women working in this industry. For legal brothels, nothing has changed. They can still have eight workers, five rooms and a total of 13 staff. They cannot exceed eight workers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111008"></A>
There is a need to create a level playing field between the brothel and the escort agency industries. The advertising which I made mention of--and this is something that the CMC picked up on in its report; the big flashy ads--does not paint an accurate picture of the services provided. The advertisements must be for social and not sexual services. This amendment is to create accurate advertising that will assist some of these people and expose some of these illegal brothels for what they are. This bill allows girls to have security, but they must have that security regulated. No doubt this legislation will assist in providing some form of protection for these women. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111009"></A>
As I mentioned earlier, outlaw motorcycle gangs and other elements engaged in criminal activity on the Gold Coast and in other parts of Queensland are still the masters of some of these strip clubs in the more densely populated nightspots where young people are the main target for their attention. I hope that our police are going to be further equipped on the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, in Brisbane and in other major centres throughout Queensland. I trust the minister can take on board the issues that I have raised in relation to the local authorities having a say in whether they want these types of operations in their local communities. It is very important that they be monitored. We all know that it is never going to be stamped out, but one thing that we have to stamp out and something that we have to have a bipartisan approach to, I believe, is getting rid of that scum element that seems to be attracted to prostitution and other areas of vice. With those few words, I look forward to the minister’s summary on this important amendment to the Prostitution Act 2009. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs STUCKEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Currumbin--LNP) (6.02 pm): I rise to join in the debate on the Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Bill 2009 which was introduced into this House on Tuesday, 18 August 2009 by the Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services. I assume that the rapid introduction of this bill came as a result of August 2009 press reports from the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
, the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
, the <Hansard-Italic>
Brisbane Times</Hansard-Italic>
 and local papers exposing to the public a sex trade industry rife with illegal bordellos, streetwalkers and massage parlours offering escort services. It never ceases to amaze me how the members of this Labor government can sit on their hands and do nothing but when their legislation falls under public scrutiny and is proven to be flawed, they swiftly brings in amendments to existing laws as it suits them. After this flurry of activity, one would expect this legislation to be debated. But instead the Bligh government has allowed it to languish on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 for two weeks short of one year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111013"></A>
As honourable members have heard from my colleague the shadow minister, the honourable member for Gregory, the LNP will not be opposing this bill in its entirety; however, as is often the case with the introduction of legislation by Labor, it is sorely wanting, and we on this side of the House acknowledge the need to further amend provisions within the current legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111014"></A>
Prostitution legislation was first introduced into this parliament in 1999. Over the past 10 years since the legislation’s inception this government has had to amend the Prostitution Act five times. During that time the Crime and Misconduct Commission has issued one position paper, two reports and a discussion paper, namely, in December 2004, the <Hansard-Italic>
Regulating prostitution: an evaluation of the Prostitution Act 1999 (Qld)</Hansard-Italic>
; in March 2005, an escort inquiry discussion paper; in December 2005, <Hansard-Italic>
Should legal outcall prostitution services in Queensland be extended to licensed brothels and/or escort agencies</Hansard-Italic>
; and in October 2006, <Hansard-Italic>
Regulating outcall prostituting: should legal outcall prostitution services be extended to licensed brothels and independent escort agencies?</Hansard-Italic>
</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111018"></A>
During the second reading speech on the third review of the act, the then minister for police and corrective services saw fit to inform this House--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1111020"></A>
I remind members who have cared to look at that CMC report that the CMC found that Queensland’s legal prostitution industry was one of the safest, crime-free models of regulated prostitution industry anywhere in the world. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1111021"></A>
The minister stated further--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1111023"></A>
We have introduced a regulated prostitution brothel system that is working. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111024"></A>
Whilst that notion might have been correct several years ago--but I have my suspicions--it seems that it has taken only a short while for the sex industry in Queensland to come crashing down around this government’s ears. The <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 reported on 17 August 2009 that illegal prostitution rings and cathouses riddled the south-east corner. It was estimated in one article that only 10 per cent of the industry was operating legally and that the 2004 CMC review estimated that 75 per cent of sexual services were provided by outcalls or escort services and most were illegal. Indisputably, illegal prostitution is rampant and near impossible to eradicate, which means that boys and girls as well as men and women will continue to be exploited by the insatiable greed and for the sexual gratification of others. The government’s amendments could do more not only to protect the vulnerable people lured into this industry but also to implement much harsher penalties for those who are caught breaking the law. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111025"></A>
This legislation will amend the following acts: the Prostitution Act, the Criminal Code Act and the Child Employment Act and, according to the minister’s second reading speech, it continues to support the five guiding principles regulating prostitution in Queensland. The minister states further that 16 of the 23 recommendations of the 2006 CMC report are to be implemented via this bill, which will see changes for licensed brothels and independent escort agencies, a part regulation of the social escort industry and further deterrence for those who participate in unlawful prostitution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111027"></A>
What is disappointing--and which again leads me to question this government’s flurry of activity when preparing this legislation--is the fact that not all 23 recommendations are being implemented. Granted, six of them have been accomplished through non-legislative means. However, some have been omitted. I mention in particular recommendation 22, which would allow for the disabling of telephone numbers advertised by illegal prostitute providers. Perhaps the minister would enlighten honourable members as to the delay with this recommendation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111029"></A>
Legally, some 25 bagnios currently operate in Queensland: 12 in greater Brisbane; five on the Gold Coast; two each in Maroochydore, Townsville and Cairns; and one apiece in Townsville and Mount Isa. Presently in this state the only forms of prostitution sanctioned by law are within the confines of a licensed brothel and incalls or outcalls by sole operators. However, it is outcalls that appear to pose the most danger for legalised solo prostitutes, and this bill purports to address this issue by allowing the holder of a crowd controller’s licence issued under the Security Providers Act 1993 to be employed as a driver for a sole operator. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111031"></A>
I remember vividly the main story on the news on Saturday, 1 May in 1993--a long time ago, but it is still etched in my memory--when Melissa Ryan was murdered in the Currumbin electorate. Melissa was 21 years old at the time and as an outcall sex worker she responded to a call to visit a client at the Sun Valley Motel in Currumbin. Tragically for Melissa, she would not return home again. Charles Sewell was later convicted and sentenced for her murder but only because of what can be described as brilliant detective work from the police investigators working on the case at that time. If Melissa had had the opportunity to employ the services of a security guard as per the recommendations in this legislation, she may well be alive today. Of course, there is always the fact that if she had not been a sex worker she would most likely not have suffered this terrible fate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111071"></A>
Allowing sole operators to use the services of a security guard or monitoring firm does offer a new dimension of security and is intended to offer increased safety for prostitutes who work as sole operators in Queensland. However, whilst it is a move in a positive direction, these amendments are still open to misinterpretation and abuse. Undeniably though, by far the riskiest business in this line of work is conducted by street workers with no fixed address. Numerous grisly murders of street based prostitutes have been vividly reported upon over the past decade or so and highlight the inherent added dangers of illegal prostitution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111074"></A>
Every worker in Queensland, no matter what their legalised occupation, has the right to feel safe at work. A 2008 report by Dr Antonia Quadara for the Australian Institute of Family Studies, titled <Hansard-Italic>
Sex workers and sexual assault in Australia: prevalence, risk and safety</Hansard-Italic>
, included figures from a survey conducted in 2004 that found that, of the 216 sex workers surveyed, 78.8 per cent of street workers had experienced sexual assaults at work and 60.6 per cent of these attacks were by clients. Let us compare this to the results for brothel workers which revealed that a lesser figure--still not good, of course--of 34.7 per cent had been sexually assaulted. That is under half the statistic for street workers. Of those brothel workers who had been sexually assaulted, only three per cent of the assaults were by clients. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111076"></A>
These figures are not surprising given the vulnerability to attacks that non-brothel workers are exposed to. Permitting a security guard to be employed as a driver for a sole operator has its merits. However, as I mentioned earlier, I hold concerns that these new amendments can still be abused as they do not, from what I can gather--and I will very happily be proved wrong by the minister--shut a major loophole to stop what is commonly called pimping. Furthermore, they could expose sex workers to organised crime syndicates and underworld identities that they have to date avoided. I pose the following question: if a security firm has 25 employees that hold a current crowd control licence, what would prevent the head of the firm allocating one security guard from his firm to each prostitute? Is it not then possible for the boss of this firm to manipulate these laws to legally operate as the pimp for the 25 prostitutes given that security guards will be paid for their services? I would appreciate some comment on this from the minister in his reply. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111077"></A>
On countless occasions both here in this House and in the public arena questions have been raised about the links between some security firms and organised crime groups such as bikie gangs. I am of the opinion that this area needs to be investigated further and defined more clearly so that the scenario I have just outlined does not occur. The amendment as it is at this point could be seen by some in the general public to actually be helping organised crime gangs by legalising individual pimps who could be then coordinated by one person or a crime ring. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111078"></A>
Having said that, I am very pleased to inform the House that illegal prostitution in Currumbin has not flourished in recent years due to the diligence of our local police. There has been little if any increase in these activities over the past decade as incidents are acted upon quickly. They seem to occur more in the section of Palm Beach located in the Burleigh electorate and they are often drug related. Overall, the Gold Coast is struggling to deal with a lack of resources, as was highlighted by the honourable member for Gregory when he referred to segments of the Gold Coast and its problems. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111079"></A>
This bill seeks to tighten advertising of escort services, which will be well received in the community. On any given day when one opens the newspaper there can be up to two pages of escort and prostitution services advertised. The provision under section 96A, advertising social escort services, to make sure an advertisement is always followed with the words ‘non-sexual’ or ‘sexual services are not provided’, should result in a reduction of the number of advertisements in newspapers, significantly in turn cutting the exposure of our children to this material. It has been for a long time very easy for prostitution services to be offered by posing as escort services as a way to avoid the proper licensing fees that legal brothel owners have to pay. The new laws also go some way to curb the influx of ‘people trafficking’ for use in the sex industry. A case on the Gold Coast of a former local hairdresser luring two Thai women to the area under false pretences comes to mind. This predator coerced these women to come and work on the Gold Coast where he pimped them out to repay debts that he owed loan sharks. He has now been convicted and will spend several years behind bars. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111080"></A>
Another area of this legislation that has been exposed as not going far enough to deter people from operating illegally is the issue of paltry fines for illegal operators. By comparison, the legal brothel and sex worker industries pay upwards of $30,000 per year in licences, compliance fees and charges. They work under strict guidelines in all facets of the business and are regulated and reviewed regularly. These include all-important health and safety issues to make certain that both clients and workers are not exposed to any sexually transmitted diseases and, of course, that workers are in a safe working environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111081"></A>
Owners of licences go to considerable lengths to make sure that all the requirements are met so as to keep their licence. It is absolutely ludicrous, after all the money spent on making sure a venue complies with the act, that when an illegal operator is brought before our court system they are fined a meagre $2,000, as occurred in a case on the Sunshine Coast not long ago. One prostitute could earn this amount in a couple of days and a top-end escort could earn this amount overnight. Such small fines do not deter illegal operators who have the potential to rake in double that a night. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111082"></A>
If this government is serious about cleaning up this industry it must put a penalty system in place that reflects the amount charged for licences on average in order to send a strong message to those operating in this industry that noncompliance will not be tolerated. The government needs to hit operators of illegal brothels and/or escort agencies operating under false pretences where it hurts--in the hip pocket--and severely so. Only then will we see some change in the reduction of illegal operators here in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111083"></A>
I move now to my final point in relation to amendments within this bill. That the Labor government in Queensland has not legislated against children under the age of 18 years working as social escorts before now absolutely beggars belief and highlights its half-hearted attitude to child protection. Omission of this amendment from the Child Employment Act 2006 reveals a shameful abrogation of responsibility by this government. Under no circumstances should a child under the age of 18 be exposed to some of the seedy behaviour that goes under the guise of the escort profession. Young, vulnerable and often lonely, they are easy targets. What is even more damning for this government that has been in power for over a decade is the failure to make public the findings of an investigation relating to child prostitution in the year 2000 as part of Project Axis’s inquiry into child sex offending. It did not make it public because it had not uncovered any new information. Yet the draft report in February 2006 concluded--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1111084"></A>
Child prostitution is a significant problem in Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111085"></A>
This casual approach to child abuse makes me sick to the stomach. How many kids could have been protected had the government acted swiftly almost four years ago? Despite considerable research by the Parliamentary Library, this final report has failed to materialise. I wonder, was this report ever made public? Were the recommendations ever considered or included? I do hope the minister will be able to shed some light on my questions on this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111086"></A>
In summary, whilst these amendments have some merit, there is more that this government should have done. Organised crime gangs could establish an easy foothold that would be hard to break if we do not look closely at the loopholes exposed here. Every Queenslander deserves to feel safe at work no matter what their profession--in a legal sense, of course--and the government needs to address the ongoing issue of child prostitution and stop hiding reports that could be somewhat damning of its inaction over the last 12 years to protect the youth of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs MENKENS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burdekin--LNP) (6.18 pm): I am happy to add my contribution to the Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Bill 2009 before the House tonight. This bill essentially aims to stamp out outcall prostitution, other than for sole operators, and to create a regulation making power to regulate the advertising of social escorts and social escort services. It would also seem to move to ensure the legal sex industry’s continued viability and reduce incentives for illegal prostitution. Most importantly, it moves to protect those under the age of 18 from being forced or permitted to work as social escorts. It is extremely important to protect these children from the predators in society. The bill also moves to try to enhance the safety of sole operators who, I would suggest, put their lives on the line every time they go to work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116026"></A>
The rules surrounding the advertising of social escort services are also being targeted by this bill. Advertisements must contain the words ‘non-sexual’ or ‘sexual services are not provided’. If any advertisement breaches these rules, the bill provides maximum penalties of 10 times the cost of the advertisement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116027"></A>
The CMC made a number of recommendations in 2006 as part of its report on the viability of legalising outcall prostitution services in Queensland. However, this bill only encompasses some of those recommendations. The questions do have to be asked: why has it taken four years for the Labor government to introduce the CMC recommendations and can this government guarantee that these new recommendations will be effective? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116028"></A>
This government’s prostitution laws have been shown to be useless when we look at the explosion of the illegal sex industry, which the shadow minister has outlined. It seems fine to acknowledge the controlled and legal sex industry, but it is only a very small part of what is happening on the streets. Queensland university research has shown that only 10 per cent of Queensland sex workers actually operate in legal brothels. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116029"></A>
In January last year the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
’s QWeekend reported on the burgeoning illegal sex trade in Queensland. This report told of the Gold Coast man Keith William Dobie, who was the first person jailed in Australia under human trafficking laws. He lured two Thai women to work as prostitutes with promises of good wages and conditions and then paid them a pittance, abused them and kept them under his control with the threat of deportation. This, of course, is sexual abuse of the highest order. The report also pointed out that there were many sex workers who advertised themselves as private and legal but were under contract to illegal brothel owners, no doubt locked into appalling situations out of which they were unable to fight their way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116031"></A>
There is a very real human element involved in the sex trade. A very large number--I would suggest the majority--of the women involved are not in this industry willingly. A few may have entered the industry by choice but most have found themselves there because of having nowhere else to go or no other way of earning a living. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116032"></A>
In Queensland legal brothels have to pay licensing fees starting at $30,000 a year. If an illegal brothel operator is caught, the courts hit them with a paltry $2,000 fine. Is it any wonder that the illegal sex industry is exploding with that sort of disparity? This government must get serious. It must increase the mandatory minimum fines for illegal brothels. These could be increased at least 50 times because the $2,000 that they are paying now is absolutely no deterrent. A major fine would perhaps act as a deterrent to those illegal operators and would in some way protect those doing the right thing by operating legally. I think this is the most difficult part of it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116033"></A>
The subject of prostitution and brothels is a very emotive one and it is certainly an issue that causes genuine concern, and rightly so, from many compassionate organisations, women’s groups and church members. Prostitution is an industry that has significant financial implications and it has many winners and losers, and the losers are the majority of the women who are caught up in the spiral of prostitution. Make no mistake about that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116034"></A>
That the government has attempted to put in place legislation to control and contain criminal elements within the prostitution industry and to set standards for legalised brothels, the health of prostitutes and the minimisation of harm within brothels is very sensible. However, to a very large part of the community, this is still an abhorrent industry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116036"></A>
The members of the Zonta Club of Toowoomba have spoken out very strongly about the issue of prostitution and the continued degradation of women with regard to sex. The basis of their request to re-examine the legislation is the unabated expansion of the global sex industry. As they have very correctly outlined in correspondence that many parliamentarians no doubt would have received, there is an increased acceptance and tolerance of sexuality within the community which also involves sexual abuse. They also state that by legalising brothels, society is perpetuating the concept of gender servitude whereby sex can be traded for money and the prostitute becomes a commodity, another piece of merchandise to be bought. They also claim that the trade enshrines a cultural mindset that allows the assumption that, being the oldest profession in the world, prostitution per se must remain unchallenged. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116039"></A>
There is an interesting perspective that has been put forward by the Zonta Club. This is in respect of the government legislation for the establishment of clean brothels. Whereas the women working in these brothels have to produce a clean bill of health, there seems to be no such encumbrance on the male client to produce a clean bill of health. From a philosophical perspective, these members have pointed out that the anti-discrimination law that gave women the right to protect themselves from any unwanted and unlawful male attention in the workplace is the same law that liberal feminists have used to argue their right to set up a service industry whereby they could trade sexual services for money. Sadly, it is often victims of domestic and sexual violence or victims of a drug dependency who become ready recruits for prostitution, legalised or otherwise, as they often have no other way to earn a living. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116040"></A>
There is a number of women who choose this form of employment, no doubt for financial gain or to support their families, but there is a psychological long-term effect on these people which is significant and cannot be underestimated. Psychologically, it is often impossible for these women to be able to retain their depth of self-esteem when they are being used as tools of others. These are the victims of the sex industry and we can make no mistake about that. There are also many young men who have also become victims of the sex industry and victims of sexual abuse. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116041"></A>
I certainly support the Zontians of Toowoomba in their cry that trafficking in persons for sexual exploitation or other forms of slavery and drug trafficking cannot be tolerated. Their assertion that legalised brothels are agents in the growth of the global sex trade such as strip clubs, mail order bride agencies, sex tourism and trafficking is no doubt a relevant claim. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116042"></A>
UNICEF was reported in the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 in September last year as saying that the Australian government has been a key player in efforts to stamp out human trafficking in Asia during the past decade but, even so, the situation is worse than ever and the networks are becoming more sophisticated. It states that Australia can do more and, like many countries that are willing to introduce laws on human trafficking, implementation and enforcement have been thin on the ground. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116044"></A>
The Toowoomba Zontians’ plea to the government is to re-examine the Prostitution Act as it exists today, being aware of the continuing escalating situation of global violence against women even though the 20th century has seen a much greater gender equity. I quote the final statement in their letter. They state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1116047"></A>
We the members of the Zonta Club of Toowoomba Inc are speaking out as one voice on behalf of the women and girls who have no voice and are the victims of such abuse. As stated by Sister Joan Chittister from her book <Hansard-Italic>
Heart of Flesh</Hansard-Italic>
--‘To bear abuse, injustice and invisibility is not a virtue. It is the sin of passive compliance with evil.’ </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116050"></A>
I applaud those members in their appeal. But we must also look to what is currently one of the important aspects: support for the current victims of the sexual industry. Sometimes we can discover that amongst intense sadness and depravity arises beauty and encouragement. Some years ago I was privileged to meet a wonderful young woman, Bronwen Healy. Her willingness to share her story and her commitment to helping others by her own example is truly inspirational. Bronwen grew up in a normal, loving and happy Brisbane family but when she was at university she became caught up in the peer pressure spiral of drug use that led to hard drugs and finally a life on the streets. However, by the strength of her character, her faith and her commitment, she has been able to rebuild her life. She writes of her life experiences in her book <Hansard-Italic>
Trophy of Grace, </Hansard-Italic>
which moved me greatly. I certainly encourage all members to read this book. Since then, with the help of many Christian friends, Bronwen has successfully created the Hope Foundation, which is a registered not-for-profit charitable organisation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116055"></A>
The Hope Foundation exists to bring hope, help and healing to the hurting people of the nation based in Brisbane, primarily women, in the areas of addiction and those caught in the sex industry--both those involved and their loved ones. It does this by outreaches, connection groups, public speaking, programs in a lot of different areas. They currently hold two outreaches every year, Valentine’s Day and Christmas in July, for the overlooked women in Brisbane. I have attended one of those functions and they are very special functions. Primarily, it is people affected by drug addiction, the sex industry and homelessness who attend. These events are hosted and provided for by Christian women around Brisbane. At these events the guests are pampered, fed, blessed and loved by the interdenominational volunteers. As an indication, at the Valentine’s Day 2006 function, 120 volunteers cared for 85 guests and 42 of these women indicated that they would like specific follow-up care to alleviate themselves from their present distress and suffering.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116056"></A>
The founders of the Hope Foundation believe that every person deserves an opportunity to start from scratch with a clean slate. They believe that through their programs this can become a reality for many people who are currently lost and struggling. They also believe that every person should be treated with respect and value, because every person does have something unique to offer. This wonderful support network has built a truly wonderful institution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116057"></A>
The foundation’s vision is for a drop-in centre to provide follow-on assistance for all the women who attended the outreach events. They would like to build centres to provide a safe place for individuals who fall within the target group. Residential care programs would follow and the foundation would also provide housing and practical care to help rehabilitate people with drug and other problems. I have no doubt that this wonderful foundation will achieve its aims and I wish it well. If there is a living angel on the streets today, it is Bronwen Healy. Today I received an email from the Hope Foundation, stating that Bronwen has been short-listed for the community and government section of the Telstra Business Women’s Awards and will be interviewed next Monday. I know that we all wish her well. </Hansard-Body>

The amendments that we are debating today certainly do not repeal any of the current laws on prostitution, but are an attempt to be seen to be getting tougher on illegal prostitution. Basically, these amendments are the Bligh government’s response to the exposure of the explosion of illegal prostitution in Queensland and, at the end of the day, do very little to protect the real victims of the sexual trade on our streets. I support the shadow minister’s comments and his position on this bill. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs SULLIVAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Pumicestone--ALP) (7.31 pm): I rise to support the Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Bill introduced into this House on 18 August 2009 by the honourable Neil Roberts, Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services. The bill addresses 16 of the 23 recommendations contained in the Crime and Misconduct Commission’s 2006 report titled <Hansard-Italic>
Regulating Outcall Prostitution: should legal outcall prostitution services be extended to licensed brothels and independent escort agencies?</Hansard-Italic>
 The bill proposes to amend the Prostitution Act 1999, the Criminal Code and the Child Employment Act 2006. This evening I will restrict my comments to legalising outcall prostitution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121113"></A>
The 2006 Crime and Misconduct Commission’s report into outcall prostitution identified that there is the potential for numerous adverse consequences for Queensland if outcall services from licensed brothels or independent escort agencies were to be legalised, including the significant likelihood that parts of the current legal industry, including both licensed brothels and sole operators, might be damaged. Applying the precautionary principle, this government has taken the view that where there is a substantive risk of an adverse consequence, such as the expansion of the prostitution industry or damage to the legal prostitution industry in Queensland and no clear evidence that the risk can be avoided, it is not prepared to recommend legislative change. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121114"></A>
This bill will reduce some of the risks associated with the overall expansion of the prostitution industry in Queensland. With the expansion there is a risk of increased organised crime and sex trafficking to meet the increased demand on the industry as a result of competition between the illegal and legal sides of the industry. The government acknowledges that the rigorous probity checks set out in the act have so far discouraged the establishment of organised crime in the prostitution industry in Queensland. The risk of upsetting this state of affairs should not be taken lightly. Additionally, the government identified the likely unwillingness of the illegal sector to move to the legal segment of the market. This is supported by the need for legal operators to meet costs associated with licensing and probity checks. </Hansard-Body>

Light regulation could lead to the setting up of modest two-bedroom licensed brothels, which could effectively operate as call centres for the provision of unregulated and unmonitored outcall services throughout Queensland, that is, the brothels could quite probably become fronts for large outcall agencies with relatively little investment. This government acknowledges that such an approach, combined with no restrictions on the provision of potentially dangerous practices such as bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism, would have detrimental consequences for the regulation of the licensed industry. Additionally, given the much lower set-up costs of such establishments, it is likely that they would severely damage the viability of existing brothels whose owners have invested a large amount of money in their premises. With those few words, I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Ms O’NEILL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kallangur--ALP) (7.33 pm): I rise to speak briefly on the Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Bill, particularly in relation to the carrying on business offences. The bill addresses limitations in the existing provisions in the Criminal Code, at chapter 22A under ‘Prostitution’, targeting illegal brothels, that is, activity occurring at identifiable places or premises and that these offences do not sufficiently cover illegal prostitution providers masquerading as escort agencies that provide outcall prostitution services, because there may not be an identifiable place or premises being used for prostitution by two or more prostitutes. It is understood that illegal outcall service providers often rent premises that are used both as an office and a call centre. However, those premises are not used by workers to engage in the provision of prostitution. Consequently, currently it is almost impossible to prosecute those illegal providers under the Criminal Code at section 229K, that is, having an interest in premises used for the purposes of prostitution, or section 229I, that is, persons found in places reasonably suspected of being used for prostitution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121121"></A>
The bill amends the Criminal Code to include a new carrying on business offence. The offence would enable the QPS to gather evidence over a period and lay a single charge to specifically target an individual or individuals carrying on a large illegal operation. The offence will have a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. This penalty is consistent with the maximum penalty applying to a person who commits a third or subsequent offence against sections 229H, 229I and 229K. However, if a person who is not an adult or is an intellectually impaired person is, to the person’s knowledge, working in the business at the time of the offence, the person carrying on the business will be liable to a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121123"></A>
The bill creates an offence that clients and workers of illegal prostitution enterprises also commit an offence. However, they may obtain a certificate of discharge, similar to the certificate of discharge in section 229J of the Criminal Code, in return for evidence that can be used against the person or persons carrying on the business of an illegal prostitution enterprise. To facilitate charges against the prostitution service provider, evidence of participation by the prostitution service provider must be obtained from the sex worker and/or client who contacted the service provider. Given there is no offence for the client, there is no motivation for the client to provide evidence or attend court during a proceedings to give evidence. There is also the potential embarrassment of the client’s involvement in such an offence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121125"></A>
I note that the bill makes changes to advertising restrictions, which make it clear that a social escort service does not offer sexual services. This may further protect workers in the business centre who may now be certain that they are not working for a service that provides sexual services and, therefore, are not working for an illegal organisation. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Ms GRACE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Brisbane Central--ALP) (7.37 pm): I rise to support the Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Bill 2009, which I believe delivers some worthwhile amendments demonstrating the Bligh government’s ongoing commitment to prostitution law reform for the state and, indeed, my electorate of Brisbane Central, which does have its share of prostitution activity. I am pleased that this bill delivers on the recommendations of the CMC review into regulating outcall prostitution, which was conducted in October 2006. The bill enshrines in legislation the outcomes of the review of outcall prostitution from licensed brothels and independent escort agencies. It also part regulates the social escort industry and creates further disincentives for the conduct of any unlawful prostitution business. The government is committed to implementing the recommendations as outlined in the 2006 CMC report, but more importantly ensuring that legalised prostitution in Queensland is not undermined by illegal activity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126048"></A>
I support the main aspects of this bill--in particular, the insertion of a new section 8B in the Child Employment Act which fundamentally bans the employment of a child as a social escort. I believe that protection of young people from this industry is paramount and that a child should not be providing social companionship to adults identified to operate in this area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126049"></A>
In addition, I fully support a major amendment contained in this bill which creates a framework to part regulate the social escort industry by restricting how they advertise and by creating offences for social escorts who conduct an illegal prostitution business. In doing so, this government acknowledges that currently advertisements for escorts are presented to publishers as ‘social’ escorts, but potential clients of the sex industry clearly understand them to be for sexual services. This government recognises that organisations or individuals who claim to provide social companionship only, and thereby avoid the requirements applicable to prostitution advertisements, have an obligation to make the nature of their service clear to the readership and potential clients. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126050"></A>
This bill will overcome this deficiency by including a provision that requires advertising for social escorts to include the words ‘non-sexual’ or ‘sexual services are not provided’. Additionally, all escort advertisements circulated in Queensland will be regulated. Also, any advertisement outside of Queensland which offers a service in Queensland will be similarly regulated, and I think that loophole definitely needed to be closed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126051"></A>
This bill will include a similar provision to that provided in section 93, ‘Advertising prostitution’, to provide that a person must not publish an advertisement for social escort services that is not in the approved form. ‘Advertisement’ includes a notice, sign and circular and matter that is not in writing but which conveys a message because of the form or context in which it appears. To ‘publish’ an advertisement or statement means to publish in any way and includes publishing in a newspaper or periodical and by a notice, sign or circular and broadcast by radio or television or in a film or video recording. I think we pretty well have covered the field when it comes to the form of advertising that this industry undertakes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126052"></A>
This bill will provide that, where an advertisement for social escort services has been published for or relating to a business, the person who was carrying on the business at the time the advertisement was published shall be taken to have published the advertisement, unless of course the court is satisfied to the contrary. The government acknowledges the difficulty of a prosecution linking individual sex workers to the owners or organisers of an illegal prostitution business. This bill will make the person carrying on the illegal prostitution business liable for the publication of any advertisement that infringes the restrictions we propose. The new provision will provide consistency within the act between brothel licensees and persons carrying on the business of prostitution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126053"></A>
This government recognises the need to deter illegal prostitution providers masquerading as social escort services. Accordingly, the bill increases the existing penalties for prostitution advertising to 10 times the cost of placing the advertisement or commercial cost of establishing the website where the cost of placing the advertisement or establishing the website is greater than $1,000. However, where there is no evidence of cost or the cost is less than $1,000, the person will be liable to a maximum penalty of 70 units, which is equivalent to $7,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126056"></A>
This is a vast difference to what currently occurs in Queensland where there are no restrictions in the way social escort providers advertise their businesses. Hopefully we will see an end to large provocative style advertisements both in print and on the internet which masquerade as social escort services but, indeed, are providing sexual prostitution services. This bill now ensures that social escort services comply with the same advertising restrictions as legal prostitution providers, removing any advantage to either sector. I also support the amendments which will empower the Prostitution Licensing Authority to issue guidelines and approve advertising for social escort services in the same manner as advertising for prostitution providers. I think this is definitely a step in the right direction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126058"></A>
In addition, I support other provisions contained in this bill which aim to tighten the operations of illegal prostitution businesses using sham arrangements such as using various premises to conduct their business and in some cases making it very difficult for police to prosecute illegal operators. Increased penalties for sham business arrangements, as well as introducing added protection for sole operator prostitutes, also make good sense. To improve the safety and welfare of sole operators, the bill will allow for the employment of a driver and message taker, and this is in addition to the currently allowed employment of a bodyguard. Like any other worker, sex workers also deserve to work in a safe and healthy workplace. In the interests of improved public health and safe sex practices, condoms and other safe sex materials will not be evidence of an offence under provisions contained in this bill. So clearly it is all about ensuring that wherever sex workers are operating it is a healthy and safe area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126060"></A>
I believe this bill strikes a good balance between strict regulation and the need to address social factors that arise from prostitution. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr FOLEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maryborough--Ind) (7.45 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on this very important piece of legislation. First, let me set the scene by saying that I find prostitution in general absolutely repugnant. I cannot imagine how demeaning it must be for a young woman to be trapped in a cycle of dehumanising employment like that. Certainly that is not a career option any of us would want for our children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126065"></A>
The member for Burdekin spoke about Bronwen Healy and the Hope Foundation. Bronwen Healy is a very close friend of our family and her PA, Emma Nainby, who is also a close friend, has worked for her for some time. Bronwen and the work that she does to support people and give them options to get out of this filthy industry are shining lights in the darkness. I could not speak too highly of their work and the job that they do. Bronwen Healy, as other members have mentioned, drifted into prostitution by drug abuse when she was a university student. I also have a close friend whom I grew up with, one of my best mates, and his sister was working as an illegal prostitute and was murdered some years ago. I have seen the absolute terror that that wreaks on a family. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126069"></A>
On a global scale, the US President himself has stated that prostitution contributes to trafficking. Prostitution is the driving force behind sex trafficking. The demand itself fuels the industry. Women trafficked to Australia are indentured by a $15,000 to $18,000 debt which they must work off before they are freed. Last year my wife and I, our doctor and his wife and a group of other people travelled to Cambodia, where we saw firsthand the absolute horror of prostitution. We spent a week going around working with an organisation called No More Traffick. We saw girls as young as eight who were being sold by their parents into prostitution for the satisfaction of dirty johns. It was an absolutely heartbreaking trip. We met with police, we met with the Australian Embassy and the Australian Federal Police. The briefings that they gave us indicated that there is a tremendous amount of trafficking of young Asian girls into Queensland, particularly through Papua New Guinea because it has not been a signatory to the Palermo Protocol. I will talk a little bit more about that in a moment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126074"></A>
Australia is a source and destination country for women subjected to trafficking in person, specifically exploitation in forced prostitution and, to a lesser extent, women and men in forced labour and children in commercial sexual exploitation. It is also a source country for child victims of sex trafficking. Primarily teenage girls but also some boys are forced into prostitution by pimps. One in 40 Cambodian girls are sold into sexual slavery. Human trafficking is the second largest organised crime in the world, even bigger than the drug trade. Two million to four million women and girls will be sold into prostitution worldwide over the next 12 months. I guess in some ways it is very easy to find ourselves in some sort of intellectual disconnect between prostitution here in Brisbane and some of the illegal sex trafficking worldwide. It is very clear that those links are there. The desire feeds the industry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131038"></A>
A great quote is, ‘Any existence deprived of freedom is a kind of death.’ When I speak to Bronwen Healy, who works with prostitutes here in Brisbane, she tells me some of the stories of the girls who are trapped in that lifestyle. I can see that that is absolutely true. We spend a great deal of time talking about prostitution and women but I would call on the men of Queensland to stand up and be counted and stop contributing to the cycle of legalised and illegal sex abuse in Queensland which is prostitution. </Hansard-Body>

 Absolutely. The <Hansard-Italic>

 and <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail</Hansard-Italic>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
has published a number of very insightful articles on prostitution and people trafficking yet they continue--and here is today’s paper--to publish ad after ad for young Asian women. A friend of mine did some research on that. That person added up the number of ads that talk about young Asian women. They are usually called students. In my experience, young Asian women who come to Queensland to study usually come from fairly wealthy families. They would not exactly need to turn to prostitution to get through university. The paper that writes insightful articles about the evils of prostitution sells advertising space for it. I think this piece of legislation will go a long way to stamping out some of those very unsavoury advertising practices. Domestic sex trafficking is a huge issue world-wide. Regulating the manner in which social escorts advertise for business I believe is a great start. I am very supportive of how this legislation will tighten that up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131043"></A>
Legalising outcall prostitution in Queensland has always been a very difficult area. The frequency and profitability of outcall prostitution prompted the CMC to conduct an inquiry into regulating outcall prostitution and a report was published in 2006. Representatives of legal brothels argued that to maintain their competitiveness and financial viability, licensed brothels should be allowed to offer outcall prostitution services. They also argued that this would add to greater transparency and control by rendering many illegal operations legal. The CMC, however, felt that these proposals would ultimately lead to an increased demand in the provision of illegal services. As much as this legislation is absolutely a step in the right direction, it is also living proof that demand has increased. This may add to the number of trafficked and under-age workers in this illegal industry. Such an occurrence was considered too great a risk to justify modification of what was generally seen as a successful system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131045"></A>
Common arguments put forward for legalising outcall prostitution services in Queensland are that the legalisation of these services elsewhere--nationally or internationally--has either improved the health and safety of the workers or has minimised the size of the illegal industry. The CMC found no evidence, and none has been submitted to it, to support those arguments. In fact, available evidence tends to point to the contrary. Internationally, few countries have legalised outcall prostitution services and those that have, including the Netherlands and Germany, now appear to be recognising the difficulties associated with monitoring and policing such services. There also appear to have been significant increases in sex trafficking and child prostitution as a result. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131046"></A>
There is some international evidence that both illegal and legal prostitution expand when legalised prostitution becomes a more acceptable social activity. This is more than a simple reflection of how service providers are counted when they change from illegal, and previously unknown, to legal, and therefore known, activity. The risks of sex trafficking and child prostitution often increase when the relatively static supply of local sex workers cannot accommodate the increased demand that results from legalising or decriminalising prostitution. We can see when there are large sporting events world-wide that a lot of prostitution is concentrated in that particular area and they will often be trafficked people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131048"></A>
What we really have to do is have a look at the core of this problem. Men who purchase girls for sex are mostly committing child abuse. They are not simply paying for sex; they are instead perpetrating brutal acts of rape against vulnerable children and women who are there pretty much against their will and do not choose to sell their bodies. No child, for instance, wants to be sold for sex. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131049"></A>
We all tend to think of this as an industry of willing participants of legal age. I did some research on when women across the world enter prostitution. In Chicago a study of 222 prostitutes found that 35 per cent of those girls entered prostitution before the age of 15. Some 62 per cent entered prostitution before the age of 18. In Seattle, Washington, a study carried out by Boyer, Chapman and Marshall found that in that location 100 per cent entered prostitution between the ages of 12 and 14. Silbert and Pines’ study of 200 women and children in prostitution in San Francisco found that 68 per cent entered prostitution before the age of 16. </Hansard-Body>

What we have is a situation where dirty Johns want younger and younger girls. I blame it on the men. We can belt the women all we like for it but if there were not the dirty Johns wanting younger and kinkier sex all the time then the demand would not be there and the industry would not be created as it is. </Hansard-Body>

Mr FOLEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Often wealthy men, that is exactly right. It is time to prosecute those who sell and purchase girls. If they are subject to punishment for their criminal acts against children, pimps and Johns will be less interested in the marketplace of very young girls. The laws already exist, but there is minimal political will at the state or federal level to prosecute them, especially the Johns. Despite all the political jingoism about being tough on crime or protecting our children, law makers are remarkably indifferent to prosecuting these child abusers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131054"></A>
How is it that in our nation in the 21st century any one of our daughters can be bought and sold for the purposes of sexual exploitation and without a severe threat of punishment? What is happening that girls’ lives are worth so little? In the context of a civilised society, this level of tolerated violence against girls is an irreconcilable contradiction. No girl should be purchased, sold, raped, abused or exploited and with impunity. Where there is a growing demand there is a growing market. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131055"></A>
So instead of continuing on the slippery slope of caving in to the demands of the prostitution industry, which clearly is an industry that gains from the exploitation of young women, Queensland should be investigating the Swedish model if it is really serious about reducing the harm of prostitution. That model, rather than prosecuting and punishing the prostitute, restricts the demand for prostitution services by prosecuting the purchaser of the illegal service. Amongst the positive outcomes from the Swedish model, which was adopted in 1999, is that Sweden is no longer seen as an attractive market for sex traffickers. That is a very significant finding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131056"></A>
Increased regulation, including registration of private workers, will also lead to increased police harassment and police corruption. The CMC stated in its report--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131058"></A>
The aim is to create a more equitable situation for legal operators, who are currently impeded by the Prostitution Act and illegal competitors--and not damage an industry that is clearly trying to do the right thing. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131059"></A>
The proposal for increased regulation, including registration of private sex workers, in order to combat an illegal escort sector will potentially damage the business and legality of private sex workers. This is by comparison to the threat of concerns either legally or not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131061"></A>
I have received some information from the Scarlet Alliance which believes that the evidence of illegal workplaces in Queensland is not strong. However, we do hear regular reports of police harassment of individual private workers who believed they were working within the law. </Hansard-Body>

It is a very interesting situation we find ourselves with. This is such a multilayered problem. Some of the areas where trafficking for the purposes of prostitution are prevalent are places like Greece which we would not think about. Greece becomes an avenue for a lot of the Eastern bloc countries. Around the time of the Olympics this became a major problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136086"></A>
I have story after story of illegal people trafficking and some of the horror that it introduces into the lives of children. There is a very interesting book titled <Hansard-Italic>
Best Practices to Address the Demand Side of Sex Trafficking</Hansard-Italic>
 written by Professor Donna Hughes from the University of Rhode Island. I want to make a couple of quick points while I still have the time, and that is to again focus on the demand side of prostitution. We have done to death the other side of prostitution and what needs to be done, and I believe that this bill is certainly a step in the right direction. If we want to really be serious about kicking a hole in this heinous industry, we need to look at the criminalisation of purchasers of sex acts, because worldwide that is the thing that has had the greatest impact on this vile industry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136091"></A>
To address the demand side of sex trafficking and prostitution, several countries have recently passed new laws that criminalise men who purchase the sex acts. Macedonia, Croatia--as I said, there are incredible problems in Europe in terms of people trafficking and exploitation--and the countries of the Balkans are sending, transit and destination countries for victims of sex trafficking. The presence of soldiers and peacekeepers has created an environment in which prostitution and trafficking have flourished. Macedonia and Croatia have passed laws criminalising buyers of sex acts if they know that the woman has been trafficked. The Macedonian law reads that a person who uses or procures the sexual services of a person with the knowledge that that person is a victim of trafficking in human beings shall be punished with imprisonment up to five years. The Croatian law reads that whoever uses or makes it possible for another person to use sexual favours or uses the person known to be a trafficked victim for illicit purposes shall be sentenced to an imprisonment of one to five years. The shortcoming of these laws is that in order to have committed a criminal act the man must know that the woman is a victim of trafficking.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136093"></A>
I prefer the Swedish system--and it has been having a huge impact on prostitution worldwide since 1998--because it is unique in that under the act prohibiting the purchase of sexual services which was passed in 1998 prostitution was defined as a form of male violence against women. The harmful effects of prostitution are considered gross violations of women’s and girls’ integrity, their dignity and their rights as human beings. Sweden considers prostitution to be a serious form of oppression of women, and I totally agree with that. Sweden’s action is also noteworthy because it is going against the trend in the European Union to legalise prostitution. In 2000 the Netherlands and Germany legalised prostitution and brothels. Although the Swedish law was controversial when it was passed, a survey in 2002 found that 80 per cent of the general public were very satisfied with the law.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136095"></A>
The Swedish law came into effect in 1999. After 33 months of enforcement, 249 men were charged with buying sex. Most were arrested for buying sex in the street. The Swedish government has reported the following numbers of arrests and convictions: in 1999, 94 cases were prosecuted with 10 convictions; in 2000, 92 cases were prosecuted with 29 convictions; and in 2001, 86 cases were prosecuted with 38 convictions. So clearly there is a trend line of success in the prosecution of people. According to the Swedish government, there has been a dramatic drop in the number of women in street prostitution and a decrease in the number of men who buy sexual services because this is creating an environment of naming and shaming people. Without the dirty johns to buy the services of demeaned women, there would be no prostitution industry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136096"></A>
I want to conclude my remarks by saying that I was very interested to read the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee report and the letter it wrote to the Hon. Neil Roberts. I read the reply that the minister wrote. Some of those things are really a step in the right direction in identifying where the illegal side of the industry is. It is also implicit that there is a recognition of the disgusting practice and the lifelong effect that it has on the women who are trapped in this cycle of child abuse. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (8.04 pm): I rise to speak to the Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Bill 2009. As has occurred with other bills in relation to prostitution, I will not be supporting this piece of legislation. Again--and I believe I have said it before--we have spent many years endeavouring to encourage women and girls and men and boys to be confident in their value and to be confident in the contribution that they can make not only to the community and to their family but also to themselves. I can think of no activity that is more demeaning and demoralising than prostitution. Whilst it is predominantly an activity that traps women and girls, there are a lot of men and boys who are also caught in that same activity. Many of the women in particular who are involved in trafficking themselves have a drug addiction and the vast majority of those who were not drug addicts to start off with which pushed them into prostitution become dependent on some kind of substance to be able to cope with the lifestyle.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136102"></A>
Every now and again we hear the story--sometimes it is proffered by the media and other times it is proffered by those who are strong supporters of prostitution--that there are people in our society who choose prostitution as a means to an end. For example, uni students choose prostitution to pay for their courses et cetera. That is trotted out on a regular basis. If we had access to genuine statistics, I believe that we would find that those people who voluntarily, knowingly and in control of their destiny choose that activity would be so infinitesimal that it would hardly reach the radar. Again--and I have said it before in this place--I believe prostitution is a most soul-destroying activity. I note that in the minister’s second reading speech he stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1136106"></A>
This bill continues to support the five guiding principles regulating prostitution in Queensland ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136107"></A>
The minister then went on to list them. The first was ensuring quality of life for communities. The minister did not introduce the first bill or the first piece of legislation. He was not the minister with carriage of this portfolio then, but if that were a guiding principle then communities with a population over 25,000 would have been given discretion to choose through their local government whether or not those communities had legal brothels. I note that the member for Gregory has stated that he will move an amendment that will give that discretion back to local government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136108"></A>
The second guiding principle was safeguarding against corruption and organised crime. I believe that if one spoke with those crime-fighting organisations one would find very quickly that corruption and organised crime is up to its eyeballs in prostitution and the selling of people against their will. The third guiding principle was addressing the social factors that contribute to involvement in the sex industry. I would be much more convinced of that principle and one that the government is living by, if you like, if there could be statistics shown of how many people have been helped out of prostitution with government resources, and I do not think there are many. There is the Hope organisation that the member for Maryborough referred to. It does have stories particularly of women and young people that it has helped out of that cycle of prostitution, but we do not allocate resources to it. We do not seriously address that area at all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136110"></A>
The fourth guiding principle was ensuring a healthy society, and I believe that if we had a healthy society we would not be debating this legislation today. The last guiding principle was promoting safety, and I will speak about that later during my contribution to debate on this bill. Again the minister’s second reading speech states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1136112"></A>
While the CMC has highlighted the need for the legal industry to remain competitive and sustainable in a way which would not lead to an overall increase in the industry, it also recognises that further deregulation by legalising outcall services would not achieve this and may in fact leave the legal industry open to those who seek to legitimise their illegal activities through legal means.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>

I find that paragraph astonishing. I know that the CMC’s report was released back in 2006 and that it has taken some time for this parliament to come to the point of implementing the recommendations of the 2006 CMC report, but the approach by the CMC about prostitution remaining competitive and sustainable I just find an astonishing approach to take. We are talking about people, we are talking about human lives that are changed forever by their experiences. That is confirmed by other amendments in this bill that attempt to provide a safer working environment for people who are involved in outcall services. </Hansard-Body>

I believe that we are all kidding ourselves. The minister’s second reading speech states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1141226"></A>
Currently a sole operator can employ one person to act as a bodyguard. This person must be appropriately licensed and only act in that capacity for that sole operator. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1141227"></A>
That is semantics. The minister’s second reading speech states further--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1141229"></A>
To enhance the safety and welfare of sole operators the bill will amend the Criminal Code to allow for the employment of a driver and to allow a person to take an advisory message from a sole operator. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

A message taker under this provision is not a receptionist. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141232"></A>
I am sorry, but it is a receptionist, and I am sorry, but the bodyguard probably will be a pimp. We can call it whatever we want to call it. We can say that it is a bodyguard but, if you are a betting person, you can just about lay bets that that person’s ultimate role will be either to pimp that person or they will become the pimp for that person. We can kid ourselves all we like in this place about what we are attempting to legitimise, but the fact is that we are not providing a better environment for our young men and our young women. We are not, because we are legitimising an environment and a lifestyle that is soul destroying. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141233"></A>
The member for Maryborough commended the minister for some of the steps that he has taken in an attempt to improve the lot of people who are involved in prostitution. The best way that we can improve the lot of those who are involved in prostitution against their will is to free them from it and the best way that we can improve the lot of those who are caught up in prostitution because they see it as the only way that they can get an income is to provide them with an income that builds them up and does not destroy them. On that basis, I cannot support this legislation. My hope is that there will be a time when young women, young children and young men who are caught in prostitution against their will are able to find a new path for their lives and to find fulfilment that will build them up and not tear them down. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (8.12 pm): I rise tonight to contribute to the debate on the amendments to the Prostitution Act 1999 which were introduced to regulate the manner by which social escort services can advertise for business and to create new offences in the Criminal Code of carrying on a business that enables illegal prostitution. Currently, there are two forms of legal sex work in Queensland. Private work, which is sole operators where a single sex worker works alone, is legal in Queensland but it is an offence to publicly solicit for the purposes of prostitution. Sex work conducted in a licensed brothel is legal in Queensland. Currently, any other form of sex work is illegal in Queensland. This includes unlicensed brothels or parlours, street workers, two sex workers sharing one premises and outcalls provided by a licensed brothel. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141238"></A>
Prostitution in Queensland is overseen by the Prostitution Licensing Authority--the PLA--which was established by the Prostitution Act 1999. The role of the PLA is to decide whether to grant brothel licences and managers’ certificates. In addition, the Prostitution Act 1999 established that the PLA is responsible for the following: monitoring the provision of prostitution through licensed brothels; conducting disciplinary inquiries in relation to licensees and approved managers; disciplining licensees and managers; receiving complaints about prostitution; liaising with the Police Service and other agencies with a view to assisting them; collecting fees under the Prostitution Act; informing relevant government departments and agencies about possible offences that are detected whilst carrying out its functions; advising the minister about prostitution related programs; advising the minister about the development of codes of practice for licensed brothels; approving advertising for prostitution; maintaining a licence and a certificate register; and raising awareness in prostitutes, judicial officers, police, community workers and the community as a whole of issues about prostitution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141239"></A>
In October 2006, the Crime and Misconduct Commission released its report on the viability of legalising outcall prostitution services in Queensland. The regulating prostitution report concluded that Queensland had a safe and effective legal brothel industry with no evidence of corruption or organised crime but considered that it had insufficient information to determine whether outcall or escort prostitution services should be legalised. The recommendation of this report called for an extended review by the CMC to examine this issue. Whilst the CMC recommended against the legalisation of outcall prostitution services, recommendations were made that were aimed at ensuring that the legal sex industry continued to be viable and therefore reduce the incentives for an illegal industry to flourish.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141240"></A>
The amendments to the act will regulate the manner in which social escort services advertise for business and the amendments to the Criminal Code will create an offence for social escort providers found to be carrying on the business of illegal prostitution and are aimed at enhancing the safety of sole operators. The legislation will amend the Child Employment Act to create a new offence that provides that an employer must not require or permit a child less than 18 years of age to work as a social escort. This, of course, is the most important aspect of the bill as minors are protected from unscrupulous business owners soliciting minors into prostitution, whether it is by legal or illegal brothels. </Hansard-Body>

The growth of illegal brothels throughout Queensland has increased dramatically, ironically since prostitution was legalised by the state Labor government. Illicit sex rings are now so common that they are impacting on the legal tax-paying businesses. According to the Prostitution Licensing Authority, currently the Gold Coast has five licensed brothels. The increase in illegal prostitution was evident way back in 2007 when the following media release was issued by the police--</Hansard-Body>

Much debate has been had about the different types of prostitution that is occurring on the Gold Coast. In fact, in an article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 on 22 August 2005, when the Queensland government was debating prostitution, the Gold Coast was even identified as the prostitution capital of Queensland along with Brisbane’s Fortitude Valley. There were calls that brothels would be acceptable to the community and that would attract brothels to the area ‘like bees to a honey pot’. The article stated--</Hansard-Body>

‘I have a steady stream of people in my shop asking where they can find a good-looking working girl and all I have to do is show them the personal ads in the newspapers,’ said Mr Tyler. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

As far back as 10 November 1999 the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 commented on the issue of legalising brothels in industrial areas and quoted a leading legal firm as saying--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1141255"></A>
I’ve had enquiries over the years from people wanting to set up illegal brothels on the Coast but now that they are to be legalised, I’m not expecting a rush. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141256"></A>
According to a further article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 of 19 November 1999, a number of boutique brothels were established in industrial and commercial areas, most in existing buildings adapted with purpose-built internal fit-outs. From the outside their actual purpose is almost impossible to discern. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141258"></A>
 In the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunshine Coast Daily</Hansard-Italic>
 brothel owners were quoted as saying that illegal prostitution was rife, with Asian gangs behind much of the corruption within illegal brothels. The article stated further--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1141260"></A>
Sunshine Coast brothel owner Paris Satine said the illegal industry was thriving despite a series of arrests in Queensland last year. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1141261"></A>
Ms Satine said Asian crime syndicates were operating prostitution rings using young women who arrived in Australia on short-term visas, and there appeared to be little interest in tackling the problem. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1141262"></A>
Ms Satine said she had received confidential information over a long period of time about Asian crime gangs operating illegal prostitution rings, and pointed to newspaper advertisements for newly arrived young Asian prostitutes to support her claims. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Legal operators currently pay around $30,000 a year in government fees and charges. Illegal brothel operators are only fined about $2,000 and can be busted 15 times in a year before they face the same costs as legal brothel operators. If the government were serious about prostitution law reform in Queensland it should have at least introduced the Telecommunications Interception Bill years ago to assist police in prosecuting unscrupulous illegal brothel owners who extort the vulnerable and the young. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146494"></A>
This legislation is an attempt by the Bligh Labor government to be seen to be getting tough on illegal prostitution. The bill has been three years in the making after the CMC made a number of recommendations in late 2006. The Bligh government’s panicked prostitution law reforms are a direct response to the number of illegal prostitution outlets that have burgeoned under its watch. The amendments that are being fast-tracked through the parliament are the result of revelations by many third parties, including leading academics and workers in the state’s legal sex industry, that illegal prostitution is out of control under this government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146496"></A>
Research by the University of Queensland’s Professor Scholendarardt and others has found that only 10 per cent of Queensland sex workers operate in legal brothels, which means that 90 per cent of sex workers are either outsourcing as single workers or are working in the flourishing illegal sex industry in Queensland. If this government was serious about proper reform, mandatory minimum fines would be increased to act as a deterrent instead of the slap-on-the-wrist mentality that currently exists whereby illegal brothels are given minimum fines even if they are caught. It makes a mockery of the system that forces legal brothels to pay upwards of $30,000 a year in government compliance fees and charges when illegal operators are fined a mere $2,000 and are then back out on the streets doing it all again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146497"></A>
The state Labor government thinks that these pathetic fines are enough to deter illegal operators. However, it is actually encouraging illegal sex rings and human trafficking. In his second reading speech the minister stated that this bill purports to create further disincentives for those who engage in the business of unlawful prostitution. In the minister’s own words--not the current minister--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1146498"></A>
However, illegal prostitution providers who masquerade under the guise of a social escort agency often rent office space to undertake business activities, limiting the ability of police to effectively target and prosecute illegal prostitution providers. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146499"></A>
This is another example of Labor’s soft-on-crime attitude where offenders on a daily basis thwart the law and get away with a fine as a slap on the wrist so that they can be back on the streets again. This bill does not go far enough. The bill is nothing more than an attempt by Labor to appear to be tough on illegal prostitution and crime. As I have stated already, it has taken three years to implement the recommendations of the CMC back in 2006. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146500"></A>
The Liberal National Party proposes, through amendments, that a mandatory minimum fine be imposed on illegal brothel operators to act as a deterrent and to hit those illegal operators where it hurts the most--on their bottom line. This Labor government is soft on crime, soft on deterrence and soft on taking on the real issues. This is yet another example of a government that proposes knee-jerk legislation without consideration of the broader implications on the community, on the police and on the judiciary. </Hansard-Body>

Ms STONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Springwood--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(8.22 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Bill 2009, which is a model to sustain legal operators and reduce illegal prostitution. This government has adopted a multipronged approach to attack the illegal prostitution industry while at the same time sustaining the current status of the legal prostitution industry in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146503"></A>
The four components of the approach are regulating social escort providers, tightening the existing authority’s prostitution advertising policies, improving enforcement measures and improving the safety of sole operators. Tonight I want to speak on the area of advertising policies. I especially have had complaints to my office about advertising of social escort agencies. On one occasion when I was delivering meals on wheels a client told me that she was very upset with the number of escort providers that were advertising in the local papers. It is something that has been raised by my community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146504"></A>
Under section 139(2) and section 93(4) of the act prostitution advertising must be in the approved form and of the permitted size. With respect to a licensed brothel or sole operator prostitution advertising must include particulars such as the business name, trading name and the phone number of the licensed brothel and any other content prescribed in the regulation or guidelines about the approved form for advertisements for prostitution. However, there are no restrictions on the advertising of social escorts. The result of this anomaly is that a person purporting to provide social escorts can place advertisements that are larger than those for prostitution and adult entertainment with content that is only limited by the publication distributing the advertisement. As I said, my office has certainly received its fair share of complaints regarding some of these advertisements. My constituents are quite offended by them. I am pleased to see this bill before the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146505"></A>
This bill will amend the act to provide a regulation making power regarding advertising by social escorts, in addition to sex workers who are sole operators and licensed brothels. The legislative amendment will remove the competitive edge this gives the illegal prostitution providers. It is proposed that a regulation be developed for Governor-in-Council approval within the next six months outlining that where advertising for social escorts meets requirements outlined in the regulation and guidelines similar to those currently displayed in the regulation and guidelines for licensed brothels and prostitution sole operators, the approval of the authority is not required. However, where an advertisement does not meet the requirements the social escort will commit an offence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146506"></A>
I now want to turn to the explanatory notes and in particular restrictions on freedom of speech. It states in the explanatory notes that the submission restricts free speech by imposing advertising regulations on a legal industry. Social escorts and social escort services will be restricted in the manner in which they advertise, closing a loophole that allows illegal prostitution providers to advertise as social escorts. Research undertaken by the CMC in the outcall prostitution report revealed that the small number of legitimate social escort providers already comply with the proposals contained in the submission. Further, illegal prostitution providers who publish provocative advertisements to give the appearance of advertisements for prostitution impact upon the continued viability of the legal prostitution industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146507"></A>
I note that the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee also raised questions on the sufficient regard to the rights and liberties of individuals. I want to read the response from Minister Roberts to <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert No. 9</Hansard-Italic>
 <Hansard-Italic>
2009</Hansard-Italic>
--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1146509"></A>
Clauses 7 and 8 extend existing legislative restriction on advertising of prostitution and social escort services. The additional restrictions on advertising are necessary given the proliferation of advertising prostitution via the internet. This is coupled with the requirement that advertisements by social escort services must clearly state they do not provide sexual services and be consistent with the size currently prescribed for licensed brothels. These clauses are considered to have sufficient regard to the rights and liberties of individuals. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146510"></A>
I know that my constituency certainly agree with the minister on that and were asking for the tightening of regulations when it comes to advertisements of social escorts in newspapers in particular, which is the issue that was always raised with me. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146511"></A>
While I have no doubt that this change will not stop illegal operators, I believe that it will reduce the number. The development of the regulation will be informed by consultation undertaken with the authority and the industry. This streamlined process will allow social escorts to advertise in a timely manner and addresses enforcement issues for the police and the authority. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146512"></A>
I acknowledge the work done by the former police minister, Judy Spence, in getting this bill before the House. I also acknowledge all the work she has done previously in the House for the safety of women in the sex industry and for improving enforcement measures. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

(8.28 pm): This subject matter is one that has raised a great deal of interest and indeed concern amongst the community over a long period of time. As I recall, the original bill was introduced in or about 1999. When I stood successfully in the 2001 election it was very much a live issue in Toowoomba. In fact, in Toowoomba North it has been a live issue for 2004, 2006, 2009 and probably will be in 2012 as well, such is the nature of my electorate and the passion which this subject matter evokes.</Hansard-Body>

 This legislation is of interest because it follows on a very pertinent and appropriate review of the legislation by the CMC carried out in 2006. The government has been careful and cautious in relation to its consideration of the report and we see the results of that consideration in the legislation tonight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146548"></A>
One aspect of it that I want to comment on is with respect to the safety of sole operators. In the interests of promoting safety, the bill amends the Criminal Code to allow actions necessary to ensure the safety of the sole operator or allow a sole operator to have one employee who acts as a receptionist and/or driver. Consequently, section 229H of the Criminal Code is amended to add an exception to the application of the provisions to a driver of a sole operator. The bill amends section 229H of the Criminal Code to create an exception for people who engage in actions necessary to ensure the safety of sole operators--for example, being told where the sole operator is attending an outcall and when he or she will be back, remaining in telephone contact with the sole operator while they are attending an outcall and disseminating information about dangerous clients and, further, people who act as receptionists or drivers for the sole operator but only if they act for one sole operator and only if they are not current sex workers themselves. However, the person acting in the capacity of a driver must be the holder of a crowd controller’s licence under the Security Providers Act 1999. Because of probity checks conducted on licensed security providers, the entry of organised crime into the sole operator industry is thereby minimised. I have no hesitation in supporting that provision of this amending act as well as the others. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146554"></A>
On the point of sole operators, by coincidence a constituent came to see me last week. This constituent lives with her husband and family in a suburb that is close to the CBD of Toowoomba. She is concerned because a sole operator has moved in next door. That has created a problem for her in terms of rearing her own children. What she says to the children by way of explanation creates a problem because people are visiting the sole operator at all hours of the day and night and some clients mistakenly come to my constituent’s house as well. Whilst the CMC investigation was concerned--and understandably so and no doubt as directed--with the safety issue of sole operators, it may well be that the minister might entertain some consideration of investigation into the effects on the general community, particularly residents in residential areas, who may well be affected as this constituent of mine clearly is. I have a great deal of sympathy for their situation. I do not know what the answer is. I therefore ask that the minister give it consideration and perhaps it might well be the subject of some investigation into the future to come up with some solution to that problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146555"></A>
In relation to the issue of prostitution itself and its legalisation, as I said before, this issue is one that has arisen often in Toowoomba. It is one which my friends opposite in the Liberal National Party--and for most of that time the National Party--strongly opposed when legislation was presented, it would be fair to say. They presented the case of a united conservative opposition to this type of legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146556"></A>
I notice in the Western Australian newspapers of recent times that the Liberal National Party government of Western Australia is now proceeding to legalise prostitution in Western Australia. Under previous governments, including the previous Labor government, prostitution was the subject of the turning of a blind eye. It was rare for any charges to be laid except where under-age sex was involved or unsafe practices were involved. The Liberal National Party has now indicated its intention to regulate the industry. Why is this? The stated reasons are to improve the health standards and the safety of people involved in the industry--very much like the reasons for the Queensland legislation. Other reasons include participants will be licensed, they will be confined to commercial and industrial areas and there will be compulsory health and blood checks. </Hansard-Body>

 (Mundingburra--ALP) (8.35 pm): I rise in support of the Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Bill 2009. One provision I would like to look at is ensuring adequate protection for vulnerable women, because very frequently prostitutes do fall under that category. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146563"></A>
The government does continue to support the five guiding principles regulating prostitution in Queensland. They are: ensuring quality of life for communities, safeguarding against corruption and organised crime, addressing the social factors that contribute to involvement in the sex industry, ensuring a healthy society and, of course, promoting safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146564"></A>
As the member for Toowoomba North was saying, I was actually here in this place in 1999 when we brought in the prostitution law reform. It was a very emotive topic indeed but one that, when we saw it in the cold, hard light of day, was all about protecting vulnerable women who work in the sex industry. There have always been women who work in the sex industry and there always will be. If we as a government protect them as much as possible then we are doing the right thing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146565"></A>
Prostitution in Queensland is legal in two ways. Licensed brothels can provide legal incalls from rooms within the licensed brothel and sole operators can provide legal incalls from their own home and legal outcalls to another place. However, the government is adopting a tough approach to the issue of trafficking in women for sexual servitude. Whilst the Queensland Police Service does not have any evidence that sexual slavery, debt bondage, people smuggling or forced labour is a significant problem in Queensland, the principles of the strategy have been adopted. The Prostitution Enforcement Task Force in particular has developed and maintained strong partnerships with the Australian Federal Police and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. They frequently cooperate to ensure maximum success of operational work to both agencies involving unlawful prostitution and possible sexual servitude issues. The Queensland Police Service task force investigators are trained to assist in the conduct of sexual servitude related investigations including providing an understanding of the causal factors, the indicators and criminal entities and methodologies that might be associated with this type of crime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146570"></A>
When we look at child employment in this industry, although it is understood that the provision of social escort services is not an illegal industry, the industry is not subject to regulation in any Australian jurisdiction. Because this government acknowledges that social companionship may operate as a precursor to participation in the sex industry, the Child Employment Act 2006 should be used to guard against this possibility. The bill provides that under section 9 of the CEA an employer is prohibited from requiring or permitting a child to perform work as a social escort. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

 (the Act) to create a framework to regulate the manner in which social escort services can advertise for business and the Criminal Code to create new offences for carrying on the business of enabling illegal prostitution. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I was elected to this House in 1998 and I had a rude awakening when the Prostitution Act 1999 came before the House. It horrified me to think that this parliament did not hold women in enough esteem to protect them from the Prostitution Act itself. While I know that this bill is presented to the House tonight in an attempt to offer a little more protection to people who engage in prostitution, I question whether or not it will do what it is hoped it will do. People know that a lot of advertising already exits. My local paper is only half a dozen pages long and sex workers advertise in it. Most people in our town laugh at the ads. However, while we read them as if they were the comedy section, they can be quite offensive. During one of my election campaigns, an advertisement in the local paper stated, ‘Dolly will be in town’ on such and such a day. I could have done a lot of business that day, because I received a lot of phone calls. It may have been somebody’s idea of a joke--I am not quite sure--but it did get me a lot of attention in the area so perhaps I should be more grateful than embarrassed. However, it is not a nice thing to have one’s name associated with. </Hansard-Body>

I have met quite a few prostitutes. When I visit different towns I like to talk to the people in the streets and I ask them what they do. When I meet prostitutes I will ask them whether they tell their children that they are engaged in prostitution or escort services. Most of them correct me by saying, ‘I’m an escort.’ Then I ask the question, ‘Do you engage in the sex act, in any of its forms, with your clients?’ They say, ‘Yes we do, but we are, in fact, escorts. We are not prostitutes.’ To be quite honest, I really cannot see the difference. I ask, ‘Do you tell your children? Are you proud to tell your children that you work in the sex industry? Do you tell your parents? Do you tell your friends? Do you have any qualms about it?’ The answer is usually, ‘No, it is just our private business and we like to keep it that way.’ I believe that if you are in an occupation that you are not proud to tell your family about, it casts a shadow over it, which really puts it into the light in which it exists. It is a dark and often very seedy occupation that involves dark and seedy people. Perhaps that is a TV portrayal of it, but I do not really think that pimps and people of that ilk can be seen as anything more. </Hansard-Body>

It concerns me a lot that roughly only 10 per cent of people work legally in prostitution. That means that 90 per cent are not working legally. Why do 90 per cent of those people work in illegal institutions? It is because many of them are very young, they may have run away from home, they may be drug addicts and they are not welcome in legal venues. Certainly runaways would not be welcome, because they would be likely to be underage. Drug addicts would not be welcome because they would not have the appropriate appearance et cetera. Many others would not be suitable either. Some women engage in prostitution once or twice to get a little bit of money to buy a fridge or whatever. I know there are housewives who engage in prostitution to get a little more money into the family coffers. I know a woman who engages in prostitution once every three months or so, if she needs a little extra for herself or whatever. She drives down to Brisbane and spends a couple of nights on the streets or in a motel room. When she returns home she never tells her husband, or so she tells me. I said, ‘Aren’t you worried about getting something?’ She said, ‘No, I get myself tested and make them wear condoms. I’m fine.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151986"></A>
If 90 per cent of those people are engaged in the illegal sex industry, this legislation is really targeting a very small number of people. I do not believe that we have the forces to regulate the industry by having the police or anyone else keeping an eye on what is going on. The police have a lot of trouble now because they do not have the resources that they need to do everyday policing. Therefore, I have grave doubts about this legislation doing what it is supposed to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151987"></A>
I find it very distressing that any woman feels that she has to partake in this kind of activity. I do not think you can put your own values on anybody else, but it has always been my belief that a woman has only herself. It is the most valuable thing she has, and I do not mean parts of her body. She is the most valuable thing she has. If, as women in this place, we do not uphold the value of a woman as an individual, how can we expect the men who abuse women to respect them? Escort agencies and high-class brothels, as they are known, are frequented by men of wealth and affluence who are quite well-to-do in society. Those on the streets who have no money to spare will frequent the women on the streets, because they will be the only ones they can afford. To look at it another way, this legislation will impact on the people who can least afford it. I am not going to condone what they do. I think everybody should pay a very high price for engaging in this type of activity, and I do not mean a monetary price. They will pay a high price in the longer term. For example, if their families find out they will pay in that manner as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151988"></A>
I think the general public has become desensitised to this issue. By legalising prostitution in 1999, it became tolerated a little more than it was before. Once it becomes tolerated, in years to come it will become accepted to a degree and people will become even more desensitised to it. I know a lot of people know the truth of it. They know how demeaning it is and how men profit from the services of women--not the men who engage them for the sex act, but those who profit by selling them. I find it interesting that people say there is no trafficking of young people in Queensland, because I have never seen any research undertaken on that. I listened to the member for Maryborough speak. If the organisations he deals with and church groups know that it is occurring, why don’t the Queensland authorities know about it? I suppose it is a bit like drug taking in the towns. Most people can say, ‘There is drug dealing going on in such-and-such a toilet block on such-and-such a street at 10 past 10. If you drive past, you can get something.’ Everyone seems to know about it, except the police. Perhaps that is what is occurring here: everyone seems to know about it except the police. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1151989"></A>
I am in two minds about this legislation. I believe that the government made prostitution legal and, therefore, there is an onus on the government to make sure that those who do participate are protected in every possible form. However, I hate the fact that we have to address issues like this. I do not believe that the bill will do what the minister hopes it will do, but I can only hope and pray that it does. </Hansard-Body>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (8.49 pm): The CMC has suggested that about 90 per cent of prostitution in Queensland takes place outside legal brothels. Today we have a bill that looks like it is going to make this activity more likely to occur outside licensed brothels, and that is on top of the existing 90 per cent. The CMC has further stated that ‘laws are only effective at protecting workers in licensed brothels’. It might seem that we are regulating an ever diminishing number of prostitutes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157406"></A>
Is this bill really part of the solution or is it part of the problem? I think the latter might be true. This is a very serious concern. The government has a duty to protect sex workers. Far from the daily spin of protecting workers’ rights and this perception of looking after workers, when it comes to the sex industry the reality is that Bligh Labor is failing the workers--in fact, 90 per cent of the workers in this industry, and that number might increase with this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157407"></A>
I, too, acknowledge that the intention of this bill is ostensibly to regulate the manner in which social escort services advertise for business. Sex workers obviously are dealing with the very basic needs of a variety of those in our communities. It is all very well to turn a blind eye to their needs but, as in the past, this has not helped to either solve the problem of uncontrolled sexual activity with no regard to health issues or solve the social problems associated with prostitution--those being crime, drug use and, sadly, trafficking in women for sex slavery. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1157408"></A>
It is no secret that brothel owners are stating that the new laws will lead to a massive increase in illegal prostitution. Lyn Black, operator of Cleo’s on Nile at the Gabba, as reported in the Queensland <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
, says that not only are illegal prostitution rings already rampant in Queensland but, if this bill is passed as proposed by the government without opposition amendments, it is going to make it even more difficult for police to identify who is operating legally and who is not. This framing was confirmed by the University of Queensland’s Human Trafficking Working Group, led by Associate Professor Dr Andreas Schloenhardt. Whilst this group confirmed that 25 brothels were ‘highly and well controlled’, this represents only 10 per cent of the industry. Critically, the issue relating to the other 90 per cent was that, effectively, there are far too many unlicensed sole operators. This new bill has no plans to license these groups. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157415"></A>
The minister in his second reading speech has said that this bill will increase the safety of sole operators. Regarding these claims about increasing the safety of sole operators, who says so? The problem is that these people are rarely sole operators. Case after case, including Lyn Black’s case, has stated that these groups are just pooled sole operators performing as illegal brothel groups. These groups avoid a $30,000 a year licensing fee, have no checks and, dangerously, are more likely not to practise safe sex. Evidence confirming this is based on recent arrests, with single pimps being found to have multiple phone numbers advertising sex services for differing sex workers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157416"></A>
The real tragedy of this new bill is that it does not build on the original Prostitution Act of December 1999. This bill allowed boutique brothels with up to five rooms, and the hope was to break the links between prostitution and organised crime. The laws had been largely effective initially, and the last 10 years have shown that they were operating very safely for the small slice of prostitution that actually takes place in legal brothels--that is, the 10 per cent that is regulated. The rest, as I say, is unregulated. It is no holds barred out there, and no-one really knows what is going on. That was highlighted earlier. The researchers highlighted that illegal street prostitution is continuing and that the escort business is flourishing. Little else is known about this growing problem. There are plenty of assumptions being made here due to a lack of statistically significant data on this illegal activity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157417"></A>
The hope of this incompetent government, that we are not moving back to a clandestine era of prostitution in Queensland before legalised brothels, is wrong. The evidence seems to suggest that we are indeed moving that way and quickly. The Bligh Labor government’s mantra reverts to the policy of ‘what I can’t see won’t hurt me’, yet it claims the high moral ground and outrageously claims that it is a reformist government. This bill is nothing of the sort. It entrenches much of the tragedy affecting women caught in the illegal sex trade. </Hansard-Body>

For those who are uninformed, this is an industry largely of tawdriness and misery that trawls new depths of human suffering. Women are forced to sell their bodies for small returns, often with the payment being converted into quick cash for drug habits to criminal gangs and increasingly in payment to criminal sex slave traffickers--human bondage for the purists amongst members. That is sexual slavery of migrants and illegals--mainly passport overstayers--with trafficked victims being forced into prostitution against their will and in many cases without their knowledge until their first service encounter, as they are misled under the pretence of other means of work. They are told that they will be waitresses, in the main. Their relatives in their home country are often threatened if the sex slave refuses to submit and comply. Very few weeks go by when some random offender is not being prosecuted for having been found to have tested our human trafficking laws so as to provide cheap sex workers in illegal brothels or pooled illegal sole operator groups. </Hansard-Body>

Sure, there are many stories about anonymous university students who put themselves through their studies on the proceeds of prostitution and go on to worthwhile careers and find a considerate mate who understands. Also, there are unskilled housewives from the suburbs just doing daylight school-hour shifts to pay for school fees and children’s costs. To those who just choose the money and lifestyle, the reality seems to be somewhat different. The researchers from the university suggest that ‘sex workers generally do not want to commit themselves to several years working in the industry’. They do not want to become victims at all. And for those migrant sex workers with a large bond owed--and I carefully use those words--this leaves those migrants in a terribly compromised position. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157421"></A>
UNESCO for Asia Pacific has stated that the Asia-Pacific region is the most vulnerable for trafficking because of its huge population pyramid as well as growing urbanisation. The University of Queensland study found a number of human trafficking cells in Victoria and New South Wales. It further found in regard to Queensland that ‘perhaps we have not found them yet, but again it is an area that the legislation currently leaves completely unaddressed’. The longer we turn a blind eye to these issues the longer we tolerate a large clandestine industry and the more vulnerable we make some people to human trafficking. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157422"></A>
The bill, as has been explained, falls into three clear parts: firstly, the amendments to the Prostitution Act 1999 on the basis of the October 2006 CMC recommendations, which I have here; secondly, the amendment to the Criminal Code to insert a new provision of carrying on a business of providing unlawful prostitution; and, thirdly, the amendment to the Child Employment Act 2006 which prohibits the employment of a child as a social escort. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157423"></A>
To examine the bill and those components more completely, the CMC report has sat there for three years whilst most prostitution went back to the streets. Furthermore, the bill has sat for 12 months whilst Labor tried to contemplate navel gazing at new levels. The chairperson of the CMC, in his foreword comments to the report, clearly outlined that the aim of the report was to understand the legal prostitution industry and how to impede the illegal industry with appropriate laws. In his summary at that time he stated that the illegal industry was ‘relatively small’ in Queensland ‘compared with other states’ and that ‘large-scale organised crime’ was virtually non-existent in the Queensland prostitution industry--legal or illegal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157424"></A>
Well, how things change and how quickly it occurs when your eye is off the ball. The CMC chair thought that the current news was good and urged gentle future caution. The evidence of the growing escort sole operators information was there. The CMC thought that legalising outcall services, on the basis of evidence from either licensed brothels or escort services, was not warranted at that time. The CMC felt that it would not minimise the size of the illegal industry nor improve the health and safety of sex workers. This was in the face of compelling evidence then and now from the other mainland states stating this to be false. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157425"></A>
The CMC has recommended against legalising outcalls. But it did recommend a multiprolonged approach to attack legal prostitution in the following four key areas: regulating social escort providers; tightening the existing advertising policy of the PLA, the Prostitution Licensing Authority; improving police enforcement measures; and improving the safety of sole operators. Do honourable members know what this bill does? It goes very close to legalising pimping and makes licensed brothels less commercially competitive, and that is a worry for us all. That was not what the CMC recommended. But the minister, in his second reading speech, highlighted the need for licensed brothels to be competitive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157427"></A>
This bill in its current state, without opposition amendments, is taking us backwards. It reinforces the role of illegal prostitution and deems all the changes of the PLA, the Prostitution Licensing Authority, irrelevant because the legal brothels are absolutely certain to be a minority grouping. The amendments suggested both by the shadow minister, the member for Gregory, and the Liberal National Party platform policy seek to ensure a much greater quantum fine of $100,000 as opposed to the miserable $2,000 for illegal operators. Furthermore, the sensible proposal to recognise the proper role of local councils, giving local councils a right of determination in approvals for brothels, achieves this aim. Do members opposite really want to turn back to the days of the red-light districts in all of our suburban streets, with taxis and all sorts of strange people turning up at home at all times of the day and night? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162795"></A>
Members need to understand the consequences of their actions here. Illegal operators once given the green light will reorganise their groups and go back to proven methods of trade. Very soon the organised criminals will be back in serious business. For those ignorant members, these organised criminal groups are involved now but they want a bigger slice of the action. No member responsibly representing their community wants any of this to occur, and I do not want it either. Do not bury your head in the sand when thinking about prostitution. We will never stop it and maybe we should not try. The critical point is to largely accept that pimps are running more than one prostitute and they have multiple phone numbers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162798"></A>
The bulk of the CMC recommendations should be embraced. Recommendations 1 and 2 said that outcall prostitution services from licensed brothels and independent escort agencies should not be legalised. This bill proposes to allow a licensed security guard to accompany an escort. I see this as allowing a pimp, after doing a once-a-week security licence, carte blanche to operate an illegal prostitution ring. To those who say we will never remove pimps because prostitutes need protection, I say that is nonsense. The rules contained in this bill regarding how these pimps will be licensed, as security guards, is dubious but has to be trialled. Does anyone think the bikies missed this change? These bikies own and operate plenty of licensed security businesses and they have form in prostitution too. I put it to honourable members that we will never protect sex workers and ourselves from organised crime taking advantage of them until we stamp out the activities of pimps. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1162800"></A>
Those who watched last year’s ABC documentary on Terry Clark, the New Zealander who crossed the Tasman and led the infamous Mr Asia syndicate and destroyed much of our police force and our young people’s lives with heroin, would know that Terry Clark graduated from truancy to petty crime then pimping. He was still pimping at the height of his drug trading, importing and murderous activities. It was the fundamental basis of his money-laundering activities. There are similar examples of this in our part of the world currently and they have not been named. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162801"></A>
What sort of message should we have from this part of the bill? The message should be that we are not going there and the reason is that we have all learned from what did not work before. This bill can take us there faster than ever before if our amendments are not adopted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162802"></A>
The second aim of the bill is the amendment to the Criminal Code with the new provision of carrying on the business of providing unlawful prostitution. This probably represents in part a follow-on of recommendations 19 to 25 in the original CMC report. Clearly, as I have indicated, the fine for this offence is appallingly low. It really is $2,000. This was clearly demonstrated as that was all that was awarded as a fine in the most recent case on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast. The member for Buderim spoke about this in the House. It was a joke. The increase in fine to $100,000 as proposed by us would have teeth. It is the critical opposition amendment.</Hansard-Body>

There was a very compelling article by Sheila Jeffreys on sexual financial bondage--for want of a better word--published in <Hansard-Italic>
Arena</Hansard-Italic>
 magazine in 2002. She stated that over 10 years ago in Sydney at any given time up to 500 trafficked women were working illegally in Sydney on false papers. They are being kept in servile conditions. They are extremely vulnerable and there is no situation to control their conditions at work. They often do not even know what country they are in and often they are told they are going to work as a waitress. As expected, in the early years the majority of these trafficked women in southern states were excluded from legalised prostitution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162806"></A>
There are examples of what occurred in London and Amsterdam in the early 1990s. Trafficked women came to dominate illegal prostitution because they were cheap, powerless and replaceable. That is what is going to happen here in Queensland. We are not so different from those other places. Some 90 per cent of prostitution here is illegal and we are much closer to the huge population of Asia. For example, on the Gold Coast we have 10 million tourists a year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162807"></A>
Most commentators state that in Western countries, the trafficking of women into prostitution and the prostitution industry generally cannot be reasonably separated. There are two opposing examples with regard to illegal street prostitution. They are to be seen in Holland where only EU holders from 2001 could work in brothels. There were not enough workers for the legalised brothels but street prostitution massively increased using largely trafficked women and these were under the control of vicious pimps. Sweden in 1999 penalised the buying of all sexual services as part of a comprehensive legislative approach to combat all forms of violence against women. Traffickers have diminished under that law. </Hansard-Body>

Ms Jeffreys’ final paragraph on the people in Sydney says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162810"></A>
... as states consider reforming their prostitution legislation in the light of problems such as the burgeoning illegal escort into the legalised system, they need to work out how trafficking can be best combated.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162811"></A>
Here we have weak laws being implemented that will only take us along the above path. Interestingly, the current bill was developed in the light of the following principles: ensuring quality of life for local communities; safeguarding against corruption and organised crime; addressing social factors which contribute to involvement in the sex industry; ensuring a healthy society; and promoting safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162812"></A>
It would seem this bill fails pretty much on all the principles on which it is built. Firstly, local communities are going to see greater street prostitution than ever before. Secondly, organised crime will flourish in an environment where there is no regulation or any corporate knowledge of what is going on. I have emphasised that throughout my speech. We need to know what is going on. Thirdly, without stronger laws against sex slavery, sex slave trafficking will rise, drug use and abuse will continue unabated and marginalised women will continue to be victims of male owned syndicates. Fourthly, illegal prostitution increases unsafe sex on the basis of evidence. Finally, how can unregulated street sole prostitution be safe? Who knows what will happen next? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162813"></A>
The CMC report was supposed to be a blueprint of where to head next. It would seem the minister took a good look at the abyss and decided to give his luck a go and jump. In some ways he has done the right thing. Perhaps the CMC is unable to manage this issue either. Do we need a new permanent review structure that has some ability to inform the public about the reality of what is going on out there in the sex world? Unfortunately, the end result of the present plan is to leave the licensed brothels to a safe but expensive future where their every move is watched. The sole operators will just flourish and be a far greater problem than we will have even experienced before. The money will move to illegal activity and the work of our police forces will be massively increased. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162814"></A>
Organised criminals require captive markets for their captives. Unregulated prostitution entirely suits their operations. Combined with loan sharking, illegal gaming, drug trading and stolen property, this is the basis of a solid criminal funding structure. Why are we allowing these key areas to make a return when real progress had been made to reduce crime and legitimise the sex industry? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162815"></A>
For those who want to believe the dream that the sex industry is just a cottage industry, I say that they are fooling themselves and ignoring reality. I put it to some of them on the government benches: would they want their son or daughter or sister caught in this dreadful cycle of degradation, victimisation and criminality? I have been involved in corrective services for 20 years and I can assure you many do. For many of those the only way out is death. Sadly, their death rate due to suicide, drug overdose and ill health is disproportionately high. There should be no role for pimps and spivs. Organised criminals should be looking for softer targets. The bill needs to be significantly amended to make it focused on making a sex worker’s life a better one. That said, it might work. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs MILLER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bundamba--ALP) (9.07 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Bill. This bill continues the reform of prostitution laws in this state. In 2006 the CMC reviewed prostitution laws in Queensland. The review was called regulating outcall prostitution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162818"></A>
This bill has several aims including creating disincentives for those people who engage in unlawful prostitution. It also in part regulates the social escort industry. I am pleased that the bill will restrict the manner in which social escort businesses advertise their services. As other members have said tonight, we see ads for escort services in our local papers on a weekly basis. So I am pleased that the size and the content of these ads will be limited. They will also be required to inform readers that sexual services are not provided. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162821"></A>
I am pleased that new section 8B will be inserted in the Child Employment Act. This new section will provide that an employer must not require nor permit a child to work as a social escort. Young people are under enough pressure these days without this type of lunacy where young people can be social companions to adults. I believe it is ridiculous. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162822"></A>
The legislation will also amend the Criminal Code to create an offence for a person--that is, the client--who obtains prostitution services from a person who is a minor--that is, not of adult age. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for seven years. If the person providing prostitution services is under 16 years of age the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168184"></A>
We live in a society where prostitution exists however much we might not like it. But I am a realist. I know that prostitution does exist in my electorate, and it certainly exists in the suburbs. Working prostitutes come to see me in my electorate office, and one visited my electorate office only a couple of weeks ago. She had just come back to Australia. She was jailed overseas for several months and she was glad to come back home because at least she knew that she had some protection under the prostitution laws in Queensland. However, we need to protect minors and we need to make sure that sole operators operate in a safe manner. I know that a lot of prostitutes have problems with drug addiction and other issues such as mental health, but I fervently believe that if they choose to work as prostitutes they are entitled to a safe workplace just like any other worker.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168188"></A>
Over the years our government and the CMC have faced the issue of prostitution in a realistic manner. The CMC made 23 recommendations, and this bill implements 16 of those recommendations in these amendments to the Prostitution Act, the Queensland Criminal Code and the Child Employment Act. No matter what particular views each of us in here have about prostitution, we have to face the fact that prostitution is in our society as it has been since time immemorial and that we need laws regulating prostitution. I implore MPs in this parliament to not judge men and women who work as prostitutes. We should be helping them as much as possible, even if they want to get out of the industry. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

I was on the backbench committee with the former police minister and it amazes me that some people who live in this world tend to think that they should hide everything under a rock.

 I take that interjection; I could have always put my fingers in my ears. This bill is designed to not only protect sole operators but also target illegal brothels. We have heard about the sex slave industry and how people are locked up. It might surprise some members that, during the review of outcall prostitution, a number of members visited a legal brothel and spoke to some of the workers. They were not tawdry. Some of them were university students. One was a young mother who worked when her children were at school. They had no worries about what they were doing because that was their choice. We have just heard from the member for Bundamba that, as much as we may all have our own points of view about how people should act in this world, it ill- behoves us to try to impose our religious and personal beliefs on others.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168197"></A>
These amendments to the act are aimed at activity at unidentifiable places or premises. Legal brothels are an identifiable place or premises, but there are illegal providers masquerading as escort agencies. They provide outcall prostitution services, but they do not have an identifiable place or premises being used by two or more prostitutes. They sometimes have an office and a call centre, but they do not provide those services on the premises. The amendments to the Criminal Code will introduce a new ‘carrying on business’ offence which will allow the police to gather evidence over a period of time and to lay a single charge to target an individual or individuals carrying on large illegal operations such as indicated by the member for Gaven. He does not support this bill, but it is designed to stamp out what he is complaining about. It defies description.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168199"></A>
The other amendments to the act also ensure that escort services comply with the same advertising restrictions as legal prostitution providers. They will be limited in size and content for their advertisements. We heard from the member for Nanango about some of those advertisements, and I must admit that there are some quite novel advertisements. I believe that the requirement to advise people who use social escort services that sexual services are not included will go a long way to making sure that people do not masquerade under that heading.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168201"></A>
The other amendments will amend the Criminal Code to allow the employment of a driver and to allow a person to take an advisory message. The good part about that is that at the present time a person, although they are appropriately licensed, can only be employed as a bodyguard. They cannot drive the operator to any outcalls and they cannot take any messages. The other amendment provided in the bill relates to the Child Employment Act. There can be no doubt that it is important to keep children and young people out of the industry and to impose penalties for those people who try to include them in the industry. All in all, 16 of the the 23 recommendations made by the CMC are dealt with under this bill. This bill will go a long way to addressing those concerns, and I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Ms DAVIS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Aspley--LNP) (9.16 pm): I rise to add my contribution to the Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Bill debate, the bill being introduced by the minister on 18 August 2009. The objectives of the legislation is to amend the current Prostitution Act to create a framework to regulate the manner in which social escort services can advertise for business and to amend the Criminal Code to create new offences for illegal prostitution. The amendments come as a result of a 2006 CMC report which offered 23 recommendations and which the explanatory notes place these recommendations into four general categories.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168208"></A>
The first comments I have are with regard to regulating social escort providers. According to the bill, a social escort is defined as a person who, under an arrangement of a commercial character, is held out to the public for hire to accompany another person to social affairs, places of entertainment or amusement, or consort with the person in any place, whether public or private. I think it is fair to say that the broader community believes that individuals who advertise as social escorts do offer sexual services to their clients. However, for those who are genuine social escorts they will now be legally required to state on their advertisements that the services are nonsexual or that sexual services are not provided. I am pleased to note and support the amendment to the Child Employment Act to prohibit the employment of children as social escorts. There are absolutely no circumstances where it would be appropriate that a child be involved in this industry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168210"></A>
The bill imposes regulations on the size of advertisements in Queensland and also places advertising restrictions on any publication that has a circulation in Queensland. I understand this would include internet advertising generated outside of Queensland but aimed at the local market. Whilst the regulations for advertising for social escorts is a welcome part of this legislation, I note that there have been startling reports into the unregulated operation of the sex worker industry more generally. In its 2004 report the Crime and Misconduct Commission found that an alarming 75 per cent of all sexual services were provided by outcall or escort services, the majority of whom were acting illegally. It was further reported recently by the University of Queensland’s Human Trafficking Working Group led by Professor Andreas Schloenhardt that after 10 years of brothel licensing in Queensland most of the state’s prostitution industry remains unregulated or illegal.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168250"></A>
Dr Schloenhardt said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1168254"></A>
Current legislation is very restricted and limited to the operation of legal brothels and to services offered by sole operators outside public spaces. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1168255"></A>
This accounts for only 10 percent of Queensland’s prostitution industry and does not include escort agencies (outcall prostitution offered by brothels or other agencies), street prostitution, and the operation of unlicensed brothels including the sharing of premises by more than one sex worker. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1168256"></A>
These activities, some 90 percent of the prostitution industry, remain either unregulated or illegal. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1168257"></A>
There are concerns within the community about the efficiency of the current licensing system, unregulated and illegal forms of prostitution, the trafficking in persons for sexual exploitation into legal and illegal brothels, as well as the possibility of regulating escort services. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168258"></A>
These are legitimate concerns, and I find the notion that 90 per cent of the prostitution industry remains unregulated or illegal to be very concerning indeed. That is a truly remarkable figure and raises the concern that this legislation does not provide any health and safety protection to a huge proportion of workers within the industry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168259"></A>
The prostitution industry exposes sex workers and their clients to a high-risk environment in which sexually transmitted infections can be transferred. While the Prostitution Act and prostitution regulations provide limited safeguards for sex workers in regulated brothels, they fail to specify measures to protect independent prostitutes, let alone illegal operatives. The combination, as I have outlined, accounts for about 90 per cent of the prostitution industry. An article last year in the <Hansard-Italic>
Brisbane Times</Hansard-Italic>
 noted--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1168261"></A>
Most sex workers in illegal operations face threats to their safety and do not have the checks essential for their sexual health. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168262"></A>
At a time when chlamydia rates have increased by 18 per cent on 2007 levels, gonorrhoea rates have increased by 19 per cent on 2007 levels and syphilis rates have increased by 15 per cent on 2006 levels, we cannot afford to be complacent about the health of any sector of Queensland’s society. I have mentioned these STI notifications because in the minister’s second reading speech he stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1168264"></A>
This bill continues to support the five guiding principles regulating prostitution in Queensland: ensuring quality of life for communities, safeguarding against corruption and organised crime, addressing the social factors that contribute to involvement in the sex industry, ensuring a healthy society and promoting safety. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168265"></A>
I think there is a long way to go before we can say that we have accomplished these goals, particularly the goal that ensures we have a safe and healthy society in light of the current STI notifications. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168266"></A>
The second comment I wish to make is in regard to amending the Criminal Code to create a new offence with respect to a person who knowingly carries on a business that provides prostitution by two or more prostitutes, in particular giving a certificate of discharge for the provision of evidence against a person carrying on an illegal prostitution enterprise. Equally as important as creating deterrents for illegal operators is the need to ensure the safety of witnesses to illegal prostitution activities. Their evidence can play a vital role in stopping illegal prostitution enterprises and is crucial to bringing the perpetrators of these crimes to justice. Witnesses need to feel confident that the law will provide them with the security to give evidence openly and honestly without fear. The proposed amendments to the Criminal Code will assist that process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168267"></A>
It is a sad reality that, among other violations of the law, social research reveals instances of women and children being held in sexual servitude in Australian cities. Project Respect suggests that approximately 1,000 trafficked women reside in Australia at any one time. Project Respect also estimates that approximately 300 women are trafficked in Australia each year, although federal government figures suggest a number well below 100 per year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168269"></A>
The presence of child slavery in Australia was highlighted in an article from the <Hansard-Italic>
Age</Hansard-Italic>
 in May 2006. The article reported the story of a Thai child trafficked to Australia and forced to work as a prostitute in a Sydney brothel at the age of 13. Fortunately, in this case the young girl regained her freedom at a later age with the assistance of immigration officials. However, an unknown number of women and children continue to be held in sexual servitude. This issue is a stain on our lawful democratic society, which values personal freedom as a fundamental human right. Any measures that seek to expose the abhorrent crime of sex trafficking and to prosecute offenders to the full extent of the law are to be supported. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168270"></A>
I am very concerned that there is little financial deterrent to illegal brothel operators. Currently, legal brothels pay in excess of $30,000 in government compliance fees and charges. My concern is not with the charges imposed on legal brothel operators but the pittance that operators are fined for running illegal brothels. The recent case on the Sunshine Coast, where an illegal operator was fined a measly $2,000, is just outrageous. The proposed monetary penalties for illegal activity do not provide a sufficient deterrent to law-breakers, and I support the shadow minister’s proposed amendment where a court imposes a monetary penalty of which the minimum penalty imposed would be 1,000 penalty units. Of course, the court would not be prohibited from using other penalties as defined within the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168272"></A>
I wish to also add my support to the amendment proposed by the shadow minister with regard to giving local governments the final say in the development applications of brothels. This amendment was a commitment by the LNP in the lead-up to the 2009 election. As I understand it, under existing laws councils with a population under 25,000 residents are permitted to have a say in such applications. But for larger towns, this right is taken away. This amendment removes the provision that requires further agreement from the minister when local councils require all applications to be refused. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168273"></A>
As my contribution draws to a close, I would like to offer a personal reflection. That is, I find it incredibly sad that some individuals feel that they have no other option but to enter into prostitution. It is sad that many of these individuals are drawn into prostitution in order to maintain a lifestyle, to support addictions or just to make ends meet. To my mind, it is sad that individuals would expose themselves to the sexism, poverty and violence that are all intrinsically linked to the industry. Finally, as indicated by the shadow minister, the LNP will not oppose the bill but we do so with consideration to the amendments that he has proposed. </Hansard-Body>

Mr EMERSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Indooroopilly--LNP) (9.26 pm): The greatest challenge facing Brisbane in the decades ahead is preserving the liveability of our city in the face of growth. However, the Bligh government is placing at risk those things that make Brisbane such an attractive place to live, to raise families, to make a home and to work. That is because the Bligh government is intent on squeezing more and more people into Brisbane. The Bligh government has ordered that there be an extra 156,000 dwellings in Brisbane by 2031. Once again, we are seeing the Bligh government ignore and dismiss concerns about the impact of its plans on the Indooroopilly electorate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168281"></A>
In recent weeks I have received numerous concerns from the local community about the Bligh government’s plan to build 17 one-bedroom public housing units on a block on Oxley Road at Sherwood. There are genuine concerns that there are too many units for the size of the block. There are also concerns that the entry to and exit from the site is obscured and risks creating a traffic hazard and worsening delays and congestion on busy Oxley Road.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168282"></A>
The 17-unit proposal for the site at 575 Oxley Road would not be allowed under the current Brisbane City Council planning rules or under the proposed changes to the neighbourhood plan being considered. In fact, a private developer attempted to gain approval for 10 units on the site last year but was knocked back because the development was deemed to be excessive. However, the state government does not have to abide by local planning rules so it is able to build 17 units on the site. To add insult to injury, the Bligh government has provided only six parking spaces on the site for residents of the 17 units and any visitors. Although I appreciate that the Bligh government may not be legally required to do so, I believe such housing should meet local planning requirements.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168283"></A>
The provision of social housing is an important responsibility of state government. However, it is also important that such housing is built with consideration of the local residents and any genuine concerns. Although the Bligh government is demanding higher density developments, it has refused to guarantee that valuable green space that it already owns in the Indooroopilly electorate is preserved to offset that higher density.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1168286"></A>
The DPI facility at the Alan Fletcher Research Station at Magazine Street, which is also in Sherwood, is earmarked to move to the new bioscience precinct at Dutton Park next year. This provides a tremendous opportunity to preserve this six-hectare site at Sherwood as green space. The Bligh government has remained silent on its plans for the use of that site, just as it did with the Oxley Road site until it was too late. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.30 pm): As honourable members would know, I take every opportunity I get to talk about the great features of my electorate. It is one of the best places--I correct myself, it is the best place--to live, to work and to raise a family. My electorate is close to some of the most spectacular environmental assets in South-East Queensland. We are close to Moreton Bay and have the benefit of parks, green space and wildlife. People in the Redlands want to look after their environment and this government is lending a helping hand. We recently announced that the Redlands is set to become a state leader in energy conservation and sustainable living. The government has partnered with Energex and the Redland City Council to sign up the Redlands region as the state’s second energy conservation community. This means residents will have an opportunity to transform their homes with innovative energy conservation technology. It is free to enrol. Participating residents should be able to reduce their power consumption and it will help the community by taking some pressure off the grid.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1174053"></A>
This announcement was made ahead of a one-day community cabinet where I was pleased to welcome the Premier and other cabinet ministers to my electorate. The Queensland Labor government was the first to take the whole cabinet, including the Premier, ministers and parliamentary secretaries, to the people. We have conducted more than 120 community cabinets throughout the state and the concept of community cabinet has been duplicated by many other governments in the country. </Hansard-Body>

During the day the Premier helped issue the one millionth TransLink go card at Raby Bay harbour. To mark this milestone for go card, free cards were given away loaded with $10 travel credit. The free cards aim to encourage more people to get on board and give public transport a go. Go card use has skyrocketed since the cards were first rolled out in June 2008. There were 23.6 million go card trips between January and March 2010, which is more than double the trips for the same quarter last year.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1174055"></A>
I also welcomed an announcement by Minister Neil Roberts that seven new and replacement ambulance vehicles valued at more than $1.2 million have hit the streets of the Redland City area. This demonstrates the government’s commitment to emergency services in my area. I also had a chance to once again visit the hardworking staff at Capalaba station with Minister Roberts. It was good to see the Mercedes 318 acute ambulance vehicle, the newest in the area. It will go a long way towards creating a modern and reliable fleet, essential when responding to emergencies. </Hansard-Body>

Just down the road from the ambulance station at St Luke’s Catholic Parish Child Care Centre I was joined by the Minister for Education, Geoff Wilson. The minister acknowledged St Luke’s Catholic Parish Child Care Centre’s participation in the 2010 kindergarten pilot program. The pilot program is a first of its kind in Queensland where long day care services receive funding from the Queensland government to assist them to deliver an approved kindergarten program. </Hansard-Body>

I am sure that the member for Toowoomba South, who is sitting here in the chamber, would agree that it really is something that is needed. People do realise it is necessary. The majority of the second range crossing is in my electorate of Lockyer and the rest of it goes up into the electorate of the member for Toowoomba South. </Hansard-Body>

 Thank you very much for your protection, Mr Speaker. He is being a bit unruly over there. I agree that some of those industries are required, but let us use a bit of common sense.

I also want to raise the issue of Greenbank State School. It is one of the biggest schools in my area. It has well over a thousand students. It will get a BER facility. The parking around the Greenbank State School is very limited and with this new facility it will be more limited. It will be a traffic hazard. I have spoken to the member for Logan in the neighbouring electorate. He agrees with me that we have to do something about getting the land off the Army that has been promised to support the Greenbank State School. The parking facilities around that school are atrocious. It is in the process of occurring but it needs to be speeded up. I encourage the department to speed up the process of acquiring this land to assist the smooth transition of this facility into the Greenbank State School. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MOORHEAD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Waterford--ALP) (9.34 pm): Beenleigh has a bright future under the Gillard Labor government with the exciting announcement from Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan and federal member for Forde, Brett Raguse, of $1 million in funding for the construction of a cultural heritage centre at Old Beenleigh Town. Beenleigh is perfectly located to bring tourism dollars to Logan--halfway between Brisbane and the Gold Coast, right on the Pacific Motorway and the gateway to the Scenic Rim and its beautiful environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1174070"></A>
This project has been an aspiration of the Beenleigh Historical Village, the Yugambeh Museum and the Beenleigh Chamber of Commerce for some time. I know that these groups will be grateful for this project under a re-elected Gillard government. This centre will bring together in one place Old Beenleigh Town, capturing the history of pioneering Beenleigh; Yugambeh Museum, Language and Heritage Research Centre, presenting our proud Indigenous heritage; and the Visitor Information Centre, promoting Beenleigh and surrounds and providing tourist information.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1174071"></A>
This project will bring jobs and investment to Beenleigh. These jobs are not just in construction and operation but promoting local jobs through getting people off the motorway and spending their hard-earned dollars in Beenleigh. The Queensland government started this snowball rolling with more than $300,000 in funding for the Beenleigh community identity project in 2008, delivering a locally controlled Visitor Information Centre, a regional marketing website for Beenleigh, and marketing and signage for Old Beenleigh Town. Brett Raguse and the Gillard government have really taken this project to the next level with this fantastic commitment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1174072"></A>
The contrast with the Abbott LNP opposition is clear. Not only will we not get a cultural heritage centre but we will lose trade training centres and the Meadowbrook GP superclinic. Last week I spoke with teachers at Trinity College in Beenleigh and they were deeply concerned about losing a trade training centre, given how much planning and expense has gone into their proposal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1174073"></A>
On Friday, 30 July, I also had the great pleasure of joining my colleagues Brett Raguse and Margaret Keech in officially opening the Loganholme State School one teacher school museum at Old Beenleigh Town. Loganholme State School is very proud of its history. The school opened on 19 May 1873 and has delivered quality education for 137 years. The students of Loganholme State School are lucky to have included in their education an understanding of this proud history. This one teacher school museum has been part of the QUT education program for many years and with the help of Wendy Charter and Anker Laursen from the Beenleigh Town Committee and the Queensland University of Technology it has been relocated to the Beenleigh Historical Village. On the day we were joined by a class of students from Loganholme State School, some dressed as pioneers, school principal Sharyn Miller and much loved former principal Vic Graham, as well as local families including the Bahrs, the Clarks and the Fels, some of whom had many generations of students attend Loganholme State School. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr CRANDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Coomera--LNP) (9.38 pm): I am truly concerned about outcomes we sometimes achieve from the questions on notice system that is employed in this parliament. It appears that there is sometimes a lack of effort in the research area and even in the reading of questions. A good example was brought to the attention of this House recently with the case of two ministers responding to separate questions on notice advising the member for Lockyer that the question on notice should be asked of the other. Neither minister wanted to take responsibility. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179762"></A>
On 14 April this year I asked the Minister for Transport for information as to passenger numbers, both in the past and projected numbers into the future, for the Gold Coast rail line. In the response, tabled on 18 May, the minister advised me of the past passenger numbers and waxed lyrical about what the government has spent on the Gold Coast line over the past five years. I make this point because it is quite clear that this minister and this government think in the past. They are happy to talk about what happened and were happy to answer questions that were not even asked. I did not ask a question on expenditure; I asked a question about passenger numbers in the past and in the future, a simple question about projections. There was no answer. The question was a simple one. As I said, I asked for past numbers, which were given. The part of my question relating to the future that was not answered was: what are the projected commuter numbers expected on the line in one year’s time, three years time, five years time and 10 years time expressed in numbers and percentage terms for each year? Like I said, there was no answer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179766"></A>
I felt that perhaps the minister had overlooked that part of the question. So in question on notice 954 on 20 May this year, I asked the question again. I did not confuse matters by again asking the question about the past. The question I asked was: with reference to passenger numbers on the Gold Coast rail line, what are the projected commuter numbers expected on the line in one year’s time, three years time, five years time and 10 years time expressed in number and percentage terms for each year? The minister’s answer was, ‘I refer the member to previous question on notice 751, which was tabled in parliament on 18 May 2010.’ The answer went on to say that the government is currently finalising a new integrated regional transport plan for South-East Queensland and that the plan includes forward projections. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179767"></A>
A number of points come to mind. Firstly, obviously the researcher did not bring to the minister’s attention that she had not answered the question in question No. 751. I asked the question; the minister did not answer it. I asked it again; the minister referred me back to the original question but she did not answer the question in the first place. It is little bit like the case involving the member for Lockyer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179768"></A>
A number of other issues come to mind. The minister could have made comments about the integrated transport plan in question on notice 751 and saved this House a little bit of time. But let us not forget the point I made--the whole purpose of why I am speaking on this topic, because that point should not be lost. I asked a question that was ignored, although I was given information that was not asked for. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs KIERNAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Isa--ALP) (9.41 pm): Before speaking about the Mount Isa Regional 2010 Valuing Volunteers in Sport and Recreation Awards, I would like to take time to pay tribute to one of our greatest volunteers, Mr George Apps OAM, who passed away on 29 June. Mr Apps was an icon in our city and a greatly respected and admired favourite son. He was a selfless community worker who gave his all for the betterment of others. He was a long-time member of the chamber of commerce and Lions. He was the founder of LEAP, which today provides many people with mobility aids and equipment. He was a passionate advocate for prostate cancer and breast cancer. George is survived by his wife of 60 years, his Lady Doris, and children and grandchildren. He will be sadly missed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179776"></A>
National Volunteers Week is a fitting time to acknowledge the exceptional work of volunteers. Over 50 people attended the awards night held recently at the town’s leagues club. I received 14 nominations for people from all types of sport and recreation areas, showing the diversity of sport and recreation options available in the outback. I was truly humbled by the individual commitment and achievements of the nominees. They are all truly inspirational. They are Melanie See, Les McElligott, George Fortune, Ken Dickson, Gail Wipaki, David Scott, Carlie Remfrey, Dave Edgar, Jim Hagan, Susan Ceronia, Theresa Braithwaite, Merilyn Harding, Roy Pattinson and Ralph Farlow. They all deserve to be thanked and recognised for their efforts. Without their individual drive, many clubs would not exist. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179792"></A>
We had a great emcee on the night in Brian Atherinos, and our finalist from 2009, Fred Frost, joined us as well. The regional recipient of the 2010 Mount Isa Electorate Volunteers in Sport and Recreation Award was Theresa Braithwaite from the Copper City Tennis Club. Five years ago Theresa had a dream, the establishment of a regional tennis facility of excellence. The results of her efforts were realised in March this year when Mount Isa became the first city in Queensland to open its regional tennis facility. It is through Theresa’s drive and commitment that we now enjoy a world-class tennis facility. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179796"></A>
In my mind, Theresa and all the nominees are community treasures and heroes. All give of their time freely, without any thought of recognition. However, I wish to recognise their efforts tonight and thank them in this House. Our community is richer for their volunteering work. I am delighted that Theresa has been selected as a state finalist in these awards and she has the whole of the north-west behind her. </Hansard-Body>

Grace and Jessica’s Road Smart Day</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (9.44 pm): Last year my home town of Palmwoods was rocked by some incredibly tragic news. Twins Grace and Jessica Hornby, then aged five, and their grandmother, or ‘Mimi’ as they affectionately referred to her, Denise Mansell, were killed in a horrific road accident in Woombye on Friday, 8 May. It was a girls’ night out. The twins, dressed in matching fairy dresses, were returning from dinner in Nambour. It was a sleepover night at Mimi’s and they were looking forward to watching a movie and polishing fingernails. Devastatingly, as Mrs Mansell’s vehicle turned across Nambour Connection Road into Blackall Street, Woombye it was struck by another vehicle. Grace, Jessica, Mrs Mansell and the driver of the other vehicle died instantly. Only a passenger in the second vehicle survived.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179807"></A>
 Grace’s and Jessica’s parents, Michael and Kelly, continue to come to grips with their loss. Who would not? As a father of five recounting the details of that evening, I struggle to comprehend this senseless and unnecessary loss of life. But Michael and Kelly very quickly looked at the broader picture, too: through this tragedy there was an opportunity--an opportunity to remind the community at large of the importance of road safety, of road smartness. Last year on 12 September, Grace’s and Jessica’s birthday, the communities of Palmwoods and Woombye were bedecked in pink and purple, the twins’ favourite colours. The colourful display aimed to serve as a striking visual reminder to ‘take care and be aware’ when on the roads.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179809"></A>
This year Michael and Kelly Hornby have plans to take Grace and Jessica’s Road Smart Day across the state. I did not--and I do not--hesitate in supporting their cause. Earlier this year, I supported the Hornbys in their request to the Minister for Education to promote the Road Smart Day in all schools across the state. I would like to put on the record my thanks to the minister for his support of this initiative. I understand that, as I speak, the education department is promoting the initiative through its various electronic communication channels. I, too, encourage principals and P&amp;Cs to support Grace and Jessica’s Road Smart Day. As a tribute to the girls, show off your pink and purple and take a moment to remember all victims of road trauma. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179810"></A>
I am getting in early and displaying my pink and purple tribute this evening. I call on all members of this House to encourage their local schools as well. I have taken the liberty of distributing a copy of this flyer to each of you. I ask that each of you promotes the idea of a Road Smart Day in your electorates--a day when we remember to take care, be aware and save lives on our roads. I call on each member to reflect personally on the information contained in this flyer. Some of the suggestions I hope go without saying--slow down, show respect for others, drive sober--but others are temptations we all face. Leave your mobile phone alone. As Michael Hornby said to me just the other day, before you consider reaching for that phone, think of your kids, think of my kids, leave it alone and keep safe on the road. </Hansard-Body>

Ms O’NEILL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kallangur--ALP) (9.47 pm): ‘Positively Ageless’. What a great title for a great Bligh government strategy. It resonates with the community, not only because the strategy is a good one with a good title but because it has been written in clear, easy-to-understand language that treats seniors with respect that makes sure it is very well received, and nowhere more than in the fine electorate of Kallangur. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179815"></A>
On 22 June 2010, over 130 senior constituents attended an afternoon tea at the Kallangur Memorial Bowls Club to meet and converse with Minister Struthers about the principles of Positively Ageless: respecting and acknowledging seniors’ valuable place in the community; recognising the past and present contributions and acknowledging the experience and wisdom of seniors; ensuring seniors retain their dignity and their rights are upheld as they move through the different stages of ageing; ensuring seniors feel safe in their homes and in the community; supporting seniors’ independence and lifestyle choices; recognising the diversity among seniors including age, ability, cultural and linguistic background, and sexuality; ensuring all seniors have access to appropriate services; and creating age-friendly communities. Just as importantly, this strategy recognises the diversity and contribution that seniors have made and provides support for those in need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179817"></A>
The Bligh government is committed to ensuring that Queenslanders are assisted with meeting the cost of living by providing $1.13 billion in concessions for discounts, rebates and subsidies, for example electricity rebates, electricity life support concessions, pensioner rate subsidies, rail concessions and the South East Queensland Pensioner Water Subsidy Scheme. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179861"></A>
The open nature of the meeting and the informal presentation meant that people were very comfortable raising a wide range of issues and concerns about the cost of living and the welcome impact of the subsidies, the management of acute and chronic pain and the need for access to pain clinics, frank discussions about the sometimes undignified ailments that come with ageing, getting employment to supplement pensions, dignified and affordable housing, and, sadly, the ugly side of becoming vulnerable through ageing, which is elder abuse, isolation, loss of independence. It was heart warming to hear people sharing experiences and frailties, as well as great ideas to enhance retirement, and particularly their appreciation of having the opportunity to meet and talk with the minister. Overwhelmingly, people asked for more informal sessions, more access to ministers and more information. It also provided a great opportunity for my constituents to raise other matters directly with me. My fabulous office staff were busy for days making sure that all the information requested was passed on. My thanks to Minister Struthers and her staff for coming out to Kallangur, and to my staff for making sure the afternoon was well catered for, both in a culinary sense and organisationally. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind) (9.49 pm): Can members guess what will happen in just over a fortnight, on 21 August 2010? We will have another federal election! I note that our state Treasurer and the Minister for Infrastructure are in the chamber at the moment. I use this opportunity to call on all members to help me help Sunshine Coast residents to lobby the Prime Minister and the federal Leader of the Opposition to contribute more money to help our state government construct the Landsborough to Nambour railway line duplication and upgrade. Everyone knows that the state government cannot fund this important project by itself. We need federal funds to assist us. Look at what happened with the Redcliffe railway line. The federal government put money on the table, the state government matched it and the council came on board. I use this chance to urge all members to help me lobby the federal government and the federal opposition to put real money on the table so that our state government and the Sunshine Coast Regional Council can join in a partnership that will see this important national railway line funded. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WELLINGTON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 We have Liberal National Party members here. Who knows what can happen. It is only just under a fortnight away. On that note, toilet facilities must be provided on this important railway service. It is disgraceful that elderly people are required to keep their feet closed and wait until they get to Caboolture before they can use the toilet facilities. They get off the train at Caboolture to use the facilities, and may have to wait for the next train to take them on to Brisbane. We need proper facilities, such as those provided on the Gold Coast train line. It is high time that the federal government and the federal opposition realised the significance of the Sunshine Coast region and no longer took us for granted. </Hansard-Body>

Southern Corridor Health Facility</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179875"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr PITT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mulgrave--ALP) (9.51 pm): At the last election one of my top priorities was the future of health facilities for Far North Queensland and Labor put forward a two-pronged strategy: a $446.3 million redevelopment of the existing Cairns Base Hospital site and the acquisition of land for a health facility in the southern suburbs of Cairns. In March Queensland Health made a statement that short-listing for potential sites was well advanced, with confidential negotiations underway. Whether it is at business functions I attend or street stalls that I hold, people tell me they want an end to the delay. Residents are demanding certainty about the location of this future health facility. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179876"></A>
I am a vocal supporter of the Bruce Highway upgrade and the Cairns transit network projects, but I concede that aligning site selection with planning for those projects has perhaps contributed to the delay. I am sure that most people would agree that the location needs to be easily accessible to as many residents as possible. However, the announcement of the master plan for those projects has come and gone. Like many of my constituents, I am very keen for a decision on this issue. I know it will put many people’s minds at rest and provide some assurance that the southern suburbs are not being forgotten when it comes to the future health needs of our region. An announcement of a southern corridor health facility would be another major step towards the continued shaping of Edmonton as the new employment hub for the Cairns region.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179877"></A>
However, claims that a fully-fledged hospital is needed instead of the proposed health facility are premature. This year’s budget provided the next $80 million for the Cairns Base Hospital redevelopment, as well as $5.6 million to complete the $12.7 million Cairns Central Community Health Centre. All of this work will take pressure off the Cairns Base Hospital. We all recognise that the population in the southern suburbs will fill in over the next 20 years. The benefit of a greenfield site is that it will allow room for growth so that the facility can be expanded. The opportunity also exists for a private health facility to be constructed to complement the government’s plans. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179879"></A>
I have a great working relationship with the federal member for Leichhardt, Jim Turnour, and I want to commend the Australian government for its commitment to planning for the future health services in our region, including the investment of $5 million in the Edmonton GP super clinic, in partnership with Balance Healthcare. It concerns me greatly that Tony Abbott would cut GP super clinics and, in the process, take us backwards. The Edmonton clinic will provide more opportunity for people to access a doctor without the need to drive into the city and, while a mixed billing service will be offered, the vast majority of local residents will be able to access bulk billing. I am advised that construction is set to begin in September 2010, with the facility expected to be open by July 2011.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1179881"></A>
Southern corridor residents want certainty about their future health needs. Because of the growth we are experiencing, it is incumbent upon me and other elected representatives to keep up the momentum on project planning and delivery in the southern suburbs. I for one will continue to ask questions to see that this occurs and that we remain on track. </Hansard-Body>
