 In December last year a committee of this House, the Committee System Review Committee, handed down a report that recommended major changes to the parliament’s committee system. Those recommendations fell within the committee’s terms of reference and, like most members, I welcome and support the changes that are designed to reinvigorate our parliament’s committee system and thus enhance parliamentary oversight of legislation. The report also recommended major changes to the way this parliament is administered and managed. In my view, these recommendations fell outside the committee’s terms of reference. I ask honourable members to think about that.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998465"></A>
As Speaker, one of my roles is to speak on behalf of the parliament--that is, not only on behalf of this 53rd Parliament, of which you are members and I am Speaker, but also on behalf of the institution of parliament, which is one of the three arms of government within our democratic system of government. Today I want to speak briefly on the proposed changes arising from the committee’s recommendations that fall outside its terms of reference, that is, the recommendations that will fundamentally change the way this parliament is administered and managed. These recommendations have far-reaching consequences for the role of Speaker and the sovereignty of parliament. The Speaker is specifically excluded from the new management committee of the parliament. Instead, it is to be chaired by the Leader of Government Business in this House and will include the nominees of the Premier and Deputy Premier among its six members. In other words, in my view, it will be a committee controlled by the executive which does not have the Speaker on it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998476"></A>
I make the following points in regard to these recommendations. In my view, the committee should have sought a widening of its terms of reference to authorise its inquiries and legitimise its recommendations. However, it did not and because there was no widening of the terms of reference no-one was aware that the review committee was considering changes to the way the parliament is managed and administered. No-one had the slightest idea that these recommendations were on the cards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998489"></A>
On 20 August last year I appeared before the review committee to speak to a submission I had made to the committee. In my submission I did not canvass matters relating to the management and administration of the parliament. Why would I? They were not included in the committee’s terms of reference. Did the committee raise these recommendations with me on that occasion? No, it did not. Did it do so on any other occasion? Again, no. I have been criticised for showing discourtesy to the committee by speaking out against its recommendations in December last year--recommendations, mind you, that in my view did not fall within the committee’s terms of reference. However, what courtesy was shown to me or, more importantly, to the office I hold? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998500"></A>
Secondly, what reasons have been given? There was certainly nothing substantial in the report. For the past four years a Speaker’s Advisory Committee, with representatives from both sides of the House and the Independents, has met, but none of the matters of criticism have been raised as complaints. Thirdly, the hallmark of the review committee’s offending recommendations, shortly to be translated into legislation presented to this House, has been the complete lack of consultation surrounding them. Members may have gained the impression that I had been consulted on the changes. I advise honourable members that that is not the case. I was told what the changes would be. They were presented to me as a fait accompli. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998509"></A>
However, of greater concern to me is that no-one else was consulted about these very significant and substantial changes to the way the parliament is administered and the role of the Speaker in that regard. This is the people’s House. We talk about it being everyone’s parliament, but the people whom we are elected to represent in this place have been left in the dark every step of the way with regard to how their parliament is now to be managed by a committee that excludes the Speaker, is chaired by the Leader of Government Business and includes nominees of the Premier and Deputy Premier.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998520"></A>
In my initial response last year I described these particular recommendations as wrong in principle and dangerous in practice. I do not resile from that view and I state it again today. The transfer of management responsibility for this parliament to the new Committee of the Legislative Assembly, given its composition, in my view represents a serious violation of the separation of powers that underpins our democratic system of government. The decision ultimately for this House is whether it wants the Speaker or the Leader of Government Business to chair a committee to lead and administer the parliament. I believe very strongly that the best interests of the parliament are served by having an independent, impartial Speaker chairing the management committee of the parliament. In every other Westminster parliament--I stress, in every other Westminster parliament--including the examples cited in the committee’s report, the Speaker chairs the management committee of the parliament.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998533"></A>
As Speaker, I am the voice of this House and I agree that I am also its servant. Once the House has spoken, I communicate its will. If it is the will of this House to accept the changes, of course, as its servant, I will accept the decision. However, the House has not yet spoken. All I can do, and all I am doing today in placing this statement on the record, is warning the House of the eventual consequences of overturning what 52 previous parliaments have considered sacrosanct, that is, that the parliament is presided over and administered by the Speaker. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110405_093927" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for Reconstruction) (9.39 am): Today politicians across the chamber are wearing red in support of the Heart Foundation’s Go Red for Women campaign to raise awareness of the risk of heart disease in women. Most women do not know that heart disease is, in fact, their No. 1 killer. It kills four times as many women as does breast cancer and in Queensland it is responsible for about a quarter of premature deaths in women. In fact, around 47 per cent of people who die of heart disease are women. </A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1001296"></A>
While women have developed a very strong awareness over the past decade of their breast cancer risk--and many are taking appropriate steps to have regular checks--many still remain unaware of their risk of heart disease. For a long time heart disease has been seen as a disease that affects mainly men in this age group. More than 90 per cent of women have a risk factor for heart disease and around half have two or more of these factors. Lifestyle factors aside, many women have few of the symptoms. However, heart disease is largely preventable. By keeping a regular eye on our blood pressure, maintaining a healthy diet and weight, staying physically active and spreading the word to women of the importance of regular check-ups, we can stop this silent killer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001297"></A>
I congratulate the Heart Foundation on the great work it does in our community throughout the year, but I particularly congratulate it on the Go Red for Women campaign. I think it is a very worthy cause. I am very pleased to support it myself today. I congratulate everybody else in the chamber who is sporting a bit of red today. Even if they did not know they were doing it for the campaign, they do now. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110405_094102" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for Reconstruction) (9.40 am): It has now been more than 100 days since the events that shaped our summer started to chart an angry, destructive course through Queensland. Although we will continue to reflect on those frightening weeks during which we watched as floodwaters engulfed our towns, our farming communities and our capital city, it is also valuable to reflect on what has been achieved since then as we pull together to rebuild, and rebuild a stronger and more resilient Queensland. </A></Hansard-Body>

Operation Queenslander is now in full swing. Operation Queenslander is pulling all of our resources together to build a more robust Queensland, a Queensland that will emerge bigger, better and stronger from these disasters. In the short period since the floodwaters receded and since Cyclone Yasi blew inland and dissipated, we have already taken giant strides forward. Make no mistake: we still have a long and difficult road to travel, but it is a credit to every affected community, to every emergency worker and roads labourer and, indeed, to each and every Queenslander who has pitched in to help that we have come so far so quickly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001310"></A>
We have paid out more than $29.7 million in grants under the Personal Hardship Assistance Scheme operated by the state government to help Queenslanders repair their damaged homes. We have paid grants to 3,042 small businesses and to almost 3,000 primary producers to help get these essential Queensland sectors back on their feet. Over $8.9 million has been provided to sporting groups for repairs to clubrooms and to buy sporting equipment. The Premier’s Disaster Relief Appeal, which has raised in excess of $250 million, has so far allocated more than $55 million in round 1 payments to about 30,000 Queenslanders. We have now received 172 applications in round 2 from those people whose homes were totally destroyed and cannot be rebuilt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001312"></A>
We are getting money out the door to our councils, which will be critical in rebuilding the state, at speeds never before seen so that work can continue. Forty-four of our councils are now sharing in $387 million in joint state and federal funding, and that amount was allocated in a period of just two weeks. This is without precedent in disaster recovery. It is good news for our councils, which are facing a damage bill ultimately likely to top $2 billion. It means they can get started on the work needed to repair their communities immediately. That is because the funding has been accelerated by the Queensland Reconstruction Authority using this new process which, for the first time, speeds up payment. More than 80 per cent of this money will go towards our massive road network, the lifeblood of our state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001313"></A>
During the floods and the subsequent tropical cyclone, more than 9,000 kilometres of Queensland’s state owned road network were affected; in many cases they were simply washed away. As of yesterday, 6,800 kilometres of those roads had been restored. Of course that does not go to the question of the thousands of kilometres of council owned roads, which are also well on the way to recovery. It is a gargantuan effort and is a credit to those crews who are working so hard to bring normality back to affected communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001314"></A>
Similarly, our rail network suffered major damage, with almost 4,750 kilometres wiped out. More than 4,200 kilometres of that flood affected rail has now been repaired, including the western line, which was opened three months ahead of schedule. Of the 387 schools that were affected, 385 are now operating normally. Of the 89 state owned bridges and culverts that sustained major damage, 55 have now been repaired--and the work continues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001316"></A>
Less than two weeks after Tropical Cyclone Tasha hit Queensland, our government appointed Major General Mick Slater to head the recovery and rebuilding effort. A little over a month later we legislated to give the Reconstruction Authority the powers that it needs to get on with the job. Late last month we released Operation Queenslander, our recovery and reconstruction blueprint. We are getting on with the job of rebuilding Queensland. It is a big task but it is a task that we are determined to conquer. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The task is huge and we simply cannot do it on our own. The reconstruction will take massive cooperation among all levels of government, the business community and Queenslanders themselves. An excellent example of that spirit of cooperation in action can be seen in the Queensland Reconstruction Authority’s Join Forces program. This program is aimed at matching up the generosity of corporate Australia with the needs of community groups that require help after the floods and the cyclone. </A></Hansard-Body>

Today I am very pleased to announce that the National Australia Bank has committed $250,000 to the Reconstruction Authority’s Join Forces program which is the largest single corporate donation to date. That donation will be part of the National Australia Bank’s $1 million Community Development Fund. The money will go towards getting the Brisbane Basketball Centre at Auchenflower up and running as soon as possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001327"></A>
This is a great partnership between the National Australia Bank and basketball in Queensland. It is a huge boost for Queensland basketball. The Auchenflower complex is one of Queensland’s most utilised sports centres. It is where state championships are held and the place where our best young players from Mount Isa, Cairns, Rockhampton, Townsville--all over the state--dream of playing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001328"></A>
This is the spiritual home of basketball in Queensland. During the floods this sporting mecca had nine feet of water through it and it remained there for 36 hours, gutting the entire complex. The ‘Auchendome’, as it has been called since the early days of the Brisbane Bullets, is a community focal point used by some 6,000 to 7,000 Queenslanders every week. The association has over 1,600 junior members, with kids playing in both social and school competitions, and over 2,400 senior members. The centre has a huge roster of local schools that use it on a daily basis and, of course, it is also where the junior and senior level state and national championships are held. As I have said, the facility is regarded as the home of basketball in Queensland. With such a large junior membership, the centre is a breeding ground for our next basketball superstars. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001329"></A>
Brisbane Basketball and the NAB have a tough task ahead of them. In just two weeks time, 30 under-14 teams from across Queensland will descend on the centre for the Queensland under-14 state championships. There is no doubt that today’s announcement will put a smile on the face of many young up-and-coming players. We wish the NAB and Brisbane Basketball all the best as they join forces to get the centre up and open for the under-14 championships in a fortnight.</Hansard-Body>

There are many other corporate citizens coming forward to help. I was very pleased to join with the member for Toowoomba North when we handed over the first Nissan vehicle. Nissan is providing 200 motor vehicles which will be used for up to six months by clubs and community groups such as the Cardwell RSL club, which will be using it to transfer cancer patients to and from Cairns Base Hospital. Some will be provided to the Red Cross for community outreach out of Cairns, and eight vehicles will go to Choice Australia Management to assist in the farm clean-up project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001332"></A>
The Reconstruction Authority now has over 120 flood or cyclone affected clubs that have registered with Join Forces and there is a growing number of corporate entities wanting to join forces with them. I commend the program to members. I would encourage those members with affected groups in their electorate to ensure they know about this program and get on the website. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for Reconstruction) (9.49 am): Finally, as I have outlined today, Operation Queenslander is well underway. Right across the state we see a great sense of purpose as communities roll up their sleeves and get down to work. But the rebuilding of our roads, schools and homes is only part of the reconstruction effort. We also must rebuild lives and shattered communities right across this state. </Hansard-Body>

As we know, the Easter holidays are looming and for many people this is a significant time of reflection and hope. But it is also the first time that many Queenslanders will have a chance to pause and reflect on the experience of this last summer. Research from natural disasters around the world shows that the period of 10 to 12 weeks after the disaster occurs can be the time when the emotional damage of the events really starts to hit home. Holidays and times of celebration are also difficult moments, as people often feel they cannot celebrate as they struggle with their own internal trauma. What that means is that this year Easter may well be a very difficult time for many Queenslanders who experienced the disaster. This year Easter comes just three months after much of the disaster happened and of course Easter is a traditional time of family celebration.</Hansard-Body>

Many have suffered terrible grief and trauma from what has occurred. Queenslanders all over the state have seen their lives dislocated, as they are staying with family and friends, living with in-laws or living in a caravan while they wait for their homes to be repaired. I think we all understand that that is simply not easy. While the physical destruction of the natural disasters was immediate and obvious, other impacts such as emotional distress and depression are not so obvious. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001381"></A>
We all have a role to play in looking out for our family members, our friends, our neighbours and our work colleagues who have been affected. Some people may need the ear of someone so they can tell their story. Others might just want a bit of extra company or practical support. Some may need to be reminded that it is important to think about and take good care of themselves. These are all things we can do to support one another. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001382"></A>
This week the government will launch a mental health ad campaign in the metro and regional press and also on radio. We want to remind people that it is normal if they feel stressed, letting them know where they can get help and asking family and friends to keep an eye on their loved ones. We will be directing them to available services like the 13HEALTH 24-hour telephone hotline. This support line now also provides a service specifically for people affected by the floods or cyclones and can link people with acute mental health services. General practitioners can also provide help, referrals and information, and Lifeline offers 24-hour telephone counselling. </Hansard-Body>

The reconstruction of Queensland will take time, and it is about much more than fixing roads and rebuilding structures. It is about rebuilding lives, reconnecting people and rebuilding communities. It is also about supporting each other through these difficult times and looking forward to the better times ahead. So, if you know someone who has been affected, Easter is a time to be reaching out and lending a hand. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Attorney-General, Minister for Local Government and Special Minister of State) (9.52 am): One year ago, through the Queensland Growth Management Summit, the government began a landmark discussion with local governments, environmental groups, industry and the general public on how to better manage growth. Since the summit, a significant number of actions and major milestones have been delivered. We have established Growth Management Queensland as the lead agency to deliver summit outcomes and to coordinate growth management in Queensland. GMQ has been instrumental in managing and achieving our growth management agenda. </Hansard-Body>

Immediately following the summit the Regional First Home Owner Grant was established to provide an $11,000 grant for first home owners building new homes in regional areas. Since the summit, we have released the draft Strategic Cropping Land Framework, the State Planning Policy for Healthy Waters, the draft Biodiversity Strategy, the Queensland Integrated Waterways Monitoring Framework, and Valuing the Things We Waste--Queensland’s Waste Avoidance and Efficiency Strategy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001400"></A>
In August 2010, we also released the draft Connecting SEQ, setting ambitious 20-year targets to transform South-East Queensland’s transport network through increasing public and active transport and reducing private vehicle trips. We have released the Queensland Migration Plan, which is setting skills and business migration priorities for Queensland. We released a Transit Oriented Development Guide to promote delivery of best practice compact communities, and called for expressions of interest to develop a transit oriented precinct at Coorparoo junction. The process closed on 18 March 2011 with seven expressions of interest received. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001404"></A>
A number of major milestones have also been achieved, including the release of the final Infrastructure Charges Task Force report and the State Planning Instruments Program. We have also declared Ripley Valley, Greater Flagstone, Yarrabilba and Caloundra South as urban development areas, which collectively will provide 143,000 new dwellings. In an Australian first, I visited the Ripley Valley site with Ipswich mayor Paul Pisasale and local MPs last week to release draft blueprints for Ripley Valley, Greater Flagstone and Yarrabilba. These new communities will address the issue of housing availability and affordability.</Hansard-Body>

(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for State Development and Trade) (9.55 am): It is clear that the economic toll from natural disasters both here and abroad continues to mount. The issues facing our state from the floods and cyclone have yet to subside. Our friends in New Zealand and Japan are still very much in recovery mode from devastating earthquakes. </Hansard-Body>

The economic and fiscal challenge is getting tougher in the short term. Ongoing wet weather has been a further challenge for our state. The Commonwealth Treasury has indicated that losses in production will likely exceed original forecasts, especially in coal production. The risk of larger volume loss than first anticipated is emerging. The impact will be tempered in part by higher prices now being achieved in a supply constrained market. This points to the probability that the already weakened midyear forecasts could be further revised downwards. The situation remains under analysis as the parameters of the next state budget are being decided. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001417"></A>
Recent commentary has also centred on the sustained higher Australian dollar, which continues to challenge our export competitiveness and weigh on our tourism industry in particular. Again, this weighs upon the nearer term economic outlook. This uncertainty and prevailing downside weaknesses provide a strong case for the Reserve Bank Board today to avoid further hikes at their meeting. They should, as they have signalled, look through the shorter term inflationary pressures. For Queensland, for Queensland businesses and Queensland families in particular, today is not the day for contemplating an interest rate movement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001418"></A>
These challenges underscore the priority for strong, stable leadership--a sustained economic reform agenda and a clear line of sight to a modern economic future. Our government has been pursuing an agenda to drive jobs growth, maintain a massive building program and support industries of the future. We have embarked upon the most substantial reordering of the state’s balance sheet in our history.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001419"></A>
All of this was reflected in last Friday’s affirmation of our credit rating by Standard &amp; Poor’s, which also confirmed our stable outlook. The report noted what it described as our ‘excellent financial management’ and a ‘very strong and diversified’ economy that would overcome the nearer term challenges from the natural disasters, with anticipated stronger growth also supported by reconstruction and rebuilding activity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001420"></A>
The report recognised the budgetary challenges that remain, compounded by the recent natural disasters, and sustained growth. It acknowledged our reform program--our plan to deliver renewed strength to our finances. This government remains determined to deliver on our economic reform agenda. While the economic and financial challenges are real, so is our determination to build a stronger Queensland economy, just as we said we would. <Hansard-Speech-End>

This includes ensuring that schools are places of learning where students feel safe, comfortable and cared for. In the wake of an incident at Southport State High School last week, I want to reassure Queenslanders that our schools are safe. </A></Hansard-Body>

Almost three-quarters of a million students attend state and non-state schools in Queensland every single day, and incidents involving weapons are very rare. And when incidents do occur, the department responds swiftly. For instance, in 2009-10, 108 students were expelled from state schools for physical misconduct involving an object. Queensland also has one of the most open and transparent reporting systems for student misconduct of any state or non-state school system in Australia. Details of exclusions and short and long suspensions are listed in the Department of Education and Training’s annual report each year as well as being posted on the department’s website. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001429"></A>
Other initiatives and legislative changes implemented by the Bligh government to further protect students include establishing the Queensland Schools Alliance Against Violence to deal with violence and bullying in all schooling sectors; extending powers for principals to exclude students for unacceptable behaviour without needing departmental approval; and announcing a series of ‘Raising the Bar’ forums to give principals, teachers and P&amp;Cs the opportunity to suggest ways to improve standards in schools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001431"></A>
I want to send a very clear message to students and parents that knives have no place in schools, and that we have a zero tolerance approach to violence in schools. As a parent of two young boys in primary school, I was very disturbed to hear about the serious incident last week. As education minister, I took immediate action. I instructed Education Queensland to conduct an urgent review into all policies and legislation relating to the possession of weapons in schools. The review covers exclusion powers, searching student property, responsible behaviour plans and the communication of policies to students and teachers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001432"></A>
While last week’s incident was an isolated one, the government has a responsibility to minimise the chances of it recurring. There is no reason for a student to take a knife to school. The Bligh government makes no apologies for taking a hardline stance against knife possession in schools and we will not shy away from tough decisions to further protect Queensland students. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Yesterday’s announcement confirms two brand-new hospitals that will give public and private patients access to nearly 1,000 new beds on this site. Work on the new 200-bed private hospital starts later this year and our agreement with Ramsay Health Care means up to 110 extra beds for public patients from 2013. The new $2 billion Sunshine Coast University Hospital, to be delivered as a public-private partnership, will open in 2016 with 450 beds, growing to 738 beds by 2021. It will be the biggest hospital building project in the country when construction gets underway in early 2013.</A></Hansard-Body>

It will give Sunshine Coast residents access to a new cancer care centre and a range of complex surgical services including neurosurgery, cardiothoracic surgery, maxillofacial surgery and a trauma service. That means around 10,000 patients will no longer have to travel to Brisbane for these services each year. Not only will the Sunshine Coast University Hospital deliver new beds and services, it will also create thousands of jobs in this important region. More than 2,000 workers will be on site during construction and the hospital will employ 3,500 doctors, nurses and support staff. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003283"></A>
We are going to market with a PPP because we believe it will be the most cost-effective, best and quickest way to deliver this project. The PPP bidders will determine how quickly a hospital of this size can be built. The Bligh government always said that this hospital would be built as a PPP if it could be shown that this would deliver taxpayers value for money. Our business case shows it does. We look forward to receiving bids that not only deliver a saving to taxpayers but also deliver more beds and services sooner to this growing region. </Hansard-Body>

We are already putting more services on the ground ahead of the hospitals opening.

These come on top of a new 96-bed ward block at Nambour Hospital and an expanded emergency department at Caloundra Hospital. <Hansard-Speech-End>

We have provided the following help to disaster affected households. To assist people into private rentals we have provided more than 1,500 bond loans, more than 350 rental grants and 775 RentConnect interviews and property inspections. This is where people have been assisted to find private accommodation. Many of the people I have met have been elderly people, for instance, who have owned their own homes, never needed a reference, never needed to go to a real estate agent and have found it extremely difficult. Our RentConnect program has certainly been a great tool in this time of need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003297"></A>
Some 65 households have been helped by the Home Assist Secure. We have received 530 applications for social housing because of the natural disasters.

We have also provided 118 temporary dwellings across the state in Grantham, Emerald, Gatton, Theodore, Condamine, Cardwell, Tully, Tully Heads and Mission Beach. </Hansard-Body>

I have seen the temporary housing we have put in place in Tully, Mission Beach and Grantham. They are high-quality homes. Many of them have balconies and verandas and outdoor living areas as well. Some 61 people have been housed in the Tully Caravan Park--some of these in temporary homes, some in factory built homes and some in ensuited vans.

We have also held housing assistance forums in flood affected areas to help people find out exactly what information and support they need.

 (Inala--ALP) (Minister for Transport and Multicultural Affairs) (10.05 am): Today I have good news for public transport commuters in South-East Queensland. New and improved train timetables are coming to South-East Queensland’s two busiest train lines from Monday, 6 June.

With patronage on Queensland Rail services growing by about five per cent in the six months to 30 December, the time is ripe to undertake the first major recast of the timetable on our two busiest train lines in more than a decade. It is also one of the biggest enhancements ever to public transport in South-East Queensland, delivering many benefits including more capacity with 150,000 additional weekly seats; a simpler timetable based on two stopping patterns allowing trains on each line to run through Brisbane’s CBD stations every three minutes at the busiest times; more reliability with delays on one line now contained, reducing impacts across the network; and a turn-up-and-go train network with off-peak, weekend and public holiday services now running at least every 15 minutes between Darra and the CBD, and four trains an hour between Northgate the CBD.</Hansard-Body>

That is why 12 months ago the government introduced covert speed cameras to increase the chance and uncertainty of detection and thus motivate motorists to change their driving habits. The government approved that up to 30 per cent of mobile speed camera enforcement can be undertaken covertly using a variety of vehicles and with no advance warning or departure signs at the camera site. Queensland Police Service data shows that our strategy is working. Between April 2010 and January 2011 covert speed camera vehicles were deployed on around 2,000 occasions across the state for a total of around 6,700 hours of operation. During this time around 4 million vehicles were monitored by covert speed cameras, with close to 87,000 detected speeding.</A></Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004884"></A>
Although there are still far too many motorists exceeding the speed limit, I am pleased to advise the House that there has been a steady decline in the number of vehicles detected speeding by covert speed cameras. In April 2010 there were 24.45 detections per 1,000 vehicles; by January 2011 this had decreased to 16.07 detections per 1,000 vehicles, a reduction of around 33 per cent. The current rate of detection for marked mobile speed cameras is around 6.8 vehicles per 1,000. The government believes that the deployment of covert and marked speed camera vehicles will continue to motivate drivers to slow down and make our roads safer.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004885"></A>
On another road safety issue, last year four lives were lost as a result of drivers disobeying traffic lights, with a total of 48 lives lost since 2005. The loss of these lives was preventable. Across Queensland there are around 140 red-light camera sites utilising wet film cameras which are now approaching the end of their useful life. That is why the Queensland Police Service has recently purchased 40 new digital red-light cameras for use at sites across South-East Queensland. The cost of these cameras was $1.9 million which was derived from fines collected through the red-light and speed camera program. The message to motorists is clear: the Queensland Police Service will continue to use a mixture of on-road enforcement and technology to continue driving down the road toll.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Queensland was by far the best represented state at the event, with more than 140 Queensland tourism operators in Sydney this week to sell our unbeatable packages, our unbeatable destinations and our unbeatable hospitality to the world. The Australian Tourism Exchange, or ATE as it is known in the industry, is the largest travel trade show in the Southern Hemisphere and, from my discussions with the operators in attendance, also one of the most profitable networking opportunities they have available to them.

Queensland was certainly shining at ATE. Operators from across the state were showcasing the very best of their products, meeting with overseas contacts and negotiating deals right before my eyes. ATE is the perfect opportunity for Queensland industry to tell the world’s leading travel buyers that Queensland is well and truly open and ready to welcome visitors. Mr Speaker, I can promise you that our operators were putting on a spectacular performance, promoting everything from our five-star accommodation, unique attractions, unrivalled tours and spectacular cruises to, of course, the best food and wine experiences going. With more than 222,000 Queenslanders owing their living to tourism, the industry is a key economic driver for the state. It is vital that we stand by this industry as part of Queensland’s economic recovery. By sponsoring companies to attend ATE this year, we are standing shoulder to shoulder with our industry to ensure we win this fight.<Hansard-Speech-End>

This is the largest electricity project ever undertaken by Energex on the Sunshine Coast. Given that the Sunshine Coast is one of the country’s fastest growing areas not just in terms of population but also in peak time energy use, this project, along with others on the Energex drawing board, is needed to underpin previous growth and forecast population energy increases across the city. The population on the Sunshine Coast has risen by around 40 per cent in the past 10 years yet network peak electricity demand in the same period has gone up by close to 80 per cent--almost double the population growth, one of the highest rises in the country. Much of this peak energy rise is due to a rapid uptake of air conditioning, swimming pool penetration and new technologies such as energy-intensive televisions, computers and games.</A></Hansard-Body>

This project has been on the drawing board since it was announced in December 2006. Since then an enormous amount of community consultation has been undertaken to develop an alignment with the least overall environmental, social and financial impact to the community. A number of state and local government agencies and community representatives, including the member for Maroochydore, residents groups and environmental representatives, were included in a community reference group which was formed early in the planning stages to provide feedback. This feedback, along with submissions from the broader community, was incorporated into the draft and final environmental impact statements. Environmental and health concerns raised during the stakeholder consultation period have been assessed by government and independent bodies prior to approval. This includes the commitment to any required species management plan. A construction environmental management plan will also identify and address other local wildlife management requirements identified in the EIS.</Hansard-Body>

Energex has a strong commitment to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of the community. These standards ensure that Energex must not propose developments which do not meet a range of environmental, safety and technical standards regarding electromagnetic fields. The SunCoast project meets those guidelines. Negotiations are well advanced with landowners in the local area to secure vegetation offsets and koala habitat plantings. The SunCoast project is a key component of a network of upgrades designed to meet the electricity needs of an additional 170,000 people expected to be living in the Sunshine Coast region in the next 20 years as well as the forecast continued peak demand increases from existing homes and businesses. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The harsh reality is that floods and cyclones are clear examples of the kind of extreme weather events that scientists predict we will see more of because of climate change. As we consider the homes that were destroyed, the lives that were left in ruins and the communities we are now working to rebuild, there has never been a greater imperative for all of us to act on climate change and to have a clear understanding about what the impacts will be if we do not. In fact, with 85 per cent of Queenslanders living on our coastline, we would be more affected by climate change than any other state in Australia.</A></Hansard-Body>

Given the devastation of the natural disasters our state has endured and our vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, it is truly a coup that this week Cairns is hosting the internationally renowned climate change conference, GREENHOUSE 2011: The Science of Climate Change. The conference has brought together over 450 national and international delegates, with presentations from world-leading scientists and climate change experts including Tom Knutson from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States of America, who is an expert on the impacts of climate change on tropical cyclones; Dr Gillian Cambers from the Pacific Climate Change Science Program, who is an expert in coastal zone management and small island sustainability; and Australia’s own experts such as the CSIRO chief executive Dr Megan Clark, Bureau of Meteorology director Dr Greg Ayers and distinguished economist and climate change adviser Professor Ross Garnaut. This is a great opportunity for the scientists and representatives from industry and all levels of government to hear about the latest in climate change science from leading researchers from Australia and around the world.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004946"></A>
This afternoon I will be presenting to the conference our latest climate science report, the <Hansard-Italic>
Queensland coastal processes and climate change</Hansard-Italic>
 report. The report is the first of its kind in Queensland and discusses how coastal processes have shaped the coast and how climate change will affect them in the future. It divides the coast into five regions and outlines the vulnerability of each to climate change impacts, such as erosion and inundation from sea level rise. </Hansard-Body>

 With a clearer understanding of Queensland’s coast, we can plan for how to adapt to the impacts of climate change and minimise the impacts on our communities. This report provides planners, policy and decision makers with the latest climate change science to support their decision making. It takes leadership in government to tackle these issues head-on, but it is essential for our state’s future.<Hansard-Speech-End>

We are rebuilding Queensland and we are also continuing to deliver services to help rebuild families. Since the last election, the Minister for Community Services and I have unveiled the $55 million Helping Out Families initiative. Our early intervention and prevention program is providing the right support at the right time to prevent families from entering the child protection system. Families are accessing services on the Gold Coast, Logan and Beenleigh.</A></Hansard-Body>

I am pleased to inform the House that Helping Out Families has received 817 referrals. That is 817 families who have access to the help they need so that they can provide a safe and loving home. It makes good practical sense to address problems early to ensure that we achieve the best possible outcome for children and families. It is about building positive relationships to help families stay together.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006607"></A>
This government is also helping to rebuild families through our Indigenous family support services. We have invested $9.4 million this financial year across Queensland. These services provide culturally appropriate support programs to those in need. This includes help with parenting skills, in-home support, which looks at how to manage a household and a budget, and also helping parents address their child protection concerns. By improving parenting skills, we can help provide a safe and nurturing environment for children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006608"></A>
Indigenous family support services also have a strong focus on early intervention. Since services began from mid-2010, 530 families have received support. On top of this, since the last election we have provided $165,000 for staff at these services to receive training so that they can help teach their clients positive parenting skills. This is for the delivery of the highly regarded Triple P--Positive Parenting Program. Today I can announce that I have approved funding to allow 20 more staff members to benefit from this unique program. The Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Protection Peak is fully behind this initiative. This government remains committed to providing the right services at the right time to ensure that Queensland’s most vulnerable children and young people get a flying start in life. This is another example of the Bligh government delivering for Queensland. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Bruce Highway</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

 (Thuringowa--ALP) (Minister for Main Roads, Fisheries and Marine Infrastructure) (10.22 am): The Bruce Highway has been cut far too many times this wet season. That is why I wish to inform the House that the Main Roads investment funding unit has produced a first estimate of the funding needed to stop flooding on the Bruce Highway. It is a sobering report, because it says that around $5.3 billion is needed to accomplish the task along the 1,600 kilometres between Brisbane and Cairns. </Hansard-Body>
<DIV>
<IMAGE xml:link="simple" href="2011_04_05_WEEKLY-22.gif" show="embed" actuate="auto"/>
</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006618"></A>
 Main Roads looked at the Bruce Highway, which is a federally funded road, identifying major trouble spots and the likely cost to fix these sections. Costs for flood immunity works along the specific sections were Brisbane to Gympie, $1.3 billion; Gympie to Mackay, $1.3 billion; and Mackay to Cairns, $2.8 billion, which includes around $800 million to help solve flooding in the Ingham area. The study sets a standard of no more than 48 hours closure in the event of a one-in-50-year flood from Mackay to Cairns and not more than 12 hours closure from Gympie to Mackay in the event of a one-in-50-year flood. The $5.3 billion cost is only for improving flood immunity, not for upgrading the road to widen it or to make other improvements, although immunity improvements and upgrades might occur at the same time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006619"></A>
I am sure members from both sides of this House agree that there needs to be much more progress to flood proof the Bruce Highway, and I am certainly one of them. People in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra would not put up with their National Highway being cut. Why should we in Queensland? A generational commitment from both sides of federal politics is needed to stop flooding on the Bruce Highway. What we experienced this wet season is a symptom of neglect of our National Highway in Queensland by both sides of federal politics for the past 40 years. But we should give credit where credit is due, because the Gillard government has quadrupled road funding for the Bruce Highway in its first term. A total of $5.3 billion is obviously a massive request. That is why we need both sides in Canberra to commit to fixing this problem once and for all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006620"></A>
I will be taking some action. I will be discussing this new report with my federal counterparts as soon as possible. I will also be working on a plan to get more funding to reduce those flooding closures on the Bruce Highway, but this plan will need a commitment from both sides of politics at the federal level. <Hansard-Speech-End>

On behalf of the CLA, I wish to advise the House of the progress of the committee.</A></Hansard-Body>

Since its establishment, the CLA has met on three occasions. During that time, the non-government membership of the CLA has changed in accordance with changes in the opposition. Nonetheless, the CLA has made considerable progress in respect of major issues, all in a bipartisan manner. In terms of the establishment of the new parliamentary committee system, the most pressing item for consideration by the CLA was the number and jurisdiction of the new committees. The committee has agreed upon the new committee system, which must be finally approved by this House as follows: the establishment by standing orders of seven portfolio committees. They are (1), Finance and Administration Committee; (2), Legal Affairs and Police Committee; (3), Industry, Education, Training and Industrial Relations Committee; (4), Environment, Agriculture, Resources and Energy Committee; (5), Community Affairs Committee; (6), Health and Disabilities Committee; and (7), Transport, Local Government and Infrastructure Committee. I table for the benefit of all members a table showing the proposed seven portfolio committees and their portfolio and oversight responsibilities.</Hansard-Body>

].</Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006630"></A>
The committee also agreed upon the continuation of the Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee. In addition, the Members’ Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee will continue to hear complaints about the ethics of members or breaches of parliamentary privileges as a renamed Ethics Committee. It is proposed that the ethics committee will also operate as an oversight committee for the statutory officers of the House: the Auditor-General, the Integrity Commissioner, the Ombudsman, the Electoral Commissioner and the Information Commissioner.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006632"></A>
The CLA has also proposed that estimates for the statutory officers it oversights be conducted by the Ethics and Oversight Committee. The Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee and the Ethics and Oversight Committee will have the same membership, performing dual roles.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006633"></A>
It is apparent that some of the portfolio committees are likely to have a higher legislative workload than other portfolio committees. Similarly, other committees will have responsibility for monitoring portfolios with enormous expenditures and service delivery. Others will monitor portfolios that involve many detailed and interesting policy issues. It is virtually impossible to evenly allocate the responsibilities of government across a portfolio committee system, but the CLA believes that the establishment of the seven proposed portfolio committees achieves a good mix and balance. However, the CLA welcomes feedback on its proposal.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006634"></A>
In terms of time line, it is expected that the new portfolio committees will be established in the next sitting week of 10 May to 12 May. It is expected that the committees will not meet during the regional sitting in Mackay from 24 May to 26 May, but that the timetable of the House will be changed to enable the new portfolio committees to meet on each Wednesday morning from budget week of 14 June to 17 June 2011. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006635"></A>
The CLA has agreed that the initial focus of the new portfolio committees must be the new estimates process from budget week to the estimates process in July. Therefore, it is anticipated that the new legislative process will commence after the budget is returned in August and that bills already introduced and on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 prior to the August sitting week will not be referred to the new portfolio committees. The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee will, however, continue in existence to examine legislation introduced until the June sitting week, with the SLC ceasing to exist from 1 July. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006636"></A>
The CLA is conscious that in the period between May and August extensive education is required for members, staff, the public sector and the public generally about the new estimates and legislative process. The CLA is already considering the details of this educative process. The CLA has also turned its attention to the accommodation and resource needs for the new committee system. Later today legislation, which will facilitate the establishment of the new committee system, will be introduced into the House. I trust that the matters that I have just reported on from the CLA will inform the debate on that legislation.<Hansard-Speech-End>

(10.32 am): My first question without notice is to the Premier. I refer to the 119 per cent increase in electricity prices since this Labor government came to power in 1998, which is more than twice the 47 per cent increase in the cost price index for the same period. I also refer to the 174 per cent increase in water costs since this Labor government came to power in 1998, which is four times the increase in the cost price index for the period. I ask: can the Premier explain to Queensland families why they must continue to endure these massive increases in their cost of living due to the policies of this failed Labor government? </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. Like every member of this House, I share concerns about growing cost-of-living pressures on families. What I know is that many families face many bills. We know, for example, that one of the most expensive bills that most families face is their mortgage bill. We also know that families have to pay their rates if they are owner-occupiers. I am concerned about the increasing rates bills that have been charged by South-East Queensland mayors. I am particularly concerned about the growing rates bills--</Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am particularly concerned to see what has happened in the Brisbane City Council area, despite promises by the former mayor that rates would not rise above the rate of inflation. That was the promise: rates increases would not go above the rate of inflation or he would resign. What was the rate of inflation over the period? It was 21 per cent. What was the average increase in Brisbane rates? It was 42 per cent. That is double. But of course it was not only owner-occupiers that were hit: community groups, such as the Richlands Soccer Club, saw rate rises of 54 per cent. And, of course, unit owners in Brisbane have seen some of the largest rate rises in the history of the city, some going from $98 a quarter to a staggering $700 a quarter. </Hansard-Body>

 My second question without notice is also to the Premier. I refer to the huge increases in costs of living suffered by Queensland families resulting from the Labor government’s imposition of a fuel tax, its imposition of increased motor vehicle registration fees and the increase in public transport fees, and I ask: does the Premier now accept that the imposition of these additional government imposed cost-of-living charges has impacted harshly on Queensland families and was a bad mistake from a failed Labor government?</Hansard-Body>

 As I indicated in my answer to the last question, on this side of politics we are deeply concerned about the cost of living for working families. That is why in Queensland we work very hard to make sure that people pay less for their electricity than they do in Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 If members want to see out of control electricity prices, I refer them to the Liberal government of Western Australia, where we have seen electricity prices go through the roof. There are 40 per cent increases in Western Australia. But what do we on this side of politics do to make sure that those who are most vulnerable, those who have the lowest incomes, those who need protection are protected from these pressures? We have an extensive system of rebates to look after people who need that help. In the south-east corner, where we have the challenge of paying off the water grid, we have a water rebate. We also have an electricity rebate and, above and beyond that electricity rebate, we cross-subsidise regional Queensland so that they can be guaranteed the same electricity price as those in the south-east. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Under the administration of our government, Queenslanders continue to pay less tax than their counterparts anywhere else in Australia. We pay $417 less per year than the average tax rate of the rest of the states of Australia. Keeping taxes and charges low by comparison to the rest of the country is something that drives our financial strategy and it is something that we will continue to ensure is part of our financial strategy: looking after those people who are vulnerable, like pensioners, through rebates. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008380"></A>
I note with disappointment that there is no water rebate from the Brisbane City Council. Other councils can do it, but the largest council cannot. It is good enough for the Gold Coast City Council and good enough for the Moreton Bay Regional Council but not good enough for the largest council in the state. We will continue to look after people through rebates. We will continue to look after regional Queensland through cross-subsidisation of energy. We will continue to hope for rate relief from the new administration of the Brisbane City Council.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms GRACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Premier. Can the Premier update the House about the financial assistance that has been provided to councils to rebuild their communities that were affected by floods and cyclones over the summer? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010407"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 We have now seen almost $400 million worth of natural disaster relief funding go out the door and into the coffers of councils so that they can get on with the job of rebuilding their communities. Many people in the House will know that for many years, under all sides of politics, the arrangements under natural disaster relief provisions that have prevailed are that councils do the work, incur the costs and then submit invoices that go through both state and federal checking processes. That means that councils, and often quite small councils that do not have a big rate base, are left with the holding costs or carry that debt on their books. Through the new system established under the Reconstruction Authority, we have brought those payments forward and paid them in advance. That gives the councils absolute confidence to contract the work and get on with the business of rebuilding their communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010409"></A>
We all know that some of our smallest councils were the worst affected. The Cassowary Coast and the Lockyer Valley bore the brunt of the worst of the disasters. Their councils are among our lowest rate based councils with very small populations. The Cassowary Coast Regional Council has had $19 million delivered to it, the Hinchinbrook Shire Council has received $17 million and the list goes on. The councils are absolutely focused on the task before them. They are working hard to make sure that they can look their constituents and citizens in the eyes and say, ‘When you were down and when you were in trouble, I stood by you. When you needed me and the leadership of this council, we stood up to be counted.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010413"></A>
For the life of me, I cannot imagine Rob Chandler walking away from the people of Alpha and Jericho. Can anyone imagine someone of the calibre of Donna Stewart leaving her post? Would Brad Carter turn his back on Rockhampton or would Peter Maguire turn his back on the people of Emerald? Would Bill Shannon leave the people of the Cassowary Coast? Would Steve Jones? No, he will go the distance. Can anyone imagine Ray Brown walking away from the people of Condamine? The Mayor of Ipswich, Paul Pisasale, would sooner fly to the moon than leave the people of Ipswich. I pay tribute to each and every one of the mayors for going the distance, for standing with their people, for sticking with their task, for meeting their civic duty. They are people of substance, people of character and people who have values. </Hansard-Body>

Pooh Corner, Queensland Rail</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010423"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Transport and Multicultural Affairs. I draw the minister’s attention to 138 hectares of environmentally sensitive land known as Pooh Corner, which was secured from the Commonwealth by the Brisbane City Council in 2006. Is the minister aware of a meeting between officers of Queensland Rail and the Brisbane City Council at which Queensland Rail officers outlined a proposal to seize 30 hectares of that sensitive area for a proposed new train maintenance depot? Can the minister brief the House on what the plans are for the site? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010426"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would like to thank the honourable member for her question. I think she is still the shadow minister for transport, although at the moment we are still unsure of the composition of the shadow ministry. However, we do know that we have a general manager. I am very well acquainted with the site that the shadow minister is talking about. It is an area known as Pooh Corner. It is about 30 hectares of land. It is a very environmentally sensitive part of an area that I represent. In fact, the member for Mount Ommaney also has a very keen interest in the area. She works very actively with the local green groups in the area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010428"></A>
Pooh Corner is a very important parcel of land. It is environmentally sensitive. Over the years, a very strong campaign has been run to protect this significant parcel of land for future generations. Therefore, I was surprised to see on the front page of today’s local paper an article in which the local councillor for Jamboree misleads the public by saying that there were plans to build a railway depot on the site. Today, I confirm for the shadow minister for transport that, due to the environmental significance of this parcel of land, it was completely ruled out by Queensland Rail. I am advised that it has been completely ruled out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010429"></A>
Clearly, this is what the opposition is doing. All you do is whip up community and public concern when it is not needed. Not one person raised that issue with me or the member for Mount Ommaney. All you are doing is whipping up hysteria. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WENDT:</Hansard-Member-Up>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010436"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Members will have heard me talk about this program and call on them to nominate people whom they know have in some way helped their community or a neighbouring community get back on its feet. Last Friday nominations closed for the local disaster heroes program. The program has been embraced with open arms by communities right across the state. I am pleased to advise the House that around 3,000 hero nominations have already been processed and daily many more are arriving by post from across Queensland. I thank members from both sides of this House who have worked to make sure that people who played a role have been nominated. I congratulate them for playing that role in their communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010437"></A>
Every single one of the nominations represents one of the thousands of stories of the people who kept the Queensland spirit alive during our darkest hours. We have seen nominations for local businesses, clean-up volunteers, people who baked cakes and even some media personalities have been nominated. This year during Queensland Week we will all have a chance to say thanks. Queensland Week will be extended slightly to run from 4 to 13 June. Nine events will be held--in Grantham, Townsville, Rockhampton, Emerald, Bundaberg, Ipswich, Innisfail, Toowoomba and Brisbane. Obviously, many more communities will hold events, but those nine locations will host the major events. We will be inviting every nominee to come to one of those events, but I know that some communities will host their own events around the nominations. People who have attended one of the big events may find that a local event will be held to say ‘thank you’ or ‘congratulations’. I encourage that. If that is what mayors want to do, we encourage them to do so. Some of my members have told me that they want to hold thank you and congratulatory functions after people have received their recognition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010438"></A>
At the events, people will be provided with a specially cast medal that commemorates the contribution that they made. The hero awards are for community members, but at the events we will also see uniformed officers such as police, ambulance and emergency service workers recognised and presented with a service medal in relation to both the floods and the Cyclone Yasi event, as appropriate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010439"></A>
I want to praise every one of those people who have been nominated. These are people whom the rest of their community saw stand up. When someone needed to be counted, when a hand needed to be lent, these are the people who did it. I encourage everyone to get behind this program and to recognise the great efforts that these people have made. </Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the minister for ICT.

It is a long-term program and it will bring our ICT services up to date. </Hansard-Body>

Whilst we are on the subject of cutting-edge ICT technology, I note that just last week this government released a discussion paper on the NBN, which will deliver front-line ICT services across Australia. What has the Brisbane City Council done about the NBN? The former lord mayor said that he did not support the NBN and that, instead, he would bring in his own network in Brisbane; he would set up his own Brisbane based NBN in the sewers. He would use the Brisbane sewers to deliver cable, but it was a failed suggestion. He failed and just recently he announced that he could not deliver the project. Queensland is leading the way on ICT, but we have had no leadership from the Brisbane City Council on it. </Hansard-Body>

 The next local government elections will be held on 31 March 2012 with all Queenslanders over 18 entitled to vote for their local council and mayor. Of course, not all mayors will choose to stand again, as we have seen in the past fortnight. We have seen the unedifying spectacle of the faceless men of the LNP imposing someone unelected and unaccountable as its party leader. We have seen the humiliation that not one of the LNP members in this House were considered suitable in the eyes of the organisation to lead the party. Then we saw in the paper this morning that the privatisation of Gladstone is on the agenda. That is part of their policy of outsourcing. They have outsourced the work of the parliamentary wing. The head of the outsourcing is the member for Callide. He is being paid $1,200 a week--$170 a day--and for what? He is the rubber stamp of the parliament for Campbell Newman. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Last week we saw the humiliation of the member for Callide when he said that he would, no doubt, be Deputy Premier under Campbell Newman. Then, of course, we had Campbell Newman saying that was not going to be the case--the absolute humiliation of the member for Callide. The faceless men have struck again with the future candidate for Beaudesert. John Brent, whom I do not mind as a person, has had three goes at the rank and file. They had Hajnal Ban, Scott Buchholz and Aidan McLindon, the member for Beaudesert, but now the only way he will get a go is by the faceless men endorsing him yet again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010528"></A>
This is an opposition that has completely vacated itself from the system of being a parliamentary opposition. This is a crowd which no longer does the job that it was elected to do and is paid to do. At the head of the queue is the member for Callide, the man who has been comprehensively humiliated by not only his colleagues but also Campbell Newman and the parliamentary wing. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the recent release of the Commonwealth estimates of the effects of Labor’s proposed carbon tax imposing an extra $860 on Australian families. Given that the Queensland Labor government supports this tax, when will the Treasurer release Queensland Treasury modelling on the effect on Queensland families? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012743"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and I suppose shadow Treasurer at this point for his question. The reality, of course, is that what we saw released into the public arena last year was not modelling of any proposed tax because there has not been any detail of the nature of that tax decided upon by either the federal government or the House of Representatives, let alone the Senate. So the notion that there is something to be modelled is not, in fact, the case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012745"></A>
The point is this: what we are talking about here as a nation is confronting the real effects of human induced climate change. This is the side of parliament that accepts the reality of climate change. The reality is that this is the side of politics that accepts the need to confront climate change and to deal with it. What are we dealing with here? We are dealing with a massive market failure--the externalising of carbon out of the economy. The weight of scientific evidence and the weight of policy advice is to price carbon into the economy. This is the side of politics that ultimately will deal with climate change. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012746"></A>
The question for the other side is: where do they stand now? Where does Campbell Newman stand now? He was out this morning talking about his green heart. Does he have a green brain? Does he accept human induced climate change? Or is he going to be beholden to the faceless men of the LNP--to Bruce McIver, who is a climate change denier--or to the Leader of the Opposition, who is one of the best climate change deniers? Has he now had to bankrupt himself, as the former Leader of the Opposition had to do, and deny his past policy position? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012747"></A>
The real question here today is: where does Campbell Newman stand now? We have all heard him go out there and talk about climate change. We have all heard him say that he accepted the reality. But where is he now? He is dancing to the tune of the banjos who deny climate change--the old boys from the National Party who came in and traduced the Liberal Party in this place. They are calling the shots. They are picking the leader. They are picking the shadow cabinet. They are saying it is 1,250 bucks a throw to get into the shadow cabinet. How many members opposite have paid their 1,250 bucks to find out whether they get to be in the shadow ministry? Who has paid their dues to be in the shadow ministry? Not one of them, because this mob in here is not being run by anyone in this chamber. They are dancing to the tune of those outside--those who deny climate change, those who refuse to deal with its consequences. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012748"></A>
This is the side of politics that says unambiguously to the people of this state, to the future generations of this state, that we unambiguously will confront the challenge of climate change and deal with it. The real question is: where does Campbell Newman stand on this issue today? </Hansard-Body>

As I said this morning, we saw Standard &amp; Poor’s issue their latest credit rating on Friday. They pointed to a ‘robust, strong and diversified’--their words--Queensland economy. They also pointed to this government’s ‘excellent financial management’--their words again. I want to quote from the report. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1012761"></A>
Queensland’s financial management is excellent in our view. In response to the floods and expected reduction in self-generated revenues, the Queensland Government is undertaking further savings measures as part of its midyear review and is currently conducting a review of spending priorities as part of the 2012 budget process. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012762"></A>
There it is from the ratings agency. They point to the challenges that continue in terms of our budget performance. They point to the challenges that come from growth and exacerbated by the current natural disasters. But there it is in full, telling it like it is. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012763"></A>
There is, however, a set of public finances that the ratings agency cannot comment on anymore--about which they cannot tell it like it is and on which they cannot pass independent judgement. Who might those be? When Standard &amp; Poor’s reviewed the Brisbane City Council’s finances in 2007--I note it is a AA plus credit rating, not a AAA credit rating under Campbell Newman--what did they say? They put Brisbane City Council on negative watch. What was Campbell Newman’s response to being put on negative watch? Did he put in the hard yards? Did he put in place a policy? No. He sacked the ratings agency. Imagine if in 2009 my response was to sack the ratings agency! Why did he do that? Because he does not like answering questions. He does not like answering questions about why rates have risen 42 per cent despite his pledge to keep them in line with inflation. He cannot answer why the toll on the Clem7 tunnel today is $3.95 when he said it would be $2. He cannot answer why he sunk $770 million of ratepayers’ money into a financially collapsed tunnel--the Clem7 is now in receivership--because he does not like answering questions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012768"></A>
One thing he can do is pull the Leader of the Opposition into line. Old ‘Yap Yap’ got the old dog into line last week. He put the dog collar on him and brought him to heel. He got the short leash on the Leader of the Opposition. When he stood up, Campbell Newman proved that he could get right up on tippy-toes and bring the Leader of the Opposition into line, because he wanted to have a go at being deputy but then he found out that the deputy deputy wants to be the deputy and the deputy deputy deputy down the other end wants to be the deputy. And now they have John Brent in the game because he wants to be the deputy from outside the parliament. What we know is that there is a complete absence of leadership on that side of the parliament. The Leader of the Opposition has been brought to heel. </Hansard-Body>

 Order! Stop the clock. As I understand it, the Deputy Premier and Attorney-General was asked a question. He is answering that question. I cannot hear any abuse of any member of the opposition that would occasion interjection. Therefore, I call the honourable the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General has the call. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1012795"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
The former Attorney-General’s record in relation to SPER is a record that speaks for itself--a 15 per cent increase on the previous year in the collection of fines. That is what he did. What the taxpayers of Queensland want to know is what the former Attorney-General achieved in his time in terms of collecting those fines, and he achieved a 15 per cent increase. Why is that? It is because of the tough measures that were introduced under his watch. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012798"></A>
People can play semantics about what is reported on websites and the like. If it makes people happy for us to report other information there, we have done that. But what matters is what is collected. Of course SPER, being the agency that it is--it collects fines, for example, for the Brisbane City Council--is not always able to determine how it might collect a debt if, for example, it is not provided with information from the body the debt is owed to. Also, half the SPER current debt of $293.7 million has been deferred as a result of the floods and cyclone. So it is misleading to compare year-on-year figures for the last two months. Fines have been suspended and we would expect that number to go up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012800"></A>
We saw some funny arguments from the shadow minister in relation to the thinking that the money should go to teachers, nurses and police--and it should. That is why the former Attorney-General achieved a 15 per cent increase in collecting fines. But there have been silly comments by the Police Union secretary that we should throw people in jail at the cost of 100,000 bucks a year. That would actually take money away from consolidated revenue. We on this side of the House will make sure that we have policies in place to collect fines where appropriate to make sure that those people who commit the offences pay their fines. But we will not throw good money after bad and put people in jail for fine defaulting in ordinary cases simply because it costs more money to do that than to actually recover the money, and it would take money away from consolidated revenue. </Hansard-Body>

 I would like to thank the member for Southport very much for his question about a very important initiative which is Cross River Rail.

Cross River Rail, worth an estimated $8 billion, is the proposed new 18-kilometre north-south rail line in Brisbane’s inner city. It includes a new surface station at Yeerongpilly, a new 9.8 kilometre tunnel connecting to new underground train stations at Boggo Road, Woolloongabba, Albert Street and Roma Street and a new surface station at the Exhibition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

This great city, and indeed the Gold Coast, needs Cross River Rail. The government knows it, the opposition knows it and transport experts know it.

A second river rail crossing must be the next big step in our public transport system. Either we lock in a second river rail crossing or we lock in a future of overcrowded trains and congested roads.

This benefits the people living in Logan, living in Caboolture, living in Ipswich, living down the Gold Coast. You need to work out your policy position on Cross River Rail. You need to work out your policy on Cross River Rail because clearly you formerly supported it and now you clearly do not.</Hansard-Body>

The government is now dithering around in a policy paralysis leaving schools in limbo.

Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the temporary shadow minister for education for his question. One thing will be known when the shadow ministry is picked: the person who sought to wreck the political career of Campbell Newman is the shadow minister for education and there will be one person who will be on the back bench when Campbell Newman gets his way with the shadow ministry. The secret agent general will be on the back bench next week. He will have a long and luxurious time to reflect on his period as the shadow minister when the new shadow ministry is picked. That is one prediction I will make today when Campbell Newman gets his way and clears out anyone who stands in his way, stands in the way of his ego, stands in the way of him monstering the opposition from outside the chamber--the democratic chamber of the parliament of Queensland. He will move him aside. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015105"></A>
What I will say about Flying Start is this. There is no state secret that we have suffered the worst natural disasters in Queensland’s history in the last few months. There is no state secret that that has badly affected the departmental budget as it has the state budget. As I have reported to this parliament previously, 350 schools were affected by floods and cyclones. Flying Start is an important initiative. Flying Start is one that this government is working closely and carefully on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015106"></A>
I have said in the parliament before, as the Premier has indicated, that we are being slow and deliberate in our approach to delivering this important project. What did we have from the opposition last year? The LNP seems to like to have it both ways on so many things. We do not know what the policies of those opposite are because in their craven pursuit for power they have said, ‘Everything we have said for the last two years is null and void.’ Everything they have come into this House to say in policy terms is now set aside. How craven. How base. They have debased themselves by going outside this parliament and picking a leader. They have debased themselves by vacating the policy field in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

What did the then opposition leader, the member for Surfers Paradise, say on the Madonna King program on 29 September last year when asked ‘Do you support a move to high school?’ He said, ‘Yes, I do.’ Then on 1 March this year he was calling on the state to clearly rule it out. What do those opposite stand for? Last year they were saying they support it and this year they do not. They are a joke. They are a rabble. They have debased themselves. There is not one with integrity, not one with character to stand up and say, ‘I’ll lead’--not one. They are more interested in drinking rum than they are in leading Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1015118"></A>
Councils strongly support water businesses as separate legal entities--commercial in focus and subject to appropriate asset and economic regulatory frameworks.

Can members imagine my surprise when I read the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 this morning and read the candidate’s comments in terms of his support for South-East Queensland water reforms? He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1015122"></A>
That is not true. It is absolutely untrue. We across South-East Queensland--the mayors--opposed this so-called water reform for many, many years and it was only at the 11th hour that we accepted a particular model that is now on the table. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015123"></A>
The fact is that the candidate’s record on this goes back years. I have with me the memorandum of understanding between the councils of South-East Queensland on the institutional reforms to water sewerage businesses dated 2006. Paragraph 6 says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1015126"></A>
The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is to set out commitments from Councils to support the Project, including an agreed approach to the separation of the Councils’ water and sewerage businesses and the transition to the reform model.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1015164"></A>
That was 2006. That was followed up with a submission from the Council of Mayors dated June 2007, and what does that say? It says--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1015166"></A>
The Council of Mayors agrees with the vision and the objectives of the reforms and supports the majority of the commission’s recommendations.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015167"></A>
What is brought into sharp focus is the candidate’s integrity. He has been caught out with a blatant lie--a blatant untruth--and the question that now must be asked is this: given the history and given the proof here of his long-term support for reform, why does he think he can get away with this untruth? When the history of the 2011 floods are written, history will record this candidate--this former lord mayor--deserting his post. He is a former Defence Force officer and he knows exactly what that means. He is a coward. He went missing in action and he deserted his post. The people of South-East Queensland and the people in the rest of the state will know and understand--</Hansard-Body>

Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I have never seen a more public admission of shame in my entire life--the shame that is borne by the opposition in this House and every other Liberal National Party member who in the federal Senate blocked $52 million of federal government funding for public dental health. The opposition does not want to recognise that Queensland has the best public Dental Health Program in Australia. That is what it does not want to recognise. Two million Queenslanders have treatments from this public Dental Health Program every year. There are more Queenslanders eligible for public dental health in Queensland than any other state. We fund public dental health in Queensland at the same level as New South Wales despite the fact that New South Wales has double the population.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015191"></A>
There is nothing more deceitful than this opposition when it comes to public dental health. Not only did the Liberal National Party in the Senate consciously block and criminally neglect the Queenslanders of this state by stopping $52 million coming into Queensland; every opposition member in this House and those preceding them were deathly silent for 10 years as John Howard ripped $50 million out of the public Dental Health Program coming to Queensland--not just for one year but year after year after year. Ten years!</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms FARMER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport. Can the minister advise how the Bligh government has supported sport and recreation facilities across Queensland to help people lead healthy and active lifestyles? How does this compare with investment by local councils?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015212"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. She is a great supporter of local sport, particularly in the Bulimba electorate. The Bligh government is committed to rebuilding and delivering services for Queenslanders. This government is continuing to support local sport and recreation facilities to help Queenslanders lead healthy and active lives. In 2010 the Bligh government delivered two rounds of sport and recreation infrastructure funding to help clubs upgrade their facilities. To date I have approved more than $20.6 million for 144 community infrastructure projects right across Queensland, and we worked with many councils across Queensland in delivering this funding. There have been 121 applications from councils seeking partnerships with the Bligh government to deliver better sport and recreation facilities. How many applications were there from the Brisbane City Council under ‘can’t-do’ Campbell’s watch? How many do members think? Zero! Nil! Zilch!</Hansard-Body>

Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 He was obviously doing lunch with his plotters instead of putting in applications for sports and recreation. It seems Campbell is a can’t-do kind of guy when it comes to funding local sports and recreation projects. He does not understand that they are the lifeblood of our communities and suburbs. The man who thinks he will be a man for all Queenslanders would prefer to fund poorly used bike programs in the inner city than invest in many local sports and recreation facilities in the suburbs and towns. There was not one application--not one application! Instead, ‘can’t-do’ Campbell has cut and run, leaving Brisbane sports and recreation clubs in limbo at a time when people need leadership. In comparison, Ipswich council has made eight applications; Cairns Regional Council, four; and Redland City Council, two. ‘Can’t-do’ Campbell could not even be bothered lodging one. Despite the lack of interest in this program by ‘can’t-do’ Campbell, I am pleased to inform the House that the Bligh government approved $3.7 million of funds for clubs within the Brisbane City Council area to support clubs in the member for Ashgrove’s electorate such as Bowls Queensland, Enoggera squash club and The Gap junior Australian football club.</Hansard-Body>

 They do not like it.

Those opposite and their can’t-do leader want to barrack from the sidelines but cannot even put in an application for sports funding while the Bligh government invests more funding in sport and recreation than any other state in the country. Unlike those opposite, we are focusing on rebuilding Queensland, including local sports clubs.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Community Services and Housing and Minister for Women. Minister, I spoke to a small business owner yesterday who had to fill several vacancies in his business with people needing to relocate as there were no local applicants. These new residents will find affordable housing difficult to get. Minister, what is this government doing to build additional social housing in the Gladstone electorate?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017905"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms STRUTHERS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. I have met with her on several occasions and I know of her concern regarding affordable housing and social housing in her electorate. Unlike many members of the LNP, she has not opposed the nation-building spend on social housing. She has been a strong advocate for social housing, and I thank her for that. Unlike members of the LNP, who many times are in their local papers opposing social housing--including the former leader, the member for Surfers Paradise--the member for Gladstone has stuck up for social housing tenants, and I thank her publicly for that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015270"></A>
I understand the pressures on cities like Gladstone--growing cities, cities that are part of the mining boom in this great state of ours. I know that the Deputy Premier, who now has responsibility for those planning issues, is working with the member’s local community and working with mining companies to meet their commitments in relation to housing and that the Urban Land Development Authority is undertaking significant work in Gladstone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015272"></A>
There are a number of fronts on which we need to deal with this housing issue. One of them that is in my area of responsibility is social housing for people of Gladstone. As part of our package of support to people around the state, one of the new products we have is the National Rental Affordability Scheme. Under NRAS, we are funding, with the federal government, subsidies to private developers to build housing and to bring that housing to market at 80 per cent of the market rent. I have discussed the opportunities we have and will have into the future to bring that product into the Gladstone region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015275"></A>
We are working hard right around the state to make sure that people have an affordable place to live. Gladstone and some of our other cities around the state are certainly under significant pressure. I urge members opposite to give us the backing we need, to give us support. Throughout the past 12 or 18 months a lot of my energy has gone into working with local media where these people have opposed our housing developments--absolutely appalling opposition to public housing. Again, let me remind members of some of the comments from members opposite that we have had to deal with--feeding the paper with nonsense--such as from the member for Surfers Paradise 18 months or two years ago: ‘Not these people, not in this street’. That is the sort of attitude many of those members opposite have. That is the sort of attitude they have to public housing. </Hansard-Body>

Townsville Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 he admits that the last time he travelled the Bruce Highway was 25 years ago when he was in an Army convoy. Twenty-five years ago! What does the pretend Leader of the Opposition think about that? What do those National Party members think about someone who has not driven along the Bruce Highway for 25 years? I reckon that is a shame.

The people of Queensland have to ask why. It is because they are running scared. They know the track record of Campbell Newman. Government members can compare that track record with their own track record and they are shamed by the comparison.

They know that Campbell Newman has stood up for the people of Brisbane. They know that Campbell Newman has delivered for the people of Brisbane and that, like all local governments across Queensland, the Brisbane City Council has been thwarted by a state Labor government that has failed to deliver. Like all local government leaders across the state, Campbell Newman has had enough of this failed Labor government. Campbell Newman is standing up for Queensland, because it is time to get rid of Bligh, Lucas and Fraser. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
It is time to get rid of the Premier, the Treasurer and the Special Minister of State. Right across the state, Queenslanders are saying that they have had enough. They have had enough of a Labor government that hides the truth to dodge bad headlines. They have had enough of a Labor government that puts politics first. They have had enough of a Labor government that works only for itself, not for the people it represents--a Labor government that has not been able to plan for the future, that has not been able to cut the waste and that has not been able to stop spending Queenslanders’ money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015299"></A>
Campbell Newman put up his hand to become Lord Mayor because he believed that Labor had failed Queenslanders. Despite 11 years in power, the Labor led council failed to deliver decent roads, it failed to deliver the necessary infrastructure and it failed to support the people of Brisbane. Now, Campbell Newman is putting up his hand for all of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015300"></A>
Campbell Newman has lived in communities across the state. He has worked in Moura, he has worked in Toowoomba, he has worked in Duaringa and he has worked in Biloela. He knows Queenslanders, he has worked with Queenslanders and he wants to help Queenslanders, just as he has helped the people of Brisbane. Campbell Newman has spent half his life in Queensland. He has worked in the coal industry, the grain industry, the electricity industry and the telecommunications industry. He understands what makes our economy tick and he understands what it is going to take to rebuild our state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015301"></A>
That is why the Treasurer, the Premier and the Special Minister of State are running so scared this morning. That is why the Treasurer is somewhat pale when he sits and interjects in the parliament this morning. He knows the track record of the man who will lead the LNP in the next election. When Campbell Newman put up his hand to become the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, he was the unpaid, unelected Leader of the Opposition for the Brisbane City Council. That campaign lasted for two years and Campbell Newman worked every day unpaid to get elected so that he could turn Brisbane around. That is exactly what Campbell Newman will do now for all of Queensland. He will listen to the people of Queensland and he will deliver for the people of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015303"></A>
As Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Campbell Newman delivered the Clem7 tunnel. He convinced the government to take on Airport Link and the Legacy Way project. He delivered the Go Between Bridge and the Eleanor Schonell Bridge. He built cycleways and created and protected parks and green spaces. A wonderful statistic that I like is that Campbell Newman put 715 new buses on Brisbane’s roads in just seven years--715 new buses! He was the leader of a team that treasures the environment. They planted 1.38 million trees, saving 1,100 hectares of bushland from development. His can-do team adopted carbon offsets for council vehicles, Brisbane’s CityCats and the city’s bus fleet. Under his leadership, Brisbane City Council buys 100 per cent of green energy. One hundred per cent of the electricity requirements of the Brisbane City Council is green energy. That is doing something. Every traffic light, every streetlight, every council building is powered by green electricity, making Campbell Newman’s council the largest purchaser of green energy on the national grid. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015309"></A>
This is what Campbell Newman does and this is why the Labor government is frightened of his move to state politics. This is the difference between Campbell’s can-do delivery and the Bligh government’s can’t-do rhetoric. It is the difference between what Campbell Newman can do and what Labor has continually failed to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018400"></A>
Under Campbell Newman’s leadership, the LNP worked hard for the people of Brisbane. Under Campbell Newman’s leadership, the LNP team here in the state parliament will work tirelessly for the whole of Queensland. Twenty years ago Queensland did not have any debt. Twenty years ago--a time that the current Treasurer would struggle to even remember--Queensland had zero debt. Now we are heading for $80 billion worth of debt and it is getting worse. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018401"></A>
The failed Treasurer in this failed Labor government, Andrew Fraser MP, readily admits that over the next four years we will see an accumulated deficit of $10 billion. The failed Treasurer in this failed Labor government, one Andrew Fraser MP, lost the state’s treasured AAA credit rating. That will be his legacy. That is what the people of Queensland will remember him for. He could not balance the books. Every year this government, the Bligh-Lucas-Fraser team, keeps spending more than it earns and Queenslanders are paying the price. They will pay the price for generations to come. They will pay the price of this failure. Can any Queenslander honestly say that life is better under this Labor government? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018402"></A>
It is getting worse. As the failed Treasurer in this failed Labor government continues to deny the reality, the reality for Queenslanders is getting worse. It is getting worse with the Gillard government’s carbon tax which is going to have an extra $860 removed from Queenslanders’ family budgets. The Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Campbell Newman, stood up to the federal government when Labor tried to get out of supporting flood and cyclone effected local governments. Campbell Newman stood up to Canberra and demanded that it help councils that had damaged sewerage systems, road and public transport infrastructure. What did the Premier do? What did the Treasurer do? What did the Special Minister of State do? They did nothing. They simply did nothing. The comparison between what they achieved in that hour of need is stark when their performance is set against the performance of Campbell Newman in his role as Lord Mayor of Brisbane City. The Premier was ready to abandon the councils and the ratepayers of Queensland because of her politics. The Premier put politics before the people of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020964"></A>
Queensland used to be the envy of the nation. People wanted to come to Queensland. Now interstate migration has ground to a halt as Queensland has slid to the bottom of the ladder. Under Bligh, Lucas and Fraser Queensland is no longer the low tax state. Under this failed Labor government Queensland has lost its AAA credit rating. They have destroyed the state’s reputation. They have robbed family budgets and it will only get worse. A Campbell Newman team will ensure Queenslanders power Queensland again not politics, a Campbell Newman team will make sure that our state is a can-do Queensland again. A Campbell Newman LNP team will work for Queenslanders not ourselves. We will save Queenslanders money, deliver more and cut waste. We will be open and accountable and we will plan for the future, not live for the moment. A Campbell Newman led LNP will inject a new energy into Queensland and create new opportunities for our state. We will present a clear, stark choice between Can-do Campbell and ‘never-has-done’ Anna. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (Ms Farmer): Order! The member for Everton has the call.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018413"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In the two years since I was elected as the member for Everton, I have worked hard with my colleagues, the members for Ashgrove and Ferny Grove, to fight traffic congestion in our area. Everyone understands that one of the downsides of South-East Queensland’s huge population growth is the increasing traffic on our roads. The Bligh government is doing a lot to tackle growth and congestion in the south-east corner. We are providing incentives to move to the regions rather than the south-east, we are encouraging development in our inner city areas to stop urban sprawl and we are investing massively in new public transport to give people other travel options. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018414"></A>
Despite these initiatives, congestion is still a fact of life in my area, which is why tackling it has been one of my biggest priorities since I was elected. Last year I surveyed locals about traffic. People told me that more than anything they wanted the bottleneck at the Samford Road-Wardell Street intersection at Enoggera fixed. This is the point where traffic heading to and from the suburbs in my electorate starts backing up. Congestion at this intersection is unacceptable and it is getting worse. Only this morning, I spent 15 minutes waiting to get through this intersection myself while on my way to parliament. Some time ago, the members for Ashgrove, Ferny Grove and I agreed that fixing the intersection was our shared No. 1 priority. We got the Minister for Main Roads, Craig Wallace, out to inspect the intersection for himself, most recently on 15 March, and I appreciate the efforts that the minister has made in this regard. We have had countless meetings with ministers and public servants. I have made seven speeches in parliament on the subject of traffic congestion and I organised a deputation of concerned local residents to meet with the Premier and the Minister for Main Roads about this intersection at December’s Albany Creek Community Cabinet.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018415"></A>
The good news is that following all of this hard work the government has agreed to fix this intersection once and for all. The upgrade will happen in two stages. Stage 1 will extend the outbound left-turn lane on Wardell Street approaching Samford Road. Last year Minister Wallace committed to extending the turning lane and the project has now been scheduled to start mid-2011. I again thank the minister, his staff and his department for looking favourably at this project. Stage 1 will lengthen the turning lane from 30 metres to 115 metres and will be finished this year. This will let through 100 more cars in each change of lights and will improve traffic flow in the afternoon peak hour.</Hansard-Body>

After completing stage 1 the government has committed to fund stage 2 over the next four years. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This involves a massive widening of the intersection and increasing the number and length of turning lanes on both sides of Samford Road and the other side of Wardell Street. I take the interjection from the member for Aspley who, despite being the spokesperson for transport issues, does not seem to think that this is a priority for our area. This massive upgrade will fundamentally transform the north-west suburbs and the daily commute for many people in our area. It will reduce queuing times for commuters coming from Everton’s suburbs, particularly in the morning and on weekends.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018419"></A>
The only thing that is not resolved is an exact start date for stage 2. It is great to have an ironclad guarantee that the work will happen, but we now want work on stage 2 to start as soon as possible. That is why, together with the members for Ashgrove and Ferny Grove, I have established an e-petition to persuade the government to start work now. It can be accessed through my website and I encourage all who want this intersection fixed now to join that e-petition. Already 76 people have signed the e-petition and I am expecting many more to follow in the days and weeks ahead.We understand that the government has to find millions of dollars to repair roads in flood and cyclone affected parts of Queensland, but we also want to make sure our area gets its fair share. With a bit more help from my constituents and my fellow north-west MPs, we will get this horrendous intersection fixed once and for all. </Hansard-Body>

This latest announcement comes on top of a range of other roadworks that the Bligh government has undertaken or is undertaking to tackle traffic congestion in Everton. These include upgrading the intersection of Pickering Street and Samford Road; upgrading the intersection of Taylors Road, Prospect Road and Samford Road; extending the turning lane from Albany Creek Road onto Keong Road; improving the traffic lights at the intersection of South Pine Road and Flamingo Drive at Albany Creek; installing a turning arrow at the intersection of Faheys Road East and Old Northern Road to assist families dropping kids off at All Saints Primary School; and undertaking planning work to improve the intersection of Stafford Road and South Pine Road. </Hansard-Body>

It is easy in this game to come out with glib slogans like ‘can-do’. What matters more is getting runs on the board delivering big improvements for your constituents and it does not get much bigger in my area than fixing the Samford Road-Wardell Street intersection once and for all. As a father, I understand that every minute spent in traffic is a minute not spent with your family. This intersection will make a huge difference to the lives of Everton families.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110405_114917" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Kallangur--ALP) (11.48 am): In the recent disastrous flooding that hit Queensland, my electorate of Kallangur was not immune from serious damage. Not only was there devastation to property below the North Pine Dam, but also the AJ Wyllie Bridge, which connects Petrie, Lawnton and Strathpine, was severely damaged and had to be closed for testing. In January, northbound lanes of the bridge, the low bridge, were closed as a result of this structural damage, which includes cracks and significant erosion to the foundations. The Department of Transport and Main Roads has undertaken comprehensive investigations of the bridge to determine the extent of the damage. Investigations included load testing, surveys of the water area with particular reference to tidal currents, crack mapping, geotechnical testing and hydraulic assessments. These have revealed cracking on sections of the structure, along with severe scouring where water has pushed away the earth at the base of some bridge piers. Most testing was not visible to the public and has led to some frustration because of the severe congestion caused by the closure of two lanes. This bridge sees a very large volume of traffic. The southbound bridge remains open to one lane of traffic in each direction.</A></Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018467"></A>
After a thorough investigation, taking into account the high volume of use and the financial and environmental issues, the department decided that a new bridge is the very best option. The new bridge will align with the existing higher southbound bridge and will make both bridges less prone to scouring and better able to handle flood flows. To have a bridge that will be less prone to flood damage and closure is the best outcome for the community. Building a new bridge to replace the 77-year-old structure will also save money on costly maintenance each year. The long-suffering users of the AJ Wyllie Bridge will certainly benefit from this new bridge but still will endure delays while the new bridge is constructed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018468"></A>
The first part of the project will be to demolish the existing bridge. That will happen as quickly as possible and be a mark of significant progress. As soon as the design and tender process is completed, the construction of the new bridge will begin. I know that the hardworking minister and the department of main roads will ensure that this project happens as quickly as possible because they fully understand the impact on us all. I thank the local community and businesses for their patience during the closure of the northbound bridge. The safety of all motorists and users of the bridge is our No. 1 priority and we are working hard to restore this important route for northbound travellers as soon as possible. Pedestrians and cyclists will be accommodated by a crossing further upstream and the team are investigating just where and how that will be managed. I know it will be hard, but I ask the community for its continued patience during the planning and building process for the new bridge.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018469"></A>
During the testing and inspection stage, one of the biggest difficulties has been getting information out to the community. The minister and Main Roads staff have assured me that regular information bulletins will be issued regarding progress and the construction phases. Members of the public can also subscribe for SMS updates about the AJ Wyllie Bridge by visiting www.northpinebridgesms.com.au and following the prompts. I know that my office and that of the member for Pine Rivers, Carolyn Male, will ensure that information is distributed via our newsletters and networks. I thank Carolyn Male for her strong advocacy, and I thank the minister and staff for their attention to this critical matter for my electorate and the Pine Rivers community. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110405_115218" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Moggill--LNP) (11.52 am): It is now well over a year since the government released the Flying Start green paper on education. Whilst that is a discussion paper, it all but announced a 2014 move of year 7 into high school. The logic put forward by the government was that this was a part cohort due to the introduction of the prep year and that there was a need to move year 7 to come into line with other major states in preparation for the introduction of the national curriculum. Whilst those opposite like to tout their advertising agent’s slogan that the LNP is without policies, I remind the House that, just as I did with the Masters report, I gave a detailed response on how the LNP viewed the issues raised in Flying Start. </A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1018478"></A>
Although the move of year 7 was one of the central issues raised in that discussion paper, once again the government was found hopelessly unable to plan ahead or even think through the critical implications of the move. It does not surprise Queenslanders that this government cannot plan education because it has been unable to plan in almost every other area of life in this state. Moving year 7 would impact on tens of thousands of Queensland families, thousands of Queensland teachers and the education of our young students. The government’s dithering policy paralysis has failed Queensland schools. Government and non-government schools were ramping up for the move that this government foreshadowed, but now they have no idea what is happening. In the absence of any leadership from this government, some have even decided to go it alone.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018479"></A>
As the LNP has been urging the government to realise, Flying Start was a fatally flawed document. What has the government done since those warnings? It started off by indicating a 2014 move of grade 7 but never mentioned middle schooling or recurrent expenditure. It indicated an increase of over 50,000 students in Queensland high schools yet proposed only $350 million for capital works. That money, which is not new money, would be barely enough to fund non-government schools. It ignored completely the impact the move would have in remote and rural areas. This left Queensland high schools with the threat of serious overcrowding and an inadequate secondary teaching workforce. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018480"></A>
Anyone who heard the minister’s response to my question this morning and who had any confidence that this minister could grapple with the issues in education planning would have had those allusions exploded. In a three-minute answer, when he had the opportunity to tell Queensland schools what his government was doing, he did not even mention his plans in relation to year 7. In a puerile and personal attack on the opposition, never once did he mention what his government is going to do, even though hundreds of schools and thousands of parents are waiting to hear the answer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181220"></A>
The LNP has urged the government to get real about the proposal on year 7. We immediately issued a response to the government’s Flying Start paper. I issued a further paper, detailing our belief that middle schooling was an important part of dealing with the move of year 7. There is an urgent need for this government to clarify the amount of money that will be needed for capital works. Our estimate is that it will be in excess of $1 billion if we want to avoid serious overcrowding. There is an urgent need for the government to address the workforce issues of providing an extra 2,000 specialised high school teachers. There is an urgent need for the government to detail how it will assist people in rural and remote Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018481"></A>
The LNP has made it clear that, in government, we will allow this move to be driven by schools. There is an urgent need for the government to engage ACARA, to ensure that curriculum will not disadvantage Queensland students who might still be in year 7 in a primary school. At best, we think that a five-year move from 2015 is possible. </Hansard-Body>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110405_115724" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Capalaba--ALP) (11.57 am): As I have said before in the House, my electorate is nestled close to some of the most spectacular environmental assets in South-East Queensland. We are close to Moreton Bay and we have the benefits of parks, green space and wildlife. We are also close to some magnificent resources and assets, such as North Stradbroke Island. People in the Redlands want to look after their surroundings and we take great pride in our natural environment. In the Redlands, business leaders are reflecting that sentiment. </A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1018491"></A>
Many of our peak business organisations, such as the Redlands Institute and the Redlands Chamber of Commerce, have a keen interest in the role that businesses can play in becoming more sustainable. However, it is not just businesses in the Redlands that want to find ways to be more environmentally friendly. This desire is echoed by businesses right across the state. That is why the state government has invested millions of dollars in the ecoBiz program. The ecoBiz program is designed to help businesses make environmental and financial savings by implementing ecoefficient practices. It assists businesses to measure their current resource use, to identify the areas that can be improved and to help them to plan and implement ecoefficient and sustainable businesses practices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018493"></A>
Of the 600 businesses participating in the ecoBiz program, 84 have now completed the program and together they have saved more than 53,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions and 710 million litres of water. I am pleased to see that the state government recently congratulated six businesses that took part in the ecoBiz program. They were awarded for adopting innovative ways to save water, energy and overall costs at the recent Sunshine Coast Business Expo. One of those businesses was the Sunshine Coast TAFE, which has worked closely with the government to improve energy, water and waste efficiency. This has seen the Sunshine Coast TAFE reduce greenhouse gas emissions by almost 800 tonnes and running costs by over $180,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023366"></A>
As a partner to the program for many years, the Good Guys Capalaba, which is in my electorate and is run by James Brockhurst, has made great savings. By encouraging the sale of ecoefficient appliances they have reduced their customers’ energy consumption by 36 per cent and reduced greenhouse gas emissions through the sale of ecoefficient washing machines and air conditioners.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023372"></A>
Since 2005 James has been at the forefront of communicating sustainable product options to his customers while exercising responsible business operation efficiencies. James’s philosophy is very simple: businesses have a responsibility to provide a positive impact on their community, and the environment is a critical part of this. I concur with his business philosophy. This is a great example of a local business running an environmentally friendly and sustainable business. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023374"></A>
The ecoBiz program not only saves the environment but also saves businesses’ bottom lines. Last year ecoBiz partners across the state reduced their running costs by more than $5 million. On average, each partner has reduced its annual resource costs by 14 per cent, saving over $80,000 annually. They have achieved this by reducing energy consumption by an average of 20 per cent, water consumption by 31 per cent and waste generation by a whopping 45 per cent. Many businesses that have been part of the ecoBiz program are moving on to take leadership roles and work with the government’s ClimateSmart Business Clusters program, which aims to promote and drive ecoefficiency improvements in energy, water and material and waste management. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023378"></A>
I would also like to mention briefly the success of the Redlands energy conservation community. I am pleased to see that, due to the overwhelming success of the energy conservation community announced by the Premier last year, the service is now expanding across the Redlands to include all suburbs such as Alexandra Hills, the bay islands, Birkdale, Capalaba, North Stradbroke Island, Ormiston, Thornside and Wellington Point. Under the program, Energex installs small energy management devices onto air-conditioning units and pool filtration systems in participating homes which will cycle power between 4 pm and 8 pm on peak demand days. In my view, this is an excellent initiative. Ultimately, all these programs make good sense. More importantly, they are good for our community, for the environment and for our future generations. <Hansard-Speech-End>

We are now aware that the Metro South health service district faces a budget deficit of $90 million; the Royal Brisbane Hospital faces a deficit of some $60 million; the PA Hospital faces a deficit of some $34 million; and, as I understand, the Wide Bay health service district faces a budget blow-out of around 12 per cent. A memo signed by the chair of surgery at Princess Alexandra Hospital states--</A></Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1023393"></A>
To do this without compromise to the safety and quality of inpatients and the continued treatment of emergency cases, a number of unpalatable initiatives will be implemented. These will include a rotating roster of closure of some of our operating lists and beds in your wards with matched nursing staff reduction. These strategies will impact negatively on elective surgery waiting times, an outcome which I find “very disappointing” ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023394"></A>
There we have it: the chair of surgery at the Princess Alexandra Hospital is saying that surgery will be cut so that this government can get its budget back to a balanced state. This means that as time goes by there will be fewer operations, fewer elective surgery procedures and more people waiting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023395"></A>
It goes on and gets worse. In a memo dated 15 March 2011 the district chief executive officer of Metro South made this comment--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1023397"></A>
Queensland Health as a whole and Metro South within it have been amassing structural debt for quite sometime. The time has certainly come to address this by realignment and reform from top to bottom. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023398"></A>
I could not agree more. Reform is required within Queensland Health, and it has to start with the removal of this government, which has been so incompetent and so negligent as to deliver a health system that is crippled at its core and simply is not able to deliver effective, timely and efficient service to people across this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023399"></A>
I also quote from a memo dated 21 March 2011 and signed by the acting executive director of Oral Health Services in the Metro South health service district, dealing with the issue of dental treatments. The email is in direct response to Dr Theile’s earlier memorandum. In relation to the impact upon dental services, it states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1023403"></A>
... if measures need to be taken which increase the wait for services it may not be within our power to prevent. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023404"></A>
This means that there will be longer waiting times for dental surgery and dental treatment--at least in Metro South. I have no doubt that this will translate right across the state so that the 108,000 people waiting for dental treatment will simply now have to wait longer. In the past six or seven years this government has spent something like $40 billion on the health system. And after all that, we are now seeing massive budget blow-outs and, more importantly, delays in elective surgery and patients receiving treatment on time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023406"></A>
Perhaps the most damning indictment of the public health system actually comes from Justice Ros Atkinson, in comments reportedly made recently in relation to an appeal against a sentence on the grounds that the defendant’s health had not been taken into account. The defendant had pleaded that his health should have been considered and a reduced sentence determined. As reported in the media, Justice Atkinson said that in her experience prisoners with medical conditions were often better in jail because of the treatment they received. The report then quotes the justice as saying--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

In one case I knew of a man who would have died but for being in prison. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Perhaps we will have a better idea when we receive the answer to a question on notice that I asked the minister on 8 March 2011 seeking details of how many doctors and nurses are employed within Queensland correctional facilities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023411"></A>
When we reach the point at which the prison system provides people with a better public health service, some serious questions have to be asked not just of this minister but also of the former health minister, the current Deputy Premier, and also the member for Stretton. These men have overseen a public health system debacle that resulted in the payroll system collapsing. Some $210 million has been spent to rectify a system which originally cost $69 million. After 12 years of Labor, we have a system with a massive budget blow-out and a system that does not deliver across the state on any informed basis. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The area I first visited was the emergency department, where I witnessed a number of patients going through various phases of the care process. There was a lot of activity and staff were fully absorbed in assessing patients according to the appropriate level of care needed and effectively providing medical attention to a large number of people, ranging from someone with unexplained aches and pains to someone requiring urgent surgery. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023422"></A>
I was absolutely engrossed watching how the emergency team process flowed so smoothly, even to the extent that some patients requiring surgery were taken to the operating theatre within seven minutes of undergoing their initial assessment. The emergency staff continue to refine and improve their processes in relation to best patient care and efficiency of operation to cut waiting times and so that ambulance paramedics can get back on the road and on with the job as quickly as possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023423"></A>
From there we scrubbed up and toured the operating theatres, which were all being utilised. I saw the highly skilled surgeons and staff undertaking a major prostate operation and then intensive pancreatic cancer surgery with the utmost care and attention to the patient, albeit I was at a safe distance. I heard some very sad and somewhat tragic stories in the ICU about various anonymous patients being treated who were involved in serious traffic accidents and someone who had serious burns to 80 per cent of their body brought about by injuries incurred while enjoying a favourite hobby with family members. The RBWH has an exceptional record in the successful treatment of serious burn injuries compared with many other leading countries. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs ATTWOOD:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I agree with the member for Brisbane Central. I met with a number of staff to discuss their roles and how they work together to ensure that everyone who needs treatment is able to receive it to the best of their abilities. They cannot and will not turn anyone away when they need help. Nor can they predict the number of people needing help every day. Flexibility in their processes and operations is absolutely paramount in this busy hospital.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023464"></A>
But the part of my visit that touched me the most was the walk through the neonatal unit. Tiny premature babies no bigger than my hand in some cases were being gently and lovingly cared for by skilled professional staff. It is just incredible and quite a miracle that during their three-month stay in most cases they grow to a normal size, overcoming the serious difficulties from birth to become part of a very happy and grateful family. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023465"></A>
This visit to the RBWH really opened my eyes to how well our health system works and its many great miracles and achievements. This is due, in the most part, to the dedication and commitment of the hospital’s highly trained medical profession, nursing and allied health professionals, and state-of-the-art facilities and equipment provided by the Queensland government. I witnessed the special areas where training and patient consultation by specialists was provided to regional hospitals via video-telelink. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023466"></A>
As the Parliamentary Secretary for Health, I am most disturbed by the fact that an estimated 80 per cent of people seeking help from our public hospital system are doing so because of illness or injury due to lifestyle issues. This is why the federal and state governments’ health reforms in relation to GP clinics and Medicare locals providing primary care for people in the community are an appropriate way to provide services in the future. </Hansard-Body>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110405_121225" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Maroochydore--LNP) (12.12 pm): Commuters are frustrated as they are caught in traffic jams several kilometres long and small businesses are hurting from loss of customers as regular road users avoid the AJ Wyllie Bridge over the North Pine River. I heard the Premier claiming this morning how quickly the government is responding to fix infrastructure damaged in the floods. Well, not in this area. The Premier did not mention any time frame to fix this problem bridge between Petrie and Lawnton. </A></Hansard-Body>

The government has taken this area for granted and grown complacent about the impact of the loss of these northbound lanes and has been slow to respond. It is three months since this critical link over the North Pine River was damaged in the floods, halving the capacity of this very busy road with only the southbound lanes able to be utilised for two lanes of traffic. The impact has been made worse due to the fact that the other local alternative route is via Youngs Crossing, and it is flood prone. When water is released from North Pine Dam, this road is closed. This community really has suffered a double whammy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023484"></A>
In addition, motorists from Dayboro do not even get the courtesy of a ‘road closed’ sign near that town to warn them that further down the road Youngs Crossing is closed. That is another issue, but it is worth mentioning as it is an example of how the state government and its agencies need to step up to the plate and help the community. As well as delivering a new bridge, in the meantime there is a need to help with better traffic management. This should also include the community of Dayboro and district to give them fair warning of road closures closer to home so they can take an alternative route. </Hansard-Body>

 Well that is the only provision within the standing orders. The minister only announced the decision to replace the AJ Wyllie Bridge after public uproar about the fact that it had been so slow to respond. Our candidates, Trevor Ruthenberg and Seath Holswich, together with the community, publicly lobbied for action. However, I share their concern that more needs to be done by the government to help this community. We want to see more from the government--some compassion and support for this community and its local businesses, help with traffic management and the fast-tracking of the bridge’s replacement. The delay in announcing a replacement has no doubt slowed down this process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023499"></A>
A new bridge is good news, but we want to see more done to bring the construction of a new bridge forward and to address these critical issues that I have mentioned. Three months have passed since the northbound lanes were closed. This has a huge ongoing impact on this community. The traffic chaos continues for the people in this area. We will stand up, along with this community, and advocate for more to be done, because these people are hurting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023500"></A>
The response from the government has been slow. But the impact on the people has been fast, with businesses and locals feeling the impact on their pay packets and their pockets. I want to draw the attention of the government again to the fact that people do not have many local alternatives. Youngs Crossing Road floods frequently, leaving this bridge as the only link to these communities, except for a very large diversion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023501"></A>
Action on the AJ Whyllie Bridge has been long overdue even before the floods. There has been concern about the fact that this old bridge has not seen the attention of government particularly in regard to timely maintenance. What we have seen as a result is a community that has been left stranded. They have been left in a situation of intolerable hardship and, for many of those businesses, there is a question mark over whether they will survive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023502"></A>
This area is one of the fastest growing regions in Australia and the residents are tired of the inadequate transport infrastructure. They are tired of the fact that this government has been so slow to respond. We need to see a faster response in addressing these valid concerns, and more needs to be done than what has been announced to date. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110405_121824" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Morayfield--ALP) (12.18 pm): This Queensland Labor government continues to invest in our teaching professionals and in educational opportunities for our young people and continues to support initiatives which provide our kids with a flying start to their education. Last month I was very pleased to welcome the Minister for Education to the Morayfield state electorate for a Queensland-wide announcement at the Morayfield East State School. This announcement related to the establishment of four new teacher education centres of excellence, including one at the Morayfield East State School. These teacher education centres of excellence are about further enhancing the great work that our teachers are doing every day in our schools. </A></Hansard-Body>

Most people will remember from their schooling days that one teacher who changed their lives, that one teacher who connected with them, that one teacher who inspired them to reach their full potential. I was lucky--I had Mr Voss in physics, Mr Taylor in modern history and Ms Wilkins in English encouraging me to seize the educational opportunities before me. These centres of excellence are about developing more Mr Vosses, more Mr Taylors and more Ms Wilkinses. These centres of excellence are about supporting our teacher graduates to become outstanding teacher professionals who have the potential to change our young people’s lives. What a worthy vision that is. By investing in our teaching professionals we invest in our young people and, in turn, we invest in the future of our communities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023547"></A>
The Morayfield East State School will be the base for the Morayfield cluster schools centre of excellence. This means that not only will Morayfield East State School benefit from this significant investment in teacher training and excellence but Morayfield State School, Minimbah State School, Morayfield State High School and Jinibara State School will also benefit. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023550"></A>
Each teacher education centre of excellence will focus on a specific area of teacher training excellence. For instance, the centre at Kelvin Grove State College will focus on early childhood education and the middle phase of learning. The one at Morayfield East State School will focus on improved student performance in low socioeconomic areas. The Mount Stuart cluster schools centre of excellence will focus on Indigenous students and community engagement. The centre at Aspley State Special School will focus on special school education. The one at Benowa state and state high schools will focus on science and mathematics education. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023556"></A>
As noted by Professor Geoff Masters in his review of the education system in Queensland, we know that there is a strong connection between excellent teacher training, effective teaching and student outcomes. These centres will help us attract and train the best teachers for our schools and will help us continue to offer a world-class quality education to all of Queensland’s young people. These centres will partner clusters of Queensland state schools with Queensland universities to ensure high-performing pre-service teachers are classroom ready and are trained in specific targeted priority education disciplines. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023558"></A>
I am very proud that this Queensland Labor government is significantly investing in teacher excellence and educational opportunities for our young people. But some people may still ask: why do governments invest in education? Well, the answer is very easy. This Queensland Labor government invests in programs like the Teacher Education Centres of Excellence program because this government believes in people. This government believes in the potential of young people. This government believes that education is everything; that education is the silver bullet that breaks the cycle of disadvantage and marginalisation. By investing in education, we invest in the potential of our young people. By investing in our young people, we invest in the future of our communities. That is why governments should invest in education. That is why this Queensland Labor government is investing in teacher education centres of excellence. </Hansard-Body>

I would like to take this opportunity to formally congratulate Dr Brian Gray, the principal of Morayfield East State School; Ms Janelle Amos, the principal of Morayfield State High School; Ms Vicky Gahan, the principal of Morayfield State School; Mr Mark Farwell, the principal of Minimbah State School; Mr Brad Fox, the acting principal of Jinibara State School; and teachers Ms Jodie Riek and Ms Sandra Doyle-Robinson for their efforts in respect of the Morayfield schools cluster centre of excellence.

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110405_122335" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Nanango--Ind) (12.23 pm): I rise to bring to the attention of the House the concerns of people in the Nanango electorate with regard to health services in general but particularly the renal dialysis service in Kingaroy. As members would be aware, over the last few years the people of the South Burnett have fought hard to endeavour to have a renal dialysis service established in the Kingaroy Hospital. Members can imagine how pleased we were when in 2008 then health minister Stephen Robertson announced that we would get such a facility in the area. </A></Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023569"></A>
As members would be aware, our main concern at the time was that so many renal dialysis patients had to travel to Toowoomba and further afield to get their treatment. Some of those patients had to travel well in excess of three hours to get treatment. Some live an hour from Kingaroy and had to make the trip to Toowoomba. They would leave very early in the mornings and it was fairly late in the evening when they got back home--seven, eight or nine o’clock in some cases. It was a very arduous and long trip.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023570"></A>
We were pleased to get this renal unit at Kingaroy. The minister said at the time that there would be $603,000 in recurrent funding each year to ensure the renal unit delivers a sustainable service. Everyone was happy. It is quite distressing to find out that at this point in time the unit is not operating to its full potential. It is only operating three days a week. It is my understanding that it only treats six patients per day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023571"></A>
It is distressing to hear that approximately five renal patients are still having to travel to Toowoomba for their treatment. Given the recent floods and the damage that has been done to the roads in the area that trip is now a lot more difficult than it was before. I would not think there would be a person who would think that all patients in the area should not be treated at the unit at the Kingaroy Hospital. Why is the unit not operating at least five days a week? Is that because there is not sufficient funding? If that is the case, we would ask that funding be supplied. Is it because there are insufficient trained staff able to operate that machinery? If that is the case, we would ask that extra emphasis be placed on obtaining staff to operate the service. It is a great unit and we are more than pleased to have it, but we would like to ensure that anybody in the South Burnett region who requires renal dialysis is able to access their treatment at this hospital. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023573"></A>
It has recently been brought to my attention that the Cherbourg renal unit is no longer operating. I will be asking the minister to check this out for me. It is an essential service in that town. It should not be sitting idle. The reasons for that I am not sure about. The matter needs to be investigated. There is no point having this kind of service inoperable. It is not a cheap service. The equipment is quite expensive and it needs to be utilised to its full extent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023574"></A>
I would ask the minister to ensure that the South Burnett renal dialysis service operates fully at least five days a week and that it services all patients in the area. I would ask the minister to clarify exactly why the Cherbourg renal unit is not operating at all. I have sought information from the health service in the South Burnett. I am looking forward to positive outcomes for both these units so that they can service the patients that need this service. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The Gold Coast University Hospital project and the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project are two projects that will transform the Gold Coast. Both are key election commitments of the state Labor government. Construction works and early works that can be seen underway now demonstrate this government’s commitment to investing in the Gold Coast as well as delivering key infrastructure projects that create jobs and stimulate our economy. </A></Hansard-Body>

Recently I attended a briefing on the progress of the rapid transit project that included a bus tour of the early works. A number of key stakeholders also attended, including business industry representatives, Griffith University staff and local councillors. The bus tour and briefing took us to where stage 1 of the light rail system begins its journey--the most northerly point of Parklands Drive. It is here at the rapid transit’s Gold Coast University Hospital station shell construction that the size of these two major projects can be seen and the future of the health and knowledge precinct can be visualised. This precinct will become one of the largest transit oriented developments on the Gold Coast and provide a major public transport interchange linking the highly populated northern Gold Coast to the key activity centres of Southport, Surfers Paradise and Broadbeach. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181245"></A>
There are two light rail stations planned for this precinct--the Gold Coast University Hospital station and the Griffith University station. Construction of the Griffith University station is currently underway and near completion. This work has been called the station shell as it includes the roof, floor and walls that will support the future station structure. I was pleased to learn that 80 per cent of contractors working on this site are locally based and the project has spent almost $18 million in the local community sourcing labour and materials. This work is being done now so as to be completed in conjunction with the opening of the Gold Coast University Hospital, therefore creating no impact or disruption to the operators of the new hospital and its patients and visitors.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023617"></A>
The Gold Coast University Hospital will offer all services currently offered at the existing hospital site plus new and expanded services that will greatly reduce the number of Gold Coast patients required to travel to Brisbane for treatment. New services that will be offered include cancer radiotherapy, neonatal intensive care, trauma response and a full suite of public cardiology and cardiac services for the people of the Gold Coast. The emergency department will be significantly expanded. There will be additional delivery suites, birth centre rooms and a special-care nursery. There will be extended mental health services and the number of operating theatres will increase from nine to 16, with the capacity for more. Support services such as intensive care, pharmacy, radiology and pathology will also be expanded. The hospital will be ideally located with the private hospital and specialist suites on-site and adjacent to Griffith University. Not only will the precinct provide future generations of doctors, nurses and allied health staff with the opportunity to learn their speciality in a hands-on, state-of-the-art facility; it will also attract graduates and experienced staff to work, teach and undertake research on the Gold Coast.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023625"></A>
It is a fact that this Bligh government’s funded $1.76 billion Gold Coast University Hospital will grow to become a nationally and internationally recognised centre for innovative medical research and health care. As this government is delivering on our promises, the opposition is being led by a candidate who is not a member of parliament and by an interim leader in the House. It is being led by an interim leader who is flip-flopping on announcements and scrapping policy that it had--and given the length of time that it has been here, it has not developed much! These projects that I have spoken about are yet another example of the Bligh government working for Queensland, planning and investing for our future. The Bligh government is getting on with the job. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Therefore, we in the opposition are still resolving a number of issues and seeking answers to a number of questions from this morning.

As the bill deals with revenue, I thought it would be interesting to actually reflect on the state of the state’s revenue. It is truly the case that this is the biggest taxing, biggest spending government in this state’s history, and in terms of being the biggest taxing government in this state’s history it seems to be proud of it. Revenue is going up to almost $42 billion this year, revised up in the midyear fiscal and economic review. But revenue going up is not alone. It is not Robinson Crusoe, because not only is revenue increasing but expenses are also increasing, up by over a billion dollars to $43.3 billion, resulting in, under the hands of this long-term Labor government, a deficit of $1.5 billion--another operating loss from the government that lost the AAA credit rating, a government that imposed a fuel tax on motorists throughout Queensland, a government that increased registration charges between 17 per cent and 23 per cent, a government that increased tolls on toll roads by 33 per cent before attempting to sell off the toll roads and a sale that it said it would not undertake.</Hansard-Body>

 Because we are debating the Revenue and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, I thought it would be appropriate to talk about the revenue. We are dealing with the Revenue and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, so let us talk about the revenue, which is going up, as I said, to $42 billion this year--boosting up year after year as the biggest taxing government this state has ever seen continues its rapacious reach into the pockets of the taxpayers of Queensland, whether it be through land tax, another issue that is being dealt with in this bill, or transfer duty, another issue that is being dealt with in this bill. Revenue is being continually seized by this government as it tries vainly to balance the books.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027045"></A>
How much is that revenue going to be this year? This year, payroll tax will be almost $3 billion. Transfer duty is down a little bit this year because of the restrained business conditions brought about by the government’s ineptitude and its mismanagement of the economy. Transfer duty is down by $300 million--down to $1.9 billion. But land tax is still going very nicely--‘Thank you very much,’ says Mr Fraser--at $1.052 billion. Motor vehicle registration duty is increasing to $1.3 billion this year. So when we are looking at a revenue bill that deals with those aspects of revenue, I think it is important that we put it in the context of this large-taxing, large-spending government--this government that lost the AAA credit rating before the global financial crisis and before the cyclones, storms and floods that hit our state. This is a revenue grab of the like not seen in Queensland’s history, a revenue grab by a government that cannot control its expenditure--unlike a government that will be led by Campbell Newman that will save money and deliver more by getting action on the basics and cutting waste. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1027046"></A>
The bill repeals 11 acts. It repeals some redundant legislation and legislation that has not been effectively used for some considerable time now. The Debits Tax Repeal Act 2005 is repealed, it having achieved its purpose. It is one of the acts that was put in place following the introduction of the new tax system--the GST--that has delivered so much for the states and delivered so much for Australia. It was effectively a review and a revision of the tax system brought in by the Liberal-National coalition at the federal level--and opposed every step of the way, of course, by the Labor Party at that stage. That act is no longer required as all outstanding debits tax matters are being wound up and there are no more matters to be dealt with under that particular piece of legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027049"></A>
Similarly, the Tobacco Products (Licensing) Act is also repealed. That act provided for the collection of licence fees from tobacco wholesalers. I mentioned before about revenue being gathered as a result of the repeal of the fuel subsidy by this government after the last election. Of course, that subsidy was brought about because of legislation like the Tobacco Products (Licensing) Act. The case of Ha v State of New South Wales found that the recovery of those types of licence fees was, in fact, unconstitutional. As a result, governments had to change their position. So tobacco licensing fees could not be collected from wholesalers in a similar way that petroleum licence fees could not be collected. So under the National-Liberal coalition at the time a scheme was put in place, with the concurrence of the federal coalition at that stage, to make sure that motorists were remitted to them through the petrol pump eight and a bit cents per litre so that they were not going to have a tax on them. Of course, that situation has now changed under this government, which is now imposing a new fuel tax. But this is the type of legislation that led to that particular change occurring. </Hansard-Body>

A number of bank acts are repealed: the Advance Bank Integration Act, the Bank Integration (Bank of Queensland) Act and a number of others, including the Bank of South Australia Act, the Bank of New Zealand Act and the Challenge Bank Act. Special legislation was required to bring all of those acts together when those banks were merged during the 1990s when bank consolidation was occurring. Those acts have achieved their purpose and are now no longer required. They all had 20-year sunset clauses in them. We are repealing them sooner than the 20 years that was required.</Hansard-Body>

The Iconic Queensland Places Act 2008 is being rolled into the Sustainable Planning Act following a 2010 review. We all remember the lengthy debates that were held in this place when forced council amalgamations occurred against the will of many of those councils involved and really in direct contradiction of promises that were given about the Size, Shape and Sustainability process that had been implemented previously. It was a breach of trust and a breach of faith with the people of Queensland by the then Beattie government. A number of places were identified as being iconic. Noosa was one of those. The amalgamation was going to particularly affect the view of the people of Noosa in terms of their particular little piece of paradise that they occupy for which they are responsible, which is quite different from the rest of the Sunshine Coast and is regarded by many people, both north and south of the divide of the old Noosa shire council, as being an iconic part of the Sunshine Coast. This legislation was a sop that was provided to try to, I guess, buy off those local concerned residents. Of course, as we know, it has failed and it is now being shown to be the complete waste of time, energy and effort that it always was. Not surprisingly, the 2010 review said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027063"></A>
... the iconic place development assessment panels were found to not be the most effective mechanism for the protection of iconic values. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027064"></A>
That is not surprising, because in the debate of the original bill in 2008 we on this side of the House warned about that. In that debate we said that we would continue to maintain the right to scrutinise how these panels operate. We said that the solution was just a watered-down version of the respective councils, which the amalgamations destroyed in the first place. They were weak and ineffectual, which is not surprising from a government that was so badly out of touch with its constituents that it took the stance of ignoring the wishes of communities that were just trying to protect their way of life. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181255"></A>
The original assessment panel that was outlined in that legislation was nothing more than a Clayton’s council--the council you have when you cannot vote for your own. That is what the panels suggested by the iconic places legislation were--a reduced council, not elected by the people and for the people, but appointed by the minister and subject to all the vagaries of a political appointment process. The legislation was not designed to help local communities. It was only meant to provide a political solution. Again, this legislation is a clear example of a long-term Labor government that is more concerned about protecting its political reputation than it is about governing for Queenslanders. So we will be supporting the removal of the iconic places legislation. It should never have been put in place in the first place. It was a bad piece of legislation put forward by an out-of-touch government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027066"></A>
The New Tax System Price Exploitation Code (Queensland) Act is being repealed. It was a transitional provision that was put in place as part of the move to the goods and services tax. That role was taken over by the ACCC and has not been in place and necessary since 2002. So that legislation is no longer necessary.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027067"></A>
I turn now to the amendments to the Duties Act, which deal with a number of legislative changes to bring various parts of the duties legislation regime into line with that of other states to clean up any anomalies that have been found to be in the legislation either through court cases or investigation by the Commissioner of State Revenue and through other areas. So there are some changes in relation to the vesting of a principal place of residence. So rather than just a straight transfer of property, where a court orders property to vest in one party, that process would normally be subject to transfer duty. This legislation provides an exemption from transfer duty on land pursuant to that vesting order. That is an issue that was not foreseen in the original legislation but there have been sufficient examples of that occurring to warrant the change to make sure that no extra duty is payable in circumstances where there is a vesting, for example in a Family Court order being made. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027069"></A>
There is a provision for special disability trusts. I think that is an issue that is much more relevant to people these days as we look at a national disability insurance scheme and the ongoing problem of an ageing population, particularly in relation to ageing parents with disabled children and how provision is made to look after them in the future. There is now a provision for special disability trusts and there are certain tax concessions so that property transferred into a special disability trust will be exempt from duty, which I must say is a very good thing. The worry and concern that many people have about how they are going to deal with people who have a disability of some sort is enormous and, as I am sure many members will know, has to be seen to be believed. So being able to reduce some of the burden so that special disability trusts can be put in place so that property, particularly a house, can be vested in them to provide for people with disabilities in the future, I think, is a very worthwhile amendment and a change to the duties legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029840"></A>
The transaction that creates the trust for the acquisition of an eligible home that will be the principal place of residence for a person with a disability will be exempted from that duty. It defines an eligible home as a place that will be used or is used as the principal place of residence for the beneficiary of the trust. And there is no restriction on the co-occupation of the property by other people, so family who are necessary to help look after the person with a disability can live there and not lose the benefit of the exemption to it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029841"></A>
The other provision in relation to duties is in relation to the transfer of modified vehicles for people with a disability. Transfer duty is paid on the value of the vehicle. When vehicles are modified to provide that they are able to be driven by people with disabilities it increases the value and the transfer duty would normally be payable on that increased value. Under an administrative arrangement that has been in place for some time now, that extra duty has not been paid. This brings the law into line with those administrative arrangements and just charges the duty on the value of the vehicle prior to modifications so that people are paying the same duty as those of us who do not require a special modification. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029842"></A>
There are some changes to duty on Indigenous land use transfers. When an ILUA--an Indigenous land use agreement--is made and it transfers land back to Indigenous people there will be some exemptions from duty if it is used for residential or community purposes. That is put in place with some conditions about satisfying the Commissioner of State Revenue about some of those changes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029843"></A>
There are provisions that deal with the transport legislation to provide for some nominal condition for vehicles that only use the roads for a limited purpose. If a person has a farm vehicle that only needs to go on the road to move from one paddock to another or an industrial vehicle that only needs to move from one work site to another, there is a provision in the legislation for a $25 nominal duty to be paid. We would certainly support that. That change is brought about by the expiry of the Transport Operations (Road Use Management--Vehicle Registration) Regulation and its replacement in 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029844"></A>
There are some changes in relation to the provisions of cancelled transfers and cancelled contracts. What happens quite often, particularly with off-the-plan sales, is that a unit is bought by someone who holds it during the course of construction and then that person enters into a subsequent contract to sell it, taking a profit in the middle--flicking, if you like, the interest on. Those people often can make a profit and one of the ways to deal with some of the things that occur, particularly the instance of duty, is that contracts are cancelled and replaced with new contracts. This provision provides that where that sort of thing occurs between related persons there is a dutiable instrument that can be appropriately charged when those transfers are cancelled. That ensures that the revenue is protected on the way through. We do not mind people making a profit provided they pay the appropriate duty that everyone else is obliged to pay. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029845"></A>
There are some provisions in relation to change of trustee duties which bring the surrender of an interest under a trust into the provisions of the duties regime in the same way that the acquisitions of interest are. That is just bringing it in for consistency and again is a revenue partition matter. There are some other changes in relation to partitions of property and also some changes in relation to punitive measures for self-assessors. These days most stamp or transfer duty is assessed by lawyers or accountants in their offices. They do most of it in their office without having to go through the inestimable pleasure of traipsing down to the stamps office which used to be the case. One would have to take a cheque and pay it down there. One can do it in the office now and transfer it through. There are some minor mistakes and errors that sometimes occur. It is not necessary to prosecute people in those instances but simply to hit them up with a fine to remind them of their obligations and to make sure that they do go about doing their assessments in the right fashion and in the right manner. That just widens the power of the commission to act administratively rather than go through the court system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029846"></A>
There are some changes to family trust concessions to remove the commissioner’s discretion and to set out in black and white those instances when a concession is allowed and those instances when a concession is not allowed. It removes it from the discretion of the commissioner. There is an longstanding principle, if I remember my old tax law days, that it would be better to have all the rules in relation to exemptions and commissioners’ discretions removed and have it clearly set out in black and white so that people can understand exactly what it is and order their affairs appropriately. I think this is a step down that path to make sure that the rules are clear and clearly understood.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029847"></A>
There are still some outstanding issues in relation to some aspects of trusts, particularly testamentary trusts--transfers of interest in trusts under wills where there are some unintended consequences that in a certain light could look like a death duty on a transfer. I know that some of these matters have been referred to the Treasurer’s office. I think those matters still need to be resolved satisfactorily. I understand that there is still some work being done by the commissioner’s office in relation to resolving those issues. There are not many of them, but I think the intention is there not to tax transfers of interest in trusts under testamentary dispositions. I think that still needs to be dealt with. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029848"></A>
There are some changes to the First Home Owner Grant Act to extend the provisions for clawback in case someone does not fulfil the conditions for the first home owner grant and extend those for consistency with the existing provisions of the revenue legislation for recovery of concessions that have been allowed. So if someone does not fulfil their conditions the commissioner has up to five years to recover the appropriate amount of duty. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029850"></A>
There have been some changes to the Land Tax Act which are beneficial to taxpayers in relation to timing, particularly when there have been reassessments. There has been a change to the Queensland Competition Authority Act--that old friend of the Treasurer’s and mine that we often talk about in dulcet tones. I think administrative orders are being put in place to allow more than just the Treasurer or the Premier to give directions to the QCA. I see the Treasurer nodding willingly as he parcels that one off to the Minister for Finance--to allow the Minister for Finance to give some instruction and direction to the Queensland Competition Authority--and I am sure that the Premier will be equally excited at the ability to move that off to someone else to allow those administrative arrangements.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029853"></A>
There are substantial changes to the South East Queensland Water (Restructuring) Act. I am sure that the member for Callide will be having something to say about those arrangements. It is no secret that the LNP opposition thinks the arrangements put in place for South-East Queensland water restructuring were a complete dog’s breakfast. We said at the time that there were going to be increases in costs. We said that it was going to cost water consumers more. In fact, the head of the Queensland Water Commission said that prices would be going up by 147 per cent. They have been going up and they continue to go up, and this government seems to remain powerless to resolve it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

The government has announced some changes to the structure of the bulk water supply authorities. That is what this piece of legislation is. It is about establishing a capacity to introduce a regulation to transfer assets from the various bulk water suppliers. So WaterSecure, which is the subject of this particular action or activity, will be merged and its assets will transfer to South East Queensland Water--Seqwater--for operation. That was announced by the government in late 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029855"></A>
What is interesting is that during the briefing we received this morning the amount of savings was unable to be identified. One question that I would ask the Treasurer is: what are the savings expected to be as a result of the merger of these two entities? It is not so much about what impact that would have on the price down at the consumer end but more about what the actual saving would be because, presumably, it is getting rid of rented premises or occupation costs, fixed overheads, the board of directors and a number of other people. So what are the actual savings that will materialise as a result of moving WaterSecure into Seqwater? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029856"></A>
Then, what are the additional obligations that are being picked up by Seqwater? WaterSecure operates the Tugun desalination plant. So what happens to the rights and responsibilities and the liabilities and warranties particularly in relation to the Tugun desalination plant and the obligations if there are things that need to be fixed as a result? Where do those obligations fall and who is responsible for them? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029857"></A>
The other interesting thing is in relation to the protection of employees of WaterSecure. Those under certified agreements will be given protection from redundancies for three years; those under common law agreements will not. It is certainly easy to see the government’s ideology in that respect--that is, there is no interest in looking after all employees, only employees under certified agreements no doubt negotiated with their mates in the union. Those who choose to exercise their own decision-making process and enter common law contracts will be the ones for the chop under a rationalisation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029858"></A>
The bill will facilitate the merger of WaterSecure with Seqwater by 1 July 2011. We would like to see the costs of that as well as the savings. Future changes will also include Wyaralong Dam, the Northern Pipeline Interconnector stage 2 along with the western corridor assets. </Hansard-Body>

I highlighted how much has been raised through increased taxes and charges. I spoke about the South East Queensland Water (Restructuring) Act. I indicated that the water restructuring program eventually put in place by this government was a farce that led to increases in water charges for South-East Queensland consumers and I spoke of the obvious dissatisfaction and unhappiness that is displayed by everyone who gets a water bill these days. I spoke about how the proposal to amend the South East Queensland Water (Restructuring) Act to provide for the amalgamation of WaterSecure and Seqwater was an acknowledgement by the government that it had got it so spectacularly wrong when it put it in place three years ago.</A></Hansard-Body>

 The bill will incorporate transitional provisions for the proposed merger of Seqwater and WaterSecure, including a statutory exemption from transfer duties. Thank goodness for that. At least the poor old consumer will not have to pay again for the mistakes of this long-term Labor government. I covered the certified agreement for employees and the difference in the way that certified agreement employees will be treated as opposed to those employed under common law contracts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036749"></A>
The legislation will also allow for the dissolution of WaterSecure upon the completion of the transfer of its assets, liabilities and employees to Seqwater. Interestingly, it will remove the existing restriction on the number of directors who may be appointed to that board, which is currently limited to five. One has to wonder what justification there would be for appointing extra directors to manage the assets. Certainly it has been said that, because there will be more complex assets to be managed, there will be a need for more expertise in relation to the assets that are being transferred. Currently Seqwater deals with dams, and the merger with WaterSecure will mean that it will also deal with processed water plants, particularly the Tugun desalination plant. One would hope that the board will not double in size because of that. I presume the board will be absorbed into the running of Seqwater and that the controls over the cost of that area will be dealt with. </Hansard-Body>

The bill deals with the urban water arrangements for areas outside South-East Queensland. Currently, those urban water arrangements are being reviewed by the Department of Environment and Resource Management. Some of the obligations on councils outside the South-East Queensland corner will be lifted in relation to their water management plans, whether it is a leakage management plan to control leakage or an outside water use plan for parks and gardens. Circumstances have changed. Obviously we are not in the position that we were in three years ago when Queensland was facing a water supply crisis because of the inability of this long-term Labor government to actually manage water supplies effectively, which meant that all of those water restrictions had to be put in place. </Hansard-Body>

 The truth hurts them. They squeal when they get pricked by having the truth revealed to them. The reality is that if this long-term Labor government had better managed the water supply and built and planned for the future, instead of living for the moment as it always does, if it had worked for Queenslanders instead of working for itself, we would not have had nearly the number of water problems that South-East Queensland suffered from 2005 to 2007. However, now that the rains have fallen, the dams are full and the water security situation is so different, the government is removing some of the more draconian regulations that it was forced to put in place because of its earlier failures. I am sure that the member for Callide will have something to say about some of those issues. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1036754"></A>
Other changes proposed by the legislation relate to a simplification of the payroll tax regime. This year, payroll tax will collect almost $3 billion. It is one of the major sources of income for the state. There are some requirements to bring it into harmony with provisions occurring in the rest of Australia. We are happy to see those provisions made, to clarify and simplify some of the exemptions. The bill also deals with some fringe benefit issues and how they are to be treated for the purposes of calculating payroll tax. It brings Queensland into line with the rest of Australia. The bill also deals with some of the grouping provisions and some of the more complex arrangements that occur over time and that impact on thresholds for the payment of payroll tax. </Hansard-Body>

The bill amends the Aboriginal Land Act to deal with areas of national parks on the Cape York Peninsula. Other members on this side will address those issues, including the transfer of land and the provision of arrangements to allow for Aboriginal management to take place in some of those national parks. In the briefing this morning I asked some questions about how that would occur--whether there had been arrangements or agreements entered into with local Indigenous groups and whether funding had been provided to enable appropriate management plans to be put in place and to enable them to carry out activities that will be required under those agreements. Just after the lunch break I received advice from the ministerial officers that appropriate arrangements would be put in place and that agreements had been put in place. As I said, other members on this side will address that particular issue. </Hansard-Body>

The bill proposes changes to the legislation for the Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association to deal with its status as a charitable institution and to provide it with certain benefits. One of the problems is that currently the legislation allows for it to be wound up by resolution of the members and to distribute what is left over to the members, which is contrary to the normal arrangements for incorporated associations. Normally, incorporated associations have to provide that, on a winding-up, their assets are transferred to an organisation with similar objects and purposes. The bill deals with that issue, however long may the RNA continue in operation. </Hansard-Body>

The bill makes some changes to the Local Government and City of Brisbane acts. One of those changes will bring together the local government superannuation scheme and the scheme administered by the City of Brisbane for its employees, City Super. Although I do not have confirmation of this, I understand that the employees covered by both superannuation schemes have voted to approve the merger of the two schemes and that there are no objections from the members to the merger of those two entities. That follows some changes and recommendations made in the federal review of superannuation. Members will remember that last year that report was released and it dealt with that. </Hansard-Body>

I have said in this parliament many times before that one of the great legacies of this Labor government will be the water supply system that it has inflicted upon people in South-East Queensland, a water supply system that will result in people living in South-East Queensland being saddled with the financial burden for generations to come that is a direct result of the failure, the mismanagement and the short-sightedness of this Labor government that for 12 years now has sat on the government benches. One of its great legacies will be the water bills that every Queenslander will receive for generations to come. There is very little that can be done to correct that. This particular bill seeks to make what is a supportable change--a change that we will support--but it is a very small change. It is a very small manipulation, a very small recognition, that the whole system that the government put in place has become a financial burden for the people of South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039628"></A>
It is interesting to see what is in the explanatory notes that accompany the bill. One of the paragraphs states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1039630"></A>
In September 2007, the Queensland Government approved a range of institutional reforms to be implemented across the South East Queensland (SEQ) urban water sector. These reforms addressed a number of critical shortfalls in the urban water supply arrangements, and coincided with the establishment of the SEQ Water Grid. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039631"></A>
I think that the term ‘the water grid’ is a term that will live in infamy and will become one of the notable legacies of this Labor government. The water grid was a political construct. It was a concept that was built in the mind of the former Premier, Premier Beattie, and in the mind of the ministers responsible at the time. It was a concept that was built to address a political problem. It was a concept that was built to defend the government against the quite justified attacks that it was experiencing from water users in South-East Queensland about the way it had failed to meet its responsibility to provide the required water infrastructure to ensure a reliable and economic source of water for domestic and industrial use in South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039634"></A>
We had a water crisis in 2006 and 2007 and these reforms were put in place in September 2007. Just three years later, we are here again in this parliament changing those institutional reforms, seeking to wind back some of the reforms that were put in place. As I said, those reforms were all about politics. They were all about creating the perception in the public’s mind that somehow or other this mythical creature called ‘a water grid’ was going to solve the problems that had become so apparent because of the years of government mismanagement. Of course it did not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039635"></A>
What it did was load the water supply system with a capital cost that will mean that water bills in South-East Queensland will be horrendously high for generations to come. That capital cost is built into the water supply infrastructure that is there now. It is very difficult to put an accurate figure on it. The most accurate figure is the one that I heard one of the mayors from South-East Queensland using a couple of days ago when he said that there are $4 billion worth of assets that water users of South-East Queensland are paying interest and redemption on that are contributing nothing to the water supply in South-East Queensland. There is $4 billion worth of assets that the water users are paying for that are contributing nothing. That figure clearly illustrates the extent to which the whole management of the water supply system in South-East Queensland will become one of the more infamous legacies of this government when it is dispatched to political history, as it so richly deserves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039641"></A>
The bill before the House seeks to combine two of the entities that were set up as part of that reform process. It was a reform process that had flow charts and diagrams. It looked something like a snakes and ladders game, trying to determine who was responsible for what. It was typical Labor bureaucracy: set up a complicated bureaucracy, give a whole lot of people jobs, put in place a convoluted and complex process and produce very little. That is what Labor governments do. That is what Labor governments have done for the last hundred years: set up those sorts of complicated bureaucracies to cover its own failures and subsequently ensure that the people who depend on those services end up paying more for the services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039642"></A>
That is what this bill seeks to correct. It seeks to play around the edges, if you like, of that problem that was created. It seeks to allow for the proposed merger of the Queensland Manufactured Water Authority, or WaterSecure--one of those entities that was set up--and the Queensland Bulk Water Supply Authority, or Seqwater, which the government announced in late 2010. It is something that is certainly a small step in the right direction, but it does not make a significant impact on that huge capital cost structure that I spoke about earlier and that water users in South-East Queensland will come to recognise as one of the main contributors to those horrendous water bills that they will receive for many years to come. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039648"></A>
One of the great indicators, if you like, of how that cost structure contributes to those water bills--and it is only one of half a dozen examples that I could pick--was the executive salaries that were paid to the boards and the CEOs of these water entities that this bill seeks now to amalgamate. There was quite understandable public outrage when this matter received a deal of public attention earlier last year because some of the salaries that were involved were extraordinary, to say the least. We could take a few minutes to go through some of them as an example of just how this whole bloated bureaucracy that was put in place by the Labor government to solve its political problem has become a financial impost on water consumers in South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039650"></A>
The Queensland Water Commission, that great entity that many of us in this place have described over the years as a political shield for the Beattie Labor government--and that is what it was at the time--was an initiative to distance the government from its responsibilities. The Queensland Water Commission had five executives that were paid a total of $1.12 million in 2010, with one executive receiving over $300,000 in remuneration. It pays contractors and consultants another $5.6 million. All of that cost comes from the water bills that the people in suburban Brisbane and South-East Queensland pay. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039653"></A>
The SEQ Water Grid Manager had a total remuneration for three of its top executives of $929,000. The top executive in that bunch of three was paid $440,000 a year to manage the water grid. The board and committee remuneration for the water grid manager for that year was $246,500 with another $1.58 million paid in consultancies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039654"></A>
They are the sorts of costs that are impacting on the water bills of everybody in South-East Queensland. Seqwater, the organisation that will carry on from the amalgamation that is proposed in this legislation, has examples in a similar vein. The total remuneration for five of its executives was $1.42 million a year with the top executive remuneration being $480,000 per year. The board remuneration for salary, fees and super was $335,000 for the year. These are incredible salaries for what should be the delivery of an essential service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042581"></A>
WaterSecure, the entity that this bill seeks to amalgamate with Seqwater, has a total remuneration for six of its executives of $1.7 million, with the top executive remuneration being $520,000 per annum--$520,000 per annum for an executive of an organisation that this bill seeks to amalgamate with Seqwater. You have to wonder about the government, about the ministers, who allowed that sort of organisation to be set up three years ago. You have to wonder about the administrative skills of people who set up an organisation and pay somebody $520,000 to be its CEO and who three years later understand that it can be wound up--amalgamated with an organisation that already exists. What an absurdity! What a great indication of the administration skills of this Labor government. What a great indication of how this Labor government has failed. What a great indication of what Labor governments always do. They have done it for the last 100 years and, given the chance, they would do it for the next 100 years. That is what Labor governments are about: bloated bureaucracies, overpaid jobs for Labor mates and increased water bills for the people of South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042587"></A>
I have said it before in this place and I say it again: when the Premier gets around to finally calling an election, the people of South-East Queensland should take their water bills to the ballot box. They should take their water bills with them on polling day. They will never have a better how-to-vote card than the water bills they get in the mail, because the water bills that South-East Queenslanders get in the mail will be forever-telling evidence of the administrative skills and the capacity, or lack thereof, of the members who sit on the government benches and who deserve to be removed simply for this issue if for no other--no other than a half a dozen other examples that I could give. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042589"></A>
While we will support the amendment contained in the bill, the people of Queensland generally should always remember that it is but a small step towards rectifying the problem that the Labor government created. It is an admission--clear and simple, loud and plain--that the water grid and the water reform process that was put in place were flawed and have failed. Nobody knows that more than the people who pay their water bills in South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042591"></A>
I will move on to a couple of other parts of the bill that I believe are pertinent and worthy of some comment--that is, the amendments to the Local Government Act. The member for Clayfield, the shadow Treasurer, spoke about the amendments to the Local Government Act and the extent to which the local government amalgamation has been a failure and has created angst and concern right across Queensland. In the communities that I represent, I do not think there is another issue that has impacted so hard and for so long as the issue of the amalgamation of local governments. It is an issue that this Labor government and a lot of its ministers simply do not understand. They simply do not understand the impact that that amalgamation process had on the small communities I represent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042596"></A>
My electorate has some 22 small communities. In the case of North Burnett Regional Council, six shires were amalgamated into one. In the case of the Banana Shire Council, old shires were cut in half and tacked on one way or the other. In the case of the South Burnett Regional Council, five shires were amalgamated into one. The effect that has had on those communities is difficult to quantify. It has in many cases torn the heart and soul out of small communities. It has torn apart the fabric that made those small communities what they were. It is in many instances, I believe, impossible to reverse. I say that with great regret. While it should never have been done, it is probably impossible to reverse. But there has to be some effort put into trying to make the system work better, trying to make what we have now work for the benefit of those communities, because it is not working for them at the moment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042599"></A>
The Treasurer now holds a position different from the one he held when this amalgamation process was passed through this House. His position in the government now, I would suggest, provides an opportunity for him to correct some of the problems, to right some of the wrongs that have been inflicted upon regional communities by this amalgamation process. It is blindingly obvious that those communities want something done. A whole range of issues need to be addressed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042600"></A>
Firstly, in relation to the boundary issue--which is the direct subject of this legislation--there are a number of places where the need for boundary adjustments is plainly obvious to anyone who wants to look at it. There are a number of obvious examples of the boundaries set at the time of amalgamation being completely and utterly unsuitable. A classic example in my electorate is the way that the old Taroom shire was cut in half. The old Taroom shire, which was a great shire--it was a good example of how a local council can reinforce the fabric of a community--was chopped in half. The town of Taroom was tacked onto the Banana Shire Council and the town of Wandoan was tacked onto the Dalby Regional Council. Those people have never recovered from it, and it is situations like that that need to be addressed. While we cannot go back and repair all of the damage that has been done by this process, we can address issues like that.  </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042603"></A>
There are also, I believe, issues surrounding the empowerment of local councillors to properly represent their communities. I think the act and regulations have gone too far in restricting the ability of local councillors to properly represent their communities. I know that the member for Warrego, the shadow minister, will have more to say about that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042605"></A>
The other issue in this legislation relates to flood recovery. Parts of the Water Act will be amended to allow flood recovery works to proceed in a more timely way. That is certainly something that I would support. But I have to say that the whole issue of getting on with the job of flood recovery in relation to rural and regional roads is pitifully slow. There is frustration building right across regional Queensland with how red tape is choking and strangling local governments who are trying to get on with that flood recovery work, trying to return some of that road infrastructure to a more useable standard. It is difficult for people in large urban areas to understand the importance of road infrastructure to the industries and the people who live in regional areas. But that road infrastructure needs to be brought back to a standard that allows those industries to operate and that allows those people to get back to some sort of normal life. This part of the bill once again is only a very small step towards addressing those issues that are increasingly becoming a frustration for people right across my electorate. While we support the passage of this bill, it is an opportunity to highlight once again the failings of the Beattie-Bligh Labor government in so many areas. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110405_145850" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Warrego--LNP) (2.58 pm): I commend the member for Callide for the comments that he has made. They reflect the views of many Queenslanders. This legislation we are talking about today amends the South East Queensland Water (Restructuring) Act 2007. When we consider the enormous cost and effort that was put into the water grid by the government, there was no thought put into it. No real cost-benefit analysis was done. Anybody with a bobcat or a wheelbarrow got a Mack truck rate when this job was done. If the job had been done with more due diligence we would have found the cost for the ratepayers of this state and the water users of this state would have been dramatically less. When we look at what is happening in terms of water prices in South-East Queensland we see enormous price rises, outrageous price rises. As the member for Callide said, the voters of this state should take a water bill to the ballot box. That is no better demonstration of what this government has done to the costs of living in this state. It is not just water costs but the rates that councils are now charging people because they have to--</A></Hansard-Body>

 Exactly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045630"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOBBS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will go into more detail about that later. I recall being in this House when then Premier Beattie got up and talked about the way the water boards in this state were run. He had a map that had lines running everywhere. He said how complicated it was. It is much more complicated now the way the ALP has put things together. The legislation before us today attempts to break it down again and make things a little simpler. But, at the end of the day, it is still going to cost. It is going to cost more and more because those opposite have lumbered the water users of South-East Queensland with the $9 billion water grid. I do not think the people of this state can have any comfort in this legislation reducing the cost of living. Nearly everything that has been done by this incompetent state government has cost people more. That is the case with electricity charges. When anything is reformed the costs go up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045632"></A>
This bill covers amendments to a lot of areas and I will just quickly touch on a few. It makes amendments to the RNA act--the Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland Act. What a great organisation that is. It has been operating since 1875--that is, 136 years--and has been providing great entertainment for the people of Queensland and the people of Australia. The restructure occurring at the site now will be of benefit and take us into the next century. It is a good site and a handy site and one that we should maintain. The bill makes an amendment so the RNA can maintain its Australian Taxation Office endorsement as an income tax exempt charitable institution. That is an amendment that is certainly welcomed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045634"></A>
I now want to refer to the amendments in the local government area. They are very important. This bill makes some amendments to the Local Government Act, particularly with regard to the Local Government Change Commission which was established under the legislation. The commission must consider whether a boundary change application is in the public interest and is consistent with local government related law. The commission is to conduct an assessment of the application in a way it considers appropriate. This legislation makes it a little simpler for the Local Government Change Commission to look at minor boundary change applications. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045636"></A>
There have been many changes made in the past to local government boundaries in this state. I have been a councillor and a chairman in the past. Every council goes through these issues, sometimes with some agony and sometimes with some satisfaction. At the end of the day, some changes need to be made and some never get made because of a stand-off between people or councils or whatever the case may be. There needs to be a mechanism whereby sensible changes can be made. Common sense must prevail when it comes to these decisions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045638"></A>
As the member for Callide mentioned, as a result of forced amalgamations there are glaring examples where some changes need to be made. What happened with the amalgamation of councils was that the internal boundaries were pulled out and the 130-year-old external boundaries stayed the same. Not a lot changed but geographically it did not work in many instances. It was like a jigsaw puzzle that did not quite come together. There are some common-sense changes that need to be made. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045640"></A>
The most important point when it comes to these minor matters is that it has to be in the public interest. If it is in the public interest that matters be resolved quickly and without going through a long, drawn-out process then that is sensible in so far as it will save time and money and reduce the bureaucracy. This government is famous for bureaucracy. This is one small step to help that situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045641"></A>
There are some other issues that the Local Government Change Commission can deal with under the Local Government Act and the City of Brisbane Act. It can change the number of councillors in a council. This should have been done before. Smaller councils in terms of their revenue and population but not in terms of their geographical area have four councillors and a mayor. During the recent floods we saw situations where councillors could not get into their areas because of the flooding. They only have to have one councillor sick or somebody excluded due to the stupid conflict of interest laws that the government put in place and it means that the council simply cannot get a quorum. They have four councillors and a mayor and one or two of them are out--</Hansard-Body>

Mr HOBBS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 There has to be common sense here. Some of those legislative changes need to be made. In fact, I believe your government is working towards that now so I would not be too smart on that side of the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045651"></A>
At the end of the day, we have to make sure it is sensible. There was a recent recommendation of your own committee that councils with under 30,000 people should have six councillors. Guess what? It was rejected by this government. For what reason? Just because it did not want that happening. In reality, in many instances it is sensible to have that number of people on the council or at least to give the councils the option to have that number of people on the council. If they do not want six and instead want to keep four they can do that. If it is practical and sensible in those regions to have six, we should let them have six. You should have accepted the recommendations of the committee. </Hansard-Body>

Mr HOBBS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do not see any reason this government could not give councils more councillors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045655"></A>
I want to move on to the provisions in clauses 8, 9 and 10 related to correcting a minor drafting error in relation to notifying a councillor of a hearing of a complaint. The words ‘inappropriate conduct’ were inadvertently omitted from the previous act. That amendment needed to be made. That is an acceptable amendment to the legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045656"></A>
One thing I would like to raise is that we need to ensure that no past allegations are challenged under this legislation. I understand from the briefing that I had that this provision is not retrospective. At the end of the day, if past allegations can be resurrected due to this amendment then there needs to be caution exercised. When I refer to the local government changes I am referring to the changes to the City of Brisbane Act as well as the Local Government Act because they are similar. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045657"></A>
The other aspect I want to talk about is the changes in relation to iconic places. This was one of those debacles that this government presided over with forced amalgamations. Communities like Noosa and the Douglas shire wanted to preserve the uniqueness of their areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048681"></A>
The government did not think about this when the forced amalgamations were done, so it grabbed the Iconic Queensland Places Act 2008 out of the air and put it in place. That is one of those things that was better than nothing, but it meant nothing. In fact, after three years the review that took place found it to be not the most effective mechanism for the protection of iconic values. Surprise, surprise! The government added more bureaucracy, but at the end of the day the government should have left those councils alone to do their own thing. They did a great job and are still doing a great job, but this has made it much more difficult because the government has now lumped them all in together. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048685"></A>
As the member for Callide said, around this state there are enormous concerns in relation to the forced amalgamation of councils. Up the coast and out west there is enormous dissent in relation to the way that local government is operating. And it is not the fault of the councillors; it is the fault of the legislative processes that have been put in place by this government without any thought, without any cost-benefit analysis and without any statement of the likely impacts on the ratepayer. Of course, the impacts on the ratepayer have been absolutely enormous across this state. Amalgamation cost nearly $200 million. The government reluctantly paid about $60 million but the ratepayers had to pick up the rest of the bill, and they are still suffering from that. I do not think this state has ever seen so many local governments operating deficit budgets, and that is thanks to you, Treasurer. We have lost our AAA credit rating and we now have the biggest debt Queensland has ever had. The councils under you are now probably in the worst debt--</Hansard-Body>

The change to the Iconic Queensland Places Act will still be in there--it is a bit of a sop--but at the end of the day it is important that we preserve the important parts of our state such as Noosa and Port Douglas. Places such as those have created a niche in the market and people from around the world want to be able to go there and see the special qualities of those places.</Hansard-Body>

States and territories have worked to harmonise payroll tax arrangements, to reduce compliance costs and to improve certainty. Queensland’s payroll tax legislation was amended in 2008 to give effect to these arrangements. The Revenue and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 contains amendments to the Payroll Tax Act 1971 to continue to improve harmonisation across states and territories. These changes will: ensure that payroll tax is not payable on benefits exempt under the Commonwealth Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986; remove the requirement to group a company with another company as related corporations where one of the companies holds its interests in the other company on trust; ensure that, where two or more members of a group together have a controlling interest in a business, all of the members of the group and the persons who carry on the business together constitute a group; and amend the employee share scheme provisions of the Payroll Tax Act 1971 to reflect changes to Commonwealth employee share scheme legislation which had been referred to for payroll tax purposes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048713"></A>
In relation to the employee share scheme arrangements, state revenue commissioners have worked together to develop the principles for taxing shares and options issued by employers to employees. All jurisdictions will make legislative changes to give effect to the agreed approach, with legislation developed by New South Wales being used as the model legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048715"></A>
I also support the amendments in the bill to the Local Government Act which will strengthen the responsiveness of the Local Government Change Commission. Designed to improve the functioning and processing of relatively minor and non-controversial or non-contentious change applications, these amendments are consistent with the provisions of the Local Government Act 1993 which provided the commission with some of the similar flexibilities that are proposed in this amendment. I stress that the flexibility in this can only be used in cases of minor change applications where there is unlikely to be any arising public interest and where it would be a waste of the commission’s resources to go down a path of conducting public hearings and seeking submissions for applications that are quite clearly agreed to by the relevant and affected parties.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048719"></A>
I turn to the amendments to the Water Act in relation to both reconstruction and urban water reform. The amendments to the Water Act 2000 are also being made in support of the government’s commitment to fast-tracking and streamlining the reconstruction of Queensland. The amendments will allow state agencies or local government authorities to take water for construction or maintenance of state infrastructure without the usual permits. Subsection 20(2)(a) of the Water Act provides for the taking of water in an emergency situation for a public purpose without a water entitlement. This provision was used during the recent flood and cyclone events to provide relief from the requirement to hold a water permit before taking water. As the emergency has now ended, subsection 20(2)(a) of the Water Act can no longer be used for the purposes of taking water during the reconstruction of our great state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048724"></A>
This proposed amendment will provide an authorisation for a constructing authority, including state government departments or local government authorities, to take water for the reconstruction of public assets such as our roads without the usual licence or permit. It is important to note that water can only be taken for the purposes prescribed and in accordance with the prescribed regulation. This will reduce the administrative burden on both the constructing authority and DERM by removing the requirement to make an application and assessment of same. In effect, this could improve current approval processes by numbers of months. This is not only reducing red tape but also reducing the time it will take, and that is critical as we reconstruct the state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048725"></A>
I want to make a couple of comments on the urban water reforms. This bill further amends the Water Act and the Water Supply (Safety and Reliability) Act with the aim of removing some planning and reporting requirements whilst still providing a legislative framework which continues to deliver safe and reliable water and sewerage services. I support that amendment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048728"></A>
Once again, the recurring theme in this ROLA Bill of 2011 is about getting smarter and more efficient practices that will get our state back on her feet and will still maintain the rigour required to maintain safety standards, quality of life, quality of services and our environment. This is all about reducing red tape and administration to support every possible avenue of fast-tracking the reconstruction of Queensland. This is on top of the $385 million of NDRRA advances that were announced a fortnight ago, which, I might add, did include $25 million in advances to the Townsville City Council so it can get on with the job instead of playing politics on issues of importance in our community. I support the amendments in this bill and commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110405_151845" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Buderim--LNP) (3.18 pm): I rise to make a short contribution to the Revenue and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. In particular, I want to address the proposed amendments to the South East Queensland Water (Restructuring) Act. It is no surprise that we need this amendment to this act. What a shambles! But are we getting the right amendments? In 2007 Labor decided that it could legislate to steal water assets from the ratepayers of South-East Queensland. It thought it had all of the answers, but all it did was create the most bloated and inefficient bureaucracy that we have ever seen in this state. There are 11 entities in South-East Queensland responsible for the supply, management and regulation of water. At the helm of those 11 entities we have 101 executives. I will speak more about that when I speak to the relevant amendments shortly. The explanatory notes for this bill state--</A></Hansard-Body>

In late 2010, the Government announced a revised operating strategy for the manufactured water assets to reflect the substantial improvement in water security in SEQ. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051876"></A>
That is Laborspeak for ‘We got it wrong again’. It started to rain again and all the Gillard-Rudd-Wong-Garnaut disciples opposite had to stop talking about the drought. This bill enables a regulation to transfer assets, liability instruments and employees between certain state owned entities. Apparently, the regulation-making powers will provide a flexible and efficient means of transferring water security assets, liabilities, instruments and employees to Seqwater as part of the merger of the two authorities announced by the government in December 2010. When talking about water security, it is always amusing to read the word ‘efficient’ in any bill introduced by this Labor government. I note that the announcement occurred two weeks after I raised an issue when debating a water bill back in November. So we over here in the LNP are pleased to have provided the minister with guidance on this particular matter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051878"></A>
But I am not sure that the minister got the entire message back in November. The explanatory notes state further--and this is an absolute beauty--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051880"></A>
The amendments will also lift the current five-member limit for water entity boards, allowing responsible Ministers to appoint additional directors to the post-merger Seqwater to reflect its added responsibilities and the expertise required. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051881"></A>
Let me say that again. These amendments give the government the ability to add more directors to those boards. The minister is right off the rails on this one. The idea is to get a few more snouts out of the trough and not allow more snouts into the trough. Yes, the Labor Party jobs-for-the-boys policy is alive and well in this bill. We know that the South East Queensland Water (Restructuring) Act established four new authorities to own and operate bulk water supply, transmission and production infrastructure in the region and to oversee the water grid. WaterSecure was established to own, operate and maintain the Gold Coast desalination plant and the western corridor recycled water scheme. That may have been the intention, but as we know the operation and management of the desalination plant and the western corridor membrane plants have been handed over to a French company called Veolia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051885"></A>
In November I asked the Premier a question on notice about the deal between WaterSecure, one of the companies subject to these amendments in the bill, and Veolia. The answer received back was--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051887"></A>
Veolia Water Australia and its partners in the Gold Coast Desalination Alliance have ten years--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1051888"></A>
yes, 10 years--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051890"></A>
remaining on their contract to operate and maintain the Tugun desalination plant on behalf of WaterSecure. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1051891"></A>
The Premier’s answer continued--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051893"></A>
Veolia’s contract for the Western Corridor Recycled Water Scheme is a fifteen year term. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051894"></A>
Just so we get this absolutely straight, this bill provides the machinery to see this merger of Seqwater and WaterSecure, which I called for back in November of last year, and arising out of this merger this bill will provide for the responsible minister to appoint additional directors to the merged entities to reflect the added responsibilities and expertise required. That is pretty important. But we need to hang on just a moment. The Premier indicated in her answer to my question on notice that the responsibilities for which WaterSecure was created, namely operating and maintaining the desalination plant and the western corridor membrane plants, have been flick-passed to a private company called Veolia for 10 and 15 years respectively. So where are these perceived added responsibilities coming from? Again I ask the question: why the need for the extra directors? In relation to WaterSecure--one of these entities mentioned within this bill--the Premier’s answer to my question on notice continued--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051896"></A>
The financial details of both contracts remain commercial in confidence. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051897"></A>
That is Laborspeak for ‘We’re paying too much and we don’t want the public to know anything about it’. In relation to WaterSecure the Premier’s answer to my question on notice continued--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051899"></A>
These competitive contracts provide flexibility to adjust to various operating scenarios across a range of production levels from zero to one hundred percent. These contracts deliver world-leading expertise from an internationally recognised water company and ensure that the plants are available to operate in line with SEQ Water Grid instructions at all times. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051900"></A>
That all sounds very impressive, but Veolia is on the job for at least the next decade and a half and we are not allowed to know how much that costs. Let us not forget that the desalination plant is in mothballs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051901"></A>
Through the amendments in this bill the following provision will be inserted into the act to apply to a transfer between WaterSecure and Seqwater made as part of the proposed merger--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051903"></A>
Specific employment guarantees for WaterSecure employees transferred to Seqwater. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051904"></A>
Further, the new provision aims to minimise the administrative complexities and costs associated with transactions undertaken by regulation and to ensure a smooth transition of the business and the preservation of the status quo in terms of the application of instruments and employee entitlements. New section 112 of the act provides a three-year prohibition on the retrenchment of any employee covered by a certified agreement that is transferred from WaterSecure to Seqwater. Again, that all sounds wonderful--and I am all for preserving jobs in this state, as we all are on this side of the House--but this bill talks about streamlining and making things more efficient, which one would assume means cutting costs, including labour costs. So my final question is: what will the former employees of the now redundant WaterSecure be doing at Seqwater? I think that question really needs some looking into. We are amalgamating all of these people into this one entity and there sure are a lot them. Considering that this bill legislates that the labour costs will not decrease for at least three years and it further legislates that more directors can be appointed to do half the amount of work, how is this legislation going to in any way result in lower water costs for the consumers of Queensland? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051905"></A>
I know that on the Sunshine Coast people’s water bills continue to rise. Every time they come out at roughly 25.88 per cent more. People are not very happy with that. I think they have pretty well had enough of it. I know that the shadow minister spoke earlier and also our leader--</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1051907"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICKSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
--relating to how-to-vote cards when people go to the next election. The next election is really what the member should be interested in, because I think there are going to be a lot of Queenslanders taking their bills along when they vote. Those bills will make great how-to-vote cards. This needs to happen sooner rather than later. We need to make water delivery authorities much more efficient and much more streamlined. All I can read out of this particular component of the bill is that the government is going to create more bureaucracy. We are going to have a whole lot of people sitting around playing canasta. At the end of the day, I do not think that the ratepayers are going to get any benefit from this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051908"></A>
We have to remember who amalgamated the water supplies in this state. It was not the councils, because I was there when it happened and I remember it extremely well. Henry Palaszczuk basically told us on the Sunshine Coast, ‘You’re not getting a water pipeline built to the Sunshine Coast. You’re crazy if you think that will ever happen. We won’t go through any green corridors.’ Guess what happened? They built a water pipeline to the coast. They forgot to put pumps in it so that they can pump water back to the coast. They just take away the water. The benefit that we on the Sunshine Coast have for this water restructure is that we pay more for water every single day of the week. The people are not happy. They are not going to cop it. But this situation is occurring right across South-East Queensland. Enough is enough. The people of Queensland are going to have a good old say at the next election. I look forward to that, because I will be handing out how-to-vote cards and I am sure they will be delivering water bills to the government in spades. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Gaven--LNP) (3.27 pm): This bill is an omnibus bill that in part reflects the ongoing need for the state to continue to adapt our legislation to secure a continuous revenue stream from state taxes that have continued long after the introduction of GST and which relate to all manner of other things. The bill also amends the First Home Owner Grant Scheme. It also further entrenches Labor’s water as income as part of its so-called reform agenda in water restructuring. It again toys with local government, with an obsession about Labor’s new class enemies: local government and councillors. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1051916"></A>
This bill is really a complex document. It is so diverse that it is all but impossible to discuss all of it without leaving something out. If that is the case, is it just too difficult to be really of any use as a legislative tool? The taxation changes all seem relatively sensible and deserving of support. The obvious place to start would be the most serious issue confronting everyday Queenslanders today, and that is the serious ratcheting up of water prices from an uncaring government which feels that it now has the right to reform our use of carbon after it has reformed our supply of water. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051917"></A>
This bill seeks to extend the powers of the chief executive regarding water rights, guaranteeing the work related rights of employees with relevant water entities, and new regulations regarding the construction of water infrastructure bodies to mirror what the government has in GOC parallels. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055203"></A>
The major assumption of this bill is that water infrastructure will be massively improved by grouping all progressively under Seqwater without any further need to come back to parliament. This bill moves WaterSecure, the desal plant and the western corridor bypass into this existing bigger entity, Seqwater. In future, Wyaralong Dam and possibly others will also move. The overriding principle seems to be that this monopoly, wholly government owned entity is no different from a GOC and by default can be put at arm’s length from the scrutiny of parliament. It also then becomes captive to a voracious Labor government, desperate for cash, lurching for any critical life commodity, such as water, where the public can be held to ransom by an overarching single Seqwater monopoly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055206"></A>
The desal plant is only the dog it is now because Labor demanded a plant beyond its original design specifications and penny-pinched on everything from pipes to filters. Arguably, the contractors may remain cost plus on-site forever. Putting it into Seqwater is irrational. It should be gifted to the Gold Coast City Council and refashioned. Gold Coast Water should be able to manage it. No amount of moving entities with minor cancellation of small boards will make any difference to Labor’s failed water security plan. Under Labor, water equals money whereas it should equal public benefit. The terms ‘exploitation’ and ‘abuse of power’ seem appropriate here. Irrespective of Wyaralong Dam, the northern pipeline interconnector, the Tugun desalination plant, known as WaterSecure, and the western corridor being described as drought-proofing, it was all too late, too expensive, too bureaucratic and too much of a monopoly at the end. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055207"></A>
The amendments to the Water Act 2000 are more of the same. The aim is to allow for streamlining of approvals for constructing authorities--that is, in flood recovery--to take water for construction and state infrastructure maintenance by exempting them from the need to obtain water licences and permits. These are practical considerations to some of the changes that authorise state agencies and/or local governments to take water for projects including for state infrastructure. It avoids the need to issue and reissue permits for water harvesting and will impose limits when water is short, as has been mentioned today a number of times. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055208"></A>
The other water changes are minor and somewhat procedural. Curiously, there is an extension of time granted to water service providers outside South-East Queensland or local governments that had boundaries adjusted at the 2008 local government elections to prepare and submit system leakage plans to the regulator for approval. Leakage remains a big issue everywhere, both in micro form and in macro form. With the removal of the 40 per cent infrastructure subsidy, councils will invariably be delaying leakage repair strategies almost into the never-never because of the potential cost. At a time when water is so precious, it could be that an affordable strategy to repair tiring infrastructure is just too difficult and it is just easy to reduce the pressure in the pipes and repair them on an as-needs or emergency basis. This demand for plans without some budget seems short-sighted when seemingly it has been done in the name of water security.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055209"></A>
That part of the bill relating to local government seems to raise a number of issues that are all largely left unexplained. The first is the merging of the LGsuper and City Super schemes. The justification is that Jeremy Cooper’s review broadly stated that the consolidation is in both funds’ interest. The proof of the pudding of course is in the eating. I hope City Super contributors in three to five years time--because that is the standard time they are assessed over--will agree it was the correct decision. I think the verdict will remain out until then. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055210"></A>
The second change that seems to send all the wrong messages is that relating to the amendment to alter provisions regarding disciplinary action under the City of Brisbane Act. Whilst the change is relatively minor to correct a drafting error to allow the Brisbane City Council Councillor Conduct Review Panel administrative power to hear a complaint of what is deemed to be inappropriate conduct, this bill continues the enduring obsession of this present Labor government with criticism of councils and their councillors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055211"></A>
Councils represent the community interest of all of our local Queensland communities. This ridiculous approach of blaming councils for problems that by and large are due to the actions of an out-of-control, reckless Labor state administration is largely appalling. Today in the House we have heard outrageous statements about rate rises exceeding the cost of living by very marginal amounts, according to Premier Bligh. This from a government that has ruthlessly taken over council water assets, sold off electricity retailers and ratcheted up everything that goes with it, including Seqwater bulk water prices that I have discussed earlier that are outrageous! Councils have had their infrastructure grants severed and have had massive costs shifted back onto them from the state so that those ratepayers have had to carry those costs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055212"></A>
Councils and councillors are local champions of their communities and they are natural partners of government. They are not recognised under the federal Constitution and, as such, they deserve the support of all state governments which they serve. They do not deserve these ongoing, disgraceful, in-parliament offensive criticisms. I do not deny that, as my wife is a councillor for Surfers Paradise, I may have somewhat of a conflict, but I believe this deeply: local councillors find the current hostility directed at them as an electoral campaigning strategy by the state Labor Party totally unprofessional and desperate. I call on Labor to recant and apologise, especially to our Lord Mayor, Ron Clarke, who is routinely criticised in this House by all number of speakers, including ministers here today. Mayor Clarke is a great Australian who has championed our broader Gold Coast rights for water control and security. He has brought our nation great distinction over a long, long history in many spheres. He is the patron of the 2018 Commonwealth Games and he deserves the accolades that are bestowed upon him.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1055213"></A>
In relation to local government changes in this bill, clauses 7, 8 and 58 of this bill amend the City of Brisbane Act and the Local Government Act to allow the minister to direct a local government change commission regarding its assessment of a proposed change. This change commission is created under this act. Critically, clause 58 amends section 19 to remove minimum requirements regarding assessment and direct that change commission to act in a particular way and require that change commission to comply with the minister’s direction. I refer members to section 19. I put it to members that this should be referred to as potential amendments to gerrymander by Labor since it nobbles the capacity of the so-called independent body, the change commissioner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055214"></A>
The comments of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee in paragraph 49 of the <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert</Hansard-Italic>
 that was issued today should be noted. The change is wrong and merely reflects much of the nonsense that occurred in the last electoral redistribution in Queensland. Briefings have implied that the intent is minor, but if they were to be minor and non-controversial changes then why would you not state that? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055215"></A>
In conclusion, the bill does not raise the ire of any one group or lead to even tense debate. But what it does do is almost taunt the public who currently are just over this government when it comes to water. Too many people are saying to me in response to surveys which I have sent out that they are just cutting out everything that makes life worthwhile including healthy food, groceries, petrol, insurance, dental care--and it goes on and on. And these are things that we need at a time when our health bills are growing. In other words, the knock-on effect of this is very significant. People have to understand that. Most people are saying that they are just not going out or even planning to take a holiday. This is in a state that has some of the greatest weather and natural beauty in the world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055216"></A>
The Premier is not listening to the words of everyday people when she claims that our electricity is the cheapest in Australia. What she does not say is that the cumulative increase of every other cost when compared to relative incomes, whether it be wages or benefits, has rendered the cost of living in our suburbs and regions impossible to the point that people are living in darkness in their own homes without any of the extras in life. One person who responded to the survey said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1055217"></A>
The cost of existing has increased. I say ‘existing’ because that is all we are able to afford to do. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055218"></A>
It is probably the most salient quote that I have had from a constituent. If that is the case then none of the changes in this bill will deliver any salvation for the majority of Queenslanders. If the legacy of any legislation of this Labor government is that it makes people’s lives worse in the face of the greatest commodity boom in our nation’s history, then that government will be historically recorded as a failure and by inference its leadership failures and vagabonds. The word ‘vagabond’ means idle, wandering beggar or thief. This is the likely epithet of a group that sought political control not for the greater good but for the control itself. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(3.38 pm): I rise to speak to the Revenue and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, a SLMP bill that addresses quite a number of different pieces of legislation. It is not my intention to address all of the changes, just a small number of them. I commend the minister for the changes to the Duties Act, particularly in that area relating to the registration duty on special vehicles. My experience is that there are quite a number of people with disabilities who have had to modify vehicles when there is a high probability that had there been more flexibility and less rigidity in the application requirements those vehicles would not have needed to be modified to the same extent. However, this change at least recognises that the special vehicles are there for a specific purpose for people with special needs. I am sure that the recognition of those circumstances is welcome. </Hansard-Body>

The bill proposes a number of retrospective changes to legislation. In general, retrospectivity is not encouraged or, in fact, seen as appropriate. However, the areas of retrospectivity in this legislation appear to be curative. Also, they do not appear to cause a disadvantage to anybody who would be caught by the changes. I would be interested if that understanding is not right. Certainly, retrospectivity should only be done in a very well thought out circumstance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055255"></A>
A number of previous speakers have talked about the amendments to the Local Government Act to allow the Electoral Commissioner to make boundary changes, with some flexibility in the requirements for consultation or at least the process for consultation. Certainly, where the local council has applied for a boundary realignment to create a more appropriate local government boundary and it is agreed to by all parties, it is an inappropriate use of resources to have a full public consultation process. There are circumstances where properties are dissected because of a boundary change. Particularly in rural and regional Queensland, the property owner then has to negotiate with two councils and usually they will have different policies and different charging regimes. It can become quite an onerous task. Where it is a curative process and all parties are in agreement, the process that has to be undertaken should be simplified. However, where a change is proposed that will affect people positively and negatively, it is important that the commission has a full consultation process with all affected persons. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055256"></A>
Boundaries should be practical, they should be logical and the people located in a boundary should have a community of interest. I concur with previous speakers from the non-government side who have said that probably one of the greatest causes of frustration and anxiety was compulsory amalgamation. Gladstone Regional Council Chief Executive Officer, Graeme Kanofski, has been involved in local government since before I started in 1988. When I was elected as mayor of Calliope, he changed from deputy shire clerk to shire clerk, and then he became the chief executive officer. He has remained as chief executive officer for the amalgamated Gladstone Regional Council. He is a great operator and a very efficient man. His commentary on the forced amalgamations now, looking back, is that he feels it was a process that was needed. He did not commence with that point of view. I believe that there are still many in the community I represent who are aggrieved by that forced amalgamation. Boundaries should be logical and the aggregation of councils into a larger council should reflect a community of interest. If the commission has greater flexibility and scope in its boundary realignment process, certainly that is welcome. </Hansard-Body>

I want to speak to the amendments to the South East Queensland Water (Restructuring) Act. I share the concern of others who have spoken about the removal of the limit on the number of members to be appointed to a board of a new water entity. That is very concerning. Certainly the community would want to know why the limit has been removed and whether it opens up the opportunity for people to be appointed to the board unnecessarily. No matter what appointments are made, they add to the cost of water. Therefore, it is incumbent on government, no matter what the structure is--whether it is a water board or any other board--to ensure that board members are appointed judiciously and that they are appointed because their presence is needed to give advice, bearing in mind that increasing the number of people increases the cost of that commodity to the community. </Hansard-Body>

As the member for Gaven rightly said, people in Queensland, and indeed all of Australia, are hurting. Often we stand here and talk about how the cost of a product has gone up--the cost of water, the cost of electricity--but not by much. It may have increased by only $100 a year. However, the aggregated increase in the cost of those types of commodities and its impact on the cost of living means that everything has gone up, but wages have not kept pace. It is not just a single issue or a single item that has gone up in price. Electricity has risen exponentially, if you are connected to the water grid the cost of water has risen exponentially, the cost of groceries has gone up, the cost of fuel has gone up and families are struggling to make ends meet. The first place that we can start to address that is to make sure that those governing bodies are lean, that they are effective, that they are efficient and that they are cost efficient. Certainly the bill proposes a number of changes to things that I am not familiar with because they relate to the south-east corner. However, one request that I believe every person in my community and beyond would make is that we ensure that the entities that they are paying for are cost effective. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110405_154605" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Pine Rivers--ALP) (3.45 pm): I rise to support the Revenue and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, which includes a number of exemptions and concessions that will benefit Queensland taxpayers. For example, special disability trusts are established under the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans Entitlement Act 1986 to assist immediate family members of people with severe disabilities to make private financial provision for the future care and accommodation needs of the person with a disability. To qualify as a special disability trust, among other things the trust must have one beneficiary who has an impairment or disability as determined under the relevant Commonwealth legislation and be established primarily to meet the beneficiary’s reasonable care and accommodation needs. Where these requirements are satisfied, gifting concessions under the Commonwealth legislation are available for eligible family members of the beneficiary and an assets test exemption up to a certain level applies for the beneficiary. Transactions that may be undertaken for the purposes of the Commonwealth legislation include the acquisition of a residence by the trustee for use as the beneficiary’s home. These types of transactions may be liable for transfer duty under the Duties Act 2001, being either the transfer or agreement for the transfer of dutiable property, the creation of a trust of dutiable property or an acquisition of a trust interest. To help facilitate these transactions, relief from transfer duty for special disability trusts was announced in the 2010-11 state budget. This exemption is currently operating under an administrative arrangement. The Duties Act 2001 is being amended to give this arrangement prospective legislative effect. I know a number of parents of children who have a disability who will be pleased to have this matter settled.</A></Hansard-Body>

The bill also gives legislative effect to an administrative arrangement providing an exemption for Indigenous land use agreements in certain circumstances. Under the Commonwealth Native Title Act 1993, the settlement of native title claims may involve the transfer of land pursuant to an Indigenous land use agreement. Such a transfer may give rise to a dutiable transaction under the Duties Act 2001, being either a transfer of land, an agreement to transfer land or an acquisition of an interest in land on its creation, grant or issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055274"></A>
Reflecting the existing administrative arrangement, the bill provides an exemption from transfer duty to native title claimants for a dutiable transaction that is made under a registered Indigenous land use agreement where qualifying conditions are satisfied. To qualify for the exemption, the transaction must be undertaken solely to give effect to a registered Indigenous land use agreement and be expressly contemplated by that agreement. In addition, the transfer of the land or the acquisition of the right must be in exchange for the surrender of native title rights and interests under the Commonwealth Native Title Act 1993 for an area of land to which the Indigenous land use agreement relates. Within six months of becoming entitled to possession of the land, the native title claimants must use the land for traditional or residential purposes, but not commercial purposes, for 12 months. </Hansard-Body>

Under the Duties Act 2001, vehicle registration duty is imposed on the registration or transfer of registration of a vehicle. The amount of duty payable is calculated by reference to the vehicle’s dutiable value. Where a vehicle has been modified to enable a person with a disability to drive or to be transported in the vehicle, the costs of those modifications would be included in the dutiable value when calculating vehicle registration duty. Relief from the additional duty payable in those cases is currently available under an administrative arrangement that has been in place since 4 March 2009. This means that, where a person with a disability, or a relative or carer of the person with a disability, registers or transfers the registration of a modified vehicle, duty will be calculated without regard to the cost of the modifications. The bill gives retrospective legislative effect to this administrative arrangement. Again, the costs that people with special needs and their families face are considerable and this will go some way to assist to offset one of those costs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058628"></A>
The bill will also provide a number of other concessions and exemptions. For example, the concessional rate of vehicle registration duty applicable to the registration, or transfer of registration, of special vehicles will be continued following changes to a department of transport regulation. The transfer duty home concessions are being extended to include acquisitions of homes by way of vesting pursuant to statute or court order. The requirement for duty to be paid prior to being entitled to a re-assessment under the cancelled transfer provisions of section 499 of the Duties Act 2001 is being removed, simplifying arrangements for taxpayers. The Payroll Tax Act 1971 is being amended to clarify that payroll tax is not payable on benefits exempt under the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986, which is a Commonwealth act.</Hansard-Body>

The bill amends the South East Queensland Water (Restructuring) Act 2007 to introduce a statutory mechanism enabling the transfer of assets, liabilities, instruments and employees between certain state owned water entities. The new regulation-making power will be used to facilitate the proposed merger of the Queensland Manufactured Water Authority, WaterSecure, and the Queensland Bulk Water Supply Authority, Seqwater, as well as future transfers of bulk water assets and associated liabilities from the government owned special purpose vehicle construction companies to the bulk water authorities. According to the government, this will significantly ease the costs and administration connected with the transfer of bulk water assets. </A></Hansard-Body>

In September 2007 the Queensland government approved a range of institutional reforms to be implemented across the South-East Queensland urban water sector. These reforms addressed a number of critical shortfalls in the urban water supply arrangement and coincided with the establishment of the much lauded South-East Queensland water grid. The act established four new statutory authorities to own and operate bulk water supply, transmission and production infrastructure in the region and to oversee the operation of the South-East Queensland water grid. Seqwater is responsible for the major bulk water storage and treatment assets across the region, including dams, weirs and water treatment plants. WaterSecure was established to own and operate the Gold Coast desalination plant and the western corridor recycled water scheme. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058650"></A>
In late 2010 the government announced a revised operating strategy for the manufactured water assets to reflect the substantial improvement in water security in South-East Queensland. The government also endorsed the further consolidation of the water grid industry structure through the establishment of a single supplier of bulk water into the grid. </Hansard-Body>

The Liberal National Party has always believed that councils should retain ownership and control over water infrastructure. On 1 July 2008 South-East Queensland’s bulk water supply and water transport assets were transferred to the state government. On the Gold Coast this transition included the Hinze Dam, the Little Nerang Dam and the Mudgeeraba water treatment plants, all of which are in my electorate. The Hinze Dam was upgraded in 1989 to a storage capacity of 161,070 million litres covering a surface area of 972 hectares and is currently being upgraded for flood mitigation and increased storage. Based on average rainfall and weather patterns, it can provide on average 191 million litres of water per day. Currently, the stage 3 upgrade of the Hinze Dam is almost completed. The upgrade will raise the dam wall from 93.5 metres to 108.5 metres to increase the water supply from the Hinze Dam to 225 million litres per day, reduce flooding in the lower Nerang River catchment and ensure the dam complies with current safety standards and guidelines. </Hansard-Body>

DO not, I repeat, do not get me started on water and how the Gold Coast was absolutely dudded out of the dams and facilities it had built and maintained very well before the state government stepped in.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Secondly--and this is where the disgraceful Logan deal comes into it--for a short time the Gold Coast had a deal with Logan for that council to SELL up to 35 mega litres of water a day from Wivenhoe via Logan pipes to northern parts of the City which never should have been part of the Gold Coast after the council amalgamations were put into Logan anyway. And more often than not, the Gold Coast only took a fraction of what it was paying $210,000 a month for. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mayor Ron Clarke, thinking he was doing the right thing, told Logan to stop sending the water. They did. But they kept sending the bills. Eventually it ended up in court and the Gold Coast was forced to pay Logan $2.1 million plus legal fees for water it never got because Logan had a contract. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1058680"></A>
Then Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman declared an emergency situation and demanded the State Government take control of water away from the only council which had managed its own dam responsibly and educated its residents to be the most water responsible people in Queensland--the Gold Coast. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The Gold Coast was repeatedly, and is often still, unfairly accused of being water guzzlers.

We have seen how well this government implements systems that are supposed to streamline and integrate the layers upon layers of bureaucracy that are crippling our Public Service. This government has spent millions and millions of taxpayers’ dollars streamlining the Queensland Health payroll system and is now spending hundreds of millions of dollars more trying to fix this monumental failure.

This legislation amends the Aboriginal Land Act 1991. The amendments to the Aboriginal Land Act include five Cape York national parks as transferable Aboriginal land, allowing joint state and Aboriginal management of the parks. The insertion of section 83LA into the act will mean that five additional national parks on Cape York Peninsula--Mungkan Kandju, Lakefield, Iron Range, Cape Melville and Flinders Group--and defined areas near those parks will be made transferable. The amendments will also assist in increasing the areas of Iron Range and Lakefield national parks. Lakefield National Park is a major tourist destination. This legislation seeks to place this and other national parks under joint Aboriginal and state management and to increase the size of Lakefield and Iron Range national parks. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1062132"></A>
Why is this government pushing on with its agenda of locking up more of Queensland when it is unable and unwilling to implement management strategies for existing national parks? I have also been contacted by constituents and visitors to my electorate who are angry that they can no longer book camp sites at Lakefield in advance. This reflects the mismanagement that is occurring in national parks across the state. These national parks are supposed to be a drawcard for tourism--both interstate tourists and locals. This is one of the many issues arising from the mismanagement of national parks, and it must be addressed rather than lumped onto Aboriginal groups who enter into a shared management arrangement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062133"></A>
The state government is now spending up to $58 million purchasing more national parks, yet at the same time it does not have management plans for the majority of Queensland’s national parks. We are talking about handing over land to the Aboriginals. These are wide, big, open spaces. They are massive areas. These national parks are full of noxious weeds, feral animals, rubber vine and lantana. There is no management control of pigs, yet one boar can spread weeds from one end of the park to the other, and overnight one boar can tear up up to a quarter of an acre like a rotary hoe. These issues are not being addressed. While the government talks about extending more national parks, horse riders are being kicked out of state forests. It is very hypocritical when we have a management problem, we have a noxious weed problem and we have a feral animal problem. </Hansard-Body>

 That is only 17 per cent. So why are we purchasing more national parks?

It is not benefiting anybody. </Hansard-Body>

This bill also facilitates changes to Seqwater. It facilitates the proposed merger of WaterSecure and Seqwater. Back in 1989 or 1990, the then government recognised that South-East Queensland did not have enough water to last us for another 20 years, so Wolffdene Dam was proposed. Then Wayne Goss came along and opposed Wolffdene Dam, as did Peter Beattie. That has brought us to the point we are at now and that is why we have the changes proposed in this bill. South-East Queensland almost ran out of water so Peter Beattie flew over Traveston Crossing, put his hand on his heart and said, ‘I will build my dam there.’ It had nothing to do with water security; it was all about saving his political hide at the 2006 election. Then we had the water crisis and the energy crisis and the health crisis. This is why we have the $85 billion debt. It has nothing to do with the global financial crisis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062141"></A>
This legislation also provides the Local Government Change Commission with greater discretion to call for submissions and to conduct hearings about boundary changes. This is intended to be used for minor, non-controversial changes. When former Premier Peter Beattie handed down the proposal for forced council amalgamations we did not hear a pin drop in this House because we could not believe it. The backbenchers could not believe it because they were not told about it. It was probably one of the greatest attacks in our history not only on rural and regional Queensland but on the whole of Queensland, because local councils were the engines that drove the communities. They were locals. They were part of the community. They worked with the community and participated in the community. But we are now seeing councils covering 60,000 square kilometres. We knew that there would be chaos and that it would be a catastrophe. We knew that. We tried to tell the government, but now it has failed legislation that we are trying to amend. It was a bad decision in the first place. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1062154"></A>
These amendments continue the rollout of the planning reform agenda which seeks to consolidate matters impacting on planning and development within the Sustainable Planning Act itself. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062155"></A>
There it is. The cat is out of the bag. The plan is just as we knew all along--that the iconic places legislation was a sop in the heat of the moment, in a fierce fight over forced council amalgamations, when 18,747 Noosa residents signed a petition in one day, when 31,000 Noosa residents sent submissions to the Local Government Reform Commission and, through the postal plebiscite granted by then Prime Minister John Howard, when 80 per cent of Noosa residents voted and 95 per cent of those voted against the forced amalgamation. Eight thousand Noosa residents and their supporters also marched through the streets of Brisbane to show their disgust at the actions of this failed Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062160"></A>
It was reported to the Weller review, when the iconic panels were only in their early stages of operation, that panel members became aware that the level of knowledge and backup by the relevant department was extremely limited. It was also noted that the intent was not supported by well-written legislation. In fact, I recall that this government had to call on the officers of the then Noosa Shire Council to help with the wording of the legislation. The resulting inadequacy of the final legislation added to the dreaded red tape. In turn, this sought to confuse the planning processes for local governments involved and also for panel members who were seeking to ensure the intent of the legislation and that the characteristics of those iconic areas were upheld. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062162"></A>
Further, it was noted that the level of departmental support was limited. Project officers appointed to each panel were doing a great job, but they needed to have the support behind them to assist in completing their work in a timely fashion. It was clear that a number of the process issues had not been well thought through, particularly the cumbersome way in which consideration by the panels took place where they considered every application, wasting valuable time and resources, rather than considering only the exceptions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065670"></A>
This was a disingenuous process designed from the outset to fail. The legislation brought into this place now by the architect of that failure, the former minister for local government and now Treasurer, is the next stage in this evil plan. The now Treasurer has the blood of those 157 councils, shrunk to just 73, on his hands. His great reform left 38, according to then Premier Beattie, ultimately unsustainable councils remaining. It was he who said in a forum in Noosa--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1065672"></A>
If I had 157 local councils like Noosa there would be no need for local government reform. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065673"></A>
It was he who oversaw the financial weakening of local government by the theft of water and sewerage assets which had given them greater financial viability when he had promised stronger councils from his reform. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065674"></A>
And so, the next stage of the plan is not to kill off the iconic panels just yet as this bill provides for a new, temporary advisory role for the iconic place panels and absorbs the policy for ongoing protection of declared iconic places into the Sustainable Planning Act. The folly of this plan is that the ability for local people to impact local decision making is now completely remote. For my electorate of Noosa--a declared iconic place along with the former Douglas shire--the ability to influence decisions about our whole environment has been stolen by this Bligh Labor government and the only shred of official protection has now been taken out of Noosa and has been moved into George Street. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Until Can-do Campbell Newman is elected and he leads the road back to a fully, truly local government for Noosa--which I am pleased to say he has come out and promised last Friday in the <Hansard-Italic>
Noosa News</Hansard-Italic>
--I will continue to lead the greater Noosa community in partnership with the Noosa Independence Alliance, a partnership of community groups, in our fight to form our own local authority. In short, the iconic places assessment panels were ill-conceived, with little or no forethought. Their passing will be mourned by no-one, just as the passing of this failed Labor government and this failed Labor Treasurer will be mourned by no-one, either. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The amendments to the Local Government Act 2009 and the City of Brisbane Act 2010 are important as the Local Government Change Commission can recommend changes to a local authority’s boundaries, including the number of councillors, the number of divisions and the boundaries which surround the divisions. I acknowledge that there may be some applications that are minor in nature, sometimes involving or including a couple of streets. Some of these changes are, in essence, technical in nature. However, this amendment allows for the commission to call for public hearings and submissions with discretion and flexibility and for the minister responsible for local government to direct the commission to indeed conduct public hearings in certain circumstances. I believe this ministerial responsibility is very important in relation to local government. </Hansard-Body>

Today in this chamber I heard an absolute diatribe from many in the opposition in relation to water bills. I have to tell members that I am absolutely sick and tired of the dishonesty of this opposition and also the dishonesty of councils in relation to water matters. The water and waste water businesses of Queensland Urban Utilities are owned by the five shareholding councils including Brisbane, Ipswich, the Lockyer Valley, the Scenic Rim and Somerset. From 1 July last year Queensland Urban Utilities supplies water and waste water services to customers in all these council areas. These councils own Queensland Urban Utilities and they are responsible for the water bills. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065699"></A>
I am personally sick and tired of ordinary people being told blatant lies about water. The opposition leader--whichever one it is; God knows--came in here and said that our water bills would be a how-to-vote card. Well, bring it on because the water bills will be a how-to-vote card in relation to the council elections next year. The councils own Queensland Urban Utilities and the councils will be held responsible for the lies and the absolute dishonesty that they have perpetrated in all of our communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065700"></A>
I think it is very important to place on the record today that in last year’s Ipswich City Council budget, which passed through council, there was an injection of $29 million from water. That is an awful lot of money to be making out of water. We had to go to some length to extract that particular figure, but it is true. The council is making money out of water. The councils are making profits out of the water that they are supplying to communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065701"></A>
It sickens me in the guts to know that every time a constituent has a complaint about Queensland Urban Utilities they are told by councillors--whoever it may be in council--that it is a state government matter. Well, it is not. The councils own Queensland Urban Utilities and it is about time they stood up and told the truth. If they refer them to me, I quite enjoy telling them the truth. My office tells them the truth. I think it is important that the councils are held responsible. They should be held responsible at the ballot box next year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065702"></A>
I place on the record that there has to be truth in local government. There has to be truth in relation to these water bills. There has to be truth in relation to Queensland Urban Utilities. Let the councils stand up and be counted for this. It seems to me that every time there is a problem with water bills councils automatically flick the matter to state MPs or flick it to the state government. We have had a gutful of it. The truth will be told. Eventually, the truth will told at the ballot box next year. </Hansard-Body>

I thank the officers of Treasury, the officers of Parliamentary Counsel and the public servants for all of their hard work in the preparation of this bill. I would ask the Treasurer--and I know he has been very vocal in terms of getting the truth out in relation to water bills--on behalf of the people of South-East Queensland to continue in his endeavours to have the truth told and not muddied by local government representatives.

(4.17 pm): I rise to speak in the debate on the Revenue and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. It is an omnibus bill. As I understand it, it seeks to amend 16 acts and repeal 11. Before proceeding further, I acknowledge the briefing that I received earlier this morning and thank the officers involved for their contribution and guidance. There were a few missing, so there are a few gaps in the information that was required. As I understand it, that has not been received by me as yet. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1065712"></A>
I will limit my comments to the amendments to the Water Act 2000 as they relate to the reconstruction and recovery from the significant flood and cyclone events we have experienced across Queensland in the past four months. Largely, the bill seeks to streamline the approvals process and/or steamroll the approval process for access to water. It extends beyond the conventional authorities and allows local governments involved in the reconstruction of assets that authority. It gives roads as an example. I presume that extends to other assets of state importance and/or local government importance. It probably extends to rail and other such infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065713"></A>
The bill is open-ended in the way that it addresses these issues. The explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1065715"></A>
The rationale for such policy objectives stems from an intent to provide an alternative mechanism that can reduce the administrative burden on the department, other state government agencies and local governments imposed by the current approval processes for water licensing and permitting. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065716"></A>
That to me suggests that there is a fundamental flaw in the way those permits and processes are working. It is good to see the red tape being cut and that streamlining process put in place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065752"></A>
It is also interesting to note that we need to legislate to sidestep some of that regulation and some of that process, and that to me says that that regulation and that process may be counterproductive to Queensland. While there are emergency provisions which kick into gear for a finite period of time to allow for water to be taken under the Water Act, those provisions are fairly finite. This bill seeks to extend that provision, particularly following flood and cyclone. While this morning we heard the Premier outline the extent of the roads that have been reconstructed and reopened, there are still many hundreds of kilometres of roadway yet to be rebuilt and there are still significant other projects that will require water. This bill seeks to address that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065759"></A>
I acknowledge that during the briefing the specific people whom I needed to hear from were not in the room even though others attempted to answer. Therefore, I will frame this contribution more as a series of questions and perhaps the minister can address them in his summing-up. While they call upon metering, the location of where the water is sourced, the type of body of water and the type of project that is involved, that implied to me that there was going to be some cost recovery from whichever water entity it is using based on the volume of water, the location of water, the availability of water et cetera. However, it is not clear within the bill, and certainly those at the briefing were not able to clarify for me, whether whatever local government, government department or construction authority was working on the project would need to pay back that water.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065761"></A>
Those giving the briefing also did not clearly articulate the range of uses that that water could be used for other than government construction work. They did indicate roads, but I am wondering if that then stretches, as we have seen, to the number of playing fields that have been affected by flood and silt and the need for water to re-establish them. Could it extend to local governments in their parklands? Would there be some offsetting required, because some of these are private water entities? If they produce water, it costs them. They are paying the bulk rates and channelling it through the pipeline. I wonder whether or not those costs would ripple back through a community and affect the viability of Allconnex, Urban Utilities and those other water entities in the south-east corner. With regard to infrastructure--it does articulate local government and/or state infrastructure--I am wondering how far that would stretch. It is going to take some time to recover from these events. This legislation will obviously help facilitate some of that work as and when it is needed. I hope the Treasurer in his summing-up can clarify those issues for me.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Glass House--LNP) (4.22 pm): I, too, rise to make a very brief contribution to the Revenue and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. As other members have suggested, this omnibus bill seeks to address a wide range of issues and will amend a vast array of legislation. Many of those issues have been addressed comprehensively by speakers before me. The water issue and the restructuring of SEQ’s water is a very passionate issue for the people in Glass House and for me in my role as the member for Glass House, but the member for Callide, the Leader of the Opposition, has quite succinctly summed up our position and our concerns. I want to focus my comments specifically on the abolition of the Iconic Queensland Places Act 2008 and the bringing of those issues and that legislation under the Sustainable Planning Act. I heard the member for Clayfield say that this raises a question mark as to why the legislation was ever enacted in the first place. I will be the first to acknowledge that there are some very iconic places around the state, none more so perhaps than the Blackall Range and the northern Blackall Range at that. I was doing some research when I came across a Department of Infrastructure and Planning fact sheet that even in its own written form said--</Hansard-Body>

</DIV>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The Act was formed to be consistent with the Integrated Planning Act 1997.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1065783"></A>
We all know that that has since been replaced by the Sustainable Planning Act. It continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1065785"></A>
It doesn’t replace, add to or remove anything that is already in the planning scheme for the area, the Maroochy Plan.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065786"></A>
The question, as the member for Clayfield said, is: why did we have the legislation in the first place? The council was well positioned and understood the iconic nature of the Blackall Range and was doing its job in protecting it. Local governments on the ground best understand what is required. In terms of the reason why the Blackall Range was declared, the fact sheet states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1065788"></A>
• 	the character and scenic quality of the prominent landscape features of the Mapleton-Montville Plateau</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1065789"></A>
• 	the coastal and hinterland vistas as viewed from the Blackall Range area</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1065790"></A>
• 	the scenic quality and rural character of the vegetated and habitat areas of the Baroon Dam Water Resource Catchment Area, horticultural, rural and open space lands</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1065791"></A>
• 	the good quality agricultural lands supporting horticultural industries and other primary production</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1065792"></A>
• 	areas of high ecological, scientific and aesthetic value of ecotonal and rainforest communities</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1065793"></A>
• 	the visual amenity, village character and subservience to the natural environment of the villages of Montville and Mapleton, and the rural residential community of Flaxton.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065794"></A>
As I read through those reasons for why that area of the electorate of Glass House was declared an iconic place, I now realise that a lot of those things that we were trying to protect are actually protected not only through the Sustainable Planning Act but also through the SEQ Regional Plan. The whole protection of prime agricultural/horticultural area, regional landscape and rural landscape is now achieved through the SEQ Regional Plan. With regard to the maintenance of the vistas from the Blackall Range, that is again achieved through the SEQ Regional Plan. It does beg the question of why we went down this path in the first place.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065796"></A>
There will be some individuals in the electorate of Glass House who are concerned about this move. There is clearly a move now to make the assessment panels temporary in nature, with the potential to phase them out over the long term. I note that the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee also picked up on this. There is a concern that perhaps, after all, this might be the government trying to save a penny here or there by removing some of the costs of running a board in terms of iconic places. I pick up where the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee identified this. In its latest <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert</Hansard-Italic>
 it suggests that--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1065799"></A>
Clause 121 would repeal the Iconic Queensland Places Act.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1065800"></A>
It continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1065802"></A>
New section 876 of the Sustainable Planning Act would be a transitional provision stating that:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1065803"></A>
•	on commencement, each iconic place development assessment panel would be dissolved and the members of each panel would go out of office (new section 876(1)); and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1065804"></A>
• 	no compensation would be payable to a member because of the dissolution (new section 876(2)).</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065805"></A>
The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee raised this on the basis that by doing so it may affect the rights of the members of those panels and one of the questions it asked was why no compensation was being paid. I do acknowledge that the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee’s <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert</Hansard-Italic>
 continues--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1065808"></A>
The non payment of compensation to the iconic panel members on dissolution of the current panels has been raised as a potential FLP issue in relation to the member’s rights and liberties. Under amendments proposed to SPA, compensation is not provided to panel members due to the proposed dissolution of the iconic panels, and is not considered necessary. Panel members are aware of the short-term nature of their appointments, which will cease on 19 June 2011, and the proposal to change the panel’s role to that of an advisory panel. Should the amendments commence after 19 June 2011, reappointment of existing members or appointment of new members will be required so that the panel’s current development assessment responsibilities can continue. Should this occur panel members will be again advised of the temporary nature of their appointments, and that no compensation will be payable on dissolution of the panel on commencement.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065809"></A>
Given that these panels are to be dissolved, I want to put on record my thanks to those who have served on them for the job that they have done. Everyone would admit that Montville continues to be an iconic place on the Blackall Range. Once this part of the legislation comes under the Sustainable Planning Act, local councillors Jenny McKay and Paul Tatton will be doing all they can to ensure that the feel we have in places such as Montville, Mapleton and Flaxton will remain. As I said, it is interesting, though, that we have come to this point where, after all of this, we are putting it back under the Sustainable Planning Act which, potentially, is where it should have been in the first place.<Hansard-Speech-End>

This bill is an omnibus bill that includes proposed amendments to a wide variety of acts. I would like to welcome the amendments to this bill that propose to exempt from duty transfers to special disability trusts, or acquisitions of residences by such trusts that will be the principal place of residence for a person with a disability, or the transfer of such a residence. I also particularly welcome the exemption from duty the transfer of vehicles that have been modified for use by a person with a disability. This will be a modest reduction in the cost burden to people with disabilities who have the capacity to utilise motor vehicles. Until November last year I was the shadow minister for disability services--a role I enjoyed--and I know that this amendment will assist a number of Queenslanders with a disability right across the state. So I offer a compliment to the Treasurer on a practical and real measure that will support Queenslanders with a disability. </A></Hansard-Body>

The bill proposes amendments to the Aboriginal Land Act. These amendments propose to facilitate the change of status of the Mungkan Kandju, Lakefield, Iron Range, Cape Melville and Flinders national parks on Cape York Peninsula as well as some additional areas near those parks to be classified from now on as national parks on Aboriginal land. It is proposed that these national parks on Aboriginal land will be jointly managed by the traditional owners of the area and the Department of Environment and Resource Management. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069603"></A>
The Bligh Labor government made a commitment in the lead-up to the 2009 state election to expand the protected area estate in Queensland. This bill also contains an amendment that proposes to expand the size of two national parks on Cape York Peninsula, being the Iron Range and Lakefield national parks, and in doing so contributes toward the overall increase in the area under national park estate in Queensland. That election commitment by the Bligh Labor government proposes to increase the size of Queensland’s national park estate by 50 per cent by 2020. Unfortunately, this proposal to increase the size of Queensland’s national parks by 50 per cent by 2020 is not accompanied by any commensurate increase in funding and resources to ensure that their environmental and conservation values are preserved into the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069604"></A>
The announcement to increase the size of Queensland’s national park estate by 50 per cent by 2020 certainly made for a good press release for the Bligh Labor government, issued as it was to mark the 100th anniversary of national parks in Queensland in 2008. The trouble with this commitment is that it is a completely arbitrary commitment. Do all areas that will be transferred from one land tenure or another to national park by 2020 in pursuit of the goal to increase the size of the national park estate by 50 per cent by that time exhibit the required and normal conservation values that would ordinarily be required to facilitate the declaration of area as a national park? I am not sure, but the Bligh Labor government has set the particular target of increasing the national park estate by 50 per cent by 2020. If it is serious about achieving that target, it must acquire and secure and expand the size of the national park estate by a particular figure by a particular time. I am certainly worried that the Bligh Labor government, in pursuit of that goal, will be declaring more and more areas as national parks that may or may not necessarily exhibit the conservation values that we would normally associate with national parks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069605"></A>
The Bligh government and the Beattie government also have a poor record of maintaining state controlled land, in particular national parks. My electorate of Hinchinbrook has some of the most outstanding national parks in Queensland and they have very significant conservation values. But the Bligh government has really failed to provide Queensland Parks and Wildlife with adequate funding and resources to manage the existing national park estate, let alone an increase in that national park estate by 50 per cent by the year 2020.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069606"></A>
 I have been pursuing this matter for quite some time--indeed, since I was first elected. The increasing number of feral pigs and the spread of pest weeds in the Wet Tropics area of North Queensland are real problems, with the resultant environmental and economic costs reaching serious levels. The reality is that pest weeds and feral animals become more prolific, they pose a major threat to the survival of endangered plants and animals and they cost farmers and landowners millions in lost production and control costs. So if the Bligh government is going to acquire and declare more and more areas as national parks, Queenslanders should be alarmed that at the same time the government has been spending less and less on their maintenance per hectare in terms of feral animal and pest weed control, which is compromising the conservation values of our parks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069608"></A>
Nevertheless, the Bligh Labor government continues to declare many new national parks across the state, including in my electorate of Hinchinbrook, where it is in the process presently of declaring the Halifax Bay Wetlands National Park. I have spoken in this House on a number of occasions about the problems associated with the declaration of that park--the lack of consultation with the local community, the exclusion of recreational activities from that national park and the concerns of the local communities in that regard. The reality is that this government is all talk and no action in relation to the management of Queensland’s extensive national park estate and that it is all politics and spin and no real commitment to the conservation of land with conservation values in this state. </Hansard-Body>

A report by the Auditor-General tabled in this House on 5 October last year revealed that just 98 of the 576 national parks in Queensland--17 per cent of national parks in Queensland--actually had a management plan in place despite the fact that each park is required to have a plan to be developed under the Nature Conservation Act. The report by the Auditor-General was an indictment on the government. Over the past few years since the government announced its intention to increase the size of the national park estate by 50 per cent by the year 2020, a succession of Labor environment ministers have swanned around this state declaring new national parks, basking in the publicity of declaring new national parks, but that is about as far as it goes. There is no commitment to actually managing properly the new parks--or existing parks, for that matter--to protect their conservation values. The Auditor-General’s report confirms that there is no planning being done. </Hansard-Body>

Mr CRIPPS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection from the member for Waterford because he has been listening to me when I have made those representations in the parliament in the past, particularly about the increasing number of feral pigs and the spread of pest weeds in the national park estate. The Auditor-General’s report was a welcome confirmation that the issues I have been raising were legitimate, are legitimate and are accurate. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1069616"></A>
About two-thirds of my electorate is covered by World Heritage national park or state forests--two-thirds of the physical area of my electorate. So I am keenly aware of the lack of resources that are provided by the government to the QPWS to maintain the conservation values of the existing protected areas. In his report the Auditor-General states clearly that, without approved park management plans, conservation activities undertaken in the protected area may be insufficient and that the relatively small number of completed park management plans reduces the department’s capacity to measure its success and accurately report its findings. The Auditor-General’s report, when it was tabled in the parliament in October last year, politely exposed the fact that the management of Queensland’s national parks by this government is an unfortunate joke.</Hansard-Body>

Under the Commonwealth Native Title Act, the settlement of native title claims may involve the transfer of land pursuant to an Indigenous land use agreement, an ILUA. Such a transfer may give rise to a dutiable transaction under the Duties Act, being either a transfer of land, an agreement to transfer land or an acquisition of a new right--that is, land--on its creation, grant or issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073216"></A>
Under an administrative arrangement, ex gratia relief from duty is provided to native title claimants in relation to transactions registered under an ILUA, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The explanatory notes accompanying the bill advise that the administrative arrangements for this process took effect on 3 May 2006 pending legislative amendment. The Duties Act is being amended to give the administrative arrangement prospective legislative effect. Reassessment provisions will also apply where a concession was not allowed but the relevant conditions were subsequently satisfied and where a concession was allowed but the eligibility requirements subsequently were not satisfied. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073219"></A>
Another proposed amendment in this bill pertaining to the Duties Act is that relating to the provision that provides transfer duty concessions for certain transactions involving registered managed investment schemes. A registered managed investment scheme is defined to mean a managed investment scheme registered under the Commonwealth Corporations Act. Subject to conditions, dealings in units in a trust which is a registered managed investment scheme do not attract transfer duty. The Duties Act is being amended to clarify that a registered managed investment scheme for the purposes of the Duties Act means a managed investment scheme within the meaning of the Commonwealth Corporations Act that is registered under that act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073220"></A>
The explanatory notes accompanying the bill insist that this amendment will ensure that where a scheme is registered under the Commonwealth Corporations Act, but for whatever reason is no longer a managed investment scheme within the meaning of that act, it will no longer constitute a registered managed investment scheme for the purposes of the Duties Act. My understanding of that explanation gives me some satisfaction. I must express some satisfaction that this amendment proposes to reduce a degree of tax relief for a scheme that I consider to be a form of tax avoidance that had a disastrous impact on my electorate of Hinchinbrook. I believe that unfair tax advantages are currently extended to managed investment schemes for plantation forestry. These tax advantages have resulted in a distortion in the demand for rural land and have driven illegitimate changes in land use, claiming large areas of prime agricultural land in North Queensland. In recent years, managed investment schemes have had a significant impact on the sugar industry, in particular in my electorate of Hinchinbrook but also right across the Innisfail district, the Tully district and the Herbert River district. The schemes were undermining the viability of the sugar industry as a whole, jeopardising jobs and, as a result, local communities in North Queensland, in particular in my electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073221"></A>
When the economy was booming, managed investment schemes were cashed up and were aggressively pursuing land and securing properties at inflated prices which distorted the market for land and undermined the viability of the sugar industry. The sugar industry in a particular area requires a critical mass of cane land to maintain the length of its crushing season which secures jobs in all sectors of the industry--in the growing sector, in the harvesting sector and in the milling sector. Losing agricultural land to plantation forestry means less cane through the mill during the crushing season. If the land under cane in a particular area supplying a mill falls to unviable levels, it is not worth that particular milling company firing the mill up at the start of the season. It does not just mean fewer farmers on the land, but it means fewer jobs in the harvesting sector--the men and women driving the harvesters and the haul-out operators. It also means fewer people in the sugar mills themselves and that is bad news for the local communities that I represent in my electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073222"></A>
These schemes were undermining the viability of sugar mills in North Queensland when the economy was booming. People with tax problems were pouring money into managed investment schemes for the tax breaks and with the downturn a number of these companies have collapsed. In their wake they have left massive environmental concerns for adjacent property owners who have not only had to contend with overgrown properties full of pest weeds and feral animals but also suffered the ignominy of reduced property values and experienced the reduced effectiveness of mill infrastructure where cane railway lines go past properties that are no longer used for producing sugar cane to service properties beyond that. That increased the inefficiency of the industry and has caused all sorts of dramas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073223"></A>
Now, amazingly, some of those properties are being disposed of by liquidators and some of them are being cleared and going back to cane. We have had a major and massive disruption for a number of years in the continuity of the operations of the sugar industry as a result of these managed investment schemes. It does give me some satisfaction that we are moving to ensure that these types of schemes pay duties where it is appropriate. In relation to the provisions of the bill that I have not addressed, I endorse the comments of the shadow Treasurer, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in that regard. <Hansard-Speech-End>

I want to direct my comments to the Iconic Queensland Places Act and wish it well and on its way. I also speak on behalf of the member for Keppel, who also represents the Rockhampton City Council which, as members would be aware, has found that this iconic places legislation is superfluous to good governance as far as it is concerned. One of the members opposite made reference to the now defunct Livingstone shire council having a role in this. That is undeniable. The outgoing mayor of Livingstone shire was a great proponent of this iconic places legislation because he saw it as a way of putting a cart in front of the horse of progress. He saw it as a deliberate way of putting a stone in the road, as it were, of the new council. He did it for the reasons that he always does things: personal animosity and gain. He is a person who is well known for his shady dealings over the years and he has managed to convince people to vote for him. He has this great and happy knack of being able to slide his way out of any issue that has been of his making. </A></Hansard-Body>

Recently he has been a critic of this particular legislation, despite the fact that the opposition now claims that he was personally involved in the drafting of it. Nothing would surprise me with this chap, Bill Ludwig--not the Bill Ludwig of AWU fame, who is a very honourable man as distinct from this gentlemen about whom I am speaking. This gentlemen, who is now on the Rockhampton City Council, is well known for his efforts in destabilising the Rockhampton City Council and recently during the floods, even though he is on the emergency committee, when I came to those meetings in the morning with the mayor, Brad Carter, Councillor Ludwig was either fiddling with his computer or asleep. He made no contribution whatsoever and as far as I can see makes no contribution of a positive nature to that council at all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073232"></A>
I am delighted that the progressive councillors in Rockhampton see themselves as being the masters of their own destiny and have the capacity to go about the planning needs of our council without need to reference further legislation to protect the Capricorn Coast. The net result of this legislation on the Capricorn Coast was that it held up developments that the council had already approved in certain instances and in other instances things that met the town plan were held up for long periods of time. I see the former minister nodding in agreement and I thank him for his tolerance in the many submissions that we have made over that time to try to do something about this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073233"></A>
This act was established for a couple of regions where there are iconic qualities. Both the member for Keppel and I know of the iconic qualities of Yeppoon and the Capricorn Coast and, indeed, are very proud of them, but we are very capable of making those arrangements in an elected council. That has always been my view, albeit that I have absolutely no faith in Councillor Ludwig to take anything other than self-interest to the council table. He has proven over many years that that is all he is capable of doing and he continues to exploit that circumstance. He works about a day a week, I think, and goes fishing for the rest of it; he stirs up a hornet’s nest and makes that look like it is hard work.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076818"></A>
It is one thing to make a contribution by way of a critique of council, but it is entirely another thing to have the will to simply wreck things that are in your way, which is what he brings to that table. I do not expect to get a Christmas card from the man, obviously. I am not exactly on speaking terms with him and that suits me fine. However, in reality, serving on local government carries with it enormous responsibility and an amalgamated council even more so. There has to be some trust and goodwill, but neither of those things applies to Councillor Bill Ludwig. He is incapable of working as a team member. He is there to wreck. As I have said, he has used this iconic places legislation as a method to halt progress for the council and to blame them. I place on record, for ever and a day, that the architect of that legislation coming to the Capricorn Coast was none other than Bill Ludwig. I hope everyone remembers that that is the case, despite his grotesque efforts to try to get himself out of the road of decision making and taking blame for anything he does. That is on the record now, for ever and a day. I could say plenty more about that individual, unsavoury character that he is, but I will leave that for another day. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The primary objective of this bill supposedly is to amend Queensland’s revenue legislation to maintain its currency and ensure its proper operation. To this effect, the omnibus bill seeks to amend or repeal some 25 acts. In effect, amendments are being made to a significant list of important issues that affect all corners of our great state, including the South-East Queensland water restructure through the merger of WaterSecure and Seqwater, the extension of urban water reform to outside South-East Queensland, changes to the Local Government Act and City of Brisbane Act, changes to the legislation governing Cape York parks, Sustainable Planning Act reforms and Duties Act changes covering disabled motor vehicle use. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076830"></A>
As the currency of the water issue prevails in my area, I shall limit my contribution to the amendments relating to the South East Queensland Water (Restructuring) Act 2007. The bill will amend parts of that act to introduce a statutory mechanism enabling the transfer of assets, liabilities, instruments and employees to facilitate the proposed merger of the Queensland Manufactured Water Authority, WaterSecure, and the Queensland Bulk Water Supply Authority, Seqwater, as well as future transfers of bulk water assets and associated liabilities from the government owned special-purpose vehicle construction companies to the bulk water authorities. The bill will incorporate transitional provisions for the proposed merger of Seqwater and WaterSecure, including a statutory exemption from transfer duty on the transaction and provisions confirming the protection of rights and entitlements of transferring employees. The bill will allow for the dissolution of WaterSecure upon the transfer of its assets, liabilities and employees and will remove the existing restriction on the number of directors that may be appointed to a board under the act. Currently, five members, including the chair, may be appointed. The merger of Seqwater and WaterSecure, which was announced by the government in late 2010, is to take effect from 1 July 2011. </Hansard-Body>

As any Gold Coast member would know, dissatisfaction with the Beattie-Bligh governments’ expensive water reforms has reached boiling point. I wish to add my voice to that of the half a million or so Gold Coasters who feel the state government is gouging their weekly wages and making it increasingly difficult for them to make ends meet. People on the Gold Coast are hurting. They are hurting as I have not seen in my 24 years as a Currumbin resident. More and more people are finding cost-of-living pressures unavoidable and in some cases unbearable. In fact, spiking living costs caused by a hike in fees from basic services such as water and electricity rated as the highest concern by far on a recent electorate-wide survey I conducted. The usual No. 1 item of concern, law and order, was beaten, as were other high priorities relating to health and transport. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076834"></A>
This is the sixth piece of water legislation to come before the House in as many years. It is no wonder electorates across the Gold Coast are furious. Every time this government amends legislation that has anything to do with restructuring water supplies in some way prices soar and innocent people suffer. In truth, Queenslanders are paying through the nose to repay the billions of dollars of debt incurred by the Beattie and Bligh governments. The honourable member for Callide described water reform as ‘convoluted and complex bureaucracy’ that has allowed wickedly high salaries for Allconnex executives, not to mention the cost of their large rented floor space in central Robina. </Hansard-Body>

Unfortunately, those predictions have already become reality. There is no relief in sight for taxpayers under this incompetent Bligh Labor government and certainly it will not come from the state government’s revised water operating strategy. In late 2010, the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 announced--or should I say ‘leaked’--that revised strategy, which included the option of shutting down the Tugun desalination plant, resulting in a $5--I repeat, $5--annual saving on household water bills. One reader of the <Hansard-Italic>

 described that forecast as ‘an unmitigated insult’ to struggling Queenslanders, and that is especially so for people in my electorate. </Hansard-Body>

In January this year, when Gold Coasters gingerly opened their water bills, they were shocked and upset, to say the least, at the figures that faced them. Increases of up to 20 per cent and beyond were seen across the city. Pensioners, retirees, single parents, ordinary families and our much admired community groups and clubs were all hit hard by the price jump. So fierce was the outrage felt by residents against water retailer Allconnex, the council and the state government that little else filled the papers, radio and nightly news broadcasts for weeks. Protests have erupted all over the Gold Coast in anger over these council owned, state government implemented water reforms.  </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076846"></A>
Starting as a Facebook group, the Disconex Allconnex movement, led by organiser Kirsty Strowger, has captivated our city. Not surprisingly, support for the protest group is growing by the day. I have now attended two protest rallies and a march organised by Disconex Allconnex which have brought together hundreds of people and attracted thousands of signatures on petitions. Several LNP members were in attendance but not a single Labor member. It is a bit rich for the member for Burleigh to criticise Campbell Newman’s comments when he visited the Gold Coast last weekend, when she and her comrades from Labor do not even attend a single protest rally. What have the members for Burleigh, Southport or Albert done to support their constituents and community groups facing crippling water bills? Nothing--absolutely nothing! I wonder if they will respond to the following email being circulated en masse to all members of parliament and bombarding their inboxes as mine was overnight. No fewer than 35 emails came through.

This bill contains provisions to facilitate the dissolution of WaterSecure, the manufactured water authority established to oversee the Gold Coast desalination project and the western corridor recycled water scheme.

On 1 October 2010 the state government officially commissioned and took over control of the Gold Coast desalination plant at Tugun in my electorate. Only then, after four years of drama and catastrophe, did the state government consider the plant up to standard. A continuous stream of faults delayed deadlines for the commissioning of the plant, first in November 2008 and then January 2009 and again in June 2010. Had the rains not come and Queensland’s worst drought persisted, the government would have failed completely to secure a drinking water supply for its South-East Queensland residents as the plant was not ready in time. Now we are told that the plant is to be placed on standby--a hot standby, if you please. This facility has had more episodes than <Hansard-Italic>
Days of our Lives</Hansard-Italic>
. Apart from its numerous faults and defects, it has also supposedly run at full capacity for questionable periods of time--that is, when it was not mothballed for repairs. These terms are not clearly understood by residents who just want to know that this monster of a building and pipes that were imposed upon them will be able to do the job they were built to do with parts that will last the 50 or more years they are supposed to. </Hansard-Body>

I do ask the Treasurer if he would inform the House what happens to the obligations and agreements relating to the Tugun desalination plant under this new legislation? How many jobs will be lost while this occurs? Does the Treasurer or his government plan to crank it up again in the near future? Is this the most cost-effective method of maintaining this plant? I do hope that the Treasurer will take these things on board because it would appear he is not listening to me right now. While we continue to hear the decision to place--</Hansard-Body>

While we continue to hear the decision to place the plant on hot standby is expected to save taxpayers $10.5 million a year, the government has been less than forthcoming as to what this process actually entails, exactly how much it will cost and how this will affect the longevity of the plant.

I will confine my remarks to those parts of the legislation that relate to national parks and the environment, being proposed new section 83LA which amends the Aboriginal Land Act 1991 as it relates to Cape York parks.

My concern with that paragraph is the word ‘jointly’. Normally when we use the word ‘jointly’ there is a sense of evenness or a sharing of responsibilities. I am concerned that traditional owners may be used in such a way that increased responsibilities will be placed on those persons in relation to the enforcement of laws, whether they be marine safety officers or conservation officers within those park areas. The explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1080571"></A>
The government has also made a commitment to expand the protected area estate in Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080572"></A>
This amendment will assist the government to expand two national parks--Iron Range and Lakefield--and increase the total protected area estate. As previously stated in this House, the Auditor-General in his 2010 report recommended that national parks should have a plan. In that report, the Auditor-General outlined the fact that of the 560 protected areas within Queensland only 98, or 17 per cent, actually had a plan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080573"></A>
Whilst I understand that the intent of this legislation is to work with the traditional owners in those areas, the government needs to take responsibility for providing those communities with the training that they need so that they do not falter in their supervisory responsibilities. I refer here to the responsibility of not just the traditional owners but also the state government to ensure that the laws of this state are properly enforced. </Hansard-Body>

I do have some concerns that I would like the minister to address in his summing-up. Looking at the map of the Iron Range National Park, I see that a number of resources reserves are shown. Looking at the map, I see that there are five different areas allocated as resources reserves. I would like the minister to allude to how section 83LA will affect any resource issues or negotiations in relation to those issues in that this subsection states that on commencement of this section a claim for the land ends. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1080614"></A>
In relation to those national parks, we currently have ILUAs, Indigenous land use agreements. They take in not only the land use of those areas but also the coastline and the ocean. When we talk about joint responsibility, this section will give them additional areas where the intent of both the government and the traditional owners has to be brought to the fore in relation to managing these national parks. I want to raise some concerns that we have in relation to putting pressure on traditional owners and in relation to the expectation of enforcement of the regulations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080615"></A>
We have seen previously in other bills that authorised officers have been given greater powers, more so than even the Police Service and the CMC. We have to ensure that people who are put in these positions of enforcing the laws of this state actually have the authority and undertake the proper training to ensure that that standard is maintained. We also have to ensure that, where they collect evidence, they have the resources to collect evidence to a high standard so that prosecutions do not fail later down the track. We have to ensure that we are not setting traditional owners up for failure if they have to present evidence in the District, Supreme or even higher courts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080617"></A>
In relation to the responsibility for park management and enforcing the law, we have to ensure that ethical practices are put in place, recognising traditional ownership and the great value of the extended family of traditional owners. We may have a situation where traditional owners have to charge their uncles or aunties or mothers and fathers who may have committed an offence. We may be putting undue pressure on these conservation and marine park officers who may be related to other traditional owners of the areas they are responsible for managing. I am sure that, pound for pound, they will have the intestinal fortitude to enforce the laws. But, when we talk about joint responsibility, it is incumbent upon us to give those Indigenous people within the community the proper training and understanding and expectation of upholding those laws within the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080619"></A>
We also have to ensure, as other members have said, that we have a national park management plan in place and that, while we have people visiting those areas and bringing in certain fauna and flora that are not native to those areas, those areas are given financial assistance in relation to pest mitigation. We talk about deer, pigs and other feral animals, but there are also seeds and other non-native fauna and flora that we need to get on top of in these beautiful but vulnerable areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080620"></A>
I understand the intent of this legislation. I understand the need for these amendments. I understand the need for a number of other amendments in relation to the management of national parks throughout the state. But, once again, as the Auditor-General said in his 2010 report, only 17 per cent of national parks have a national park management plan in place--98 of 576. That signifies a lack of commitment by this government. I implore the state government to step up to the mark, to raise the bar in relation to Queenslanders’ expectations for the proper management of national parks. The government needs to ensure it is not copping out by giving responsibility to traditional owners without giving them the proper resources and finances to do what is needed within those park areas. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The general comment is that it is a way of harmonising and getting rid of red tape associated with a wide range of legislation dealing with revenue. I am happy to support any measures that will meaningfully get rid of red tape. </A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1080629"></A>
Probably the best conversation I have had in relation to red tape was with the deputy mayor of Bundaberg, Mr Tony Ricciardi. We were talking about the special economic zones and the plans that we have for the Burnett. In a pause in the discussion he told me how he travelled back to his homeland of Italy and, while visiting his relatives, visited the Colosseum. He had one of those historical moments at the Colosseum when the weight of history bore down on him. He was overwhelmed by the great courage and deeds that had been carried out at the Colosseum. I said to him, ‘I understand what else you were thinking about as the deputy mayor of Bundaberg.’ He said, ‘What do you mean?’ I said, ‘Well, you were thinking: imagine the development application on this place.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080632"></A>
It is something that we have to take into account, because I think we have reached the stage in our state life and in our national life where the red tape, the rules and regulations, are starting to strangle our ability to achieve greatness--to achieve greatness as a state and to achieve greatness as a nation. Whenever entrepreneurs in our community look to invest, they run into a wall of red tape, especially in the local government area. They run into a wall of charges, and those charges are going up and up and up. What we are doing is limiting the future of our young people, of our grandchildren, by not getting a hold on this. I am happy that this bill makes a small attempt at reducing red tape. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080634"></A>
In his second reading speech the Treasurer talked about payroll tax. Payroll tax is a favourite subject of mine because there are many different entrepreneurs and businesses in the Burnett that have to pay payroll tax, especially in the Isis area. We are the largest producers of tomatoes in the Southern Hemisphere. We are the largest producers of avocados in the Southern Hemisphere. Until recent times, there was not any value-adding to these valuable primary products. We did not have the tomato paste factory or the tomato sauce factory. The business community of Childers is asking the question, ‘Why don’t we have these value-adding opportunities?’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080639"></A>
I spoke with Andrew Philip, the owner of SP Exports, who is, as I mentioned, the largest tomato grower. It really came down to headworks charges and state government charges. I think he mentioned that he paid something like half a million dollars a week in payroll alone. He employed hundreds and hundreds of people. When I mentioned to him that I had an opportunity to speak with the Treasurer about payroll tax, he got quite excited. He said that it is one of his favourite subjects and that he has been trying to seek a reduction in payroll tax. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080640"></A>
After the recent economic downturn, the natural disasters and the problems that the whole community is suffering as a result of those natural disasters, I think now is the time to mount the argument for a reduction in payroll tax. John Russo and I are meeting with the Treasurer tomorrow, and we are very grateful for the opportunity to meet the Treasurer. In that meeting we will be making the case for special economic zones in regional and rural areas, specifically in the Isis and Childers areas, and in those special economic zones we would like to see a dramatic reduction in payroll tax, for example, and other state government charges. In his second reading speech the Treasurer stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1080680"></A>
Other beneficial changes being made by the bill ensure that payroll tax is not payable on benefits exempt under the Commonwealth Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986, and remove the requirement under the Payroll Tax Act 1971 to group a company with another company as related corporations where one of the companies holds its interest in the other company on trust. Both measures will improve harmonisation of payroll tax arrangements with other states and territories. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1080681"></A>
Later on his speech the Treasurer states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1080683"></A>
The Payroll Tax Act 1971 will be amended to ensure that, where two or more members of a group together have a controlling interest in a business, all the members of the group and the persons who carry on the business together constitute a group. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080684"></A>
I welcome those initiatives. I know the shadow Treasurer talked about how much the state received in revenue from payroll tax. From memory, I think it is about $3 billion. I have had this discussion with him before in other surrounds. It would be good if we could get rid of payroll tax, but, of course, what we are left with is a $3 billion hole in the budget. That particular reality scares a lot of people off. As politicians in this state I think we now have to not only focus on the potential $3 billion hole but also focus on the economic benefits and the revenue that would flow in and the boost to manufacturing and the boost to our rural and regional areas if we were able to phase out this insidious tax which everyone knows is a tax on employment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080685"></A>
When the government of the day, either of the Labor persuasion or most likely the LNP persuasion, talks about wanting to create job opportunities, the best thing it can do is get out of the way of the entrepreneurs in the rural and regional areas which, let us face it, produce most of the income for this state and cut back taxes and charges, especially payroll tax. I would like the government and the LNP opposition--the government of course has the resources--to commission studies which look at financial modelling. We can do modelling on the end of the world and how bad carbon is. We can predict the world’s temperatures and how much the oceans will rise. Why can we not do modelling and find out what the economic benefits would be if we got rid of payroll tax? Imagine a Queensland with no payroll tax. I see the look on the faces of both the shadow Treasurer and the Treasurer--it is not convincing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080686"></A>
We should have that conversation. All members of the business community and specifically those in rural and regional areas would like us as leaders of the community to have that conversation. We need to allocate some resources and get those studies and that modelling done so we can find out how many jobs would be created and what boost there would be to the entrepreneurial spirit in the bush. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080687"></A>
We really need to do this. It is a challenge that both sides of politics will have to undertake so that Queensland can become the greatest state again in terms of manufacturing. Mining is humming along well but we have problems in our manufacturing industry. We have problems in our horticultural industry and in our rural industries. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080689"></A>
I was just speaking with Craig Van Rooyen before I came into the chamber to deliver this speech. The orchardists and the lychee growers around the Isis district are suffering terribly. People are starting to bulldoze their crops because of the red tape imposed by this government in terms of pest mitigation permits. Because this government will not give them their pest mitigation permits they are forced to come up with hundreds of thousands of dollars to install lights and run those lights and they have to have sound makers. When they could shoot half a dozen flying foxes they could protect their crops from these pests. In one night my farmers lost $30,000 in crop. These are running costs that farmers are incurring throughout Queensland. Add to that payroll tax. They cannot afford that. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I can hear murmuring from the Labor side. They are saying, ‘Come on. You can’t kill small bats.’ It is their arrogance that really upsets me and their lack of empathy for businesspeople and their lack of empathy for regional and rural growers. It is an attitudinal thing that we have to get through. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080692"></A>
Local government amalgamation is mentioned in this bill. Many members have spoken about the forced local government amalgamations. The member for Dalrymple said that you could hear a pin drop in here when Peter Beattie announced the forced local government amalgamations. People were stunned. I can remember saying to the then Premier, ‘And what are you going to do after launch? Are you going to invade Poland?’ It was that draconian. It is hard to see the benefits. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080693"></A>
What really worries me is that the member for Callide--and I understand that he has empathy for the rural and regional communities--has admitted defeat with regard to this matter. I have heard all the cliches--you can’t unscramble the egg, you can’t put the water back into a tap. I disagree. I think we can go out there with a new government and offer deamalgamation to those communities that would like deamalgamation. Communities like Noosa would definitely go for it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080694"></A>
The communities of Childers and Isis are desperate to deamalgamate because their communities have gone backwards under amalgamation with the Bundaberg Regional Council. This is for a whole range of issues. I have empathy and sympathy for local governments because this government has cut out the 40 per cent infrastructure charge. It means that they have to find money somewhere else. What they have typically done is increased their rates, increased their water charges and increased their headworks charges. I have brought examples of those increases in headwork charges to this House.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080697"></A>
The old Isis shire council comprised a bunch of entrepreneurial spirits. They understood how communities grew and flourished. They would offer a three-year rate-free zone for businesses coming in. They understood that it was hard for businesses to get going. But those businesses, once established, were able to employ more and more people and offer benefits and wealth to the community and those communities were able to flourish. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080699"></A>
That entrepreneurial spirit--dare I say it, that can-do spirit--does not exist within the Bundaberg Regional Council. There needs to be a cultural change. The words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, ‘Give me the broom, I want to clean house,’ is a philosophy that this government would benefit from as well as the regional councils, especially the Bundaberg Regional Council. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080701"></A>
There are high headwork charges, as I mentioned. There are also drainage problems. The basic infrastructure is not being looked after. We would not have found those sorts of problems when we had deamalgamated councils. It has been proven over the years that bigger is not better. Bigger just means bigger rates, bigger bills and less service. Democracy has been diluted. The Isis and Childers regions desperately want their local government back. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080730"></A>
This bill will enable small variations of those boundaries. The powers of this bill will be welcomed by the communities of Baffle Creek and those communities around the Rosedale area. Those communities are on the border between the Gladstone Regional Council and the Bundaberg Regional Council. The community of interest for Baffle Creek is Bundaberg; it is not Gladstone, yet it is in the Gladstone Regional Council area. I can see a community like Baffle Creek making the case and asking for a boundary realignment under the provisions relating to local government amalgamation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080739"></A>
I turn now to water charges. The people of Agnes Water and 1770 are very upset by the desalination plant that has been placed in their community. We fought it for so long. It is a $40 million desal plant for a community that has around 700 ratepayers. For so many reasons it just does not make sense. It does not make economic sense, it does not make social sense and it does not make environmental sense. It is placed on a beach where two endangered species of turtles nest. To make matters worse, the communities of 1770 and Agnes Water pay--I stand to be corrected--the most in water charges in Australia. They have the highest rates. Residents at Agnes Water and 1770 pay $4.50 per kilolitre. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080743"></A>
Bruce Rhoades, a very active community social activist, has done some comparisons of water access fees between the Rockhampton Regional Council and the Gladstone Regional Council. The water access fee in Rockhampton is $279.90 per annum while in the Gladstone Regional Council area it is $262 per annum in the Gladstone area and $438 per annum in the Agnes Water area. That is just the access fee, so there is up to 57 per cent more in charges in the Gladstone region. The sewerage access fee is $454.50 per annum in the Rockhampton Regional Council area while it ranges from $397 per annum in the Gladstone area to $864 per annum in the Agnes Water and 1770 areas--that is, up to 92 per cent more in the Gladstone and 1770 areas. The rates on a $197,500 block of land are $1,323.25 in the Rockhampton Regional Council area and $2,053.85 in the Gladstone area--that is, 55 per cent more. In terms of the total for the water access fee and the sewerage access fee in rates, in Rockhampton it is $2,057.55 per annum whereas it ranged from $2,712.85 in the Gladstone region to $3,365.85 in the Agnes Water and 1770 region. That is a range of 31 per cent to 63 per cent greater in the Gladstone overall area. Mr Rhoades makes his case well.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080752"></A>
After speaking with the community of 1770 and Agnes Water I learned that the start-up fees for a business are just phenomenal. If one wanted to open a bed and breakfast at Gladstone the start-up fee would be around $30,000 whereas in Agnes Water and 1770 it would be about $60,000. I understand that the councils are being forced to levy these charges because of the lack of funds from the state government, but I think it has reached a stage where it is absolutely critical that we cut back on red tape in both areas of government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080754"></A>
Going back to the desal plant, I still shake my head and just cannot fathom why the state government is pouring $30 million into this desal plant. It is not needed; it is not wanted. If you could wave a magic wand and get it going now, the area would not need the water because there is plenty of underground water. The growth rates that this plant was built on are grossly exaggerated. There is an underground aquifer that is capable of supplying four or five megalitres a day and the community is drawing 0.7 of a megalitre, so the community is not going to run out of water. I merely raise this issue because the community is devastated. It knows that it could spend that $40 million--$10 million from the council and $30 million from the state government--much more wisely on roads, upgrading the Essendean Bridge, putting in a high school at Agnes Water, decreasing the costs for businesses and allowing communities to grow and prosper. I commend the bill to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110405_173458" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Mirani--LNP) (5.34 pm): It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on the Revenue and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, which is a bitzer bill in that it amends 16 acts and repeals a further 11 acts. The shadow minister and others on my side of the parliament have spoken at length on most aspects of the bill, but it is very important to speak about the duty concessions that are available through this bill for people with disabilities. Given the cost of living, the resources that are required to support people with disabilities are increasing all of the time. Today in this House we heard about the increased cost of rates, the increased cost of fuel, the increased cost of groceries and all of those other things that we have to buy to live in this society. When we take into account people who have disabilities and their limited access to many services, every little bit that can be given to them to enable them to have a sustainable and reasonably supportive lifestyle is of great help. It is quite significant that special disability trusts have been brought into play under this legislation, which means that their houses are to be exempted from duty. Modifications to their vehicles et cetera are also to be exempted from duty.</A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1080765"></A>
Depending on the disability, the cost of modifying vehicles for people with disabilities to get around and lead a half-decent lifestyle is quite high. That cost is rising all of the time with different types of vehicles being modified, as is the cost of hiring a person who is qualified to make those modifications. As most people would realise, those modifications have to be certified by Transport. That is another piece of red tape that makes it difficult and costly to have these modifications made. This legislation exempts the duty for those modifications and of course the ongoing costs of the vehicle itself. Also, once a vehicle is modified it has a reduced capacity in the second-hand market to gain a premium and therefore there is a loss of value for the vehicle once it is modified. That is a step in the right direction and I commend the Treasurer for making that concession. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1080768"></A>
I congratulate the government for most aspects of this bill. To a certain extent it limits some of the red tape that we have seen in recent years and also winds back some of the excesses that we have seen from this government, such as the debate we had on the iconic places legislation. We all knew that that was a farce and now finally the government has admitted it by rescinding that legislation and putting the provisions back into the planning act. With those few words, I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.39 pm): This bill makes a lot of mechanical amendments to a large amount of legislation. Some 16 acts are amended and another 11 acts are repealed. But this revenue bill comes in under the shadow of the massive debt that this state is facing by the year 2012 of some $80 billion. The interesting thing about that debt is that the government was facing a debt of $84.5 billion but it has now sold off $15 billion of income earning assets--assets that were earning more in income than in interest the government would have saved. Those assets have been sold off and the debt has not come down from $85 billion to $70 billion. It has come down to only $80 billion. So under this government the deterioration of the financial situation of this state continues. When you look at what has happened to our neighbours in New South Wales, where people regard that state as a basket case, I understand that their debt situation is not as bad as it is here in Queensland. Certainly, that state still holds its AAA rating. Queensland has lost its AAA rating--the only state in Australia to lose it--and as a result it has to pay an additional amount on loans that are negotiated. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085089"></A>
The problem with this debt is that it goes right down to the average person and it hits everybody in their pocket. That is why we have a massive cost of living, because the government has to find a way of finding these massive interest costs that arise from this debt that by 2012 will be $80 billion. That means dividends on electricity, water, drivers’ licences and registration. So people have less and less and less in their pockets to the point at which it affects the way in which they live. They cannot go to small businesses. Clothing shops are feeling the pinch, because people have less money in their pocket. They have to pay for their electricity, their water, their gas, their registration, their drivers’ licences and another 10c a litre in petrol tax on their fuel. That affects small business and in turn that has a very damaging effect on our community and our economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085090"></A>
But what it also does--and this is how things collapse inwards when you have massive debt--is that people can no longer afford private health insurance. So they start going to public hospitals. So the waiting lists get longer. People cannot afford to go to a private dentist. So the waiting list for dental care gets longer, because they have hundreds and thousands of dollars of extra per year in the basic cost of living. People must be shaking in their boots to think that they are now going to have imposed on them a further cost in this theoretical mumbo jumbo of a carbon tax, which will end up seeing Australia having a more complicated system around that tax that is probably just as complicated as the tax system itself--with rebates here and there and all sorts of bureaucracy and red tape. I think people are wising up to what that will do to this massive cost of living that they have already. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085091"></A>
Although this bill does not address in a substantial way increasing income to the government, as I said, it is under the shadow and the pall of this massive debt that has been foisted on the people of Queensland and it is a debt that is delivering real pain to everybody in every average household throughout the state. </Hansard-Body>

I want to speak to a couple of aspects of this bill. One is the issue of the water bodies. I want to make the point that one of the reasons water is so dear is that it comes through the three-tiered level of wholesale, distribution, retail and then finally to the consumers who have to pay for their access fees and who have to pay for the actual use of water as well. One of the major cost imposts is the government’s directive of a nine or 10 per cent return that has to be made on the water grid. So we have an approximately $10 billion water grid. Probably about $3 billion of that or more was absolutely dud money that people are paying a dividend on. For example, the western corridor recycled water pipeline ballooned up from about $1.4 billion to $2.8 billion. This government absolutely and totally mismanaged and wasted taxpayers’ money. On top of that, the water pipeline is hardly used. Then we have the desalination plant at Tugun, which the member for Currumbin has spoken about. Then we have the Traveston Dam. About $700 million was wasted there. So all of this massive waste, mismanagement and improper planning--getting out there and saying that it is going to be finished by a certain date when there is no chance of it ever being finished by that date and then the costs just blowing out through roof--has meant that we have this massive component within the total cost of the South-East Queensland water grid that ultimately consumers are paying for. They are paying for a return on billions of dollars of dud and wasted money. If they were paying a return on something that was worthwhile, it might be a little bit more acceptable, but it leaves a nasty taste in the mouths of councils and consumers that they have to pay this dividend or return on an investment that was so badly managed and had such cost overruns and which, right from the start, was probably typical of the mismanagement of this particular Labor government. </Hansard-Body>

There is an amendment in this bill which relates to the houses and cars of people with disabilities. That issue has been tidied up so that stamp duty is not paid, for example, on the modification that has to be made to cars. I welcome that, because people who have a child with a disability or who have a family member with a disability often face an incredible increase in the cost of the purchase of a car. If they have to purchase a vehicle that can take a wheelchair for a child who has grown into a teenager or a young adult and who can no longer be assisted into the seat of the car but whose wheelchair has to go into the back of the car, that can cost tens of thousands of dollars in modification costs. Very often, as a result of the disability of their family member, instead of both parents being able to work only one of them is able to work and the other one has to be a full-time carer. </Hansard-Body>

This bill raises the issue of water licences during the reconstruction after the floods and natural disasters. I have some queries about that issue. As I understand from reading the bill, the government does not have to go through the process of obtaining particular licences and permits to access water. Does that mean that it can go on to private property and suck water out of dams for water tankers that are doing road reconstruction? I think we need an explanation of what it is the government is able to do. Is it just a temporary matter during the reconstruction after the floods and the natural disasters, or is the provision going to be permanent to enable this government to take water from various sources, be it private sources or government owned corporation sources, to circumvent the usual permits that are required by others who may wish to acquire that water? </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1085096"></A>
The bill also contains some technical provisions regarding payroll tax. I know that payroll tax can be almost a penalty on people who are successful enough to create about 20 or more jobs. I remember talking not long ago to a stock agent who had built up a business on the Downs. The agency game is a pretty tough game to be in. It involves long hours working at saleyards around Dalby, Taroom and on the Western Downs. That business was built up by the hard work of the three guys who commenced that business. Of course, once they made it successful enough to employ people in some of those towns at a time when jobs were needed, they hit the magic barrier of around 20 employees and were penalised for being successful and penalised for creating jobs and penalised for providing a service to people in the rural areas of the state. I know that this is a difficult issue for both sides of the House, because payroll tax has become one of the major components of the income of the state. That has to be understood and appreciated, but I think payroll tax is an issue that always has to be watched carefully and endeavoured to be improved, particularly for those people who are in small business and who by dint of hard work are able to grow their businesses and provide job opportunities for people. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1085097"></A>
This bill also addresses the issue of the RNA at the Brisbane exhibition grounds and tidies up some matters to do with the RNA’s registration as a charitable organisation, particularly if the enterprise ever had to be wound up--and we would certainly hope and be confident that that would never, ever happen. But the bill addresses those technicalities to enable certain charitable institution taxation benefits to apply. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085126"></A>
We all wish the RNA well under the current leadership of Allan Warby and his committee and Jonathan Tunny and his staff as they undertake this major venture. I was involved in selling the old Toowoomba showgrounds and buying and developing the new Toowoomba showgrounds. I know what a massive effort it is. We had a new greenfield site where we could undertake earthworks and construction without having to run the day-to-day events which we continued to run at the old showgrounds. This massive redevelopment will have its moments of difficulty as the RNA tries to run events at the same time--the Ekka and the other exhibitions that are necessary--but a lot of planning and thought has gone into it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085131"></A>
It is a magnificent site. We are a lucky city to be blessed with an area that is basically in the geographic heart of our city. It would be very difficult to ever shift that to another site on the outskirts of Brisbane. It has always been blessed by the fact it has a railway line through the centre of it with a railway station, as well as a lot of history and a lot of feeling. It is well loved by the people of Brisbane and the rest of Queensland. I support this aspect of the legislation which will assist the RNA in some of the technical aspects as it goes into this venture. A lot of time and thought has gone into the plan. It is worthy of government, public and private support. It is a great plan. It will enhance that facility and be a great addition to the lifestyle and activities of the people of Brisbane and a great addition to Brisbane as the capital of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085132"></A>
I emphasise the financial morass that this state has fallen into with this $80 billion debt. It is a massive debt with a massive interest cost that will be around for many, many years to come. It has a capital component that will require many, many years of sacrifice to pay off a debt of that size. The sad thing about that debt is that it is hurting ordinary, average people and is the direct and indirect driver of the cost-of-living increases that have hit everybody in this state. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for State Development and Trade) (5.52 pm), in reply: I thank all members for their contribution to the debate. I want to deal with a number of the substantive issues that were raised by members in their contributions. Firstly the shadow Treasurer raised an issue about testamentary trusts which, as he pointed out, is a matter of ongoing work. It is something that the Queensland Law Society and the Office of State Revenue are working closely together on. God bless them both for that effort. In that regard I think there is a process that is underway to make an assessment about any unintended consequences. </Hansard-Body>

In relation to the revenue matters, the member for Gladstone raised a question about whether her interpretation was correct. The answer to her is, in fact, yes, it is. In relation to Cape York plans, a couple of members raised questions about whether or not they were funded. The answer is that they are and there are agreements in place. </Hansard-Body>

A number of members raised questions about the urban water provisions--that is, the requirement for councils outside the south-east corner to provide for system leakage plans in outdoor water use efficiency plans. The timetable for those has been amended to recognise the levels of water security around the state. As I mentioned in my second reading speech, it comes in response to requests from councils about the priorities that they have at this point in time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085141"></A>
In relation to the amendments to the South East Queensland Water (Restructuring) Act, the targeted savings are $1.4 million. In terms of the executive structure, the number of directors is planned to go from eight across the two businesses down to five. There are presently five on each board, and that will move to six or seven. I note in that regard that the average across government boards, as noted by the Webbe-Weller review, was 6.6 members. The obvious point here is that with the merger there will be both less in terms of the management structure and fewer board members overall, but it is appropriate, in terms of the very different nature of operating the produced water assets compared to the dam assets of Seqwater, that there be provision made for that expertise to be added to the Seqwater board which is overall an efficiency measure contained within the proposed amendments of this legislation. </Hansard-Body>

The member for Redlands, in his capacity as the relevant shadow minister, raised questions about the provisions relating to the taking of water. In that regard there are no fees to be charged. There will be no application fees. They are being provided here for the purposes of reconstruction. In that regard, the ability to access that water is being prioritised in order to enable reconstruction. It is the case that there is a strong requirement for a policy that governs the allocation and indeed the proper pricing of water in more general terms, but that is being worked around given the priority around flood reconstruction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085143"></A>
I also want to note the report from the member for Gladstone of the particularly enlightened comments of the chief executive of the Gladstone Regional Council, Graeme Kanofski, who has had a conversion in his views on amalgamation. In that regard it is always incumbent upon me, for old time’s sake at least, to note the particularly antediluvian comments of the retrograde member for Warrego, who once again proved that the more time rolls on the less he changes. </Hansard-Body>

(5.57 pm): I rise to speak in my capacity as shadow minister for fair trading to the Body Corporate and Community Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010, which was introduced into the House on 23 November 2010 by the then Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading, the honourable member for Southport. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1085179"></A>
This bill amends the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997, the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Regulation 2009 and the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Rules 2009. The bill’s main objectives are to amend the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997 to provide a new lot entitlements system to limit the ability to adjust contribution schedule lot entitlements and give owners in existing community titles schemes a right to reverse previously adjusted contribution schedule lot entitlements to their original position; and to simplify the management of residential community titles schemes which are comprised of only two lots. A specified two-lot-scheme module is being developed providing that a body corporate for a two-lot scheme will not have a body corporate committee, hold general meetings or be required to conduct polling or voting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089378"></A>
As the former minister mentioned in his second reading speech, the two-lot model is being progressed and is expected to be operational in mid-2011. This is projected to potentially affect 12,000 community titles schemes, which is almost one-third of schemes in Queensland--a significant proportion indeed. This follows a review in 2006-07 of the existing regulations under the BCCM Act, which identified a need for a new module to simplify management arrangements for two-lot residential community titles schemes. Further provisions in this bill are designed to enhance the disclosure requirements for the sale of a lot and provide for more content to be included in the community management statement, the CMS, for a community titles scheme. All of those provisions are purportedly designed to enhance consumer protection and transparency and add certainty to lot owners. However, concerns have been raised about the ability of this bill to effectively achieve those aims. I will canvass those in detail later. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089381"></A>
Before going any further, I thank the former minister for providing me with a briefing from departmental staff: Mr Ivan Catlin, the executive manager of Marketplace Strategy; Mr Chris Irons, director of Fair Trading Policy; Ms Julie Clayton, the principal policy and legislation officer; and Mrs Wendy Bourne, policy adviser from the minister’s office. No doubt, like me, they are somewhat frustrated at the lack of accurate data available. I asked Mr Catlin for some information regarding two-lot schemes. He gave a commitment to send me the information, but the then minister avoided giving me an answer in his correspondence dated 17 February of this year. All I wanted to know was how the new two-lot scheme differed from the small schemes introduced in 1997 by then Minister Hobbs. Surely that was not too difficult. Perhaps the new minister, who I see is in the House now, will be more obliging. I was also unsatisfied with the reply to my questions as to how many applications were in progress and how many of the 216 submissions were in support of this bill and how many were against. It is this reluctance or inability to supply requested information that causes me disquiet with aspects of this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089384"></A>
As I have stated in debate on previous legislation relating to matters body corporate, my husband and I own property in a complex that falls under the provisions contained within the Body Corporate and Community Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. To avoid any accusations from members opposite, I add that the unit complex has not applied for an adjustment. Of course, honourable members do not know if the former minister has a property that underwent an adjustment or if the current minister is in that situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089385"></A>
Over the past decade or so the BCCM Act has undergone several reviews and amendments and attracted an inordinate amount of comment from individuals, lawyers and industry stakeholders. It has been described as complex, confusing, biased, unbalanced and more. Community titles schemes take many forms, including duplexes, home unit blocks, townhouse complexes, high-rise apartment buildings and some commercial premises. The very nature of community living, which is being chosen by an ever-increasing number of people for reasons ranging from lifestyle changes and security to affordability, means that governments have an obligation to review legislation on a regular basis to make sure it is pertinent to current needs. Local, national and international financial scenarios aside, a reduction in the size of individual footprints is the direction in which the future is heading. Smaller allotments in city precincts reflect a global trend in order to accommodate growing populations. Let us look at the Gold Coast for an example. It is a leader in high-rise developments, but exactly how best to manage population sustainability is a debate for another date. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089386"></A>
According to a library brief I requested, community titles legislation was first introduced into Queensland in 1965--over 45 years ago--to deal with the collective ownership of property and assets. A body corporate was created for each community titles scheme and lot owners automatically become members. Lot entitlements are used to determine how costs and interests in a community titles scheme are divided between owners and the voting rights of owners in certain circumstances. This act was followed by BUGTA, the Building Units and Group Titles Act 1980, which introduced a single schedule of lot entitlements for community titles schemes. The original BCCM Act was introduced in 1997 by a coalition government. The minister at that time, the honourable member for Warrego, who I am pleased to say is still a member of the parliament, introduced a bill that gained positive world recognition. Ivan Catlin, the executive manager of Marketplace Strategy, said that the bill was very cleverly drafted and agreed that it was landmark legislation. I might add that Labor did not oppose the 1997 legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089388"></A>
Importantly, the 1997 act introduced two types of lot entitlement schedules, an interest schedule and a contribution schedule. In order to provide honourable members with a brief explanation about this undeniably confusing and complicated landscape, I will run through the definitions of those terms as per the explanatory notes of the 2003 BCCM amendment bill. The ‘interest schedule’ defines the relative ownership of common property in the scheme and is used to determine contributions for those matters that are generally related to the value of the individual lots, such as rates and insurance. The ‘contribution schedule’ is used to determine contributions for those matters that relate to the day-to-day operation of the scheme and generally should be shared equally amongst all lots. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089389"></A>
Currently, contribution schedule lot entitlements must be set equal, except to the extent to which it is just inequitable in the circumstances for them not to be equal. Most body corporate expenses are proportioned by each lot’s contribution schedule lot entitlement, which is used to pay for common and shared expenses drawn from the body corporate administration fund and sinking fund. Moneys used by the body corporate to pay for the long-term expenses of running or improving the complex, for example to repaint the building, are referred to as a sinking fund. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089390"></A>
In the example of a typical complex, the cost distribution of utilities is as follows. Each unit is usually metered for electricity consumption and hot water. Common property is metered for electricity, cold water consumption and swimming pool heating gas consumption. The body corporate expenses typically come from the administrative fund and the owners receive equal benefit. These are management fees for caretaking of the common property, body corporate management fees, legal fees, pest control, garden and grounds maintenance, pool and spa maintenance, lift maintenance and security, to name a few. The following common property contingent expenses are paid by the body corporate from its sinking fund and owners receive equal benefit: examples include roof membrane replacement, electrical fittings, carpet to passageways, reception area furniture, water pumps, garage and driveway door replacement and so on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089391"></A>
In Brisbane, residents in unit complexes affected by flooding are finding out that they may be paying substantial costs to rectify flood damage as it is almost impossible for bodies corporate to secure flood insurance. Considering the pressure placed on households from rising water and electricity costs under successive Labor governments, it is no wonder the contribution schedule lot entitlement has been an issue loaded with contention in recent years. Rather than admitting that the Labor Party now thinks it got it wrong, in his second reading speech the former minister mischievously tried to incriminate the coalition for its 1997 legislation by stating--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1089393"></A>
There has been no single cause of the problem. A chain of events and decisions over time, including a failure in 1997 to fully appreciate the transitional implications arising from the enactment of the BCCM Act, have combined to give rise to the current problem. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089394"></A>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs STUCKEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
--that upset the apple cart, so to speak. The former minister should know better than to distort the facts. Bewilderingly, the 2003 BCCM debate, which the former minister and honourable member for Southport actually spoke to, was not mentioned in his second reading speech and was not referred to in the explanatory notes. Therefore, it is a bit rich to try to buck-pass to the 1997 legislation, which was brought in by the conservatives. Members on the other side are good at gilding the lily for their own advantage. In the 2003 debate, the former minister contained his short comments to provisions pertaining to the statutory easements, but he still voted in support of it, saying--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1089400"></A>
In 2003, not one member of parliament opposed the bill. In 2003, 66 of the 89 members were ALP members. Now we have a new minister. In 2003, the Deputy Premier was a member of this House when the legislation was passed. The former minister’s complete lack of ownership of Labor’s 2003 amendments reveals that he is either too embarrassed to acknowledge Labor’s efforts in 2003 or he has chosen to adopt Bligh’s attitude of denial, preferring to pass the buck to the opposition. In his second reading speech, the then minister stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1093460"></A>
We have a problem in the marketplace. It needs to be fixed. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093461"></A>
Does that not take the cake? The minister is declaring that there is a problem in the marketplace that needs fixing, but he fails to tell the truth and say that, if indeed there is a problem, his government created it and he voted for it. The former minister has been caught welching on his own word. But then only in the last month we have seen our Prime Minister backflip on an election promise that there would be no carbon tax. There is a name for people who do that but I cannot use it in this place. Let us just say that it is not very flattering. </Hansard-Body>

 In 2004 the BCCM Act underwent review and in 2006-07 the regulations to the act were also reviewed by the strategic policy section of the Department of Justice and Attorney-General culminating in the introduction of the current regulations in 2008. Significant amendments were made to the act in 2007 as a result of the 2004 review, which the library kindly found for me. Specifically, these were amendments related to improving dispute resolution functions of the BCCM Act to focus on self-resolution, expanding the jurisdiction of the then Commercial and Consumer Tribunal and introducing a code of conduct for body corporate committee members. A discussion paper released in December 2008 by the then Attorney-General called <Hansard-Italic>

 was released because, as is stated in the introduction--</Hansard-Body>

No doubt it was at the behest of the honourable member for Southport while he was a humble backbencher. An article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 on 19 May 2008 expressed the honourable member’s concerns and the fact that he was meeting with the Attorney to seek a review of what was labelled a controversial law, one brought in by his own government. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1093474"></A>
A more recent article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 on 27 September 2010 reported that the then minister was exceptionally keen to have the new laws introduced as quickly as possible. What the article did not spell out was that the honourable member for Southport intended throwing out the very legislation he had praised as important in 2003 in order to achieve the changes. Honourable members really have to wonder about the reason behind this legislation. It was put to me by one local Southport resident that the honourable member is worried about losing his seat at the next election and he is trying to appease voters with this legislation.</Hansard-Body>

The Body Corporate and Community Management Act has always included the ability to apply for lot entitlement adjustments. I will repeat that: the Body Corporate and Community Management Act has always included the ability to apply for lot entitlement adjustments. It is the way they are permitted to occur that varies with new amendments that come before the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093478"></A>
Adjustment methods were introduced in the original 1997 act and the options were that two or more owners could agree to adjust their own entitlements between themselves, a body corporate could adjust the lot entitlements through a resolution without consent or a lot owner could apply to the District Court for an order for the adjustment of lot entitlements. Amendments by the Labor government in 2003 introduced the ability for lot owners to apply to a specialist adjudicator as an alternative to the District Court for lot entitlement adjustment orders. This was considered to be fair for all. Furthermore, the 2003 amendments enshrined that the equality principle, which courts were obliged to consider for adjustment orders, also had to be adopted by developers in the first instance when they set contribution schedule lot entitlements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093479"></A>
Labor’s 2003 amendments extended and simplified existing processes so that lot owners unhappy with their lot entitlement distribution had a more accessible option to have their lot entitlement adjusted. This exercise came at significant personal cost to those who took this course of action--anywhere between $10,000 and $20,000 I am told--as the process was very thorough. Currently, if one owner in a community titles scheme is successful in having their contribution to shared costs revised down, others in the scheme have their share increased or balanced to compensate. Undoubtedly, there have been some cases where people have been negatively affected by the flow-on from adjusted lot entitlements and have been encumbered by the changes. However, in other cases all parties are happy with the result. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093481"></A>
Since 1997 we are told that approximately 120 applications of such a nature affecting between 5,000 and 10,000 lots, which equates to many thousands of people, have been made to the tribunal now called the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal--QCAT--with many more in the pipeline. According to Mr Catlin, there are in the vicinity of 30 to 40 applications at various stages of progress awaiting decisions. These people will not be able to proceed under the provisions before honourable members and their applications will cease upon commencement of this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093485"></A>
How can this be deemed fair? How many applications are in process? Why is that information not publicly available? Does the minister not care about those people? Are they somehow less important, less deserving of fairness? A lack of accurate data is inexcusable and is highlighted by the Community Titles Institute of Queensland, the peak industry body for body corporate and community title management in Queensland, originally founded in 1984 as the Body Corporate Managers Institute of Queensland. This respected body argued that it conducted a much more detailed search than the minister and the number of schemes that have undergone a contested review process or adjustment is over 350--a far cry from the government’s figure of 120. Consequently, these proposed amendments may have a substantially greater impact than the minister is implying, with CTIQ saying that a reasonable estimate of affected lots is 21,500, or approximately six per cent of all lots in Queensland. CTIQ’s detailed look below the surface from which the minister arguably skimmed this rough figure included cases where parties initiated an adjustment application and did not fight all the way to the end result of a court ordered adjustment, asked the tribunal member to consent to what is called consent orders or were adjustments forced upon a lot owner through duress by another lot owner. The circumstances under which adjustments have been made are numerous and varied, and the CTIQ considered the minister’s figure to be laughable given its extensive search to determine the true impact of this legislation. Let us take a closer look at the changes that are proposed by this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093489"></A>
Firstly, the bill will provide a new lot entitlement system for new community titles schemes established after this bill’s passage and commencement. It is proposed that contribution schedule lot entitlements may be determined by applying either of the following principles: the equality principle or the relatively principle. I will quickly explain these terms for honourable members. The equality principle, which is the current method used, requires all contribution lot entitlements to be set equal except where it is just and equitable that they not be equal. The relativity principle will be a new alternative means by which developers can set unequal contribution schedules between different lots with regard to the following: how the community titles scheme is structured; the nature, features and characteristics of the lots; the purposes for which the lots are used; the impact the lots may have on the cost of maintaining the common property; and the market values of the respective lots. It is worth noting here that developers still have the right to allocate contribution schedules. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093490"></A>
The Queensland Law Society, one of many entities to send a submission to my office, had a raft of concerns with many areas of this legislation, one being in relation to this proposed new method. QLS believes that reflecting on the market value in the relativity principle is unfair and problematic, particularly considering the term is not defined anywhere in the legislation. While QLS is reasonably happy with the first four considerations that sit under the relativity principle which, when considered together, promote fairness, it strongly opposed giving developers the option to consider market value for the setting of contribution schedule lot entitlements. The society has proposed its own methodology named the ‘fairness principle’ to be the single principle for setting contribution schedules. The Australian College of Community Association Lawyers also commented on the market value inclusion and stated that market value should not be a relevant factor in the calculation of contribution schedule lot entitlements. It says-- </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1093493"></A>
It is absurd and inequitable to suggest the owner of a three bedroom apartment on the sixth floor causes three times as many meeting notices to be sent as the owner of a ground floor single bedroom unit. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1093494"></A>
The methodology for setting interest schedule lot entitlements is also proposed under proposed new section 46B for new community titles schemes created after the passage of this bill. Adopting the market value principle, interest schedule lot entitlements must reflect the respective market values of each of the lots in comparison to each other lot except where it is just and equitable not to do so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181390"></A>
The second objective of this bill will limit the ability to adjust contribution schedule lot entitlements and give owners in existing community titles schemes a right to reverse previously adjusted contribution schedule lot entitlements to their original position. In relation to community titles schemes established after the commencement of this bill, where a lot owner believes the contribution schedule lot entitlements are not set in accordance with the contribution schedule principle applying to the contribution schedule lot entitlements, they may seek an order of a specialist adjudicator or QCAT to adjust the contribution schedule lot entitlements. The order must only be in accordance with the contribution schedule principle which already applies to the contribution schedule lot entitlements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101599"></A>
In addition, provisions in this bill remove the ability of lot owners in a community titles scheme established prior to the commencement of this bill to apply to a specialist adjudicator or QCAT to have their contribution schedule lot entitlements adjusted. These lot owners will only be able to adjust contribution schedule lot entitlements if it is unanimously agreed to by all lot owners through a resolution without dissent of the body corporate, as established by new section 47A. This provision presents a possible breach of fundamental legislative principles. The Unit Owners Association of Queensland, the UOAQ, a peak industry body with 800 members, believes a unanimous agreement will never be reached, stating that this outcome is virtually impossible to achieve. The QLS further believes that this provision could have an undesirable outcome, as in cases where the original lot entitlements may have been set with errors, omissions or unfairness, in that it prevents a body corporate where a single lot owner disagrees from ever making contributions fair between the lot owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101603"></A>
This bill also proposes to enhance content and disclosure requirements of community management statements, CMSs. After commencement, a CMS will be required to state the relevant principle for deciding the contribution schedule; if the equality principle is used and lots are not set equal, the reason they are not set equal; if the relativity principle is used, how the principle was applied to decide individual contribution schedule lot entitlements. Additional requirements are also proposed for the disclosure statement given to a potential buyer of a lot by the current owner to include: the amount of the owner’s current annual body corporate rate payments, the extent to which this fee is based on contribution schedule lot entitlements and interest schedule lot entitlements, and that contribution and interest schedule lot entitlements are stated in the CMS. A copy of the CMS must also be provided to the buyer with a contract upon sale. If, however, a new CMS is recorded before settlement, a copy of the new CMS must be provided to the buyer within 14 days. The onus for these provisions is on the seller or owner of the lot, and the potential buyer may have the right to terminate the contract if these requirements are not met. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101604"></A>
I turn now to the provisions of this legislation that have caused enormous controversy. This bill proposes that community titles schemes established prior to the commencement of this bill that have been subject to adjustment orders will have the ability to revert their lot entitlements to their original settings prior to any and all adjustment orders. To facilitate a reversion of contribution schedule lot entitlements the bill provides that, if a lot owner submits a motion to be considered at a general meeting of the body corporate requesting the contribution schedule lot entitlements for all the lots in the scheme to be reverted to the original contribution schedule lot entitlements in place before any and all adjustment orders were made, it is deemed that the body corporate passed the motion. The body corporate will then be required to give effect to the motion by reverting the contribution schedule lot entitlements to their original settings, subject to any subdivisions, amalgamations, boundary changes or material changes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101605"></A>
It is of concern that the same procedures that created the supposed problem in the marketplace, according to the former minister and described by him as having devastating consequences, are being endorsed by this bill but in reverse. Provisions in this bill indicate that all it will take is one person to move a motion and the reversion must occur. Where is the fairness in that? Where is the balance here? Surely this is bound to create further animosity amongst unit dwellers. Furthermore, it is an insult to people who have taken the time, the effort and considerable costs to go to such lengths to apply through proper legal channels to get adjustments made. Industry stakeholders are appalled at the ease with which this bill allows all this effort to be reversed. All it takes is a stroke of the minister’s pen. Is this what the minister means when he says he is simplifying the legislation? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101607"></A>
In their submission the Queensland Law Society also expressed their significant concern and dismay at the proposed provisions stating--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101609"></A>
Permitting one affected owner to undo the careful assessment of what is ‘just and equitable’ in terms of apportionment is itself visiting unfairness on lot owners. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101610"></A>
Additionally, the power of a single lot owner to compel the body corporate to pass a resolution winding back adjustments will likely seek to isolate and stigmatise that owner amongst their co-owners. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101611"></A>
Doesn’t that sound like a recipe for a convivial community-living atmosphere! Rather it is a recipe for heated disputes and unrest. Similarly, the Queensland Law Society argues that ‘merely because a change has occurred to the contribution schedule does not necessarily mean that the result of the change did not bring fairness between the owners’.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101614"></A>
The Australian College of Community Association Lawyers stated a parallel view in their submission. They state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101616"></A>
... the Amendment Bill does not achieve the stated objective and, indeed, provides more uncertainty and unfairness by allowing 13 years of settled law to be ‘undone’ at the behest of just one affected lot owner.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101617"></A>
Granted, this bill as it stands cannot satisfy all different types of situations. It is doubtful that any bill would, given the variety of circumstances, the size and make-up of complexes--high-rise versus freestanding units and villas--but it could do a whole lot better than this offering, especially given the length of time for review and ongoing issues raised about body corporate matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101618"></A>
Owners who have bought into a scheme after an adjustment of lot entitlements could face an increase in fees from the provisions contained within this legislation, much the same as original owners were following adjustment orders. Where is the justice here? The former minister’s argument--and it sounds like the current minister’s argument--is also flawed. One legal commentator gave an example of this which I wish to share. He says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101620"></A>
Take for example an owner who bought in 2006 a large unit in a building which a couple of years before had changed its lot entitlements to reduce the lot entitlements, and therefore the levies, for that particular unit. That owner would have seen the lot entitlements and the levies for the unit at the time of purchase and probably relied on them at the time of purchasing. Yet now, these lot entitlements are likely to be changed so that the owner’s levies will increase by a huge proportion, there being nothing that the owner can do about it. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101621"></A>
That puts a new spin on ‘buyer beware’. Labelling the government’s argument fanciful, the same legal eagle said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101623"></A>
What the Government seem to ignore is that over the past 13 years or so, dozens, if not hundreds of buildings have changed their lot entitlements under what the Government considered then, and seems to still, given that the principals to be adopted for new buildings have barely changed, a fairer methodology. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101624"></A>
Then there are also the people who purchased in, say, 2005 or 2006 who were not aware the lot entitlements had ever been adjusted who are in for a nasty shock when they realise they may well have to fork out more than they bargained for, more than what was listed as legally binding on their community management statement. Surely a fairer system than the one before us could be drafted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101625"></A>
The CTIQ has gathered data on the number of lots in affected schemes that have changed hands after a contested review process has occurred. Approximately 13.5 per cent of lots, or 2,900, have changed hands since a contested adjustment. I would like to commend industry bodies and individuals for their detailed input via letters and copies of submissions. I have read them all. That meant countless hours of reading that gave me a firm grasp of the issues as well as the pros and cons of both sides of the argument. It is very clear that it will be impossible to bring about an outcome that will please everyone, as the former minister has mentioned. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101627"></A>
The Queensland Law Society do not believe that these proposed amendments achieve the balance between fairness and certainty for all lot owners that the government is striving for. Comments from their submission, dated 23 September 2010, state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101629"></A>
As a statement of general principle we support the proposition that body corporate contribution schedule lot entitlements should be as far as possible fair and certain for lot owners. This does not mean, however, that </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1101630"></A>
• 	it is unfair for lot entitlements to be adjusted; or </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1101631"></A>
• 	merely because lot entitlements have changed for any particular lot owner it is unfair </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1101632"></A>
It also does not mean that lot owners should be locked into unfair results merely to provide certainty. We propose that there should be fairness between lot owners.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101633"></A>
And it is important to remember that residents who have changed their lot entitlements already have the right to change again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101634"></A>
The Australian College of Community Association Lawyers have stated they cannot support this legislation because ‘the amendment bill does not add to or improve certainty and fairness, and multiple options does not create--</Hansard-Body>

(7.30 pm): The Australian College of Community Association Lawyers have stated they cannot support this legislation because ‘the amendment bill does not add to or improve certainty and fairness, and multiple options does not create flexibility, but rather it adds to the complexity and cost of scheme establishment’. The Unit Owners Association of Queensland president made the following point regarding reversion to original lot entitlements--</Hansard-Body>

That is to assume that the original settings were fair, just and equitable ... There can be no reliance that the schedules prepared by the developer were fair and reasonable in the interest of future owners of the scheme. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105881"></A>
He raises an interesting angle, and nothing in this bill addresses whether original settings were ever fair. Colin Lamont, a former member of this House, as the spokesperson for the Unit Owners Alliance, said in 2009--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105885"></A>
The Act as it stands is fair. It states that unless there are special reasons each lot shall pay the same. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105887"></A>
I believe it is important to share with the House the views of Leary &amp; Partners, quantity surveyors with nearly 30 years experience providing services to the strata industry including expert contribution adjustment advice for both applicants and bodies corporate since 2002. In its submission to the 2008 discussion paper on lot entitlements, Leary &amp; Partners said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105888"></A>
We broadly support the current system for setting and adjusting contribution entitlements. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1105889"></A>
It is clear in its message to the government: leave the law as it is. It goes on to say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105891"></A>
... we do not believe that the number of schemes or lots disadvantaged by the current system is demonstrably greater than the number that would, for other reasons, be disadvantaged by an alternative system. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105892"></A>
Since the publication of the Court of Appeal decision for Centrepoint, there has been a high degree of consistency and as a result certainty, in the interpretation of the intent of the law by parties dealing with the contribution entitlement system on a regular basis. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105893"></A>
The Queensland division of the Property Council of Australia, which lobbied the government for these amendments, calls this bill a major win for the Queensland property industry and unit owners alike as it will enable developers to include affordable housing products in their development schemes. In its covering letter to the minister this group advocated for the user-pays approach to policy and proposed that the 2003 amendments, followed by the successful Centrepoint court challenge in 2004, created a lot of hardship for lower level unit owners, who were faced with steep increases in body corporate fees. The Property Council, in its submission to the draft consultation bill, had the following recommendations--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105896"></A>
That the bill preserves the option for developers and bodies corporate to continue with the existing ‘equality principle’.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105897"></A>
That the new option for setting contribution schedule lot entitlements referred to as the ‘relativity principle’ allows developers and bodies corporate sufficient flexibility to take into account a whole range of matters in setting up a community title scheme. In particular, the relativity principle allows developers to take into account the market value of the lots in setting body corporate levies. This key initiative will encourage developers to include affordable product in upmarket community title schemes. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105898"></A>
These comments further raise the issue of who should be the person or the body responsible for making decisions on community titles schemes and lot entitlements. There is a raft of competing interests here--from owners to developers, body corporate managers and building managers--that make this an ongoing quandary. It was very disappointing that the Property Council chose to attack penthouse owners as the cause of all this perceived evil when it said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105900"></A>
It should be remembered that under the existing law, a large number of ‘penthouse’ owners have an almost unfettered ability similar to that contained in section 380 to force a re-writing of levies in their favour.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105901"></A>
It is the Property Council’s view that new section 380 and its associated provisions provides the greater good for the greater number of unit owners as opposed to the existing legislation which provided windfall benefits for a small number of wealthy penthouse owners. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105902"></A>
Not all penthouse owners are wealthy. Some bought under favourable developer conditions. Not all have cash on hand. Some are on tight budgets and need to live frugally. It is unfair and improper of the Property Council to make discriminatory judgements such as these. It is comments like these that could be accused of typecasting and creating a social divide. Mrs Boland from Mermaid Waters argued--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105904"></A>
Penthouse owners weren’t the only ones to benefit from changed entitlements, a considerable number of other unit owners did also. Not all penthouses are mansions and have very wealthy owners as we are led to believe. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105907"></A>
Liat Walker and Ros Janes, directors of Success Law Pty Ltd, said with regard to the following: ‘Any application before a specialist adjudicator or QCAT that has not been decided or has not been given effect by the time of the commencement of the amendment bill will cease to have the effect at commencement’--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105909"></A>
We consider the objectives of the amendment Bill have not been met. Indeed, there will be less certainty for those bodies corporate who have been the subject of an order adjusting the contribution schedule lot entitlements, as they could be subject to a reversal of the order. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs STUCKEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The minister may like to listen to this. A suggestion was put forward that if the government really wanted to make unit living a more level playing field, the authorities should install separate water meters to every unit at no or very little cost to owners. The reason given was that it is not fair or reasonable for a single person in a unit to be made to contribute to water usage by units with three or more inhabitants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105917"></A>
Another resident reported that some unit blocks with separate meters are accepting a bulk bill from Allconnex and then billing each unit on their consumption. The UOAQ are of the view that bulk water supply should be discounted due to reduced meter-reading and billing costs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105919"></A>
The committee of a high-rise building in Main Beach on the Gold Coast comprising 124 units are most distressed as they changed their lot contribution schedule by consensus and had it ratified by the court. The history of this facility, I am told, is that the developer presold the penthouse and all subpenthouses--37 of them--to Japanese investors before the lot contribution schedule had been determined. The developer then loaded all the top units’ contribution schedules so that he could reduce the lower floor contribution schedules to make them easier to sell on the local market. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105920"></A>
This action was considered so blatantly wrong that the lot owners, by consensus, agreed to a more equitable schedule. It is now their view that they will be reverted to the unjust contribution schedule with no opportunity to have the matter reviewed. If this behaviour was going on at this one block then there is every chance it has occurred at others. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105921"></A>
A number of people have told me that in the early days of high-rise development developers offered some buyers very good deals to assist in quicker sales but others did not fare so well, as I have indicated with the above-mentioned case. The committee of this building want to know if this legislation is unconstitutional in that it deprives building owners of their democratic right to vote on the future of their building. ‘How can this legislation satisfy the primary and secondary objectives of the BCCM Act?’ they ask.

The passing of this bill would be a travesty of justice, unthinkable in a democracy ... By reverting to the original unfair entitlements will not make the issue go away--it will continue to simmer and cause disharmony in various Body Corporates. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Martin Clark, who owns a large unit in the Q1 building on the Gold Coast, said--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105928"></A>
I have always voted Labor and was disappointed to hear you suggest that unit owners such as myself should be subsidising Body Corp levies for the smaller units ... The majority of wear and tear in the building is caused by the major traffic through these rental units. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

He continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105961"></A>
Why is there no provision for units that are rented out to holiday makers to pay higher Body Corp levies? These are the units that have the biggest impact on common property or maintenance. During the Schoolies festival for example, Q1 has about 100 units rented out to schoolies. At the end of the festival, we had approximately $100,000 of damage caused by schoolies. However the unit owners who reaped massive rents (approx $4,000 per week) contribute nil extra.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

That is a quote from Mr Clark. Wallace and Robyn Kienzle, in supporting the bill, described the developer’s system for allocating lot entitlements as--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105969"></A>
... very well thought out and took into account the size of the unit, the floor level and the stack--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

that is, whether it was north-east, east or south-east facing--</Hansard-Body-Continued>

all of which affected its value.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

 It is a real pity that the minister is interrupting me while I am actually telling him about someone who is supporting his legislation. Atlantis West on the Gold Coast went through an adjustment which saw the contributions of the penthouse and subpenthouse owners reduced substantially. A number of residents from Atlantis West expressed their support for these amendments. Reg Warr of Robina said, ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!’ He underwent personal costs of thousands of dollars to go through an adjustment to have a fair and equitable entitlement system put in place. He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105982"></A>
This is grossly unfair and makes a nonsense of an existing order and a total waste of those monies expended to reach that decision. That there is no room for appeal against such a reversal of procedure adds to the blatant unfairness of the proposal.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Graeme Muller from Labrador in opposing the legislation said--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105986"></A>
Why should one section of the community have to unfairly subsidise another, there is no justice in this. We cannot agree that some lot owners have an obligation to provide affordable housing (for others). That is the responsibility of Governments. It is a disgraceful piece of legislation that is contemplated.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The UOAQ wrote--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105990"></A>
The Bill as presented fails to provide any improvement over the consultation draft. The Minister has not considered--or if considered, rejected--stakeholder concerns. The Minister has failed to make any appropriate changes to present more democratic and objective achievement of the stated objectives of the legislation. Moreover, the Explanatory Notes admit that the Bill fails to achieve compliance with the Legislative Standards Act 1992. The Unit Owners Association Queensland philosophically rejects ‘resolutions without dissent’ as a device to circumvent democratic voting rights and disenfranchise owners.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105993"></A>
If anything is achieved, it is to add to the confusion and expense surrounding contribution schedule adjustment.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1105995"></A>
It goes on to mention that the explanatory notes admit that--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1105997"></A>
Existing schemes will not be able to adjust their contribution schedules except by resolution without dissent, or reversion to the pre-1997 developer imposed schedules. Resolutions without dissent are an impossibility; therefore, all existing schemes will be reverted, on the opinion of one owner, to the unfair and unjust developer imposed contribution schedule. Effectively reverting Bodies Corporate 14 years to where they were before the 2003 contribution schedule legislation, and creating two classes of buildings, pre and post the Bill.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1105998"></A>
It continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1106000"></A>
The current principle for setting and adjusting contribution schedule lot entitlements is--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1106001"></A>
as is quoted in this bill--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1106002"></A>
‘that they should be equal except to the extent it is not just and equitable in the circumstances for them not to be equal’.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1106004"></A>
This, according to the UOAQ, is one clear and easily understood principle.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106006"></A>
The Summervilles from Runaway Bay wrote to me and explained that they and other owners put in a combined request for their lots to become just and equitable. They engaged solicitors, as did the body corporate. Both parties negotiated the lot entitlements to adjust an equitable number for everyone. It was submitted to QCAT. A judgement was passed on 6 April 2010 and body corporate fees were adjusted on 1 July. Now they are very concerned that the minister is taking away their equality and their rights to appeal. These folk paid a significant amount of money to go through the processes brought in by this same Labor government that is now trying to toss out its own legislation, harming innocent unit owners along the way.</Hansard-Body>

Les Armstrong, President of the Association of Residents of Queensland Retirement Villages--the largest advocacy organisation in Queensland that represents 7,500 members across the state’s 326 villages--has expressed his concern at not being consulted by the government on this legislation despite 135 of Queensland’s retirement villages established as community title schemes under the BCCM Act. A submission from ARQRV stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1106013"></A>
In preparing the bill, the Government does not appear to have considered the unique nature of retirement village schemes as compared to ordinary community titles schemes.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1106015"></A>
In particular, Mr Armstrong raised issues regarding unit sale prices and exit fees. He states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1106017"></A>
In light of these matters, the ARQRV opposes the Bill to the extent that it could cause an increase in ongoing costs for residents in villages who had entered the village (and committed to exit fees) in the belief that the equality principle would continue to be applied to their contribution schedule lot entitlements.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1106018"></A>
So any argument from the government that this is to support people on lower incomes is absolutely lame according to Mr Armstrong’s submission.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106020"></A>
Notably, unlike many other bills that come before the parliament, the Body Corporate and Community Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 does not list in the explanatory notes what organisations, government departments or key bodies were consulted on the drafting of this legislation. This omission is perplexing and would suggest a degree of secrecy on the part of the government. According to reports in the newspaper, the former minister stated they had received about 150 submissions to the draft consultation bill, largely from affected individual lot owners. But those figures were in contrast to those provided by Mr Catlin during our briefing, who said there were 216 submissions in total. Unfortunately it would appear the government did not ask for a waiver from those who sent in submissions, using the excuse of cabinet confidentiality, so honourable members are prevented from knowing details of submitters. In order to provide genuine transparency in this debate, I ask if the minister will give honourable members an explanation as to why this is so and provide a catalogue of these groups to the House. After all, they are included sometimes in other bills.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106025"></A>
On 6 December 2010 a Gold Coast resident received a letter from the then minister stating--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1106027"></A>
There were 216 submissions received and departmental officers from the Office of Regulatory Policy within the Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation reviewed all submissions and provided an analysis of submissions to government for consideration. Submissions were received from owners in community titles schemes, advocacy groups, law firms and professional organisations as well as Government agencies.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106028"></A>
I can understand why private individuals desire privacy over their submissions, but I fail to see why all of the other groups mentioned are not disclosed and made available as important material to assist with this debate. The opposition requests that the minister table for the House a list of the groups and the government agencies he mentions in the correspondence he sent to this resident and I ask that the minister give a breakdown of percentages for each group and for these individuals. Without this information the members of this parliament are denied knowledge of the degree of support or the degree of dissension in these submissions. It struck me that 216 submissions was a relatively small response when one considers the size of the pool of affected people, estimated to be over 364,000 lots. A sceptic might accuse the former minister of pushing his own barrow on this one, determined to proceed regardless of responses. Then there is the fact that this review has been going for so long and only now appearing in the parliament for debate. I wonder how many people with lot entitlements living under these schemes realise what the government is planning here. How many submissions from residents were for this legislation and how many were against? Surely we have a right to know.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106030"></A>
Another point of concern was raised by a respected firm that deals with issues relating to this act. It told me that the 2008 discussion paper resulted in such negative reactions to this bill that the former minister at that time shelved the results, hoping the more recent one would provide more support for the bill. Sue Ekert, a long-serving committee member of UOAQ, commented--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1106033"></A>
The submissions procedure was a complete debacle in my view. Minister Lawlor is looking after the complaining people in his electorate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106036"></A>
Another submission from Mrs Sue Potts from the Sunshine Coast said she actually met with the former minister to address the inefficiencies of this bill in relation to layered schemes and said of the former minister--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1106038"></A>
... he listened but did not help. He appeared to already be set on his particular course of action--to overturn the current legislation.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

In the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee’s <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert No. 1 of</Hansard-Italic>
 <Hansard-Italic>
2011</Hansard-Italic>
 a number of sections of this bill were highlighted as potentially affecting the rights and liberties of individuals. In particular, the committee found new section 46A, which defines the relativity principle for setting contribution schedule lot entitlements, may be inconsistent with the principles of natural justice as it may allow a decision to be made based on an irrelevant consideration, that being that contribution lot entitlements could be solely based on the market value of lots, placing a larger portion of body corporate costs on owners of lots with higher market values irrespective of the size of their lots or any other relevant considerations. This is an exceptionally important point, which was also raised by the Queensland Law Society as a considerable flaw in the way in which this legislation has been drafted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110778"></A>
The <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert</Hansard-Italic>
 of this parliament echoed numerous concerns from the Law Society, highlighting sections of the bill that adversely affect the rights and liberties of individuals, unclear and vague drafting that will leave concepts open to broad interpretation by the courts and strong concerns about the retrospective application of this bill. I say again: these serious issues were raised by the parliament’s own committee. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110779"></A>
Also worth noting is the number of offences that this bill creates, the majority of which relate to penalising bodies corporate for failing to adhere to time frames and procedures for updating the CMS. Like many other honourable members in this House, I am not in favour of the practice of retrospective legislation. This bill before us would enable retrospectivity to apply many years back. In March 2008 in this House I said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1110782"></A>
Retrospective legislation is contrary to fundamental legislative principles. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs STUCKEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My position has not changed but, very clearly, those interjecting do not really care about fundamental legislative principles. Aspects of this proposed legislation will have retrospective impact on some community title schemes, with the ability to revert contribution schedule lot entitlements to their original settings prior to any and all adjustment orders. Reverting contribution schedule lot entitlement adjustments may be seen as a breach of fundamental legislative principles as orders from a specialist adjudicator, tribunal and court will be overturned even though they were made in accordance with the law at that time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110786"></A>
The Australian College of Community Association Lawyers said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1110788"></A>
A retrospective reversion and/or to permit unilateral action on the part of a single owner is inconsistent with good policy and legislative practice and creates discriminatory outcomes rather than a balanced and equitable basis for the rights of all stakeholders involved in community title schemes. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110789"></A>
On the subject of retrospectivity, I ask honourable members to cast their minds back to the debate on the 2003 bill. This debate attracted a stack of Labor speakers--some 26 of them--who spoke in glowing terms about the provisions in the bill. They raised numerous unaddressed issues relating to management rights, an area omitted from this bill before us despite the government having almost eight years to review the legislation. Here is what some of them had to say about this legislation that they now want to reverse. The honourable member for Stretton--the minister at the time--said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1110791"></A>
The guiding principle for both setting and adjusting the contributions schedule is that it involves the equitable sharing of the costs of operating and maintaining the common property. These costs should be borne in proportion to the benefit, not in proportion to the unit’s value. It is not a contribution linked to an ability to pay, but as a payment for services. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1110792"></A>
The minister went on to say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1110794"></A>
However, if there are reasons why an equal contribution schedule would not be fair or equitable, it can be changed through application to the courts or to a specialist adjudicator. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Centred>
<A ID="pgfId-1110795"></A>
...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Centred>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1110797"></A>
But when we are talking about those parts of a property where the benefits are shared more or less equally, we cannot apply the same formula. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110798"></A>
Now Labor is introducing this as part of one of the formulas developers may use when setting contribution schedules--included in relativity principles established under this bill. The Queensland Law Society and other respected bodies have grave concerns about the inclusion of market value of the lots as an attributing factor to be considered when allocating lot entitlements. The minister went on to say--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1110800"></A>
At the end of the day, this bill is about two things: It is about our economy and it is about our people. That is why the central tenet of this bill is to make things simpler and fairer for all Queenslanders... the bill before the House today, has meant that the legislation before members is the best tool for fixing the little cracks in Queensland’s community titles industry. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110801"></A>
The honourable member for Callide is not one who is known to often praise Labor policies. He must have been feeling in a generous mood, because he said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1110803"></A>
I think the minister can be commended for the fact that the legislation that comes before the House today is the result of a compromise in terms of what was, at the start of this process, a divergent range of opinions. That compromise has been able to satisfy unit owners as well as residential managers and the rest of the stakeholders. As far as I am aware, no group within that stakeholder community opposes this legislation. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110804"></A>
The honourable member for Mackay--now a minister--spoke in glowing terms about this bill. He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1110806"></A>
This bill is a model of how government, business and the wider community can work together to develop workable, practical and beneficial legislation that delivers positive outcomes for all Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Centred>
<A ID="pgfId-1110807"></A>
...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Centred>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1110809"></A>
The involvement of industry stakeholders in developing this bill has been exemplary and instrumental to its success. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110810"></A>
Sadly, this involvement was not continued in the consultation process leading to this bill. You could not silence the member for Mackay. He was so full of praise. He went on to say--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1110812"></A>
This bill does not favour one group over another. This bill delivers a fair outcome for every Queenslander it affects. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110813"></A>
I wonder what the honourable member has to say about this bill, as it undoes the fair and balanced stakeholder approved model of 2003. By its very nature, this bill establishes a two-tiered system of bodies corporate, differing for schemes established prior to the commencement of the bill and those established after the commencement of the bill. The explanatory notes to the bill state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1110815"></A>
This proposal does present a possible breach of fundamental legislative principles in that lot owners in schemes established prior to the commencement of the Bill will have a different set of rights to lot owners in schemes established after the commencement of the Bill. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110816"></A>
The government’s response to this matter is--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1110818"></A>
The distinction between the community titles schemes established pre- and post-commencement of the Bill is considered necessary. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110819"></A>
By whom? How was this deduction made that it was necessary? This statement does not offer any explanation, either measured or otherwise. Those schemes developed after this bill will be governed by an entirely new set of principles and arrangements. Legal opinions state that buyers may be discouraged from purchasing lots in older buildings where bodies corporate have entrenched arrangements that are deemed unfair. The minister needs to satisfy the argument. Where are the statistics and figures to say that that will not be the case? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110820"></A>
The former minister could not provide a list of those who supplied submissions and has now managed to avoid all responsibility for providing a breakdown of the findings. Additionally, there are no accurate figures of people who are tied up in the middle of applications for adjustments. As I said earlier, in 2003 not one member of parliament opposed the bill. Let us see what the Labor members will do now. Will they go back on their word? Will they say that they told untruths in 2003? No, they lack the intestinal fortitude to do that, especially as their own minister could not bring himself to acknowledge the 2003 legislation in his second reading speech. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110821"></A>
It is important to look at what was said in the debate on that bill, as it is the provisions therein that the minister and the Bligh government now want to repeal. The minister may think that Labor’s own legislation in 2003 was wrong, even though he cannot admit it. But what he has presented before us today is abominable and the LNP cannot support it. I shall be moving a number of amendments and I foreshadow that now. <Hansard-Speech-End>

This bill seeks to reform the Queensland parliamentary committee system to strengthen and support the role of the Legislative Assembly in scrutinising legislation and executive government.

. It was clear from the feedback that Queenslanders wanted greater oversight of the government and examination of legislation by the parliament.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115647"></A>
Queensland is unique among Australian states in that our legislation only has to pass one house of parliament to become law. In response, the parliament established a committee to report on how the parliamentary oversight of legislation could be enhanced and how the existing parliamentary committee system could be strengthened to enhance accountability. The Committee System Review Committee, chaired by the member for Sunnybank with the member for Southern Downs as deputy chair, included representatives from both major parties and the Independents. Its members understood parliament and parliamentary procedures in detail. They were very well experienced members of the House. The committee spent most of 2010 considering options and public submissions on ways to improve parliamentary oversight and accountability. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115650"></A>
Its report of December 2010 made 55 recommendations. When the government was considering the recommendations, it had the key points from the terms of reference at the forefront of its deliberations: accountability, oversight and effective examination of legislation. Parliament debated the review committee’s report over two days in March 2011 and, as a result, the parliament established a Committee of the Legislative Assembly to provide a roadmap to implement the government’s response to the report. This bill takes account of the views of many of the members who contributed to the debate, together with the wishes of the Committee of the Legislative Assembly, including the members of the opposition and the view of the cabinet. It will improve the way the parliament operates and will better adapt our committee system to the community’s expectations in the 21st century.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115651"></A>
Specifically, the bill makes a number of changes. First, it will establish portfolio committees made up of an equal number of members from each side of the parliament. These committees will cover all ministerial portfolios and government departments. Their main activities will include, for their respective portfolios: conducting the budget estimates inquiries; examining legislation, both government and private members’ bills; and examining public accounts and public works matters associated with the portfolio. Portfolio committees will have the ability to call public servants as witnesses and ask questions of them directly in accordance with the provisions of the standing orders. Alternatively, public servants may be invited to assist committees to understand the legislation which government brings before the parliament. Members of the public will be able to make submissions on legislation and raise concerns they have regarding legislation directly with the committee. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115652"></A>
The portfolio committees will be provided with more time during sitting weeks to discuss matters and more time in parliament to have their reports debated. The new committee system will reinforce the current high level scrutiny of the rights of individuals and the principles of natural justice. Accordingly, the bill retains the functions of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee to examine legislation for consistency with the Legislative Standards Act 1992. These powers are being provided to portfolio committees to enable them to examine both the legislative obligations and the policy intent of the legislation simultaneously. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115653"></A>
The Public Accounts and Public Works Committee will no longer exist, but all of its functions are being given to the portfolio committees. That is, the portfolio committees will be able to review reports by the Auditor-General and examine major capital works within their portfolio areas, amongst other things. The portfolio committees will also serve as the estimates committees to examine in detail the budgets of the departments within their portfolio and ask questions of ministers and senior public servants at their public hearing. These comprehensive powers and responsibilities will ensure that the budget, accounts, capital works and legislation for portfolio areas will be examined in the one forum in a coordinated and comprehensive manner.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115654"></A>
The number, title and portfolio areas to be allocated to these portfolio committees will be established by the parliament in standing orders. These matters are to be the subject of further consideration by the Committee of the Legislative Assembly with a view to having draft standing orders before the parliament for consideration in May 2011. The bill also seeks to establish a separate ethics committee to consider any matters referred to it with respect to complaints about the ethical conduct of particular members or alleged breaches of privilege by members of parliament or other persons. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115655"></A>
While the Committee of the Legislative Assembly was established by resolution of the parliament on 10 March 2011, this bill will establish that committee as a statutory committee. The Committee of the Legislative Assembly will assume the responsibilities of the Standing Orders Committee and the bill provides that the Speaker will be a member of the committee when it is dealing with matters relating to the standing orders. The bill also makes provision for a member of the committee to nominate an alternate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115656"></A>
The bill provides that the areas of responsibility of the Committee of the Legislative Assembly will be: the ethical conduct of members, including arrangements for the Register of Members’ Interests--however, the ethics committee will deal with any complaints of breaches of these provisions; publishing and reviewing the code of ethical conduct for members; parliamentary powers, rights and immunities; standing rules and orders about the conduct of business by, and the practices and procedures of, the Assembly and its committees; and any other matters for which the committee is given responsibility under standing orders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115657"></A>
With respect to the Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee, this committee is being retained with the current complement of seven members. However, it is the government’s intention to appoint a non-government member as chair of this committee. The new parliamentary committee system will ensure the highest standards of parliamentary scrutiny of the executive, of the operation of the parliament and of the conduct of members. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115658"></A>
Beyond the parliamentary committee system, the bill also inserts the newly titled position of Manager of Opposition Business as an office holder to which an additional salary can be paid, and makes provision for committee chairs to receive an increase to the additional salaries they currently receive. This will give due recognition to the additional responsibilities of these positions and is in line with the bipartisan recommendation of the Committee System Review Committee. The amount of the additional salaries will be determined by the Governor in Council and will be made public through the <Hansard-Italic>
Queensland Government Gazette</Hansard-Italic>
 and the <Hansard-Italic>
Members’ Entitlements Handbook</Hansard-Italic>
. The bill also includes amendments to implement government responses to other parliamentary committee reports. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115659"></A>
The government’s response to Report No. 109 of the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee supported a recommendation to combine a register of written waivers by members to rewards of holding a public appointment, required to be maintained by the Speaker, with the Register of Members’ Interests, maintained by the Clerk of the Parliament. The bill amends the Parliament of Queensland Act 2001 to implement this commitment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115660"></A>
Further, the bill implements the government’s response to the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee’s Report No. 42 to amend the Legislative Standards Act 1992 to require that all subordinate legislation be accompanied by an explanatory note. While this requirement has already been implemented by the government administratively, the legislative amendments are now proposed to enshrine them in law. I commend the bill to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(8.07 pm): There has been both great anxiety and anticipation of this legislation by thousands of unit owners across our state, our cities, especially on the Gold Coast, and even in my electorate of Gaven. To quote the most recent report of the Unit Owners Association of Queensland--</Hansard-Body>

Unit living must remain sustainable if community living is to thrive well into the future. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115674"></A>
If the status quo remains, the costs of unit living will continue to grow well beyond the reach of ordinary homeowners who may wish to live a unit lifestyle and leave a lighter footprint on our environment. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1115675"></A>
The former minister is correct when he says in his second reading speech--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1115677"></A>
We have a problem in the marketplace. It needs to be fixed. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115678"></A>
The former minister is here tonight. His problem is that he vacillated for too long whilst unit owners were caught in this no-man’s land which correctly the minister has described as an untenable situation where ‘they cannot afford the increased fees but cannot afford to sell at fire sale rates’. Add this to the worst returns in 20 years for those on fixed incomes as either full or part self-funded retirees or pensioners and a person’s home is often their only or, for some, their major asset--that is, a lifetime investment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115680"></A>
Whilst noting the severity in proportionate terms for those on low or fixed incomes, what the government has done is to delay this bill unnecessarily to almost maximise the pain of these very vulnerable groups. This is grossly unfair and unconscionable. The incorrect perception seems to be that those unit residents are all old, they are all childless with no dependants and they mainly vote against the Labor Party. There is nothing further from the truth. This is the answer to those false assumptions: on the Gold Coast it must be presumed, as it is the minister’s home city, that he has incorrectly decided that the impact of the QCAT adjustment to contribution schedules in 2008-09 which led to this current debacle is mainly on the high-end, mainly Surfers Paradise, Southport, Broadbeach, Burleigh and Coolangatta high-rise owners. That is wrong. Many owners beyond those boundaries have been impacted. They have all just endured a dreadful Christmas, which was compounded by higher water, electricity and gas charges. New land tax charges by the state government and differential ratings by local councils have only added to the misery of very upwardly rising body corporate charges for individual owners.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120325"></A>
The shadow minister, inclusive of the minister, has explained the impacts of the Centrepoint case in the Court of Appeal. That case clearly magnified the significance of the lot entitlement schedules, those being the contribution component and the interest component. The impact of the Court of Appeal case was on the equity end of the contribution schedule. Of course, a small group of owners had a great victory, which they would all agree was fair, and the court agreed with it. Sadly, the vast majority of owners were bitterly disappointed and the change has been that the contribution schedule lot entitlement was ratcheted up massively. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120328"></A>
What was not said was that when owners purchased they did know what they were buying into and the costs were clearly explained, or so they thought. Those who now claim that a legitimate challenge to that formula is reasonable would be equally inferring that those who agreed to a lower contribution based on a different lot had a lesser entitlement for fairness, firstly, because they lost by virtue of the Court of Appeal deciding mainly in the penthouse owners’ favour. Secondly, the law has to be equitable and this issue of equity seems to blunt the definition that some are more equal than others. Thirdly, where people live in communities where costs must be shared, does an external party really have the right to change one portion of a significant agreement without giving all others an equal right to having all the agreements looked at and maybe changed? If this were truly to occur, there would be anarchy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120329"></A>
In this bill, the amendment that is critical is that which limits adjustments of contribution schedules for entitlements and provides for revisions for those schemes that have been the subject of contribution schedule orders. Of course, that will be a massive relief for those currently facing costs that they never expected or budgeted for. For those who thought they had a major win and a big annual cash saving, their hopes were dashed and they will be very unhappy. This problem was always going to be about winners and losers. Essentially, there were too many losers and too few winners, as the law stood after the successful appeal. Now it would seem that everyone becomes a loser, so go figure that one. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120330"></A>
A few other amendments need discussion and I will address those before the completion of my speech. What has not been said by the minister, although the shadow minister has alluded to it, is that the member for Southport enthusiastically supported the previous changes in the legislation that subsequently led to the QCAT appeals. While his speech has been quoted already, I will refer to it. The former minister, who is now the Minister for Energy and DERM, championed the changes. Certainly the quote is as was stated by the former minister, that is--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1120332"></A>
The guiding principle for both setting and adjusting the contributions schedule is that it involves the equitable sharing of the costs of operating and maintaining the common property. These costs should be borne in proportion to the benefit, not in proportion to the unit’s value. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120333"></A>
The minister went on to speak about the fact that you pay in proportion to what you use. He said that the central tenet of the bill was to make things simpler and fairer for all Queensland. He talked about safeguarding futures. How wrong he was. The former minister, the member for Southport, said that he supported the minister’s stance. He said that he supported the BCCM and Other Legislation Amendment Bill and he congratulated the minister and his staff for the important bill, which he commended to the House. It is no wonder that QCAT made the decisions that it did. What does that say about a lack of foresight, sowing the seeds of one’s own destruction and that truism, taught to our children, to always consider the consequences of your actions? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181398"></A>
There are more than a few red flags here and they were apparent very soon after the BCCM Act 1997 was enacted. Critically, in his second reading speech the former minister stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1181399"></A>
.... the new module will potentially affect 12,000 community titles schemes in Queensland, which represents almost one-third of community titles schemes in Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120336"></A>
That is a very big group and it is growing. Secondly, the speech stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1120338"></A>
The bill will introduce a new and more flexible system of contribution schedule lot entitlements, including a new relativity principle aimed ...’ </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120339"></A>
That corrects the anomaly generated in the 1997 BCCM Act where the two lot entitlement schedules, the contribution and interest schedules, were introduced, but it leaves the window open for the challenge to the equity rules on the contribution schedule, which all now claim was apparent. I put it to the House that it was very clear on the basis of available evidence at the time--that is, schedule lot entitlement distributions were entitled to be adjusted but the owners had to apply to do so. That problem was apparent at the time and yet we were all allowed to blunder on. What is extraordinary is that it took so long for 120 applicants to get a QCAT ruling and even longer for this hapless Labor government to take action. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120340"></A>
Thirdly, and most tellingly in the case of this bill, there has been an appalling lack of stakeholder consultation and open disclosure at a time when people’s lives and homes are at stake. We are all in the same jungle and we must talk to one another to ensure that we all survive. This lack of transparency is shocking and it should be a big wake-up call. There is a wide body of evidence that this government and the minister pressed on when most were urging caution. Too many people are hurting and those who have just had what they believe was a very justified victory are feeling friendless--</Hansard-Body>

Dr DOUGLAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The member should listen--bereft and unprotected by the judiciary. It is not the court system nor our system. It is a recklessness and a failure to look for red flags. It is legislators who see only green flags, even though they are paid to be cautious and govern for all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120343"></A>
The bill changes disclosure requirements for developers to explain contribution and interest entitlements, to have the explanation form as part of the community management form and to attach both to the contract of sale, which collectively would seem to say that buyer beware remains but if that fails then we will have the risk transferred back to the developers. It is no wonder that in Australia we are short over $100 billion homes, that currently on the Gold Coast housing starts are 50 per cent of what they were in 2007 and that builders in my electorate of Gaven are queuing in foodbank lines for emergency food supplies. At Christmas, at the Nerang community centre 113 families lined up for food. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120344"></A>
To attempt to solve every problem by transferring responsibility excessively back to the supplier leads to less choice, less stock, inferior quality and higher cost. If this is the Labor solution to everything, as appears to be the case, then why would anyone support such nonsense? This body corporate bill has prompted many in my electorate to contact me regarding many other issues that are just as difficult and problematic. One constant problem is that of the owner of a unit in a small complex who does not really need a body corporate with a contracted unit manager, although many such complexes have them. Businesses are charging small lot owners exorbitant fees for very minor services, with large mark-ups for things such as pool maintenance, lawn mowing and just being there. The management rights are on sold, but really it is simply an on-site owner who performs few of the services. The owners could save themselves a fortune by not having such people around, yet they are paying monthly fees. None of those problems are represented in the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120345"></A>
It behoves the new minister to get a grasp of the whole area. The government needs to widely consult stakeholders and try to understand the broader problems. That needs to be done for all of the problems, and there are so many of them. To shamefully try to push the current issue through is a forlorn hope that will do no-one justice. Indeed, it may do little to address some of the dreadful injustices that have occurred. Basically, it is both cavalier and insensitive. If we want sustainable communities and sustainable jobs, then a good start can be made by looking at very reasonable cost structures for unit and community title dwellers in Queensland. If one adds a policy of carefully thinking through legislative changes for home owners, then one critical part of individual Queenslander’s lives will be changed for the better. Interestingly, the case that drew everyone’s attention was the Centrepoint case. If all we do is put consumers at the centre of all of our legislative deliberations and keep pointing both our energies and ourselves at resolving their problems, this current problem, for example, would never have occurred. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1125029"></A>
This bill needs extensive changes to make it worthwhile. I would urge the minister and members of the Labor Party to embrace the changes suggested by the shadow minister. They will lead to peace and harmony in an area where there has been much unhappiness. Lot entitlements should be based on both the equality principle and the relativity principle, but they vary so much. Critically, the Queensland Law Society is quite on track and quite right when it states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1125033"></A>
... there needs to be an appropriate balance struck between fairness for lot owners holistically and the comfort for individuals brought about by certainty. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1125034"></A>
If this bill does not achieve that objective then it is as bad as the 2003 bill, which Labor now wants to reverse. In essence, this bill punishes the majority who have spent time and money to reach equity and now see that trashed. Where is the fairness in that? The original decision was a vote grab, as is this reversal. There are 39,000 schemes in Queensland covering 364,000 lots. This bill is about affordability for whom? <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110405_202039" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Mermaid Beach--LNP) (8.20 pm): I rise tonight to speak on the Body Corporate and Community Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. From the outset I would like to say that this bill is acknowledgement from the government itself that it is unfit to legislate in Queensland. This bill is a classic Beattie-Bligh backflip on the amending legislation that it brought to this House in 2003. It has caused considerable community angst, pitting fellow community living dwellers against each other. I would like to congratulate my colleague the shadow minister for small business, job creation, fair trading and industrial relations and shadow minister for women on her succinct and informative contribution to the debate to explain to the people of Queensland why we should not let this Bligh Labor government govern Queensland. </A></Hansard-Body>

The basic principle in this debate is who should pay more and who should pay less. If one party in the community living entity pays more for activity and services in that entity then, by definition, another party will pay less. It is a complete abrogation of this government’s responsibility to bring in legislation that should be effective and that specifically addresses the issue when it failed dismally to get it right with the legislation that it passed through this House in 2003. Now it is saying, ‘We got it wrong in 2003. Will you support us to backflip and get it right in 2011?’ What a lot of nonsense! It is an absolute indictment of Minister Stephen Robertson, who pushed the 2003 legislation through, and it is an incredible ‘give yourself an upper cut’ self-blow to then Minister Lawlor, who said in 2003 how wonderful that legislation was only to introduce rectifying legislation in 2010. That legislation was to rectify the rectifying legislation that then Minister Lawlor thought was so rectifying. It sounds like a pile of rectum rectification to me! </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1125044"></A>
I have had meeting after meeting with unit owners on both sides of the argument and can see that both have significant reasons for their position. My shadow cabinet colleagues, the shadow minister for fair trading and members of the opposition see that there has not been enough consideration of the unit owners that this legislation will adversely affect. The Community Titles Institute of Queensland believes that 21,500 lots will be directly affected by these changes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1125046"></A>
Today the LNP will be voting against this bill because we believe that, yet again, these are Labor Party amendments that are ad hoc and have not been researched enough to be effective in a growing industry of community living. This industry--</Hansard-Body>

Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Heaps. I take the interjection from the member for Morayfield. There are a lot of community living titles in Mermaid Beach. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1125049"></A>
The industry is growing at an amazing rate, with community living--whether it is unit complexes, townhouses or stand-alone properties in a gated community--becoming the people’s choice and a very popular form of living accommodation. The reality is that the 1997 legislation is now outdated and needs to be reworked from the ground up. The premise that the developer should set the lot entitlements gives no recognition to the fact that it will be the entity’s own community that will endure the living conditions for perhaps many decades ahead. It is that community that is expected to live in harmony on the same piece of ground shared in ownership under the current flawed legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1125051"></A>
It is sometimes far too tempting for a developer to set lot entitlements that are advantageous to their own financial needs and not to address the long-term ramifications of their decisions on unit dwellers. For instance, if a developer wanted to live in a penthouse of an apartment building, he could write the lot entitlement down for the penthouse to favour his own financial position and force the lower unit owners to pay more than what is fair and equitable. Alternatively, if a developer wanted to--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you for your protection, Madam Deputy Speaker. It really is quite unbelievable that a member could come forward with the comment ‘everyone goes in with their eyes open’ and therefore it is acceptable. It is not fair and it is not acceptable, but they are in there with their eyes open! On very many occasions there are people in our society who are not protected by just having their eyes open. I am sure the member for Southport thinks a caveat emptor world is wonderful from a solicitor’s point of view, where everyone has to look after themselves, but that is what governments are supposed to do. That is why we have Fair Trading. That is why the minister is responsible for Fair Trading. We have to put in checks and balances that protect people in our society who are not capable of doing that themselves--and there are many of them. For the minister to say that they should have their eyes open is a complete abrogation of his responsibility to the unit dwellers and people in community living in the electorate of Southport whom he is supposed to represent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1125055"></A>
The 2003 legislation recognised the conundrum of the 1997 legislation but has obviously failed to address it correctly, hence this ad hoc and misguided attempt at rectification in the House today. Issues such as the developer setting long lease periods for management rights to the entity seem a terrible impost on future communities living in the entity when the developer has grabbed his cash and run, leaving residents and QCAT, funded by the taxpayers of Queensland, to sort out problems created by this failed legislation. For instance, what would be wrong with the initial term of lease of management rights on developed property being limited to three years, until the community had established itself in the premises and would be then best placed to set its own lease management period? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1125057"></A>
Community living should be totally about the community making the best decisions for its own community as a whole. That is why bodies corporate are charged with decision making and direction taking on behalf of their community. A complete review of body corporate legislation by the next government in Queensland would demonstrate to the thousands of body corporate dwellers a can-do approach to address industry concerns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

The objective of this bill is to amend the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997 by creating and introducing a new lot entitlements system. The new lot entitlements system will consist of two guiding principles for the setting of contribution schedule lot entitlements and a ‘limited ability’ to adjust contribution schedule lot entitlements. In regard to community titles schemes established before this piece of legislation was developed, there is a chance for lot owners to have the opportunity to revert the contribution schedule lot entitlements for every lot in a scheme to their original setting prior to any adjustment order already in place. According to the government’s explanatory notes, the second objective of the bill is to simplify the management arrangements for residential community titles schemes that only have two lots. </Hansard-Body>

Community living is the fastest growing form of housing and accommodation arrangements in Queensland, with many people choosing to live in body corporate managed complexes and unit blocks. There are 380,000-odd body corporate management groups in Queensland which means there could be up to a million Queenslanders who in some form will be affected by this legislation. </Hansard-Body>

Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 One major concern is the retrospective nature of this piece of legislation which will have significant changes and regulations imposed on unit owners and which will have a significant effect on people who have invested in property in good faith under the laws of Queensland. I take the interjection from the member for Southport who said that it is not right. It was he who said that the 2003 legislation was right and, hello, in 2011 says it is wrong. So does the former minister who introduced the legislation know if it is right or wrong? Is he Yin or Yang? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129806"></A>
This Bligh government is now sanctioning a loss of financial position to some property investors after 2003 through this legislation, and former Minister Lawlor and current Minister Lucas should hang their heads in shame. The history of this legislation goes back to the Building Units and Group Titles Act 1980, which introduced a single schedule of lot entitlements for community titles schemes. From this original piece of legislation, the Body Corporate and Community Management Act was introduced in 1997 and brought in two different types of lot entitlements schedules--a contribution schedule and an interest schedule. The majority of body corporate charges are determined by each lot’s contributor schedule lot entitlements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129809"></A>
Amendments to the Body Corporate and Community Management Act in 2003 were introduced by the Labor government to change the legislation where one set of body corporate fees were required for each unit or property. This is the system that the Labor Party wants to change in the present bill before the House. In 2006-07 there was a decision to review the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 2003, and this review recognised the need for the simplification of management arrangements for residential communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129811"></A>
The proposed amendments attempt to ensure that there is an introduction of a new framework for the establishment and management of residential two-lot schemes. It will be called specified two-lot schemes module, which will manage the arrangements around two-lot schemes. All contribution schedule lot entitlements are to be fair and equitable, but we can see that this will not be the case with these amendments. The contribution schedule lot entitlements will still be based on the equality principle which will be equal under all circumstances or the relativity principle where there must be a relationship between lots by reference to one or more relevant factors. The two-lot schemes module can only apply if there is a written agreement between the owners of the lots called a ‘lot owner agreement’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129812"></A>
It is stated in the notes and required under the amendments of the bill that a body corporate for a two-lot scheme ‘will not have a body corporate committee, hold general meetings or be required to conduct a poll or cast a vote’ and can authorise or nominate a person to act in body corporate matters. Cost to government will apparently be none, but surely there are financial outlays by government because of more cases going through the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal. For this government, all disputes are heading towards QCAT determination, whether it be racing appeals, body corporates et cetera.</Hansard-Body>

Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Neighbourhood disputes--anything is going to QCAT. I can only see logjams for hearing dates and rivers of public money flowing to QCAT to try to keep up with poor Labor Party financial mismanagement. The Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal has been set up as a one-stop shop to deal with a variety of disputes and conflicts and, as we know, has a very heavy workload already and a backlog that needs government support to fix. With this piece of legislation there will be more community living residents who will need to utilise the services of QCAT. </Hansard-Body>

There is potential for a breach of fundamental principles which I have major concerns with. The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee highlighted this in its <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert</Hansard-Italic>
 No. 1 of 2011. In the words of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee report, clause 5 may be inconsistent with principles of natural justice as it may allow a decision to be made based on an irrelevant consideration. Clause 5 also inserts a new section which brings in schemes introduced after commencement of the bill, the equity principle and relativity principle. With the relativity principle, this allows for an unequal contribution scheme. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129820"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Trust me. I’m a politician. Again, in regard to rights and liberties of individuals, clauses 7, 8, 12, 21 and 41 are of major concern. These are significant clauses that the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee has great trepidation and concerns about and which may breach fundamental legislative requirements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129821"></A>
Clause 8 in particular removes the right of some lot owners’ ability to apply for adjustment of their contribution schedule lot entitlements. This may deny lot owners their rights regarding the adjustment changes and processes. This is the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee saying that this is flawed legislation. They agree entirely with the LNP. A bipartisan committee says that what this group of people called the Labor Party in government are trying to do is railroad legislation that does not comply with and does not take into account the cares and concerns and the legal requirements of what is expected of a properly constituted government in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129822"></A>
Clause 21 looks at the requirement that if you fail to comply with continuing and future contravention notices then the penalty will be 20 penalty units. Clause 41 relates to body corporates failing to lodge requests to record new community management statements incorporating change to contribution schedule lot entitlements, with the penalty being up to $10,000. This, according to the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee, may affect the rights and liberties of all lot owners. This is what an independent committee is saying. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129824"></A>
New section 379 is also of concern to the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee in regard to the rights and liberties of lot owners. This section has a sunset clause on motions for reversion of three years from commencement. It would be prospective in operation, taking property interests to a retrospective point in time prior to all or any adjustments of the original contribution scheme lot entitlements. This, I believe, is very significant and will definitely impinge on lot owners’ rights. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129825"></A>
Clause 4 amends section 46, which relates to lot entitlements of community titles schemes after the beginning of the subsection relating to the contribution schedule principle and the interest schedule principle. The insertion of a new section establishes the equality principle and the relativity principle for deciding lot entitlements for community titles schemes. This section sets out relevant factors for the use of the relativity principle. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129827"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Wilson:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 What does that mean? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129828"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am pleased to explain in very simple terms to members of the government what it all means. Developers are the ones that can choose which principles apply, either the relativity or equality principle, and therefore which relevant factors work out the contribution lot entitlements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129829"></A>
Clause 5 also introduces a new section which establishes the market value principle as the deciding principle for calculating interest schedule lot entitlements for lots included in a community titles scheme. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129830"></A>
With the recent flooding events in Queensland, I would like to raise the point that there is no obligation on body corporates to insure their complexes for flood cover. It seems that insurance companies have abrogated their responsibilities in this area as well.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129868"></A>
The insurance that is required by law is basic building cover. I believe that this is an issue that needs to be looked into and that will require future legislative changes to the insurance industry. If the properties are stand-alone and do not share walls, each individual property owner can take out flood insurance separately, but I do believe that most property owners in complexes presumed that they would be covered. The insurance system needs an overhaul so information that is clear and concise is disseminated to the consumer.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129870"></A>
In conclusion, I am amazed that the Labor Party wants to change the law yet again--back to what the original piece of legislation was. To make changes in this muddled and reactive manner are symptomatic of a government in disarray, with incompetent ministers guiding the passage of important legislation through this House. If ever there was a sound recommendation for new and rigid scrutiny of legislation to be addressed in this House then this abominable piece of legislative handiwork by a dysfunctional Labor Party government is it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129871"></A>
One gets the cynical impression that this ill-founded legislation is based on political survival instincts rather than reasoned logic and fair decision making. It is to be hoped that all Queenslanders savour the cost of the 2003 and 2011 legislation on people’s lives in community living abodes and kick out this incompetent government at the first opportunity. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(8.40 pm): I rise to support the Body Corporate and Community Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. I want to focus on two particular elements. The first is the simplified process for dealing with bodies corporate for duplexes. In my electorate duplexes are common and becoming more common. Some of that is as a result of the Minister for Community Services and Housing’s department providing accommodation more suitable for older people who are looking for smaller accommodation. </Hansard-Body>
<DIV>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129878"></A>
Some of the new estates in my electorate are providing two- and three-bedroom accommodation units that are affordable. They are being provided through this duplex model. They are often very well done. They are often done on corners. People do not even realise they are duplexes because they have two street entrances. They have proven very successful in places like Holmview. I support this simplified model of administering the body corporate issues that arise in those circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129880"></A>
I have a concern that I want to put on the record. It is dealt with in clauses 27 and 28 of this bill. This legislation puts a much greater onus on the seller of units and particularly the developer of units in terms of providing purchasers with information about what they are buying and moving into. I do support that principle. People need to know what they are getting when they move into these facilities. We need to ensure that there is some certainty. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129881"></A>
Part of the problem I have in my electorate is an historical one. Developers of large townhouse developments, particularly in Edens Landing, have traditionally put in place a body corporate scheme and a contract for an on-site manager. That on-site management contract often has escalation clauses in it which mean the manager’s contract continues to escalate over time. I understand that those developers often sell that contract to a person who buys in. In the past that has made it difficult for some of my constituents to ascertain what it is they are purchasing when they move in. Because those management contracts continue to escalate their body corporate fees continue to escalate, and that puts significant pressure on their ownership. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129883"></A>
For those residents in Edens Landing, I have sought the assistance of the Commissioner of Body Corporate and Community Management. The commissioner was very helpful in trying to resolve the matter. Unfortunately, these issues of escalating costs were not evident when they purchased. I think we need to ensure that when people are purchasing into these body corporate and community management schemes they are aware of what they are purchasing. Not only should they know the cost they are facing now; they should also have the chance to make a call on whether the escalating costs as time goes on will stay within their budget. The last thing we want to see is people who are purchasing into schemes put into a position where they are priced out and have no option but to sell what often is the greatest investment of their life. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(8.44 pm): I rise in support of the Body Corporate and Community Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. Firstly, I begin by acknowledging the work put into the development of this bill by the former minister for fair trading, the Hon. Peter Lawlor. The member for Southport worked with great determination to have the inequities of the lot entitlements system under the current legislation dealt with for many people living in units right across the state. He is to be commended for all his efforts. </Hansard-Body>

Ms CROFT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is his legacy. He did a fantastic job. I know that it was No. 1 on his priority list. He should be very proud that this bill is before the House tonight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129893"></A>
The changes that are before us in the bill being debated tonight are, of course, the result of extensive consultation and review. The bill has two objectives that will deliver better outcomes for many of my constituents living in residential community titles schemes. I note that the LNP are not supporting the bill and will be voting against it. This is a great shame for many of their constituents, I believe. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129894"></A>
This bill provides a more equitable arrangement for unit owners, many of whom are pensioners on fixed incomes or mum and dad investors. I think the LNP should be ashamed that it is not supporting people living in those units, particularly on the Gold Coast where there are many people who have had inequitable arrangements. I am very surprised that the LNP are not supporting this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129895"></A>
The bill provides for a new lot entitlements system. There will be now two principles for setting a contribution schedule lot entitlements and a limited ability to adjust contribution schedule lot entitlements. In addition, the bill establishes a far more simplified management arrangement for residential community titles schemes containing only two lots. This is achieved by a new regulation that will simplify and improve the day-to-day management of residential two-lot schemes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129896"></A>
Under the current lot entitlements scheme, owners of typically larger units have applied to have their contribution schedule lot entitlements and therefore their body corporate fees reduced. This has resulted in owners of smaller units subsidising common property maintenance expenses for owners of larger units. That is what the opposition thinks is a fair arrangement. In many cases, the owners of smaller units whose lot entitlements and body corporate fees have increased now struggle to pay their share of body corporate fees. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129898"></A>
The bill amends the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997 by providing lot owners in community titles schemes established prior to the commencement of the bill with an opportunity to revert the contribution schedule lot entitlements for each and every lot in the scheme to their original settings prior to any and all adjustment orders. For community titles schemes established before and after the commencement of the bill, any future adjustments of contribution schedule lot entitlements will be limited to very particular circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129899"></A>
As currently provided, two or more lot owners can agree to redistribute the contribution schedule lot entitlements amongst themselves. Lot owners will be able to adjust contribution schedule lot entitlements if it is agreed upon by all lot owners in a scheme through a resolution without dissent. Alternatively, a specialist adjudicator or the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal can make an order to adjust the contribution schedule lot entitlements if they are not set in accordance with the principle applying to contribution schedule lot entitlements--that is, the principle stated on the scheme’s community management statement. Limiting the ability to adjust contribution schedule lot entitlements into the future provides certainty for lot owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129900"></A>
As I have mentioned, this bill makes life easier for residents who live in specified two-lot schemes. The new management process encourages the owners to self-manage. Decisions of the two-lot scheme owners will be made by a written agreement and will not require a body corporate committee or the need to hold meetings and no-one will be required to cast a vote regarding a matter. For many reasons, the owner of a property may not reside in or close to the two-lot scheme property they own and, when decisions are made about matters that can quite easily be managed, through the changes in this bill an owner can authorise a person to act for the owner in body corporate matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134919"></A>
The bill also provides for owners to agree on how they may choose to fund body corporate expenses without having to use the concept of levying contributions. These changes encourage more sensible and workable outcomes for people living in close proximity to one another, encouraging greater and more open communication and consideration for one another. Whilst it is inevitable that owners or occupiers may not always agree, the bill provides that, instead of requiring the body corporate to issue a contravention notice where a lot owner or occupier does not comply with the by-laws, which for a two-lot scheme requires the two owners to agree to issue the notice under the new regulation module, an owner can give the owner or occupier of the other lot a written notice for contravening the by-laws. The process includes the provision that a lot owner can start enforcement proceedings with the Office of the Commissioner for Body Corporate and Community Management or the Magistrates Court.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134926"></A>
More and more people are choosing to live in unit or community living developments and it is really important for people when buying into a community titles scheme or if they are selling their property in a community titles scheme to exercise due diligence. It is important that the applicable principle being used to determine the lot entitlements and the body corporate fees for a property are disclosed. This bill enhances disclosure requirements, ensuring that protection is provided for consumers when considering buying or selling a property in a body corporate scheme. I am very pleased that the Bligh government has introduced this bill that will fix a problem that has affected many people who are struggling to pay body corporate fees that have increased significantly following applications to adjust the contribution schedule lot entitlements of schemes around the state. I commend the bill to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

But after listening to the diatribe from various members of the LNP, I thought it might be salutary to explore the whole history of units in Queensland. The original types of units were actually companies and if a person wanted to buy a unit when they subdivided the air above a piece of ground they had to buy shares in a company. There was a difficulty with that because they became a shareholder and they were subject to the Companies Act, which imposed a lot of different obligations on various people within the scheme. In 1980 we got the Building Units and Group Titles Act. That was never a really full answer, but it endeavoured to answer some of the problems that had arisen by putting in place a very specific scheme to deal with the subdivision of air, the subdivision of blocks that were built above two or three storeys.</A></Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOOLIHAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It gives the untruth to, if we want the vernacular, but that obviously was never the English application. The Building Units and Group Titles Act probably caused as many problems as it solved. In 1997 the act was amended and we heard the story about how great that amendment was. It was again amended in 2003. For the benefit of those people opposite who do not have any knowledge of the doctrine of the separation of powers, they should take into account that the 2003 legislation, which was enacted by this parliament, was in fact determined to have some defects by that other branch of government under the doctrine of separation of powers--the judiciary. There was a 2004 case and it made decisions in relation to 2003 which said that there had to be a different approach to it. We heard about the 2007 amendment, and that really gave the jurisdiction the right of application to QCAT as against the District Court. I believe that, ultimately, QCAT will provide a lot of reasonably inexpensive results for people who go to it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134943"></A>
That notwithstanding, as a result of the 2004 Centrepoint case--that was the decision in relation to the application of the 2003 legislation--it was then followed through and it was reviewed. There have been a number of ministers. First off, the member for Albert was the minister who initiated the original discussion paper. We then had the member for Southport as the then minister and we have the current minister. This bill seeks to address the mischief which has arisen by virtue of the act as it presently stands. We have heard claims about suddenly raising the fees for body corporate lots to a massive amount because people owned big areas. I do not know whether people believe in the word ‘equity’, but I would have thought that if one has such a large area and they want to be equitable they should pay a rateable proportion according to the area that they own. That is just common sense and probably a true exposition of the law of the land, but the LNP does not want to look at that. That would encourage it to support people other than those people who it would look to for large amounts of money or major financial support. Therefore, we sit here and we hear all of the bleating about the amendments to the act in the bill which is now before the House.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134945"></A>
I support this bill wholeheartedly after having practised law for 25 years and grappled with the difficulties that were experienced by very many lawyers in the application of the original body corporate legislation. However, the main point that I wanted to deal with related to the specified two-lot schemes module. With 12,000 community title schemes consisting of two lots in Queensland, this module will really be welcomed by many constituents right throughout Queensland, because it is becoming a favoured way of increasing the ability of having two living areas on one block of land. The formal arrangements provided by the existing regulations modules are often impractical for residential two-lot schemes, and most of us know them as duplexes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134946"></A>
The new regulation module will provide more appropriate requirements for the management of body corporates for residential community titles schemes containing only two lots and the decision-making framework for owners of those schemes to which the new model applies will no longer require body corporate meetings to be held. It seems rather pointless when two people live side by side and they need a formal meeting to decide matters which they should be able to agree between themselves. Instead, owners of two-lot schemes to which the module applies will be able to make decisions about body corporate matters in writing by a lot owner agreement. Simpler financial arrangements will also be provided for residential two-lot schemes under the new regulation module, including the ability for lot owners to manage their shared expenses without the need for an administrative or sinking fund. If we go back to those larger schemes to which the act applies, that is the real rub about contributions according to equity, particularly in relation to the sinking fund.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139830"></A>
A more practical approach to enforcing by-laws in residential two-lot schemes, to which the new module applies, will also be introduced. Instead of requiring the body corporate to issue a contravention notice where a lot owner or occupier does not comply with the by-laws, which for two-lot schemes requires the two owners to agree to issue the notice, under the new regulation module an owner can give the owner or occupier of the other lot a written notice for contravening the by-laws. The specified two-lot schemes module will make the day-to-day management of a body corporate simpler and less onerous for owners of residential two-lot schemes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139831"></A>
The other provisions of the legislation will make it more equitable for the many owners of small residential units in very large building schemes where they are presently at the mercy of people who can bring an application to reduce their contributions per lot and just lump the costs for their lot onto the owners of smaller lots. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139832"></A>
All in all, I believe that the Body Corporate and Community Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill will provide a more equitable approach to contributions to lot entitlements. I would like to thank the minister and previous ministers for bringing the bill before the House. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The bill amends the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997, the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Regulation 2009 and the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Rules 2009. The main objectives of the bill are to amend the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997, among other things to provide a new lot entitlements system to limit the ability to adjust contribution schedule lot entitlements and to give owners in existing schemes a right to reverse previously adjusted contribution schedule lot entitlements to their original position, allegedly to add some certainty to lot owners. I would argue that this legislation is only going to further confuse matters and create more uncertainty for many owners of lots. </A></Hansard-Body>

As the member for Currumbin indicated in her outstanding contribution to this debate, community titles schemes take many forms. I would guess that my electorate of Coomera would have more than most of the other electorates represented by members in this House. Lot entitlements are used to determine how costs and interest in a community titles scheme are divided between owners and the voting rights of owners in certain circumstances. This brings me to the point of my contribution in this debate. Numerous individuals have come to me as their local member to discuss inequities that they see in their individual schemes versus schemes around them. As the member for Mermaid Beach said, the issue is about who should pay more and who should pay less. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139843"></A>
A classic example where the lot entitlements were determined by the developer is one case that I have been involved in. It came to light because new owners moved into a property in a community adjacent to one that they had just vacated. The matter came to light because they could not believe the difference in their rates notice versus the rates for their previous property. This particular development has been in place for something like six or seven years. No-one had raised the issue in the past, but it came to light. These people made inquiries and they referred the matter to me. We had some discussions about it and it was determined that, in dividing the lot entitlements among the various properties, the suggestion was that the developer would benefit either himself or others by adjusting the lot entitlements to ensure that particular properties within the overall complex would pay far less in not only their rates but also their body corporate fees and so forth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139844"></A>
This legislation starts to get very messy for people who are in a position where they have already found that there is an inequity. Everybody agrees that the owners of properties in this particular area have been, for all of the years that the development has been in place, paying too much in every respect versus the owners of other properties within the precinct. So the change is made and agreed to by all of those in the development and they go along with them for some time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139845"></A>
Then along comes this legislation and we see that all of those inequities that have been corrected in the past can now be reversed. So we have a situation where, under this new legislation, we can change everything back to the inequitable position that existed before. This is just one small example of what is wrong with this legislation. As I outlined, once this legislation is approved there are going to be more problems for property owners who have already been through the process of redressing the inequities. The opposition does not support the legislation. <Hansard-Speech-End>

As we know and as we have heard in this debate tonight, the bill before the House amends the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997. That legislation was introduced into this House by the member for Warrego as a member of the Borbidge government. The bill also makes minor changes to the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Regulation 2009 and the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Rules 2009. Queensland has some 39,000 community titles schemes covering 364,000 lots. Of course, when we are dealing with community titles schemes we are not necessarily dealing with large unit complexes; we can be dealing with duplexes which are involved in community titles schemes. </Hansard-Body>

As I said, when we are dealing with community titles schemes we are not talking in all events about high-rise buildings and multimillion dollar penthouses. I note that the member for Coomera and other members representing electorates on the Gold Coast have talked about community titles schemes in their electorates. We can certainly see the difference between the community titles schemes in the electorate of Currumbin and the electorate of Kawana. Most of the community titles schemes in my electorate are ground-level community titles schemes, over-50s villas not contained in retirement villages but of one or two levels, and simple duplexes under the small scheme modules. </Hansard-Body>

The bill before the House will amend the previous amendments brought about and moved by the Beattie government in 2003 which the opposition supported. It was good enough at the time.

Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I unqualifiedly and unreservedly withdraw. The Beattie government moved these amendments in 2003 and, as I said, it was good enough at the time. Time and time again this government comes into this place with amendments formulated as a result of advice from practitioners and a form of consultation because it has introduced legislation in a rush and a panic and it works out that it got it wrong and needs to change it. The government is completely changing its position from where it stood in 2003. It is an absolute backflip. But if you ask me if I am surprised I will say ‘absolutely not’, because this is not the first time, it is not the second time and it is not the third time. It has happened over the course of this long-term toxic Labor government over the last 12 years in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144925"></A>
This bill that we are debating tonight will proffer a new entitlements scheme. In my previous occupation I had a number of dealings with body corporate matters and community titles schemes. The Attorney-General last week started the debate on the Neighbourhood Disputes Resolution Bill. We did come to some form of agreement, to an extent, on that matter. Even the member for Keppel and I agreed in that debate at the time. It does not happen often, but it did in that debate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144926"></A>
For most practitioners in this House, the second most common form of complaint and dispute that always seemed to arise was with community titles schemes. This is because people are living so close to one another, whether in a ground floor unit in a community titles scheme or in a high-rise development. I acted for a constituent who bought a couple of units in a community titles scheme. They went from quite a nice house on the canal into a community titles scheme. I could tell by their personality, as you sometimes can, that they were potentially not suited to community living in close proximity to neighbours, having had the freedom that they had had for most of their years. These particular people only lasted about eight weeks. The lady was an author and wrote a book about why not to buy in community titles schemes. They bought another house on the canal and lived their married life there. Community titles schemes do not suit everyone, but it is a form of accommodation that we need and some people do enjoy it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144927"></A>
When dealing with community titles, I used to draft community management statements in terms of lot entitlements. We were also dealing with the schedule lot entitlements and exclusive use areas. One issue is community property. The responsibility for the common property rests with the body corporate. It is an area of law that clients need particular explanation of as to their rights, liabilities and responsibilities. Since my election to this parliament a number of residents in the Kawana electorate have raised concerns that changes undertaken by the Bligh Labor government will affect the costs associated with living in a community titles scheme which are, of course, apportioned by the lot owner’s allocated lot entitlement. These costs in the past have related to heavy water restrictions on common property of body corporate facilities, including the forced implementation of vigorous water reform processes that bodies corporate had to endure in the last two years, and to the extent of costing bodies corporate a lot of money in these schemes, some of which can least afford it. There have also been changes to pool-fencing requirements.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144928"></A>
The principles for deciding contribution schedule lot entitlements are set out in clause 46A of the bill as the equality or relativity principle. These principles cater for inequities in car parking and different requirements for public access or maintenance or commercial community titles schemes and the use of large volumes of water. I have been contacted by some constituents in respect of the wording of the consultation draft of the bill. The primary objections that were raised relate to proposed section 385(4)(b), which was set out in clause 19 of the draft consultation bill as--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1144929"></A>
385 Resolution on motion. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1144930"></A>
(4)	At the general meeting, the body corporate--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1144931"></A>
(a)	is taken to have passed a resolution without dissent to change the contribution schedule lot entitlements of the lots included in the prescribed scheme to the pre-adjustment order entitlements, subject to the changes (if any) decided under paragraph (a). </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144932"></A>
The explanatory notes state that the bill proposed to allow community titles schemes established prior to the commencement of the bill which have been subject to one or more orders to adjust contribution schedule lot entitlements the ability to revert their lot entitlements to their original settings prior to any and all adjustment orders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144933"></A>
While bodies corporate should be allowed to revert their lot entitlements to their original settings prior to any adjustment orders, the decision should be made by motion to be passed in the same manner as any other motion that is put before the body corporate committee. Any motion that is put before a body corporate committee should be voted on and either accepted or rejected in accordance with the body corporate standard procedure for motions. Such a motion should not be deemed to have passed without dissent, as prescribed in section 385(4)(b) of the consultation draft of the bill, unless the motion is, in fact, passed by the body corporate without any votes against it. I note that the bill before the House does not include the section proposed in the consultation draft of the bill but merely states that the motion will be decided at a general meeting. I seek the Attorney-General’s comments in relation to the bill before the House and the changes between the consultation draft and this bill relating to the issues that I have raised. I would also appreciate the Attorney-General’s confirmation that in the bill before the House the rules of a general meeting will take effect in determining motions on lot entitlements put before a body corporate committee. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144934"></A>
As shadow Attorney-General, I have grave concerns about any legislative amendments that are retrospective in nature and breach fundamental legislative principles. Again, this is not the first bill that we have debated in this parliament that the Labor Party have introduced with retrospective effect. They do it all the time. I do hold initial grave concerns about any retrospectivity in any bill because it does sometimes impinge upon the rights and liberties of individuals. The explanatory notes to the bill refer to these fundamental legislative principles as defined in the Legislative Standards Act 1992. The notes state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1144935"></A>
The proposed amendments to the BCCM Act will potentially breach the fundamental legislative principle by adversely affecting the rights and liberties of individuals retrospectively. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144936"></A>
Lot owners in community titles schemes that were established prior to the commencement of the bill will have different rights to the lot owners in schemes established after the bill. I do, however, support any legislative amendments that will reduce the workload on the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal. The underlying premise of QCAT is to streamline our justice system, and that should never change. It is also an underlying principle to provide effective and cheap justice through the justice system to Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144937"></A>
The second objective of the bill before the House relates to the establishment of a management arrangement for residential community titles where there are only two lots, commonly referred to as a two-lot schemes module. This is prescriptive whereby it only applies to community titles schemes (a) that are residential, (b) that consist of two lots, (c) that are not part of a layered arrangement, and (d) where there is no letting agent for the scheme. Lot owner agreements will be required for decisions of the body corporate for a two-lot scheme. The intention of this amendment is to simplify the decision-making framework for a two-lot scheme body corporate. There is no need for a body corporate committee, no general meetings are required, there are no polls and no casting of votes and there is no need to maintain a quorum. This is a sensible change to the management of a two-lot titles scheme and reduces the administrative burden of maintaining body corporate meeting procedures on the individual lot owners.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144973"></A>
In its submission on the bill before the House, the Queensland Law Society stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1144977"></A>
There needs to be an appropriate balance struck between fairness for lot owners holistically and the comfort for individuals brought about by certainty. In the Society’s view the consultation amendment proposals do not achieve this balance. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1144978"></A>
Of course, that was in relation to the draft consultation bill, which was changed to what is before the House today. There are also submission contributions from a number of legal entities that do not believe the bill before the House achieves its objectives in clarifying schedule lot entitlements. </Hansard-Body-Continued>

I take this opportunity to thank the shadow minister, the member for Currumbin, for the work that she has undertaken in preparation for the debate on the bill before the House tonight. She has spoken with industry stakeholders and has foreshadowed a number of much needed amendments. There is one thing about this side of parliament that differs fundamentally from the other side. I notice that the member for Pumicestone has just entered the chamber. I have been talking about consultation and how the shadow minister has consulted with industry stakeholders. As I have mentioned before, a couple of weeks ago in this place the member for Pumicestone said that the Labor Party invented the word ‘consultation’. </Hansard-Body>

 I take the interjection from the member for Toowoomba South. He said, ‘We can consult.’ The member for Currumbin, the shadow minister, can consult. All the members of the LNP can consult. That is the difference between those of us on this side of the House and the Deputy Premier and his cronies on the other side of the House. We will listen to Queenslanders; we will listen to the public. We have listened, hence the very well thought out contributions of the shadow minister and members on this side of the House, who have sought contributions from Queenslanders who are suffering under this government. I conclude my contribution by voicing my support for the amendments foreshadowed by the shadow minister, which will not seek to move the goalposts as the game has already been played, to coin a phrase. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(9.23 pm): I rise to speak to the Body Corporate and Community Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. Community titles schemes have existed for many years in both commercial and residential forms. With regard to the latter, in our state steadily rising population figures have inevitably led to denser housing arrangements. A rightful desire for homeownership has seen more and more Queenslanders become owners of lots in community titles schemes, automatically making them members of bodies corporate. Such schemes involve the collective ownership and management of shared property and body corporate assets. It has become more important than ever to ensure that affordable housing options are available to Queenslanders. More than might be expected, body corporate fees can be a crucial factor in making a decision that touches the lives of so many Queenslanders, which is, ‘Where will I call home?’ </Hansard-Body>

</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144993"></A>
This bill seeks to make amendments to the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997, which exists as the legislative authority on the establishment and administration of community titles schemes in Queensland. These amendments come on the back of an initial amending bill introduced by Labor in 2003. Under the BCCM Act, every community titles scheme has a community management statement. The community management statement contains two schedules that are used to calculate lot entitlements: the contribution schedule and the interest schedule. The contribution schedule is used to calculate a lot owner’s share of most body corporate expenses, as well as the value of a lot owner’s vote for an ordinary resolution. The interest schedule is used to calculate a lot owner’s share of common property and body corporate assets upon termination of the community titles scheme, as well as each lot owner’s share of the unimproved value of schemed land for rates calculation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144994"></A>
The primary focus of the bill before the House is to make significant changes to several aspects of the contribution schedule. Where a lot owner’s share of most body corporate expenses is calculated, the principle for doing so under section 48 of the BCCM Act is to ensure that shares are equal, except to the extent that it is just inequitable in the circumstances for them to be equal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181432"></A>
The inclusion of the equality principle was a cornerstone of Labor’s 2003 amendments, which were unanimously supported at the time. For example, let us consider a community titles scheme containing a combination of residential and commercial lots. It would be unfair to ask the lot owner of a one-bedroom apartment to share the same body corporate, maintenance and utilities costs as a bustling restaurant downstairs. In such circumstances, it is only right that the lot owner of a restaurant pays a greater share than would be deemed equal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181437"></A>
The BCCM Act allows for several ways in which contribution schedules may be adjusted. Applications for an adjustment process are incredibly thorough, often costing anywhere between $10,000 and $20,000 for those seeking an adjustment order. Following the 2003 amendments, adjustment orders must be made with regard to the equality principle. However, this has led to circumstances where, to use the previous example, the one-bedroom apartment owner might have to take on an increased share of the body corporate expenses because of an adjustment in the restaurant owner’s favour. Certainly this is an extreme example. However, it appears that the former minister considers it to be the norm. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144996"></A>
Proposed section 379 of the bill allows an adversely affected lot owner to put forward a proposal to the body corporate to revert an adjusted contribution schedule of the scheme to reflect that which existed before the adjustment order was made. Under the bill a single lot owner has the power to compel the body corporate to pass a resolution to revert a contribution schedule lot entitlement to its original setting. All it takes is one person to undo a thorough assessment of what was deemed a just and equitable scheme as a whole. I support the proposition that a schedule lot entitlement ought to be as fair and certain as possible for lot owners. However, I cannot support section 379. I cannot see what is fair about allowing one person to compel a group for the sake of individual interest. I cannot see what is appealing about certainty when it ensures unfairness. Section 379 is an overreaction, failing to strike a balance between fairness and certainty for all lot owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144998"></A>
For new community titles schemes, amendments to section 46 are proposed to govern the setting of contribution and interest schedule lot entitlements. With regards to contribution schedule lot entitlements, the equality principle is retained. However, scheme developers will have the option to apply either that or a proposed new relativity principle. Under the relativity principle, it will be a requirement that contribution schedule lot entitlements demonstrate the relationship between the lots by reference to a list of particular relevant factors, being how the community titles scheme is structured; the nature, features and characteristics of the lots; the purposes for which the lots are used; the impact the lots may have on costs of maintaining the common property; and the market value of the costs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150082"></A>
An assessment based on the market value of the lots has attracted criticism upon consultation with several notable bodies including the Queensland Law Society and the Australian College of Community Association Lawyers. The QLS considers that an assessment based on market value is problematic and leads to unfairness, especially since the term ‘market value’ is left undefined. On its face, the bill would mean that the body corporate fees would be apportioned according to a lot’s market value irrespective of size. While a market value assessment may be appropriate for calculating interest schedule lot entitlements, its application to contribution schedule lot entitlements is flawed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150086"></A>
Labor’s proposed amendments to the governing principles of lot entitlements seek to introduce greater fairness and certainty for members of bodies corporate with regard to the management of lot entitlements. No-one in the LNP would deny that this is an admirable goal. Put simply, though, this bill fails to achieve this objective. It is impossible to expect the setting of lot entitlements to please every single lot owner. However, this bill will not make it any easier for lot owners and bodies corporate alike, nor will it make it any better. It encourages conflict between people who must live within close proximity of each other. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150087"></A>
The LNP supports fair and equitable contributions, but this is not achieved by this politically motivated bill, which only serves to protect the member for Southport and not the thousands of unit owners who bought into schemes under the existing legislation. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Redcliffe--ALP) (9.30 pm): I rise to contribute to the Body Corporate and Community Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. Unit living in communities where there are community titles schemes is becoming more common state-wide. In my electorate of Redcliffe, unit living is becoming increasingly prevalent. Our skyline is dotted with increasing numbers of high-rise apartment blocks. Their increase has been controversial and a point of much discussion on the Redcliffe Peninsula. They are, however, here to stay and an ever-increasing number of people are finding them a convenient lifestyle choice. Those with heavy work commitments or seniors living in a community find that having access to a pool, a gym or gardens without the burden of responsibility for their upkeep is an inducement into this type of lifestyle. </Hansard-Body>

The workings of a body corporate, with many different points of view, can be a shock for new unit owners. This bill will ensure fairness for all unit owners particularly regarding their body corporate fees. This bill amends the 1997 Body Corporate and Community Management Act. Specifically, the part that introduced the ability to allow lot owners in all body corporate schemes to adjust the contributions to a scheme’s contribution schedule and interest schedule is to be amended. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150099"></A>
With the passing of the 1997 Body Corporate and Community Management Act, there have been significant adjustments to some contribution schedules and interest schedules to the detriment of some lot owners as they have placed huge financial burdens on them. For example, a retiring couple may have bought a $400,000 ground-floor unit in a new 12-storey building. Their body corporate fees may only be a third of those of the owners of the penthouse on the 12th floor costing $1.5 million because they make no use of the lifts and other expensive amenities that those on higher floors use daily and thus increase the cost of maintenance of the lots on the higher floors. Under the 1997 act, the lot owners of the penthouse could make a case that all units should pay an equal share of body corporate fees so that the body corporate fees are significantly reduced for them but the retired couple on the ground floor suddenly find their body corporate fees have doubled. They are now paying the same share of the lift maintenance fees and the other amenities as those on the higher floors but they never use the lift and they do not have the benefits of the views that the more expensive units have. This bill reverses this in cases where some lot owners have been burdened with large increases in body corporate fees as a result of changes made to the scheme’s contribution schedule or interest schedule by other lot owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150100"></A>
This bill also provides appropriate and flexible principles for setting contribution schedule lot entitlements. Both the equality and relativity principles ensure that all issues from lot value, characteristics and impact of each lot on the cost of maintaining the common property are among the issues to be considered when setting contribution schedule lot entitlements. If the contribution schedule lot entitlements are not set with regard to these principles after this bill becomes legislation, lot owners have recourse to QCAT. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150102"></A>
I believe these amendments will, indeed, be advantageous to many of my constituents who have bought units for the first time over the past 10 years and have been caught by these changes in the amount of body corporate fees they have to pay. This bill also separates the management of duplexes from the management of multiunit communities to make the day-to-day management less complex through the use of a new regulation module. This is a well-targeted bill that will make duplex and unit living much easier and will allow lot owners to enjoy the lifestyle they have paid for. It is about fairness and better management. I thank the minister for his crafting of this bill. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Community or unit living is an increasingly popular lifestyle and accommodation choice, particularly for our seniors in the Mount Ommaney electorate. During the devastating floods this year, I was approached by residents of the Westlake Villas units. Most of the residents in this complex were flooded and there were angry meetings between residents and body corporate members, who were blamed for not obtaining adequate flood insurance for the complex. I walked around the complex and spoke to many residents. Some advised that they thought the body corporate should have covered their building structure because they were not able to get this insurance; they could only obtain contents insurance. After I provided residents with information regarding the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997 and various agents to contact for help, there were still some ambiguities in relation to who is responsible with regard to particular insurance companies. This example raised some of the likely matters that can become complex with bodies corporate. </A></Hansard-Body>

In relation to this bill, when entering into a contract of sale for a lot in a community titles scheme both parties--the buyer and the seller--must exercise their due diligence. This bill introduces enhanced disclosure requirements around the applicable principle applying to the distribution of lot entitlements and around body corporate fees. The enhanced disclosure requirements will incorporate contracts for the sale of lots in community titles schemes and a scheme’s community management statement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150113"></A>
The Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997 currently requires a disclosure statement to be given to a proposed buyer by a seller before the buyer enters into a contract to buy the lot. A disclosure statement contains essential information about a body corporate including the amount of annual contributions currently set by the body corporate and payable by the lot owner. The amendments to the act will require the disclosure statement to be accompanied by a copy of the community management statement for the scheme. Further, a scheme’s community management statement must state the principle applied to the distribution of the lot entitlements. The termination of a contract for the sale of a lot in a scheme will be provided where there is inaccuracy of disclosure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Consumer protection for owners and intending buyers of lots in community titles schemes is a fundamental objective of the act. This amendment enhances that objective. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(Brisbane Central--ALP) (9.39 pm): I rise in support of the Body Corporate and Community Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997 currently allows either the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal or a specialist adjudicator upon application by a lot owner to adjust a community titles scheme’s contribution schedule lot entitlement. Contribution schedule lot entitlements have sometimes had significant adjustments which have resulted in many lot owners being unable to pay their share of body corporate expenses. This has had significant impact on a lot of unit owners who live in my electorate. </Hansard-Body>

Unfortunately, living in a unit, which many have chosen to do for a number of reasons--be it a change of lifestyle, be it for retirement, be it for the ease by which you can get around the city and avoid travel--is slowly becoming very expensive, particularly when combined with the recent increases that were introduced by the Brisbane City Council--may I say in a very sneaky manner--in the last budget which saw massive rate increases for unit owners in my electorate, sometimes up to 300, 400 and 500 per cent. It has been an incredible increase which is making living in a unit unviable and very expensive for unit owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181720"></A>
I really cannot see the justification for these increases. These buildings sometimes contain 100 and 200 units. They are probably on a block of land the size of maybe two or three ordinary house blocks. You collect rates from 100 or 200 units, yet you have one place to go to collect bins, one input for water and one output for sewerage. Compare that to the services provided to 100 or 200 houses in a suburb where there is some distance between houses. That is quite different from a high-tower unit block, where there is no requirement for those services to be delivered along a lengthy road. There is a big difference between a unit dwelling and a house dwelling, and there are economies of scale of 100 or 200 units being built on a block compared to 100 or 200 houses in a suburb. There is a big difference in the amount of land that it takes. </Hansard-Body>

I acknowledge the excellent e-research done by the Queensland Parliamentary Library on this bill. It is a good document. I refer members opposite to it. They should read it so they can understand what this bill is about. When I was elected back in 2007, this was one of the first issues raised with me. It was a concern shared by me and in particular by the member for Stafford, the current minister, and by the member for Southport. Clearly there was a problem in the marketplace that needed to be addressed--and I admit that this is a complex issue to address, because inevitably in addressing this issue there will be gains and there will be losses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155339"></A>
Importantly, there has been no single cause of the problem but a series of events and decisions over a long period of time dating back to 1997, when there was a clear failure to fully appreciate the transitional implications arising from the enactment of the BCCM Act, all combining to bring about a problem we are addressing via this bill. Problems also commenced following the well-known Court of Appeal decision in what is commonly known as the Centrepoint or Fischer case which was handed down on 25 June 2004. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms GRACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Frequently discussed at the Wynnum IGA. It was a decision of a block of units located at Spring Hill in my electorate. Following this and the issues that had been continually raised, the government released a discussion paper back in December 2008. That discussion paper was entitled <Hansard-Italic>
Sharing expenses in community titles schemes</Hansard-Italic>
. It included a number of scenarios and options, and there were many submissions covering many issues. There have been opposing views from those who have gained by the Centrepoint decision and of course from the many who have been severely disadvantaged by the use of the legal precedent. In this particular court case, there are no doubt winners and losers when it comes to lot entitlements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155345"></A>
Larger penthouses and one-level unit owners have had their annual body corporate fees reduced, and this has been at the cost of smaller unit owners, whose fees have often increased substantially. I know of one inner-city complex where a very large unit owner’s body corporate fees reduced to a quarter of what they were paying when they bought the unit with their eyes open, knowing that that was their body corporate fee. Following a decision, their body corporate fee reduced to a quarter, and the smaller unit owners had their fees doubled or more. In some cases, the smaller unit owners were paying 50 per cent of the equivalent amount of body corporate fees paid by the larger penthouses or one-level unit. Clearly this has placed great financial stress on people who also did their due diligence and had their eyes open when they bought their unit. This decision is impacting upon their ability to remain living in a unit which they considered affordable when they purchased it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155346"></A>
Not only did they find they were up for these additional expenses through a court decision; it invariably affected the value of their property because body corporate fees are a major consideration when someone buys a unit. I want to place on the record my thanks to many of my constituents who have raised this issue from both sides of the argument--those who believe the Centrepoint decision is fair and those who are pleading to have this bill enacted as soon as possible. I acknowledge that this is a complex issue but it is one that needs addressing, and I believe we have found the best solution possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155347"></A>
The amount raised necessary to meet body corporate expenses usually represents 100 per cent. Inevitably, when one amount is lowered then someone else picks up that amount. From the many examples of adjustments brought to my attention, I can honestly say that the majority of unit owners in a complex have been disadvantaged when compared to the minority few gaining greatly from a reduction in their fees. The bill provides the ability to revert to previous contribution schedule lot entitlements and will only apply to existing community titles schemes and in relation to an order of the court, tribunal or specialist adjudicator that was made before the commencement of this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155348"></A>
A lot owner adversely affected by an adjustment order--that is, the fees increased due to the order given by the tribunal or the court--may submit a motion to the body corporate or the body corporate committee proposing the adjustment of the contribution schedule for the scheme to reflect the contribution schedule before any and all adjustment orders. However, there are limitations on the ability to propose such a motion. It is not available to an owner of a lot after an adjustment order was made or who becomes the owner of a lot after the relevant provisions in this bill commence. Also, the ability to submit such a motion will cease three years after this bill is enacted. Therefore, there is a time frame that affected unit owners must act within and the right for this motion no longer exists after three years. So there is a window of opportunity here for people who believe they have been adversely affected by these decisions to move a motion in the body corporate or body corporate committee to revert.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155350"></A>
 The body corporate or the body corporate committee must then deal with any such motion, and there are provisions in the bill about the manner in which the decision is to apply in such circumstances. There is quite a comprehensive flow chart that has been put together by the department to assist in the process, and I am very eager to help people who live in units in my electorate who want to move a motion, to give them the tools to enable them to do exactly what is required by the legislation and also to give bodies corporate the tools they need to take the actions they must take. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160548"></A>
The bill also proposes two important principles--the equality principle and the new relativity principle--to determine the setting of contribution schedule lot entitlements. This aims to set out a process for how these entitlements are going to be worked out by applying two principles which must be open, transparent and advised to people when they are buying units. The bill provides that contribution schedule lot entitlements must be set in accordance with the equality principle--that is, contribution schedule lot entitlements are set equal except to the extent to which it is just and equitable for them not to be equal--or the relativity principle, where there must be a demonstrated relationship between the lots by reference to one or more prescribed relevant factors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160549"></A>
Lot owners in community titles schemes established prior to and after the commencement of this bill will be able to adjust contribution schedule lot entitlements if it is unanimously agreed by all lot owners through a resolution without dissent of the body corporate. I notice that the member for Currumbin actually brought to the attention of the House a situation where all the lot owners were in agreement that the lot entitlement should be amended in a particular way. This bill will enable them to do that. There is no hindrance, where there is agreement and no dissent, to the body corporate adjusting those lot entitlements to reflect the desire of members of that body corporate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160550"></A>
For a community titles scheme established after the commencement of the bill, where a lot owner believes the contribution schedule lot entitlements are not set in accordance with the contribution schedule principle applying to contribution schedule lot entitlements, they may seek an order of a specialist adjudicator or QCAT to adjust the contribution schedule lot entitlements. An application has to be made and they have to apply whatever principle was applied when the lot was established. The order must only be in accordance with the contribution schedule principle which already applies to the contribution schedule lot entitlements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160551"></A>
The bill also provides that interest schedule lot entitlements--that is different to contribution schedule lot entitlements; it appears to be a principle that those opposite do not understand--must reflect the respective market values of the lots, except to the extent to which it is just and equitable in the circumstances for the individual lot entitlements to not reflect the respective market value of the lots. I am sure that those opposite have no understanding of the difference between contribution and interest schedule lot entitlements. With an interest schedule lot entitlement the lot owner has a share of the common property. The lot owner’s interest on termination of the scheme includes their share in the body corporate assets. There is a difference between contributing to the running costs and the interest schedule, where they actually have a share in common property and in the costs of the assets. That is a completely different kettle of fish. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160552"></A>
The member for Currumbin is exactly right: they have absolutely no idea. They must apply the market value. I would like to hear the explanation of what the alternative would be. If members understood the extreme differences between the two they would understand why the legislation is written in this manner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160553"></A>
The current provisions of the act providing the ability to seek an adjustment of interest schedule lot entitlements will continue to be available for all schemes after the commencement of the bill. These changes to the bill will ensure that there is as much certainty around body corporate costs as possible, as well as providing more appropriate principles for setting contribution schedule lot entitlements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160554"></A>
I congratulate the current minister for bringing this bill to the House. I have many constituents out there waiting to hear that this bill is being debated and that it passes through this House. I also congratulate the previous minister, the member for Southport, Peter Lawlor, who did an excellent job in going through all of the complex issues in relation to this matter. The member for Southport has been a strong advocate for ensuring that this matter does not continue in the complex way it is at the moment, that the majority of unit owners who are being disadvantaged do not continue to be disadvantaged and that the legislation is brought before the House as soon as possible so it can address the issue that I have spoken about tonight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160555"></A>
The member for Southport has done a sterling job. I place on record my congratulations for the hard work that he has done in relation to ensuring that this bill brings about a solution which, although complex and may not suit everybody and may not necessarily address all of the complex issues that we have discussed tonight, goes a long way to reverting to what people had when they first bought units and therefore having the disadvantage removed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160556"></A>
If those opposite understood this bill, if those opposite spoke to those unit owners, if those opposite realised the number of people who have been disadvantaged not only by the decisions of the courts in increasing their expenses but also by the increases in rates that they have had to endure because of the previous Lord Mayor of Brisbane, the candidate for Ashgrove--this has affected people who live in the Brisbane Central electorate but also people in other electorates--we would not need to apply a lot of the changes that are proposed. I believe it is a necessary step. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

On 23 March my office received a response from the Premier to a request I made on 9 February. My request was pretty simple. Given that Grigor Bridge at Conondale had been considerably damaged during the January floods, would the Premier give consideration to replacing it as part of the flood reconstruction? </A></Hansard-Body>

To me and my constituents in Conondale, the request seemed reasonable. Transport and Main Roads persist in throwing good money after bad repairing the bridge, instead of completely replacing it. Yes, in the short term the cost is less, but over the long run the repair bills start adding up and they will certainly swamp the $18 million price tag for replacing the decrepit timber structure with a modern flood proof concrete formation. But it was the same old tired response from the Premier. TMR would ‘redesign and reconstruct the side track that was washed away during the flood’ and ‘carry out further repairs to Grigor Bridge’, repairs that are expected to take up to eight months. It was not the answer that I or the people of Conondale sought, but it was the answer that we expected.</Hansard-Body>

The news is the same for the people of Beerwah, Glasshouse Mountains and Bells Creek. Following a tragic double fatality at the notorious Bells Creek interchange on the Bruce Highway, I wrote to the federal Minister for Infrastructure, Anthony Albanese, pleading that the interchange upgrades not be delayed because of the flood recovery. The minister’s response sounded as tired as the Premier’s--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1160572"></A>
... the deferral of construction works on a number of Nation Building projects, including the Caboolture and Caloundra upgrade, was necessary to free up funding and skilled workers to ensure there is a capacity for the rebuilding of essential infrastructure.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160575"></A>
As I said when the delay was first announced, this is heaping tragedy upon tragedy.

How many more will die during the two to three year delay? It is just not good enough.</Hansard-Body>

To conclude the disappointment for the constituents of Glass House, just yesterday I received formal communication from the Minister for Energy and Water Utilities confirming that he has decided to make the designation for certain land to become community infrastructure under the Sustainable Planning Act 2009, guaranteeing that Energex’s planned SunCoast power project along Eudlo Creek will proceed. </Hansard-Body>

There was no mention of a species management plan to protect the platypus community. There was no mention of Energex’s appalling record of community consultation--a record that saw the biggest stakeholder, the Sunshine Coast Grammar School, only formally briefed last Tuesday. There was no mention of the alternative options--alternatives that would have had far less social and environmental impact. The common thread across these three examples is the lazy approach of this tired Bligh Labor government. It is time for a change. It is time for energy, vision and leadership for all of Queensland. Campbell Newman and the LNP team stand ready to provide this change for Queensland. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The biggest public transport project in the north-western suburbs of Brisbane is going full steam ahead: a major redevelopment of the Ferny Grove Railway Station and precinct is underway. This $100 million state government initiative has been brought forward four years to help tackle congestion on our busy roads. I have been campaigning for this project for many years and it is fantastic to see it now taking shape. What will be created is a major public transport hub for the north-western suburbs that involves duplicating the track from Keperra to Ferny Grove, a major upgrade of the station, an expansion of the car park to approximately 1,000 places, and a major bus interchange for the TransLink services from Samford, Upper Kedron and Ferny Hills. I am delighted that with community support I have also been successful in ensuring that a new Ferny Grove Tavern can be built on the site.</A></Hansard-Body>

The big challenge for QR is how to manage all of this construction work over the next 12 months or so while at the same time having as many car parks as possible available for commuters every day. The number of car parks unavoidably will vary significantly during construction. At the moment, capacity has increased from about 600 to 750. However, later in the year this will be significantly reduced. Many Samford residents already park at Ferny Grove station and catch the train to the city. I believe that TransLink could help them out. I am calling on TransLink to provide assistance by temporarily waiving, for a limited period of time, the fares for bus travel on the Samford bus when the car park capacity is significantly reduced later in the year. This would encourage more commuters to use the bus and would take a lot of pressure off the car park when its capacity has been unavoidably reduced by the construction work on site. It may also encourage greater use of public transport longer term. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165824"></A>
I know that this is a fairly unusual step to take. However, I believe it is a simple and practical way to ensure that, for the limited time that construction work designed to expand the car park actually significantly reduces its capacity, QR and TransLink work together to ensure that commuters keep using public transport and help tackle traffic congestion. Sometimes exceptional circumstances call for exceptional solutions.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110405_220235" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Mirani--LNP) (10.02 pm): Today, as every other day, thousands of families were confronted with a different routine and challenge--a lifestyle dedicated to autism. All across our state there are parents struggling to get or deal with a diagnosis of non-communicative or difficult behaviour. There are families trying to control runaways, confused behaviour and challenging responses. The craving of every parent--reciprocated affection--is noticeably missing, yet these families continue to love their children and provide the best possible lives for them as they deal with autism spectrum disorders. There are many success stories, as we see by the adults who still deal with the disorder as they continue to participate in our society. The effects of autism are felt far and wide, as our teachers, carers and health professionals know. Yet we still do not have an accurate idea of the prevalence of autism across the state because this Bligh government still has not completed the fundamental simple task of mapping it.</A></Hansard-Body>

This month is Autism Month. It is a month to praise the work of families who help children develop through their autism. It is a time to recognise the achievements of those who have made so much of themselves while dealing with the disorder. It is an occasion to congratulate the work of doctors, therapists, teachers and specialists as they work to help our children receive the earliest possible treatment. Early intervention is essential in autism and needs to be a priority. Too many parents in this state have stories of being flicked from one government department to another, watching their children grow more and more into the disorder because early intervention services are not receiving enough support. I commend the work of our many carers, families and professionals who work to make the world so much better for people with autism.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110405_220456" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Toowoomba North--ALP) (10.04 pm): I want to speak on a number of matters that have happened in Toowoomba in the last week. Firstly, the government announced with the federal government an amount of $15.4 million from the disaster relief fund to the Toowoomba Regional Council. This was advance funding provided by both the state and the federal governments which will of course stimulate the Toowoomba economy. This will enable the Toowoomba Regional Council to confidently continue with the recovery work, particularly with respect to public infrastructure, local repairs and replacement of roads and bridges. Councils needed to supply their damage lists and signed funding agreements, which was eventually done by the Toowoomba Regional Council. </A></Hansard-Body>

It is of interest that about 80 per cent of the amount received will be spent on roadwork. The government’s priority is the rebuilding of Queensland, and last week’s payment shows that we are dedicated to getting on with that job. I want to acknowledge the fact that the Prime Minister was in Toowoomba today and also acknowledge that this is her third visit to Toowoomba since the floods. We appreciate her commitment to our area.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165847"></A>
Secondly, I want to mention last week’s opening by Minister Struthers of the new YWCA units at Mary Street. A $3.8 million contribution from the state government will provide 23 new affordable housing units which will provide safe and appropriate accommodation for people in need. They are very adaptable so that people with specific needs can access them. They are named the Hofmann and Wadley Wings after two former local presidents of the YWCA. Aileen Wadley began the tradition of providing affordable housing in 1945 and Margaret Hofmann raised the funds in 1971 for additional units. Therefore, it was appropriate that these new buildings recognise their past extremely worthwhile contributions. I am very pleased that this project has come to an end. It required a great deal of work from the previous minister, Mr Schwarten, as well as the current minister, Minister Struthers, and I thank them both for their efforts in this regard.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165856"></A>
Thirdly, adults with a disability on the Darling Downs have better access to better services with the opening of the new Endeavour Foundation centre in Toowoomba. The minister, Mr Pitt, opened the Endeavour Foundation’s Learning and Lifestyle Centre after the state government contributed $500,000 towards the new centre. Staff will deliver services and support to more than 140 local adults with a disability. They will provide training in literacy and numeracy, computer skills, money handling, road safety, health, physical activity and craft.</Hansard-Body>

 None for the Gold Coast, just Caboolture, Ipswich, Rosewood, the north coast line on the TransLink network. We have 15-minute gaps in the trains in the peak hour on the Gold Coast. We are told that there is no room to put any more trains on the tracks for the Gold Coast line, because there is no room when we get to Brisbane to put them across the river. We talk about a five per cent increase in passenger numbers. Let me put that into numbers for members. That is another 50 passengers on the Gold Coast line standing for one hour and 20 minutes every morning going to Brisbane and every afternoon coming back from Brisbane--50 passengers on each and every train in the peak period. </Hansard-Body>

 (Pumicestone--ALP) (10.11 pm): As we all know, two things in life are certain: death and taxes. I can predict with absolute certainty that many Queenslanders will die this year from a host of natural causes, illnesses, trauma, cancer and old age. Virtually all of the families of these people will find themselves at a funeral business at some stage to make decisions about the funeral arrangements. It is an important decision for people to be making at a time of great personal loss. They may be encouraged to spend vast amounts of money as a final tribute. I can also safely predict that most, if not all, of these families will be offered a funeral package that has changed little in the past 100 years. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1171336"></A>
It should not surprise honourable members that the funeral business, which can charge high prices for what are fairly simple items, is a highly lucrative one. For example, take the coffin, which will be used very briefly before being burnt or buried. It has no special or magical properties. It is just a fancy painted or stained box made of particle board, MDF or chipboard. Some coffins are made with precious timbers on order. Some are made locally, but I am advised that a growing number are cheap imports.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171337"></A>
The pace of change in the funeral industry is slow. In fact, an article last year in the <Hansard-Italic>
Economist</Hansard-Italic>
 titled ‘Exit strategies’ described burial rites in most of the modern worlds as an expensive relic of the 19th century. The article notes the findings from a South Australian study that burying a body, still the first preference for many Australians, releases a cocktail of formaldehyde and other chemicals into the soil and the surrounding watertable. Many of the drugs we take to preserve life are released in the decomposition process and some compounds never break down. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171340"></A>
Cremating was introduced in major cities and towns as an option to avoid these risks and to reduce the demand for more land for cemeteries. However, cremation has its own problems. The UK government has recently introduced regulations to require crematoria to fit control equipment to cut their toxic mercury emissions by half by 2012. The introduction of those regulations follows the discovery that up to 16 per cent of all mercury emitted in that country was from crematoria because of the fillings in teeth. Other countries are following the UK’s example.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171341"></A>
Honourable members will be pleased to note that a new inquiry by the Environment and Resources Committee will be examining this issue as well as other aspects of burials and cremations and related land use issues. We are taking submissions until 20 April. We are not seeking to interfere in religious practices, nor are we seeking to dictate to anyone how they should deal with their departed loved ones. However, we are interested in seeing the funeral industry lift its game. We would like to see more choices with less expense, less wastage of resources, fewer chemicals and lower overall impact on our natural environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171342"></A>
Every farmer and every producer in Queensland is aware of the impacts that their activities have on the environment. I am sure that the vast majority are keen to minimise their impacts if they can. Usually the law says they have no choice. The funeral industry should be no different. If there are ways that it can reduce its harmful effects, it should try to do so. This government and the community are making enormous improvements to reduce our use of resources and to minimise waste. I trust that every member will support the work of my committee to find better choices for the state’s funeral industry--an industry that ultimately affects every Queenslander.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Nicklin--Ind) (10.14 pm): This afternoon a very distressed Sunshine Coast resident contacted me regarding the end-of-life care his wife is receiving. I understand his elderly wife is and has been a resident of a Sunshine Coast nursing home for some time. She is a diagnosed palliative care patient with cancer and a muscle-wasting disease and is suffering significant pain and distress. I also understand that the woman has pleaded with her doctor not to let her suffer and die in pain. I understand that the doctor has refused to authorise a syringe driver to improve her pain management, claiming that a patient should enjoy their last stages of life. The husband has told me that he and the rest of his family are all very angry that the attending doctor will not administer enough pain relief to relieve his wife’s suffering, even if the result is to accelerate her death. This is what the woman has told her family she wants. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171350"></A>
This woman was a registered nurse working in the aged-care industry and she was assured by her family that they would not let her die in pain. Yet the husband tells me that the attending doctor is not prepared to rely on the amended Queensland law, commonly known as the rights of the terminally ill amendment, which allows a doctor to administer whatever medication is necessary to relieve the pain and suffering in a terminally ill person, even if a secondary effect of the drugs is to shorten the patient’s life. I understand situations such as this are occurring regularly. There have been two in the past week that I know of on the Sunshine Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171351"></A>
When people face such a terrible end--dying in agony watched by their distressed families--it is no wonder that more and more Queenslanders are calling for voluntary euthanasia laws in Queensland. I believe that this government and the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association have a responsibility to remind all Queensland doctors of the rights of the terminally ill amendment, which I introduced into the parliament some time ago, which allows people to die without pain and with dignity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171353"></A>
No Queenslander should die in pain. The RSPCA would not allow animals to suffer like this person is suffering at the moment. Maybe the next time I am approached by a family in similar circumstances I should approach the RSPCA, with the support of the patient’s family, and then we will see what the government and the Queensland doctors have to say about the way some Queenslanders are being treated at the moment. <Hansard-Speech-End>

It is a little bit unusual: it was at the Borallon Correctional Centre, which is in my electorate. I am a constant visitor to the centre and support a lot of the programs they have in place there. </A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1171363"></A>
The general manager of Borallon Correctional Centre, Scott McNairn, in the short time that he has been there, which has been only a couple of years, has done an amazing job in turning around some of the prisoners in that particular facility. Last week we saw prisoners graduating from literacy and numeracy level III and computer aided drafting courses. We saw a number of prisoners graduating with a certificate II in furniture making and as part of that program they are building doll’s houses, which are going to be used at the local children’s hospital. These were outstanding items that I took the time to view. There were also graduations in certificate II in hospitality and graduations in certificate I in IT. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171364"></A>
I think what is better about this particular facility than most others in relation to prison reform is that about 40 inmates have taken part. On graduation day, the parents of the prisoners enter the facility and are there to support their loved ones as they graduate. I take the opportunity to speak to every one of these family members before the inmates come in and I can tell members that, even though our prison population is largely illiterate and highly undereducated, it is amazing to see how proud not only the parents are but also the offenders are in relation to achieving simple tasks and simple certificates, such as certificate I or certificate II. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171365"></A>
Borallon Correctional Centre is also well known for a number of other things that it is doing at the moment. I think every member would be aware of the Pups in Prison program. As part of that program, prisoners train pups to work as assistance dogs for people with disabilities. This program is aimed at reducing reoffending behaviour and it also helps prisoners to develop their reading, writing and communication skills through the upkeep of a daily diary. I will be at the prison again next month for Pups in Prison. If any other members would like to come out on the day, they are welcome to come along and see these pups. They are absolutely fantastic. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171368"></A>
As well, there is the Shakespeare in prison program. Last year, they showed <Hansard-Italic>
Macbeth.</Hansard-Italic>
 It was absolutely outstanding to see some of the prisoners who were able to learn, understand and recite those lines of <Hansard-Italic>
Macbeth.</Hansard-Italic>
 Anybody who knows <Hansard-Italic>
Macbeth</Hansard-Italic>
 would know that the play has a number of long orations, and for the prisoners to recite them is an amazing feat on its own. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1171414"></A>
They are also doing the regular NAIDOC festivities. As members would imagine, the prison population includes a number of Indigenous persons. This year they are also looking at trying to help our Islander offenders as well. All in all, congratulations to the Serco facility at Borallon. Well done and hopefully there are many more.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Michelle broke her finger quite severely and needed to have a knuckle replacement. Mrs Guy was booked in for surgery on 18 March 2011 at a hospital in Brisbane. She arrived at 6.30 in the morning and waited for six hours, only for somebody to come out and say that her surgery had been cancelled. The reason? Because her finger surgery was not urgent, she was last on the list and the doctors had run out of time. </A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1171422"></A>
There was an enormous amount of organisation undertaken for Mr and Mrs Guy to go from Hervey Bay to Brisbane. I would like to talk about the cost involved and the reimbursement due to this cancellation. Surgery cancellations and rebates for country patients show a great disparity. Mr and Mrs Guy made the trip to Brisbane the night before the surgery. They organised accommodation and drove to Brisbane. They had booked a B&amp;B which was four minutes from the hospital at $135 a night for the two-night stay. They thought that was the better option as the parking at the hospital was $26 a day. What disappointed Mrs Guy was that she only got $30 back for the accommodation and $86.10 for the fuel for her trip, a total of $116.10. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171423"></A>
Mrs Guy is a very kind lady. She did not mind so much about the cancellation of the surgery. She said that she understood priorities. She and her husband have to do it all again, though. She still has a very bad finger and she believes that she has been hard done by, and I agree with her. Mrs Guy was more concerned about other elderly patients travelling to Brisbane only to be told that their surgery had been cancelled. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1171424"></A>
Travel and accommodation are very expensive for these pensioners. I have had a number of people come to my office and complain about travelling to Brisbane for surgery only to be told that their operation had been cancelled. I just wish that some consideration could be given to people, especially the elderly, who have travelled long distances to get medical treatment in Brisbane.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Upon seeing the needs of the victims of the recent Queensland floods and Cyclone Yasi, the Mayfield Marlins swim captains, Lauren Hocking, Daniel Bottesini, Emily Caputo and Josh McKee, decided to arrange a swimathon to raise funds. They organised the event, arranged sponsorship and, along with other members of the Mayfield Marlins swim club, swam their hearts out to raise the $1,246. I would also like to thank the parents and volunteers, including the Mayfield Marlins president, Donna Ricca, for their support for this obviously very worthy cause. I can assure all the members of the Mayfield Marlins swim club and their supporters that the money has been passed on to the Premier’s appeal and will go a long way to help support victims of the disasters which affected so much of Queensland earlier this year. </Hansard-Body>

Another example of the great community spirit in my electorate of Chatsworth is the members of the Carina Men’s Shed group. </Hansard-Body>

 I acknowledge the support from the member for Bulimba. The Carina Men’s Shed group president, George Hickey, Mal Wier and their team recently took on the task of building 50 nest boxes for mahogany gliders that were severely affected by Cyclone Yasi. They are an endangered species of glider. They live in the Tully area, an area I am very familiar with. The effect of Cyclone Yasi was to strip their habitat--all the leaves off the trees--which left them vulnerable to the weather and predators. George and Mal were the driving force in setting up the Carina Men’s Shed. They have been meeting under George’s house since they commenced. Due to the high level of support in the area for the Carina Men’s Shed and the number of men looking at joining they are quickly outgrowing their current home, and I and the member for Bulimba are working hard to try to find them a more suitable and permanent home in the Carina area. </Hansard-Body>

The mahogany glider boxes were requested by the RSPCA. George and the guys at the Carina Men’s Shed took it on. I was very pleased with the level of support they received from the local Bunnings. Alison and her team at Bunnings at Cannon Hill provided all the material and the guys set about building the 50 boxes within a couple of days. I congratulate them for that. I also congratulate Bunnings for their support of that particular project. I am happy to announce that they are continuing to support the Carina Men’s Shed group into the future.<Hansard-Speech-End>
