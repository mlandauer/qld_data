In my statement I advised the House that, included within a bundle of various documents tabled by the honourable member, one document had redactions which were ineffective in removing names that could identify a child, which is breach of standing order 35. The House gave leave to approve the Clerk to alter the document to effect proper redactions. The issue relating to redactions is now before the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee. However, an additional matter has now come to light. The tabled document refers to criminal charges instituted almost a year ago and states--</A></Hansard-Body>

... criminal charges are now scheduled to be heard in a Bundaberg court on 3 September 2010.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998424"></A>
However, the Clerk’s delegate has made inquiries with the Bundaberg Police Child Protection Unit and it has been confirmed that the matter referred to in the tabled paper is currently before the courts. I am advised that the matter has been through the committal process in the Magistrates Court and is currently before the District Court. Accordingly, the document is also in breach of the sub judice rule as set out in standing order 233. I have therefore instructed the Clerk to remove the offending document from the bundle of documents. I have also referred this aspect to the committee.</Hansard-Body>

Honourable members will of course now be aware of the tragic event that occurred on Sunday, 29 May at the Pacific Pines Tavern on the Gold Coast. Armed offenders entered the Pacific Pines Tavern with the intention of committing a robbery and took seven hostages. One of those hostages managed to make a 000 call seeking police assistance and Detective Senior Constable Damian Leeding and his partner, Detective Senior Constable Nicole Jackson, were first on the scene. While trying to apprehend the offenders, Senior Constable Leeding suffered a gunshot wound to the head. He was taken to the Gold Coast Hospital in a critical condition where he was on life support for a further three days. On Wednesday, 1 June, Senior Constable Leeding’s family made the heartbreaking decision to suspend his life support. Damian Leeding is survived by his wife, Sonya, who also serves the people of Queensland as a police officer, their two-year-old son, Hudson, and their three-month-old daughter, Grace. </Hansard-Body>

Senior Constable Leeding was a very well respected officer of the Queensland Police Service with a very bright future in that service. He was regarded by all who worked with him as someone who loved his work, loved his family and was a much loved mate to all. His loss is a great tragedy and a reminder of the risks that our front-line police officers face on a daily basis in their job of protecting all of us. Damian Leeding was laid to rest by his family at a private location last Tuesday following a full police funeral at the Gold Coast Convention Centre which I attended along with a number of representatives of all levels of government and all sides of politics.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000488"></A>
The death of this young officer genuinely touched the hearts of all Queenslanders. Thousands of Queenslanders in regions right across the state bought and wore the police ribbon in support of Damian’s family and Damian’s friends. More than 5,000 people paid their respects at the very moving public service, including over 4,000 police officers representing every Australian state, New Zealand, Canada and the United States of America. The public response was not only very heart-warming for Damian’s family but also heart-warming evidence to the entire police family that they and their work are much valued by Queenslanders. Following the service, police officers formed a guard of honour along the Gold Coast Highway for Senior Constable Leeding’s final journey. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000705"></A>
During a very emotional funeral service, police colleagues undertook to look after his family and a fund has been established to support them. The fund has so far raised more than $300,000, which I think speaks volumes about the generosity of Queenslanders. The Queensland Police Service announced that it will posthumously bestow its highest award--the Valour Medal--on Damian Leeding for his gallantry. On behalf of all Queenslanders and all members of this House, I extend our heartfelt condolences to Damian Leeding’s wife, his children, his extended family and his friends and colleagues in the Queensland Police Service.<Hansard-Speech-End>

I also place on the record my condolences to his wife, Sonya, his children, Grace and Hudson, and his extended family, friends and colleagues. Nothing can prepare a family for the death of a loved one at work. Nothing can prepare one’s colleagues or indeed the broader community for such tragedies. Any death is a tragedy, but the death of a police officer while he is responding to a crime and attempting to help those in danger and in need is particularly devastating. It is also a terrible reminder to us all that our police officers put their own lives at risk every day to protect all Queenslanders. While we pray that such deaths will not occur, our police officers face those risks with professionalism and courage and I know that all Queenslanders are saddened that we have lost one of our finest and bravest front-line police officers in this way.</A></Hansard-Body>

Whilst a recruit at the Police Academy in 2002, Damian Leeding wrote that he wanted to become a police officer because he believed that he could make a difference within the community, and he did. He worked within the Gold Coast police district and at Coomera initially as a general duties officer. However, his skill, professionalism and enthusiasm soon saw him attain the rank of plain-clothes senior constable. His commitment was recognised during his funeral service, with the Police Commissioner posthumously awarding Damian the Medal of Valour--the Queensland Police Service’s highest award--and also announcing his appointment as detective.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000362"></A>
Detective Senior Constable Leeding was an enthusiastic and highly regarded police officer. He had a passion for putting the bad guys before the courts. He was much loved by his family and his work colleagues. The QPS and Queensland have lost an outstanding officer, colleague and friend to many. I know that Damian’s death is being felt hard by those officers who worked with him, as well as the entire police family across Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000713"></A>
The outpouring of emotion from the public in the wake of Damian’s tragic death reinforces the community’s strong support for its police service. Thousands attended his funeral service on the Gold Coast, and I know that this was greatly appreciated by his family and the Police Service generally. Detective Senior Constable Damian Leeding’s life was tragically cut short in the pursuit of safety and security in our community. We will never forget his sacrifice. His name will live on in honour within the Queensland Police Service. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 Senior Constable Damian Leeding lost his life acting on our behalf. Like all Queensland police officers, he responded to a crime that was being committed. He responded on behalf of all of us, and when he was attacked all of us were attacked. When he lost his life, all of us felt the loss.

(9.47 am): Each year during the first week of June Queenslanders throughout our state celebrate all that is great about living, working and raising a family in Queensland. Queensland Week is seven days of celebrations focused on what makes us and our state so special. It is about our individuality. It is a celebration of what makes Queensland tick. It is a celebration of the unique Queensland spirit.</Hansard-Body>

Never before has Queensland Week been so important as this year, coming just five months after we faced some of the worst and most challenging and heartbreaking episodes in our history. Over the past week our government has ensured that this year’s event will reserve a special place in history. Queensland Week this year was a celebration of the spirit that has come to characterise the heart of communities the length and breadth of the state as they faced almost unthinkable adversity. As floodwaters engulfed homes, businesses and entire towns, as raging torrents tragically stole family members, friends and neighbours, as communities were brought to their knees by floods and as cyclonic winds the like of which have not been seen in a generation ploughed into our coast, we saw the very best of each other. Strangers came out to help. Neighbours ensured that each others’ homes were cleaned up and repaired. In many cases people took leave from their jobs to get in and do their bit. All around Queensland ordinary people did extraordinary things. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003092"></A>
Our police and emergency service crews and our priceless SES volunteers went above and beyond the call of duty, often for weeks at a time. We pulled together as a people and as a state to ensure that, while Queensland took a massive blow, we were able to get back on our feet. Our recovery will be a long journey, but we have already come a very long way. We have returned as near to normal as possible in a remarkably short time. It is largely due to those ordinary, everyday Queenslanders who put in such an extraordinary effort--those people who set an example for the rest of the country, not for reward but out of a sense of pride, community spirit and camaraderie. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003093"></A>
Our government felt it was important that those Queenslanders were honoured and remembered during Queensland Week. That is why earlier this year we called for nominations for Queensland disaster heroes medals. An astonishing 3,500 people were nominated and received this special commemorative medal. These are the people who were nominated not by politicians or government officials but by their fellow Queenslanders as a mark of their gratitude. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003094"></A>
Over the past week 10 ceremonies have been held to award these medals and honour our local heroes in Gatton, Tully, Townsville, Rockhampton, Bundaberg, Dalby, Emerald, Toowoomba, Ipswich and Brisbane. These events were truly moving because we had a chance to hear some of the heroic tales and local stories. These events were also an opportunity for people who came together during the floods and cyclones to be reunited--people like Doug Hislop and Peter Fenton, the drivers of <Hansard-Italic>
Mavis</Hansard-Italic>
 the mighty tugboat which manoeuvred the broken away RiverWalk down the Brisbane River and out of harm’s way; people like Danielle Crismani, who set up Baked Relief to feed the hundreds of affected Queenslanders and the thousands of volunteers helping them; people like Dylan McRae, a 12-year-old who got his pregnant mother and two little sisters to safety as floods engulfed his family farm near Rosewood while his dad was away; people like Gwen Braga, the president of the state Meals on Wheels organisation known to many in this House--Gwen rolled up her sleeves and got on with the job despite losing everything in her own home; people like Mark Kempton, who winched 43 people, with his team, into his chopper and to safety from the Lockyer in appallingly dangerous conditions; people like the thousands who came out with buckets, shovels and brooms to join the Mud Army. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003102"></A>
These are the inspirational stories of ordinary Queenslanders thrust into shocking circumstances. These are the stories of how they refused to be beaten, dusted themselves off and got on with the job. Their names will now be recorded in our history books thanks to their nominations as disaster heroes by their fellow Queenslanders. I place on record today our gratitude to our local disaster heroes and also to those who noticed and recognised them for what they were and took the trouble to nominate them for special recognition. </Hansard-Body>

As we recognise the heroes of our own disasters, we are mindful that our friends in Christchurch are once again in the grip of a frightening experience, with news overnight of severe aftershocks injuring more people and causing more damage to properties in the region.

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110614_095307" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for Reconstruction) (9.52 am): Education creates opportunities for our children and opportunities for our state. A solid education lays a solid foundation for future generations and for future wealth and prosperity. Our government has always been driven by a passion for education and improving the opportunities for young Queenslanders. That is why last week I was pleased to announce the next exciting chapter in Queensland’s education reform journey that commenced almost a decade ago. That journey has seen the introduction of a full year of prep for every Queensland child, providing Queensland students with an additional year of schooling, and in 2008 an increase in the school starting age that brought us into line with other states. The education journey has also seen the introduction of the learning or earning reforms, supporting the future of our 16- to 18-year-olds by keeping them in school and keeping them gainfully employed. We are also rolling out our investment in the early years, providing a kindergarten program for every Queensland child by 2014. </A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1003111"></A>
It is an exciting time in Queensland’s education system, and our commitment to our children continues with our next big reform. From 2015 when the first full year of prep students reach year 7, they will become the first group of Queensland children to start high school in year 7. By 2015 more than half of these children in year 7 will turn 13 and all of them will be in their eighth year in primary school. They will be ready for the challenges and the new depth of learning that high school can offer. In the majority of states and territories, year 7 students already have access to the specialist facilities and specialist teachers that high school offers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003112"></A>
In addition, Australia is about to embark on the biggest national educational reform since Federation. With the introduction of the new Australian curriculum in maths, science and English in 2012, year 7 children in the majority of Australian jurisdictions will get the essential support they need for these subjects in a high school setting. Our government is committed to ensuring that our year 7 students, when they are of the same age, will have the same learning opportunities and access to specialist teachers and facilities such as dedicated science laboratories as their counterparts in other states.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003113"></A>
Our government is determined that Queensland children will lead from the front, not be left behind, as the nation rolls out these new learning opportunities. We recognise that this is a very big change. We know that it means we need to provide schools, parents and families with the support they need to make the transition carefully and appropriately. That is why over the next four years there will be a big investment in new classrooms, in professional development for our teachers, in the delivery of scholarships for those primary school teachers who want to take the opportunity to upgrade their qualifications to teach in a high school setting, and in our non-state school system to ensure they are ready for the change as well. Our government has always been driven by a belief in the transforming power of education and we are very pleased to take the next step in what we believe is an important and exciting journey.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.56 am): Earlier this month I attended my first meeting of the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs. At the meeting ministers received the first-ever report on implementation of the Australian Consumer Law, a priority element of the Council of Australian Governments’ commitment to a seamless national economy. The new Australian Consumer Law took effect on 1 January this year in all jurisdictions. As the meeting communique noted, the Australian Consumer Law has been delivered on time and in full, which is a major achievement. The Australian Consumer Law is important because it simplifies, strengthens and broadens consumer protection for all Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1003121"></A>
Ministers also agreed that the Commonwealth and Queensland would lead work to provide enhanced consumer protections to the many millions of Australians who purchase gift cards each year. Too many consumers are being ripped off. Too many consumers are falling foul of expiry dates and other terms and conditions which prevent them from realising the full value of their gift cards. It is wrong that some businesses benefit from the massive amounts of money paid by consumers for gift cards when those consumers have received absolutely nothing in return. We are going to fix this problem, not just for Queenslanders but also for all Australians. At the meeting it was also agreed that a national strategy was needed to detect, pursue and disrupt the actions of those conmen who continue to engage in unlawful door-to-door selling. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003122"></A>
I also attended the COAG Select Council on Gambling Reform meeting in Canberra on 27 May. The federal government’s proposed reforms include the requirement for all gaming venues to implement a nationally consistent precommitment system with mandatory player enrolment. Ministers agreed that precommitment is a useful tool to help gamblers define their expenditure and stick to limits but did not agree on whether precommitment should be mandatory or voluntary to the player. Queensland supports a voluntary system. However, ministers did agree that all new gaming machines will be required to have precommitment functionality from a date to be agreed and asked senior officials to undertake further work on precommitment functionality and implementation time frames. The Queensland government wholeheartedly supports the select council’s agreement that small venues require special consideration with regard to the implementation of any precommitment system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003123"></A>
Another example of the progressive work done at select council is a discussion of the promotion of live-betting odds during sporting events. This is a potentially harmful practice as it has the potential to normalise young people to gambling. The select council agreed to take action to reduce and control this promotion. The Queensland government looks forward to continuing to work alongside state and territory governments and the Australian government in relation to these and other reforms. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(9.58 am): Investment is returning to Queensland and in a significant way. It is being led by our resources sector and investment in gas, and it is set to power the rest of the economy. Queensland is fortunate to have these natural resources, but we also need to work to develop our industries of the future. Labor in government has been committed to advancing this agenda. </Hansard-Body>

In the past few weeks I have seen firsthand this dynamic change taking hold in our economy. I recently opened Queensland’s first stem cell processing and storage business in Queensland in Meadowbrook, in the electorate of Waterford, where I was accompanied by the member for Waterford. StemTech is the name of that facility. The StemTech facility, which was assisted into our state by Trade and Investment Queensland, provides the opportunity to store cord blood cells from newborn babies to provide the sort of insurance that money could not previously buy. In the past, cord blood cells were considered a waste product and today they can provide the gift of life into the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005008"></A>
I have also opened a world-class oncology compounding centre at Geebung, in the electorate of the Minister for Police and Corrective Services, that will supply vital chemotherapy drugs and other specialised intravenous products to Queensland hospitals and clinics. The centre, run by Fresenius Kabi Australia, already employs 20 people and is a $5 million investment in a high-technology facility in our state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005012"></A>
The government has worked closely with both companies to facilitate their move and their investment in Queensland. There was strong competition from other states, but we were determined to help them ensure they could invest here, given the potential lucrative long-term returns to the Queensland economy and the growth in cutting-edge science that they represent to our state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005013"></A>
Recently I also attended a special function at the Wesley Hospital, in my own electorate, at which Mincom, one of this state’s great business triumphs and a world leader in mining technology, is donating $1.5 million to the Wesley Research Institute’s tissue bank. This is an enormously generous contribution to important medical research, and Mincom needs to be recognised for this great act of corporate citizenry. The tissue bank provides medical researchers with an invaluable resource for investigating the origins and development of cancers and other diseases. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005016"></A>
I have also attended a function at which one of our leading universities recognised its best and brightest researchers. The University of Queensland is one of the state’s great treasures. It is a world-class institution with world-class minds doing world-class research. That fact is well reflected in the recent QS World University Rankings for technical subjects, in which UQ listed in the top 40 in the world. UQ also did exceptionally well in the recent Australian Research Council’s Excellence in Research for Australia--ERA--report 2010. UQ’s smart-state disciplines of neuroscience, biotechnology, nanotechnology and most areas of biological science were rated by ERA as above world standard, which is ERA’s maximum rating.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005019"></A>
These strengths, 21st century institutions, excellent researchers and best-of-the-best technology, coupled with a strong entrepreneurial spirit and a well-oiled IP process providing certainty to investors, will continue to attract investment and jobs--the jobs of the future and the economic future of our state in the 21st century. As a government, we remain committed to delivering the jobs of the future, just as we said we would. </Hansard-Body>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110614_100226" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Greenslopes--ALP) (Minister for Education and Industrial Relations) (10.02 am): Last week I had the pleasure of joining the Premier to announce the next stage of Labor’s reforms for education in this state. The Labor Party has always been the party of reform, and there is no clearer example of our reform vision than in the education system. We want Queensland students to receive the best possible education so that they have every opportunity to succeed in life. The Premier has already outlined in some detail the government’s plan for year 7 to join high school in 2015. The benefits of this move will be substantial for our children, who represent the future of this great state. The government has developed a comprehensive package of programs to support the transition of year 7 into high school.</A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1005031"></A>
I assure parents that year 7 students attending state schools from 2015 will be well supported through pastoral care programs as they make the move to high school. To help achieve this, amongst other things we will introduce junior secondary into Queensland state high schools--a school within a school. Junior secondary will have its own distinct identity and cater for the specific academic and developmental needs of students in years 8 and 9 from 2013, with year 7 joining in 2015. Year 7 students will be eased into high school life with fewer subjects and teachers than higher grades, but at the same time they will be able to take advantage of the educational opportunities that high schools can offer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005032"></A>
We want students in rural and remote areas to have the same opportunities as their city counterparts, but we recognise that their families face additional challenges due to distance. To help support them, we will increase the living-away-from-home allowance for year 7 students to the secondary school rate, conduct a comprehensive review of the educational needs of geographically isolated students and the services offered to them and, with the Catholic and independent school sectors, establish a cross-sectoral task force to examine the financial implications of the change on boarding schools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005034"></A>
Also, I assure state school teachers that no permanent staff will lose their job or be forced to relocate as a result of this important initiative. Those wishing to make the move to junior secondary will have access to professional development programs. The government will also fund up to 500 scholarships for those primary school teachers looking for the challenge of teaching in a secondary school setting. Principal pay scales are also guaranteed for three years from 2015. This government acknowledges the importance of teachers and principals in educating our children. In implementing this important change, we pledge to continue to work closely with the Queensland Teachers Union and principals to make this transition as smooth as possible. Between now and 2015 there is much to be done to get high schools ready for year 7 students to join them, and we are committed to getting on with the job. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005035"></A>
This initiative is backed by significant financial resources to ensure the transition is successful--just as we did when we implemented prep in recent years. Over the next four years the government will allocate $328.2 million in extra capital funding for state schools. This will pay for more than 1,400 new and refurbished classrooms and learning areas in state high schools. Also, the government will provide an extra $293.8 million in recurrent funding over forward estimates to implement the suite of initiatives outlined in the Flying Start white paper. This includes $81.3 million for capital assistance to the non-state-school sector. In total, the government has allocated $622 million over the forward estimates. We believe this is a generous and sufficient allocation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005036"></A>
The government acknowledges that further funding will be required beyond the forward estimates period to fully implement the Flying Start initiatives. This is expected to total a further $268 million up to 2017-18. From 2018-19 onwards, about $70 million a year in additional funding for year 7 in high school will be required. This investment reflects our view that the best investment a government can make is in the education of its young people. Through this latest initiative, the Bligh government is ensuring Queensland students can get a flying start to learning and to life. <Hansard-Speech-End>

I am pleased to announce that our $440,000 Tourism Queensland campaign is now underway, promoting the Fraser Coast’s enviable position as our whale-watching capital.

All the way from the Gold Coast to Cairns, and right through the winter months to November, Queensland is home to these spectacular, curious and inspiring ocean mammals. And what better place to see them up close and personal than the Fraser Coast, where whales frolic and play in the calm, warm and safe waters of Hervey Bay? Last year’s season drew to the region around 60,000 visitors from across Queensland, interstate and overseas, injecting some $80 million into the local economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005048"></A>
As well as promotional activities, this year’s campaign will include Twitter and Flickr feeds, so our whale-watching tour operators will be tweeting whale sightings and whale facts as well as posting the latest whale photos. I am pleased to say that on Thursday, 7 July in the Queen Street Mall there will be a special celebration to showcase this very special season. It will feature prizes and giveaways, performances, workshops for children and even rolling footage on the big screen showing the action taking place in Hervey Bay. I invite all honourable members to join me on this very exciting occasion.</Hansard-Body>

Not only does the whale-watching season benefit local tourism operators on the Fraser Coast; the benefits flow to the entire region and throughout our prized coastal areas.

This scientific report warns that climate change impacts on our biodiversity could include deaths of millions of birds in South-West Queensland, as well as losses of other species in locations across Queensland, especially the Wet Tropics, the gulf, the mulga lands and the Central Queensland coast, all of which are particularly vulnerable to changes in rainfall and temperature.</Hansard-Body>

Queensland is home to a range of rare plants and species, half of which are found nowhere else in the world.

The draft strategy, which will be finalised this year, will deliver a framework to ensure we protect vulnerable species, continue to increase protected areas and ensure the survival of critical ecosystems.

 on Friday night, early reports show that, in the first three days alone, more than 5,000 people have visited the exhibition.

Speaking at the opening of the exhibition on Friday night, the Pompidou Centre’s president, Alain Seban, who had travelled all the way from Paris to be at the opening, said that this was the best and most innovative touring exhibition that the Pompidou Centre had ever done and that, while the Pompidou does not travel its work widely, it chose Brisbane because of our world-class Gallery of Modern Art and because our city is quickly becoming acknowledged as the arts hub of all of South-East Asia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006740"></A>
This extraordinary exhibition is open until 2 October and brings to Australia works from the Musée National d’Art Moderne at Paris’s iconic Centre Pompidou, which holds Europe’s finest surrealist collection. We are lucky to see in Queensland works of this calibre because, as I said, the Centre Pompidou’s surrealist collection rarely leaves France. There are more than 180 works in the exhibition by 55 artists, dating from 1913 to the late 1970s. So in that sense, it is a far more comprehensive historical record of surrealism than is your standard exhibition. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1006744"></A>
Since GoMA opened almost five years ago, the gallery has generated a $45 million boost to tourism and the state economy, with half of visitors to international ticketed exhibitions living outside Brisbane.

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006745"></A>
Visitors to GoMA know it for its large open spaces. However, the gallery has been completely transformed into a labyrinth journey through the minds of the surrealists.

 will mark 30 years of the Queensland Art Gallery. It is because of exhibitions such as these that our Gallery of Modern Art and the Queensland Art Gallery are now Australia’s most popular museums. When we built GoMA five years ago just 300,000 people a year were visiting the old Queensland Art Gallery. Now 1.8 million people visit the two campuses each year, making this the biggest art gallery in Australia. <Hansard-Speech-End>

, recently highlighted changes that had taken place over time in Queensland’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The contrast between Aurukun under the Bjelke-Petersen regime and Aurukun today under a Labor government could not be more stark. Our groundbreaking policies have helped shape communities where school attendance is up and levels of violence are down. On the <Hansard-Italic>

The Cape York Welfare Reform trial has played no small part in bringing about change for the people in Aurukun, as well as Mossman Gorge, Hope Vale and Coen. The trial began in 2008 in partnership with the federal government, the Cape York institute and the men, women and children of those four communities. While the results are promising, we know that there is more work to be done. To this end, I am holding talks with mayors and community leaders on the future of the trial. I also want to hear from justice groups, service providers and residents in the trial communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006765"></A>
Many people have had a role to play in the early success of the trial. One organisation’s achievements in particular ring loud and clear, and that is the Family Responsibilities Commission. As I said, it is a shining example of what can be achieved when communities embrace reform with courage and conviction. It links welfare payments to social benchmarks, including school attendance--and its results in getting children to school have been a success as well as a re-establishment of local authority. Between semester 1 of 2008 and semester 1 of last year, school attendance rates in Aurukun increased from 43.7 per cent to 62.1 per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006767"></A>
The Cape York Welfare Reform trial is about closing the gap on the health, education and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with practical policies and sensible solutions right in the heart of local communities. I am hopeful that these reforms will deliver lasting, long-term benefits, and I am keen to listen and learn from local communities as to where to from here. <Hansard-Speech-End>

In a huge engineering feat, piling work is now complete at Fig Tree Gully. The work saw drilling of 40 deep holes, some up to 25 metres in depth, along the edge of the road and then filling those holes with concrete to stabilise the area. The gap certainly did not escape the wrath of the natural disasters which struck our state earlier this year. They left behind a path of destruction including significant damage along a seven-kilometre stretch of the Cunningham Highway. </A></Hansard-Body>

This government is getting on with the job of rebuilding Queensland. Indeed, this morning the government announced nearly $1 billion in repair and reconstruction works for Central Queensland roads under our NDRRA program. This is in addition to $300 million we announced at Mackay. This is an extraordinary level of funding and it will bring massive job benefits to these regions. In Central Queensland alone, 3,000 jobs will be created. I thank the members for Rockhampton and Keppel, who have been very vocal in calling for these works to be undertaken. I am sure they will welcome this nearly $1 billion in funding. There could be no more graphic illustration that Operation Queenslander is moving into high gear than these huge road repair projects. We are reconnecting communities and getting industries moving again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006779"></A>
Back to the gap, we are building a better, stronger and more resilient highway. Main Roads is carrying out an unprecedented engineering procedure. When we are finished, the road will be safer than it has ever been. The next step is to ‘cap’ the concrete piles and reinforce them with 1,100 cubic metres of concrete and 250 tonnes of steel to form a new retaining structure which will be anchored to the rock face beneath the road. With 80 workers on site, we are supporting local businesses--from the motels where the workers are staying to nearby service stations, trade suppliers and, of course, the local pie shop. I thank my staff from Main Roads, who have done a great job there. In fact, we monitor that site 24 hours a day to look for slippages. It is part of an important reconstruction effort across the state. <Hansard-Speech-End>

In keeping this support on track, a new chair has been appointed to the QRAA board. Former National Australia Bank agribusiness general manager for Australia, Wayne Carlson, took up the appointment on 3 June. As chair, Mr Carlson will report to me on the performance of QRAA’s functions. Mr Carlson’s 35 years of experience in the rural finance sector will help QRAA adapt to changing trends and embrace opportunities for growth. His background with agribusiness will inform his views and decisions in this position, and I believe he will be a valuable addition to the QRAA team. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1008529"></A>
In addition, three new directors have been appointed to the board. I would also like to welcome John Pollock, Georgie Somerset and Sarah Israel as new board directors.

(10.21 am): Last Monday this government unveiled the largest public transport timetable overhaul in more than 15 years. We added more than 200,000 weekly seats for customers on some of our busiest trains and buses across the network, meeting our commitment to add more than 305,000 additional weekly seats in the current financial year.</Hansard-Body>

The 6 June package added 150,000 more weekly train seats, more reliability and more frequency to the Caboolture, Ipswich, Rosewood, Richlands and north coast rail lines. Trains now run through Roma Street and Central stations every three minutes during the busiest times. There are also more off-peak, weekend and public holiday services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008546"></A>
Trains operate at least every 15 minutes between Darra and the city and four trains an hour between Northgate and the city. TransLink has also added 50,000 seats per week to services and adjusted times to ensure connections on more than 80 bus routes across South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008547"></A>
There have been high-frequency upgrades on route 120 to Upper Mount Gravatt and on route 196 between New Farm and Fairfield.

 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Energy and Water Utilities) (10.23 am): There are some very interesting figures that I feel important to share to show the House today how innovative and effective our water infrastructure is when faced with unprecedented circumstances. We all know that a natural disaster can leave lasting damage. However, it is yet to be shared the true level of damage that has occurred to our catchments and therefore the quality of our raw water in our key water storages. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1008556"></A>
Mr Speaker, 60,000 tonnes per day of sediment was released from Wivenhoe Dam during the peak of the flood, and 315,000 tonnes is the estimated amount of sediment that flowed out of Wivenhoe Dam following the flood event in January. It is estimated that one million tonnes of sediment flowed from the Brisbane and Lockyer catchments over the Mount Crosby Weir--60 kilometres downstream of Wivenhoe--over the same period.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008558"></A>
What this demonstrates is that the extreme nature of the floods resulted in an unprecedented volume of sediment not only flowing through Wivenhoe Dam but flowing into the Brisbane River from both the Lockyer and Bremer rivers. Such was the force of the flows into Wivenhoe Dam that for the first time water quality across the entire lake was adversely impacted. The reality is that the current elevated levels of turbidity within Wivenhoe are likely to remain for at least another year and perhaps longer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008559"></A>
Poor raw water quality presents real tests for water treatment plants like the two at Mount Crosby which process the main supply for Brisbane. Regardless of how long it takes for our catchments to recover, water from our taps will remain safe, clean and of the highest quality. Why? Because of the South-East Queensland water grid, which offers a secure water supply of the highest quality. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008560"></A>
The water grid allows us to transfer water to where it is needed most. Dual flow pipelines allow us to move treated drinking water from Noosa to Coolangatta and out to the Lockyer Valley. It allows us to choose our water from both new and existing sources across the region, and it allows us to blend our water sources. We are also able to draw on the Gold Coast desalination plant as a climate resilient source, as we did in the immediate aftermath of the January floods, to supplement our water supply whenever it is required. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008561"></A>
The Bligh government not only drought proofed South-East Queensland with the water grid but is still proving its worth. This government has made sure that even during some of the worst natural disasters this state has faced our water quality was not compromised. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Employment, Skills and Mining) (10.25 am): The Productivity Commission’s recent report into climate change has identified gas fired power as being the most cost-effective method of lowering greenhouse gas emissions.

The reality is that the established coal seam gas industry and the emerging liquefied natural gas industry are good for Queensland’s economy and good for our environment, as the Productivity Commission’s report shows. This government supports the balanced development of the industries and recognises their potential to bring employment opportunities to Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008570"></A>
The three LNG export projects that have state government and federal government approval could bring up to $65 billion in investment in Queensland and some 18,000 jobs. This demand is being driven by increasing international demand, with key export markets identified in Japan and China, who are seeking lower emission transition fuels such as LNG. The truth is that, if big economies like those in Asia turn to Queensland LNG instead of coal for large scale power generation, their greenhouse gas emissions will be significantly reduced. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008571"></A>
The Bligh government is also aware of the need to balance the development of the industry with agriculture, the environment and impacts on communities and landholders. That is why we have introduced strict legislation to achieve a more favourable outcome for all players. Our laws ensure landholders are fully aware and fairly compensated for activities undertaken by resource companies on their land. They require companies to enter into legally binding conduct and compensation agreements with affected landholders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008572"></A>
Petroleum and gas companies are also now subject to compulsory new reporting requirements for all exploration and production activities that they plan to carry out. The safety of the industry was recently highlighted in an industry-wide audit of Queensland’s CSG wells which showed that 98 per cent of wells had no leaks. I am confident that this balanced approach to the development of the industry will lead to a prosperous future for Queensland and a ready source of cleaner energy for the world. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Health) (10.28 am): The Bligh government is committed to ensuring all Queenslanders can access quality health care. That is why we are developing innovative new strategies to help outpatients see an outpatient specialist sooner. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1008580"></A>
Last financial year Queensland Health provided more than 2.35 million specialist outpatient clinic appointments to outpatients. I have made it clear that no outpatient needing an urgent consultation should ever be turned away. I have also directed that any category 1 outpatient must be treated at their local clinic, not referred on. The director-general has delivered this message to district CEOs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008581"></A>
At my direction Queensland Health has, for some time, been working on strategies to streamline outpatient clinics so patients can see a specialist sooner. This is being led by the Centre for Healthcare Improvement under the leadership of Acting Director-General Tony O’Connell. These strategies include working more closely with local GPs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008584"></A>
All Queensland Health districts have been informed by the director-general of their responsibility to make contact with GPs in the rare instances when re-referral letters are issued to ensure alternatives are explored. Alternatives might include assessment or treatment by an allied health professional such as a physiotherapist or occupational therapist, for example. It might also include referring outpatients to another nearby clinic with a shorter waiting list than the one closest to them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008620"></A>
A project at the Metro North Health Service District in which referrals were reviewed by an in-house GP substantially improved the time in which outpatients could be seen. The GP was able to reduce the number of follow-up appointments waiting on the list so follow-up outpatients got care sooner and outpatients waiting for new appointments moved higher up the waiting list to be seen sooner. The project evaluation also found that in many cases referral to other clinicians, such as allied health staff, was more appropriate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008623"></A>
Other new strategies recently implemented are already showing results as well. At Logan, for example, a new nurse led screening clinic for endoscopy services has improved access to the service for outpatients, meaning the most urgent outpatients are able to see their specialists sooner, in line with their clinical urgency. After a successful trial at three outpatient sites, orthopaedic physiotherapy screening clinics are now operating at 13 facilities state-wide, including Ipswich, Townsville, the RBWH, the PA, Gold Coast, Mater Adults, Logan, Toowoomba, the Mater Children’s Hospital, Nambour, Redcliffe, Cairns and Mackay. In just the first eight months at Mackay, 302 new cases were reviewed by the musculoskeletal physiotherapist working in the screening clinic within orthopaedic outpatients. That was a 61 per cent increase in the number of new outpatients who were seen in that period.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008624"></A>
I made it clear when I first became health minister that tackling outpatient waiting lists was one of my key priorities. This work already underway is proof that we take this issue extremely seriously. <Hansard-Speech-End>

That is why I am delighted to announce the opening of the Sport and Recreation Infrastructure Program for 2011. We have $20 million worth of sports grants up for grabs. From Bowen to Brisbane, from Cairns to Coolangatta, sport and recreation clubs are pumped about this. As members will be aware, we put this program on hold following the summer of natural disasters. All efforts were redirected into our Sports Flood Fight Back Plan and the recovery of flood and cyclone affected clubs. Our focus has been on rebuilding Queensland, but now we are moving forward and investing in a program that will benefit Queenslanders across the state. </A></Hansard-Body>

This program will help clubs build new or upgraded facilities to encourage Queenslanders to lead more active lives. To top it off, the program will also create much needed jobs across the state. The funding can be used for a range of options, from the construction of facilities and additional playing fields to new lighting, shade structures and playing surfaces. Clubs can also use the grants to repair flood affected facilities. Up to $300,000 is available for minor projects, which means that clubs can apply for up to 75 per cent of projects which are worth $400,000. Also, up to $750,000 is available for medium-sized projects, meaning clubs can apply for 60 per cent of a project worth $1.25 million. The Bligh government will allocate the full $20 million in the one round, so I urge clubs to get their applications in by 25 July so they do not miss out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008633"></A>
This infrastructure program will complement our other funding initiatives, including the Positive or it’s Pointless equipment grants and the Local Sport and Recreation Jobs Plan program, both of which are now open. This is on top of the $15 million which was provided to flood and cyclone affected clubs to help them get back on their feet. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008636"></A>
To ensure clubs know what assistance is available, our sport and recreation funding information sessions will be hitting the road. Over the next few weeks, sessions will be held around the state, kicking off in Roma tomorrow. It is a great opportunity for clubs to find out the finer details of how the program works, how they can apply and what they can apply for. Essentially, it is a one-stop shop for sports funding. By investing in sport and recreation clubs, we are investing in the future of healthy living. We want to boost participation levels in sport and recreation by providing first-class facilities for all Queenslanders.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Smart Service Queensland, the ‘front door’ to the Queensland government, has been recognised as one of the best government service providers in the country. During 2010, research based consulting group Customer Service Benchmarking Australia carried out an assessment of Smart Service Queensland’s customer service standards.

Smart Service Queensland recorded a customer satisfaction score of 170 out of a possible 200 in the face-to-face service category. The performance of Smart Service Queensland’s Government Service Centre saw a customer satisfaction score well above the overall average of 158; in fact, we bettered the average by 12 points. Visitors to the Government Service Centre had an average wait time of 116 seconds to speak with an agent. This was the second-fastest wait time--a full 84 seconds faster than the overall average of 200 seconds. Smart Service Queensland’s website--www.qld.gov.au--recorded an overall score of 86, seven points ahead of the overall average of 79.

Smart Service Queensland managed almost 14 million customer contacts in 2010-11. This is an enormous volume of transactions and it is a testament to the skill, dedication and hard work of all its staff. I thank them all for their efforts to entrench Queensland’s reputation as the Smart State. <Hansard-Speech-End>

To add to his troubles, he fell ill and, not able to pay his rent, he faced eviction. The Bligh government is committed for the long-term flood recovery effort. We have boosted funds to services that are helping people get back on their feet. After making contact with the Acacia Ridge Tenant Advice and Advocacy Service, he was referred to Micah Projects’ Flood Recovery Housing and Support Service and is being assisted into secure affordable housing. </A></Hansard-Body>

This is an example of the Bligh government’s whatever-it-takes approach to housing and supporting people through the flood and cyclone recovery period. Micah Projects is now being given a funding boost to provide practical assistance across Brisbane for 12 months as part of the ongoing follow-up in the flood recovery process. We are in this for the long haul; we are not cutting and running. Recovery workers can assist those in need to access alternative housing; identify resources, services and entitlements; link with financial counselling, mental health services and legal services; and provide support for people dealing with personal or family matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008661"></A>
I express my gratitude to Micah Projects along with other NGOs and community organisations, like the Acacia Ridge Community Centre, the Centenary Recovery Centre and the Yeronga Recovery Centre, and I thank the member for Yeerongpilly here. I joined him on Friday in his electorate to provide support to the Yeronga Recovery Centre. We passed on 35 handmade bears that had been donated from a very kind woman in South Australia, and we provided $50,000. The member for Yeerongpilly had been calling for that support, so I thank him for his advocacy. I also thank West End Community House, the Sherwood Neighbourhood Centre, the New Farm Neighbourhood Centre and many others locally for the great work they have been doing. These groups are committed to improving the lives of Brisbane residents.</Hansard-Body>

With around 25,000 Brisbane homes affected by January’s floods, words cannot express the devastation people felt. The Department of Communities conducted over 30,000 face-to-face assessments through outreach and recovery centres in the first six weeks alone. We have paid out more than $8.8 million in financial assistance grants to more than 16,000 people just in the Brisbane region alone. The work continues and we are committed to whatever it takes to make that happen. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110614_103920" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (10.39 am): Earlier this year tens of thousands of everyday Queenslanders worked alongside SES volunteers to help clean up following the floods and cyclones that impacted our state during our summer of sorrow. The work they undertook provided great satisfaction and a sense of achievement in helping their community when it was needed most. This is exactly what SES volunteers do all year round. That is why the state government has launched a new campaign to encourage those who pitched in following the floods and cyclones to join the SES. A 30-second television advertisement is currently screening focusing on the fantastic community response by thousands of volunteers who helped strangers and neighbours recover from the disasters. The advertisement encourages these community-minded people to consider joining the SES.</A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1010676"></A>
There are currently around 6,800 volunteers state-wide who don the orange overalls to ensure the community receives the assistance it requires in times of need. One of the great things about the SES is that there are a vast range of practical skills that people can learn which transfer over to their everyday lives. In addition to this, those who already possess certain skills like radio operations or abseiling or chainsaw operations can have the chance to hone and utilise these skills in potentially life-saving environments. I recognise that this type of work and volunteering is not for everyone, but I hope that those people who are looking for another opportunity to contribute to community safety in Queensland take the opportunity to join their local SES group. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010678"></A>
While our current volunteers do a fantastic job, an ageing population and change in work patterns mean the need to attract more people to the SES is a priority. Having a strong volunteer base with steady recruitment will ensure the SES remains a world-class service to all Queenslanders, and in that regard I acknowledge the partnership that the state government has in recruitment and supporting the SES with local governments all over Queensland. Anyone interested in finding out more about the SES should call 13QGOV or 137468 or contact their local council or Emergency Management Queensland office and ask about signing up with their local unit.<Hansard-Speech-End>

I refer to the Treasurer’s claim last year that his plan for the sale of Queensland’s assets was ‘to pay down debt’. Given that the Treasurer has now sold the $17 billion worth of assets but still lost the state’s AAA credit rating and is today planning for a $2 billion deficit and projecting debt to increase to a massive $85 billion, how can any Queenslander not conclude that our state economy is managed by Australia’s worst state Treasurer who today will hand down a budget that nobody will believe?</A></Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Let me make this point really clearly, and I will say it slowly: in the budget that I hand down this afternoon, as I said in the public arena yesterday, debt in this state will be $17 billion lower than was forecast--$17 billion lower than was forecast and $17 billion less than what it was going to be but for the fiscal reform program that this government put in place, but for the choices that we made to undertake an overhaul of the state’s balance sheet and position this state for future growth, just as we are. Because this government had the courage to make those decisions, that means that the interest expense that will be shown is $492 million lower--$492 million. What is the dividend of the hard work that this government has done in reforming the state’s balance sheet, in putting forward a budget strategy that was for the long term and not for the short term, that was not about the electoral cycle but about the life cycle of this economy and this state? The fact is that debt is $17 billion lower, and that is the quantum--that is the quantification--of what we have done.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010733"></A>
What is the sum total of what those on the opposite side have offered? The answer is zero. So, yes, there will be this afternoon presented to this House a budget that looks to the future, a budget that is not about the next election but about the decades ahead. What the people of Queensland want to see from this parliament this week is a real, fair dinkum economic debate. The Tony Abbott idolisers on the other side only want to knock and criticise. They are empty vessels who only want to engage in puffery and rhetoric, the sort of political strategy of ‘I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house down’. Well, enough of the puffery. Enough of the hot air. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010734"></A>
The time has come for the people on the other side to stand up and say what are the choices they will make. What are the things that they will do? What are the things that they will not do? Let it out. Spell it out. Put it out with the detail, because at this point in time here is a number that should be of interest to every member of this House and indeed to the people around Queensland, and that is the number of policies that the LNP has released, costed and put into the public arena. What is that number? It is zero! How many ideas does it have for the future of Queensland? Zero! What is the difference in this state budget compared to the previous forecast? $17 billion lower in debt because this government had the courage, the foresight and the fortitude to implement a fiscal reform program like good Labor governments do--the sort of thing we never see from indolent tory governments without ideas, without something to propose and only ever opposing.</Hansard-Body>

Budget, Interest Payments</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010738"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is also to the Treasurer. I refer to the Treasurer’s comments when he described the Brisbane City Council as being broke and its budget as a horror budget even though the council’s interest payments will peak at three per cent of council’s income and the council’s budget is in surplus. I contrast that to the Treasurer’s comments on TV last night when he said that in his budget interest payments would be nine per cent of the state’s income and the budget would have a deficit of $2 billion, and I ask: how can the Treasurer continue to deny that the Brisbane City Council is in a much stronger financial position than the state of Queensland under his financial management as the worst state Treasurer in Australia?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010775"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that channelled question as the voice of the absent leader of the LNP. I can only look forward with delight to what is going to happen on Thursday, because I am sure there will be a nice little <Hansard-Italic>
Pride of Erin</Hansard-Italic>
 with the Leader of the Opposition in this place and the LNP leader as they seek to respond to a budget, and respond they should. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010776"></A>
Let me make this point about the Brisbane City Council, which handed down its budget last week: what happens to its debt forecast? It goes up by 50 per cent. If the Brisbane City Council has so much money and is so well run, why is it that in the Brisbane City Council budget papers there is no fessing up? Nowhere can you find how much the Go Between Bridge is costing the ratepayers of Brisbane each and every year. No, it is not there. What is the detail of the CityCycle scheme? Is that revealed in the budget of the Brisbane City Council? No, it is not contained in there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010779"></A>
So perhaps the budget reply on Thursday, delivered by the Leader of the Opposition in this place on behalf of the muppet at the top, might just tell us about the Campbell Newman tax plan to bail out the RiverCity tunnel, where he lost $774 million of ratepayers’ money. It might tell us about the Campbell Newman tax plan to bail out his cycle scheme that is rapidly going bankrupt. It might tell us about the Campbell Newman tax plan to bail out the Go Between Bridge. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010780"></A>
Each and every time Campbell Newman has gone near building infrastructure or has undertaken any project, what has happened? There has been a massive cost blow-out. The Go Between Bridge is going broke and the CityCycle scheme is going broke, yet these people want to put him in charge of the whole state. People in cities right around Queensland should quiver in fear. They should quiver in anticipation of just what Campbell Newman might do to communities right around the state of Queensland if we ever have the misfortune of him sitting in this place and putting forward ideas, because so far he does not have one idea, one plan or one thing to say other than empty rhetoric, hot air, slogans and chanting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010781"></A>
From today it is ‘game on’ when the state budget gets handed down. Laid out in full--in detail--will be an economic plan for the future. The clock will be ticking for Campbell Newman to finally go beyond the slogans, to go beyond the rhetoric and to put forward a policy, to put forward a plan. That is the debate Queensland deserves to have. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection from the member for Rockhampton. They are wonderful parklands built by a Labor government and home to an honour wall that commemorates Queensland Greats. There have been recipients of the award in Queensland Week every year for 11 years now. There are now 50 Queensland Greats and a number of Queensland institutions that have been recognised. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010791"></A>
This year we saw another five individuals and one organisation receive this honour. I was very pleased to make the awards this year to a number of people: firstly, to people who have been prominent in community activities and who are well known as business leaders--and Dr Betty Byrne Henderson AM is very well known to this House. I was also very pleased to see a very strong regional series of nominations this year, with George Chapman AO from Cairns--I think George is the first non-Indigenous person from Far North Queensland to be awarded--and Graham Jackson OAM from Townsville. All three people are very prominent business leaders and they use their business ability to then go on to make very significant contributions in a number of community organisations. </Hansard-Body>

I think he did a bit more after he played for Valleys. As we get ready for the second State of Origin game, we all know the contribution that Wally Lewis has made to football and sport in Queensland, but he is also a great ambassador for the Hear and Say Centre and for people with hearing loss, and I was very pleased that many of them were there to see him get his award. I was also very pleased to see a Queenslander who has made a very important, prominent name for himself on the national stage as one of the great journalists of our time, that is, Kerry O’Brien. I know that Kerry was very honoured to be recognised by his home state in this way. </Hansard-Body>

When it comes to recognising a Queensland Great institution, I could think of no better year than this year to see our marvellous SES officers awarded as the 2011 Queensland Great organisation. These are 6,800 volunteer members who are there when we need them on the front line. I join with the Minister for Police in congratulating them again and I am very pleased to see them recognised. I am also pleased to see the launch of a new SES recruitment campaign. Thousands of people came out during our disasters to help. We have a job for them if they want to do it again. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Treasurer. How much extra will Queenslanders be paying next year for electricity, for water, for registration and for fuel even if the ambulance levy, worth $109 a year, is removed in today’s budget? Why should Queenslanders believe that they will be any better off under this budget, given the increases in taxes and charges they have endured over the past three years? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010806"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the shadow Treasurer for the question. What we can expect to see this afternoon from this government is a budget that makes choices. It is one that owns up to the fact that the task of government requires people to front up with the policy choices, to say what it is they are going to do, what it is they are not going to do and how they are going to do it. It is a budget that is going to be honest with the people of Queensland. It is a budget that is going to tell it like it is. It is a budget that is going to respect the people of Queensland and their ability to see that governments have to make choices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010807"></A>
It will go beyond the political tactic of the LNP in this parliament, which is to stand up and pretend that there are never choices to be made, to stand up and pretend that it can do everything without ever spelling out what it is it is going to do, that there is some magic pot over there that it dips into at every point in time and that it is able to do whatever it wants at every point in time. This budget makes clear choices about what it is that we as a government believe in, the policies that we are going to pursue, the issues that we are going to address and the people we want to assist--those in our community who are doing it the toughest, and they are in particular those who are on fixed incomes, our pensioners, who we know right around Australia have been put under pressure because of the nature of the economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Therefore, we are going to see from this government choices made that lay out in detail a plan. I bet that plan will stand in stark contrast to what we are going to see on Thursday. That will just be a Tony Abbott channelling exercise--walking in here offering only criticism, offering only negativity, offering only opposition and not one single proposition. It remains to be seen what we will get from the LNP on the other side of the House--those indolent members of the opposition who have not laid a finger near a policy piece of work for the more than two years that we have been in this parliament. </Hansard-Body>

What should the people of Queensland look for on Thursday? They should look for a proposal. They should look for a scintilla of an idea. Can they scratch it out on a piece of paper? Can they get out the old chalkboard and write out what it might be? My prediction is that after the budget reply speech in here on Thursday is over, all we will be left with is extra greenhouse gases and the hot air and wind of people who are bereft of ideas, bereft of policy proposals, without a clue, without an ability to put forward a policy proposal. Then the people of Queensland on Thursday night can look at what this government proposes--what this government says it is going to do, the choices it is going to make, the way it is going to do it, the detail of it, the hard numbers, owning up to the reality, charting a course for the future--and then look at what they will get from the other side, which is nought, zero, zip--zero policies, zero ideas and zero credibility. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question and I know of his interest in this area. I am pleased to be able to advise the House of some of the great work that is happening right across Queensland by businesses that are accepting the science on climate change and want to be part of the solution. We have people who are doing terrific work. That is why I was very pleased on Friday night to join with the environment minister, Kate Jones, and 500 businesses, schools and community organisations to recognise people who have chalked up some very significant sustainability achievements. Everyone there was what I would call a practical environmentalist: someone who in their own business is changing their work practices to reduce their impact on the planet, someone who is helping others do it or, in some cases, people who are inventing products that will actually help the world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013013"></A>
There were some world-beating innovations there. For example, the Toowoomba based company known to many people here, Wagners, was named overall winner for its new eco-friendly concrete. Concrete is not the first thing one thinks of when thinking about a greener future, but the cement industry is responsible for five per cent of the world’s emissions. What Wagners has done is defy convention by using two waste bioproducts, blast furnace slag and fly ash, to develop an innovative alternative to traditional carbon intensive Portland cement. It is called Earth Friendly Concrete. It is the same, if not better, with engineering and construction properties as good as traditional concrete, but it saves 9.2 tonnes of CO<Hansard-Subscript>
2</Hansard-Subscript>
 emissions per 300 square metre slab and produces 80 to 90 per cent lower CO<Hansard-Subscript>
2</Hansard-Subscript>
 emissions than its traditional alternative. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013016"></A>
If all house slabs built every year in Queensland were made from this Wagners product it could save up to 270,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. That is a remarkable achievement and it is happening right here in regional Queensland. It is a great Toowoomba family company that cares not only about its employees and its business bottom line but is proving through efforts like this that it cares about the planet, and I take my hat off to it. </Hansard-Body>

At the awards there were 154 nominees, 36 finalists and 11 category winners.

I am very pleased to take the opportunity today to congratulate the Minister for Environment. These awards were started last year. They are a way of recognising those businesses in Queensland that are not only doing something terrific in their own business but also potentially offering something to the world. The product that I have outlined from Wagners could well be one of our next big exports and I look forward to working with that company to bring it to reality.</Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Treasurer.

He finds it a little bit hard to go through the budget papers so he put the call out. I trust that some helpful soul has appeared and wandered up to provide a little bit of assistance to the member for Gympie to go through the budget papers and explain them to him.

What it will do is set out in detail what it is this government stands for, the choices we make and our vision for the future. Let us be clear about it.

 There is a proposal. It is a proposal to front up to the reality of climate change. Even those climate change deniers on the other side, even just the driest of economic rushes on the other side, should see the rationality in pricing a scarce resource. Those on the opposite side cannot have it both ways. They cannot have Campbell Newman out there on the weekend talking about the ClimateSmart Home Service as gizmos when he co-funded it as Lord Mayor. What rank hypocrisy is that? He wants to say in Ashgrove, ‘Dear people of Ashgrove, I support climate change. I believe in the science.’ Then he wants to run around in regional Queensland saying, ‘I don’t believe in climate change. I don’t believe in the science. All of this is a Labor conspiracy.’ The time will come--and the time comes from 2.30 this afternoon--when it is game on for a real fair dinkum policy debate. If Campbell Newman was fair dinkum he would stand up and say once and for all whether he believes in climate change and if he does not I am sure there are about 30,000 people in Ashgrove who would love to hear why not.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Last week on 7 June I had the honour to represent the Premier at Grantham, together with local mayor Steve Jones and Graham Newton from the Queensland Reconstruction Authority, and to turn the first sod on a very exciting new housing development. Those who are familiar with Grantham would know that the hamlet of Grantham sits down in the valley--as hamlets often do--and is surrounded by farmland. Shortly after the flood event I was in Grantham with the mayor and he spoke to me about his vision of relocating the town from the low ground up to the high ground. I do not claim to be an expert on matters of agricultural soil or primary production, but it is quite clear that in most instances in agricultural terms the good quality soil tends to be alluvial and down in the river flats and the poorer quality soil tends to be on the ridges. Additionally, there is also the advantage that on the ridges, which are elevated from flood land, there are also nicer views. Therefore, all other things being equal, in farming country in the Lockyer Valley, which of course is very high quality farming country, the ability to develop the land on the hills is a win-win. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013036"></A>
Through the Queensland Reconstruction Authority, in cooperation with the council--as it is a council project--we are identifying a very significant amount of land for the voluntary relocation of people from Grantham from the parts affected by flood and also very significantly growing it further to provide further sustainable mass for the people in Grantham. These new blocks will be kerbed and channelled, they will have parkland, many of them will be sewered although some of them will be septic depending on the size of the particular block. In an Australian first, it is actually building back the community better. It was a very good idea from the Lockyer Valley Regional Council and the mayor. That this can be done about four months post the flood event really does show the ability of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority to get on with the job of getting through those approvals. Additionally, the temporary local planning instrument endorsed also allows that to be facilitated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013037"></A>
Speaking of local governments and temporary local planning instruments, through my department I have also worked with both the Ipswich City Council and the Brisbane City Council on temporary local planning instruments to deal with flooding issues pending the resolution and further inquiry of those issues through the flood commissions of inquiry. In relation to Brisbane and Ipswich, they look at interim standards that are appropriate in those communities pending these matters being resolved. That is important because the business of getting on with building and redoing things must not wait until the conclusion of the royal commission. This is about working to get very good outcomes for people in these communities and working cooperatively to get them as soon as possible. I thank the councils for their cooperation. </Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to claims made by the Treasurer on 26 July 2010 that Queensland was heading in the right direction, noting one report that ‘the next few years should see Queensland start to muscle its way back towards the top of the state growth league ladder’. Given that since then CommSec, the Centre for Independent Studies and the IPA say the Queensland economy has slipped from second last to last in the economic league table, how can Queenslanders believe anything the Treasurer promises for the future?</Hansard-Body>

 Order! Stop the clock. Treasurer, resume your seat. Member for Clayfield, you have had a pretty good go this morning. I warn you now under 253A(1). Those on my left, you have asked the Treasurer a question and the Treasurer is answering the question. It may not be the answer you want, but I am taking it that it is in the spirit in which it was asked. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013076"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I do hope the shadow Treasurer can be here for the speech this afternoon. Those on the other side want me to model a tax that does not exist, but they do not want to take account of natural disasters that actually happened. That is the central proposition of the last couple of questions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013077"></A>
Over the past 12 months, those on the opposite side have taken every opportunity to talk down the Queensland economy. They want to come in here and use right-wing think tanks like the Centre for Independent Studies, which is probably a misnomer, and the Institute of Public Affairs, which is that very balanced institution that promotes the most right-wing extreme agenda and is out there cheering from the sidelines as Barry O’Farrell trashes workers’ rights in New South Wales and as they traduce the rights of trade union movements in the state of New South Wales. If they want to hold up the Centre for Independent Studies and the Institute of Public Affairs as their hallmark, so be it. Other than that, they want to use a stockbroking firm, yet it is well on the public record the exceptions that have been taken, not just by me but by other treasurers around the state, to the methodology of CommSec. Of course, that has forced them to make a change to their methodology as they acknowledged that the way they were assessing economies was in fact open to question and should change. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013082"></A>
Last year it was predicted that there would be business investment growth of nine per cent in the Queensland economy. Those naysayers on the other side said that people could not believe that there would be business investment this year. Each and every day since then they have done their level best to talk it down. It turns out that last year there was not nine per cent business investment growth in this state; there was 13 per cent business investment growth in this state. More than anything else, that tells us what we need to know; that is, through the past 12 months, despite the natural disasters, despite the shadow Treasurer and various leaders of the opposition and the rest of the naysayers talking down business, talking down Queensland and talking down the Queensland economy, business has spoken with the only language that counts, by investing money in the state of Queensland, investing in private sector investment and driving prosperity. That is exactly what is occurring, despite the very best efforts of those opposite to talk it down. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1013088"></A>
Since the parliament last sat, the ABS has released the national accounts. As I intimated earlier, they tell a story in facts presented by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Those facts might be denied by those on the other side, who only want to read hegemony from institutions like the Institute of Public Affairs. However, what do the facts show? What does the ABS say about what occurred in the Queensland economy versus the national economy in the March quarter, which was the quarter hardest hit by natural disasters? In the March quarter, in Queensland business investment increased by 10.5 per cent for the year, and that was driven by investment in machinery and equipment of more than 12 per cent and in engineering construction of more than 15 per cent. How does that compare to Australia? In the same time frame, business investment was seven per cent. Business investment was going ahead in Queensland through the year to the March quarter, which included the natural disasters, at a rate ahead of the nation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013090"></A>
Those opposite might want to pick up on their favourite tory magazines, their favourite right-wing shock jocks and their favourite right-wing policy document writers. In fact, they could probably pick up a few tips on how to write something down. However, ultimately, when it comes down to the judge and jury, when it comes down to the independent referee, when it comes down to the independent umpire, the statistics from the ABS say that business investment increased through the quarter of the natural disasters at a rate ahead of the rest of the country. This afternoon the budget will show that locked-in business investment. It will show that great wave and surge of investment, which is ready to course through the Queensland economy and which is going to deliver a new era of prosperity to this state. </Hansard-Body>

The only thing we are at risk from is the policy-free zone of the people opposite. They do not have a single idea, a single policy or a single proposal to put forward. Should they ever drag their knuckles across the chamber and sit on this side of the House, Queensland’s economic recovery will be at risk. However, while this government, which has the courage and the foresight to plan for the future, drives the economy into the future, we will continue to see investment grow. The only risk to the Queensland economic recovery is if Campbell Newman, his policy-free zone and his policy-free team end up on this side of the chamber. </Hansard-Body>

The risk to the back pockets of Queenslanders does not come from this government, which is going to set out in full detail a whole agenda for economic recovery. We will set out our policy choices in full detail and we will set out all the numbers. It will be a good read and I recommend it to those opposite, including the member for Gympie. It will be a good read that grasps the opportunities, that looks at what is going to happen next and makes the choices. The only risk to the Queensland economy is Campbell Newman’s sloganeering, rhetoric and reckless promises to do everything but cost nothing, to promise everything but put out no policies to say how he is going to do it. If they end up on this side of the chamber, woe betide the people of Queensland, the Queensland state budget and the Queensland economy. </Hansard-Body>

After all, this person proposed to build a tunnel that he said would cost $850 million. Then he said it could cost $1 billion. Then he said it would cost $2 billion-plus. Then it was going to cost $2 billion-plus-plus. It ended up costing $3 billion. This is the person who they say is going to manage the state’s finances? He is the person who tripled the cost of a tunnel that is now in receivership. What a financial genius that man must be! He is a financial genius who had a plan to build a Northern Link tunnel. So good was his plan that he had to bring his cup to the Queensland Treasury and ask me to loan him the money. He flew around the world, rattling the tin and asking people to pitch in for the Northern Link tunnel, but what did he come back with? An empty cup! What did he do? He put it on the tick of the ratepayer, because his ego would not let him go back. His ego drove him forward. In the end, the ratepayers of Queensland and Brisbane have an enduring legacy because Campbell Newman’s multibillion dollar tunnel dream is turning into a tunnel nightmare and his ego would not allow him to walk backwards and face up to the reality. I say to the people of Queensland: if you want someone who is going to triple infrastructure costs, does not know how to manage a budget and as soon as it gets tough does a cut-and-run, you should put your mark on Campbell Newman. However, if you want someone who will stand up, tell it like it is and look to the future, then vote Labor. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WENDT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services. Can the minister advise the House about the strict monitoring and compliance regime applied by Corrective Services to those persons subjected to the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015655"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question and for the support and interest he shows in Corrective Services operations and probation and parole in his electorate. The Labor government does take very seriously the responsibility we have to ensure that dangerous sex offenders are held accountable for their crimes and, if they are released into the community, are supervised appropriately. We need to remind the House again that it was a Labor government that introduced the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act, which provides the courts with an opportunity to either keep high-risk offenders in jail beyond their sentence or issue appropriate supervision orders in the community. The Queensland government also introduced the child sex offender register, in conjunction with other states, which enables the monitoring of the whereabouts of child sex offenders under the ANCOR register. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015657"></A>
Our laws are as tough as they can get. They are at the limit of constitutionality. They have been challenged in the High Court. They have been criticised severely by the United Nations. But they are tough and they provide the appropriate levels of control and supervision of offenders. Interestingly enough, I have also received a letter of complaint from an LNP member about how tough our laws are, particularly in relation to an ANCOR offender who last year was breached for failing to comply with his annual reporting requirements. Not only have we had criticism from the High Court and the United Nations; we have also had criticism from an LNP member who was representing one of his constituents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015660"></A>
In addition to the ability for courts to keep people in jail, offenders can be put on supervision orders with up to 50 or 60 conditions. If they breach those DPSO orders, QCS gives them no quarter and they are brought back before the courts if necessary. Members would by aware of recent media coverage which demonstrates how tough QCS is. An RTI application showed that in the 13 months to February 2011, 52 offenders were breached from a total of 154 contraventions. Some of those contraventions were serious; others on the face of it may not seem to be that serious. However, QCS treats them seriously--for example, reporting late to a corrective services officer for an appointment, being next door at a neighbour’s house watching the footy instead of being in their own home, making an unauthorised phone call and failing to meet a curfew. They are all examples of how tough Queensland Corrective Services is. </Hansard-Body>

 I thank the member for the question. It is obvious that he does not read the police annual statistical review. That review shows very clearly that for the ninth consecutive year crime rates in Queensland are declining. Indeed, what is that a result of? It is a result of this Labor government resourcing the Police Service to levels where it can actually get out there and proactively address crime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015677"></A>
Let us go back to the Fitzgerald inquiry. One of the key complaints about the National Party government was low police numbers--low resourcing of the Police Service leading to high crime rates. Since Labor has been in office there has been significant investment in police resources including a significant improvement in the police-to-population ratio. Under the Liberal-National Party government there was one police officer for every 507 people. We have significantly reduced that to around one police officer for every 430-odd people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015679"></A>
Crime rates in Queensland have been reducing over the last 10 years under this Labor government. The rate of property offences is down around 48 per cent. More than 30,000 fewer homes and businesses are broken into today than 10 years ago. That is a result of increased resources to the Police Service and proactive policing. The rate of offences against the person has reduced by around 20 per cent across Queensland. All of these reductions are due to improved resourcing for the Police Service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015683"></A>
I am proud of the support that the Queensland Labor government has given to the Police Service. This budget will continue a number of measures that have been in place for some time and also, as has been announced, obviously increase resources. As I have indicated, the opposition is in denial about what is happening with crime in Queensland. Of course there are concerns about spikes in crime rates in particular categories, and I acknowledge in particular some of the issues which have been experienced on the Gold Coast. We have been dealing with that issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015685"></A>
The facts speak for themselves. In particular, over the last 10 years the trend rates for crime in Queensland have been significantly reducing. I repeat: there has been a 48 per cent reduction in the rate of property crime and around a 20 per cent reduction in offences against the person. All of this is due to proactive, professional policing and also due to the resources that the Labor government has been giving the Police Service. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs KIERNAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Regional Economies. Given the federal government’s decision and the concern of producers in my electorate with regard to live exports, can the minister please update the House on the implications for Queensland producers of the suspension of live exports to Indonesia? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015692"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MULHERIN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for Mount Isa for her question. I know of her concerns not only for the primary producers--the cattlemen out in that area who really care for their livestock--but also for the communities in which that industry operates--the small country towns that will be impacted by the federal government decision. As members know, on 8 June the federal government imposed a suspension of the live cattle trade to Indonesia. The live cattle trade here in Queensland is worth about $100 million per year. Up to 200,000 head of cattle are exported yearly to Indonesia. While the suspension of live exports to Indonesia will directly impact on mainly producers in the north of the state, clearly the ramifications of this suspension will be felt much more widely. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015693"></A>
The Queensland government is working to support the cattle industry. The Queensland Live Cattle Export Task Force has been established to deal with the specific issues whilst the trade has been suspended. The task force will include representatives from AgForce, large pastoralists and the processing sector. It will work on identifying market options for stranded cattle, provide assistance to affected producers and work with the Commonwealth government to ensure reinstatement of trade. In conjunction with AgForce, we will also be conducting a major livestock industry forum in Mount Isa in the coming weeks to discuss the current situation. The forum will be open to all sectors of the industry. A farm financial counselling service has been made available to businesses affected by this decision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015696"></A>
Discussions will shortly commence with the Department of Transport and Main Roads, along with the industry, on the possible lifting of road transport permits to assist in the movement of cattle into feedlots in other parts of the state. The Queensland government will work with the industry to respond to the Australian government’s independent supply chain review, which is being headed up by a former ambassador to Indonesia, Mr Bill Farmer. We want to make sure that this review is a priority so that the recommencement of live cattle exports can occur. We recognise that Indonesia is a key export market for Queensland cattle. However, we must ensure that we have safeguards in place so that the industry can move forward with confidence in the overseas supply chain. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CRIPPS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Regional Economies. I refer to the Gillard Labor government’s decision to suspend the live cattle trade from Australia to Indonesia, undermining the $100 million a year trade. I note the answer of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Regional Economies to the question from the member for Mount Isa and the characteristic response of the Bligh Labor government to establish a committee to address serious issues. When will the Bligh Labor government stand up for Queensland’s cattle industry and the 1,200 workers who rely on the live cattle trade for their livelihoods to ensure that the Gillard Labor government takes responsibility for compensating affected industry participants and moves to re-establish a fully identifiable and traceable supply chain that meets Australia’s animal welfare expectations? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017975"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MULHERIN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. This is not the first time that suspensions have been put in place for the export of live animals to markets in different parts of the world. Those suspensions have been put in place because of public outrage in relation to the way animals have been treated. Previously the Howard government put a ban on live sheep exports because of those issues--we could not guarantee, with the supply chain, that at the end point those animals would be treated with the highest animal welfare standards that we have come to expect here in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017978"></A>
AgForce has met with me and the Premier. It was the suggestion of AgForce to set up a task force to develop responses particularly to Queensland, and that is what we have done. We have established a task force at the request of AgForce. I make that clear: AgForce asked for this task force. That is what we have done. This task force will then feed into the Australian government’s industry-government review of the supply chain. The industry will also participate in our weekly hook-up with the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland governments in relation to the matters at hand. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017986"></A>
The federal government has imposed this ban and it will continue to negotiate with industry around the industry’s issues. It has set up this overarching industry-government review, headed by Mr Bill Farmer. There are also a number of subcommittees that will look at broader issues. We will continue to work with AgForce and larger pastoral companies. We have responded to needs, and we will be organising a forum at Mount Isa with AgForce and other large pastoral groups in the next couple of weeks so that people will have the opportunity to bring their issues to us so that we can forward them to the national process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017990"></A>
We want to see that this trade is reinstated as quickly as possible, but we need to have confidence that the supply chain is of the highest standard to ensure that Australian cattle are treated appropriately at the end point of processing. As I have said, this is not the first time that a federal government has imposed bans on the live export of animals. The Howard government did it on two occasions. From memory, when it put a ban on the trade of sheep into Egypt, that ban lasted for 12 months. It is hopeful that this trade will be reinstated within six months. The view of those opposite is that it is okay for the tories to put a ban on the export of live animals but it is bad for a Labor government to do the same. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs SULLIVAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017997"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Pumicestone for the question. She knows the importance of the Bruce Highway--a vital link up and down the Queensland coastline. The Bruce Highway is a federally funded road, and a big increase in federal funds over many years is needed to bring it up to a reasonable standard. Unfortunately, we are playing some catch up after 12 years of neglect by the Howard government. Let us not forget that many of those members opposite were here in this place cheering on the Howard government during those 12 years of neglect. It is interesting to look at the figures. Under the Howard government, on average the Bruce Highway received an insulting $100 million a year for roadworks. Let us compare that to Labor--$480 million a year under Labor, nearly a fivefold increase under Labor.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017998"></A>
So I was perplexed--I was surprised--by the response I received when I recently put out a press release questioning the bona fides of the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to fixing the Bruce Highway. He was up in North Queensland talking about it. But let us not forget that he was in this place for seven years cheering on the Howard government. What did he do to twist the Howard government’s arm on the Bruce? What did he do? Absolutely nothing. In fact the question needs to be asked: why was that old warhorse who did nothing about the Bruce for seven years talking about the Bruce Highway? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018001"></A>
Unfortunately, he took exception to my media release and put out his own. The LNP hard man said that I was guilty of a ‘childish personal attack’. And that is coming from the member for Callide--a ‘childish personal attack’! Unfortunately, it seems the member for Callide has caught ‘Claytons’ Campbell’s double disease--a thin skin and a glass jaw. Perhaps in a hissy fit the member for Callide’s 9 June press release has been removed from the LNP website. That is why I table a copy today for posterity so that all in the House can see it. </Hansard-Body>

But we should not be surprised that they are trying to hide.

Five of the 10 worst local government roads were in the Brisbane City Council’s area. I am not surprised. Why were half of the roads in the Brisbane City Council’s area? Because ‘Claytons’ Campbell starved suburban roads of funding to fund his tunnel folly, and he would do the same--</Hansard-Body>

Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Health. Estimates are that LNG alone will create around 15,000 jobs in Gladstone. Additionally there are other contractors coming for other work. I am advised that locum contracts are being cancelled and full-time positions remain unfilled at the Gladstone Hospital. Will the minister give the people of the Gladstone electorate an assurance that the Gladstone Hospital will employ the staff required to provide the level of service needed to meet this community growth? </Hansard-Body>

Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. It is an important question about planning in our various regions and in particular in Gladstone. As I have indicated both privately to the member and publicly on other occasions, a significant body of service planning work is being done by Queensland Health for not only Gladstone but the broader surrounding area. It is proposed that we will be able to provide some answers and responses to the questions that the member and many others have asked in terms of long-term planning before the end of this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018018"></A>
It is important that we get the planning right. There is a major development taking place throughout the whole of Queensland; it is not just limited to LNG in Gladstone and the Surat Basin. We want to make sure that the long-term planning, not just around health but other vital government services, is robust and takes into account all of the contemporary knowledge and information that we have about the long-term population growth and the way in which the industry will develop not only in Gladstone but in the surrounding region. We need to do that to ensure that we get the planning right. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms JONES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for her question. I think everybody in this House knows just how passionate the member for Cairns is when it comes to protecting the Great Barrier Reef and how important the Great Barrier Reef is to Queensland’s economy, as it supports up to 65,000 jobs and a $5 billion tourism industry. That is why when the scientific consensus report was released in late 2008 we decided as a state government that we needed to take action to protect the Great Barrier Reef. I had the great honour and responsibility of introducing into this House landmark legislation that does just that. It addresses some of the key threats to the Great Barrier Reef and its future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020397"></A>
This report showed that, despite seeing significant dollars invested into voluntary measures by the federal government over a long period of time--coming on the back of a significant agreement signed by the then Prime Minister of the country, John Howard, and the Premier of Queensland at the time, Peter Beattie--we were seeing nutrient, sediment and pesticide levels in the Great Barrier Reef that were still extremely high, and these came from intensive agriculture in the main. We have actually seen pesticides some 60 kilometres offshore. This new legislation protects the Great Barrier Reef from those threats. We are getting real action, with over 85 per cent of farmers who are covered by this legislation complying with the environmental risk management plan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020398"></A>
What we have seen once again is the new leader of the LNP, the electoral leader, promising one thing to one group of people and saying another thing to another group. He went to Proserpine recently, and what did he say to the cane farmers at Proserpine? ‘We’re going to scrap that legislation.’ What did he then turn around and say to the tourism businesses in Airlie Beach? ‘We’re going to get more people here to look at the Great Barrier Reef.’ Once again we are showing that he does not want to support the legislation which protects the Great Barrier Reef but he promises to bring more people from Asia to come and see the Great Barrier Reef--a reef that will have no future. </Hansard-Body>

The biggest threats to the Great Barrier Reef are poor water quality and climate change.

This is a program that the former Lord Mayor of Brisbane not only supported but also funded. He used ratepayers’ dollars to implement this program in Brisbane households, but now that he is spending time with the National Party in Queensland he is calling it a waste of taxpayers’ dollars and gizmos and gadgets.

This morning we saw the reason the Queensland economy is in such a financial mess. This morning we saw why this government is running scared of its own financial mismanagement. This is a government that went broke in a boom. It went broke in a boom and it waits desperately for the next boom in order to break even. That is the economic management strategy that has been put in place by the member for Mount Coot-tha. </A></Hansard-Body>

Any attempt to question him on his economic management strategy results in personal abuse being thrown in all directions. Not quite sure who is to blame, he smacks everybody in sight with his personal abuse to cover his own financial failings. He is undoubtedly the worst state Treasurer in Australia and it is the people of Queensland who are suffering for that failing. The people of Queensland are suffering because the Treasurer has lost his way. He is a Treasurer who has lost his economic compass and does not know how to get out of the difficulty that his own mismanagement has brought the state into. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020427"></A>
The budget that we will see this afternoon will be a litany of disgrace and it will be the legacy of this state Labor government. That is, this government has put the state into a financial position that generations of Queenslanders will bemoan. Generations of Queenslanders will struggle to repay the debt that continues to be accumulated, despite the fact that the government and the Treasurer embarked on an asset sales program--a deceitful asset sales program--in an attempt to pay down the debt. Well, the attempt has failed. The attempt has failed because the debt that will be projected this afternoon will be greater than what we have seen in previous years. The debt continues to grow, despite the fact that the assets have been sold. While that debt continues to grow, the interest bill that every Queenslander must shoulder also continues to grow. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020428"></A>
A little bit of simple mathematic calculation shows that our interest payments are $595,000 every hour. I repeat: the people of Queensland will pay $595,000 every hour in interest. That is an enormous amount of money that could be put to better use. That amounts to some $14 million a day or $100 million a week in interest. The interest payments that this government has incurred on behalf of the people of Queensland could build a new school every two days. They could build a new regional hospital every week. They could build a major hospital every four weeks. They could employ 50,000 nurses, teachers and policemen and provide the sorts of services that the people of Queensland so badly need.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026699"></A>
But instead that $595,000 an hour will be used to pay the interest on a debt that this government has run up while it desperately waits for the boom times to return. Nothing typifies the state Labor government better than its failure to manage the finances of this state. Nothing typifies its failure better than the fact that it still does not have a solution, it still does not have a plan, it still does not have anything that can provide hope to the people of Queensland that things are going to get better. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026702"></A>
We on the other hand will develop a plan to address Labor’s failures. We are developing a plan which will give the people of Queensland some hope that there will be a solution to that monumental $85 billion worth of debt, that we in Queensland can grow the economy, that we can grow business and attempt in time to pay back that great legacy of this failed Labor government--a Labor government that has done what Labor governments always do. Labor governments always go broke. They always blow the money. They always look to blame somebody else. They always seek to find an excuse and they are never successful at managing the money, and this Labor government is a great example of that.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 He was wrong according to CommSec. He was wrong according to Access Economics, and he was wrong according to the National Australia Bank. I hear those on my left interject, because that is their response: they put their fingers in their ears and say, ‘Don’t worry about it. We’ll put it on the spindometer. We’ll make another big whack. We’ll put it on the spindometer to try and buy our way to success at the next election.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026723"></A>
That is exactly what is happening right now with the budget that we can expect to see later today. Quite frankly, nobody believes this government when it comes to its promises in budgets. And so today we will again sit in this House and wait for a plan from a government that has no plan to repay the debt. As we wait for a plan from the government to bring the budget back into surplus, there will be another attempt at hope over the bitter experience that we have established in the last four years under this government, under this Premier and under this Treasurer. It will again be another slick spin document put forward to try to sugar coat the pain so that the electorate is convinced to vote for it one more time and to soften the political blow that this government is afraid is coming, a blow that it is afraid is coming as it runs the state into an $85 billion debt.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026725"></A>
Ever since this government reneged on its promise not to sell assets and ever since it reneged on its promise not to impose a fuel tax, it has been saying to the public, ‘We have a plan.’ But that plan has not delivered anything. In the budget last year the total debt was going to go to $84 billion and then it was going to come down to $80 billion. Once again we find it is going up to $85 billion--$595,000 an hour, each and every hour, each and every day of each and every week. Just two years after the assets were put on the chopping block, were flogged off--the silver was sold--the debt is going to be more than it was when the initial program was put there. No-one should believe this government when it talks about asset sales. It flogged the assets off to pay the wages--to pay the wages because it was so inept that it could not control its own expenses, and that was despite a massive increase in taxes and charges.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026726"></A>
Who has heard about the plan to get the AAA credit rating back? Remember that Q2 objective: ‘We will keep the AAA credit rating’--another broken promise, another broken commitment! The government said, ‘We will sell the assets to get the AAA credit rating back.’ That was the whole reason for it. That was the whole reason for it if one goes to the budget documents. That is not even mentioned as we head towards that $85 billion worth of debt. Queenslanders will be paying that almost $600,000 each day, each and every day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026729"></A>
The Treasurer makes claims about the surplus. He has made three separate claims about the deficit in fact this year, and none of them have proven to be true so far, and I do not think anyone believes the latest events will prove them to be true. He talks about economic growth and he talks about predictions for economic growth. This government has a record of never hitting its economic growth targets. In 2007-08 it predicted five per cent and got 3.75 per cent. This government cannot be believed.</Hansard-Body>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110614_115607" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Bulimba--ALP) (11.55 am): I rise to speak about the announcement by the Premier and the Minister for Education and Industrial Relations last week of the plans to transition year 7 to secondary school. This is the latest plank in a raft of education initiatives which have been rolled out by the Labor government over the last decade and it marks this government quite simply as a reformer, as a government of ideas and a government for the future. This government knows that our children are our future. If we invest in the early years of a child’s life that sets them up, and this is what governments need to be investing in. This latest announcement positions our children to take best advantage of all of the opportunities which are available to them and will be available to them over the coming years. It will see the year 7 students of 2015 as the first of their cohort to be part of secondary school.</A></Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026739"></A>
But this will not be happening on its own. This transition is going to be supported by a comprehensive package of initiatives which address not only all of the opportunities which will be available but any of the challenges which might otherwise be involved with an initiative of this magnitude. Following on from the introduction of the full-time prep year in 2007 and the raising of the school entry age by six months, the time is now right for year 7s to transition to high school. It means that those prep children when they reach year 7 will be six months older on average--half of them will turn 13 years in year 7--and they will also be in their eighth year of school. This is the time of a child’s life when they are becoming more independent and when they are looking for challenges, and these same children will be part of some of the most exciting curriculum changes which have ever been instituted through the new national curriculum. We need to make sure that our students are in the best position possible to take advantage of this.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026741"></A>
I know that a number of parents and others have expressed concerns about whether children of this age were too young to go into a secondary school environment, and being a parent myself I can understand this. That is why I was very pleased to see the concept of a junior secondary school being included as part of the year 7 transition. This will begin straightaway for years 8 and 9, with the year 7s being added in 2015. The junior secondary concept will mean these students will be in a physically different location in secondary schools and will receive pastoral care and extra support as they merge into a new environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026742"></A>
What they will also now be able to get, however, which they simply could not get in a primary school are the specialised facilities and teaching which will make sure they are in the best position possible to take advantage of the new Australian curriculum. High-performing states like New South Wales and Victoria have had year 7 in high school for years. We want to make sure our year 7s have the same learning opportunities as these students and others across the country, and this new initiative will achieve that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029292"></A>
The government will be putting money where its mouth is to ensure the success of the initiative, with a significant investment in the state and non-state sectors to build new classrooms and buy extra teaching resources, support teachers and develop programs. A total of $328.2 million over four years will be allocated to implement the Flying Start initiatives. We will also provide recurrent funding of $293.8 million over five years, including $81 million to the non-state sector for capital assistance grants. There is so much to this initiative--so much support and encouragement, so much effort going into making it right. I refer to things like the additional funding to support year 7 students to travel to local secondary schools; up to 500 scholarships for state primary school teachers to prepare them for teaching in junior secondary; extra professional development programs for junior secondary teachers; and support for teachers to introduce the new Australian curriculum for 2013.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029300"></A>
I wish I had time to talk about all the elements of the package and I am certainly looking forward to making sure that the people of the Bulimba electorate are aware of them. I was very pleased to spend quite some time talking to local principals, teachers, parents, P&amp;C and P&amp;F committees last year when the consultation was being conducted on Flying Start--in fact, surveying the entire electorate for people’s views, and I know that everyone will be pleased to see any of the important issues they raised being factored in.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026782"></A>
I will say that now, more than any other time, is the time for a child who is engaged or who will be engaged in the future in the education system in Queensland. With the learning or earning reforms that we have introduced, the introduction of full-time prep, our plans to make kindergarten available to all Queensland children, our support for parents and carers to help their children be ready for school and life, our work with teachers, principals and schools to support them as they deliver quality learning opportunities and now with this latest series of announcements, things are just getting better and better in education. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110614_120038" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Toowoomba North--ALP) (12.01 pm): The Warrego Highway has been described as the backbone of sustainable economic growth and social wellbeing in southern Queensland and is a major contributor to regional, state and national economies. However, over many years now the condition of the road has deteriorated as a result of increasing use owing to a growing population associated with the pre-existing agricultural and pastoral industries but, more significantly, the fast-expanding coal and energy industry. The emergence of the $40 billion coal seam gas industry in the Surat Basin places even greater pressure on a highway that, even now, is struggling to meet its current traffic demands. Immediate and considerable action has and needs to be undertaken. </A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1026791"></A>
As a result, in May 2010 I convened a road summit of relevant mayors, the RACQ president Richard Pietsch and others with the Minister for Main Roads, Mr Wallace, and the then Minister for Transport, Ms Nolan, to consider the urgent priorities for the upgrade of the Warrego Highway between Morven and Helidon over the next four years. The estimated cost is $380 million to provide 55 kilometres of widened road on all narrow seals, 50 kilometres of strengthening work on rough and out-of-shape pavement, preservation works, intersection upgrades and safety treatments at high-crash locations, up to six kilometres of four-lane duplication between Toowoomba and Oakey and additional overtaking lanes from Oakey to Dalby to generally achieve 10-kilometre intervals. Other priorities over five to eight years and then nine to 12 years were also agreed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026794"></A>
The summit’s submissions call on the federal government to commit immediate funds under the National Land Transport Network to halt the current deterioration of the highway, upgrade the highway to a standard that supports future economic development across southern Queensland and the Surat Basin region and improve safety for industry and the travelling public. With gross regional product forecast to double by 2031 to approximately $9.3 billion, with the most increase occurring between 2014 and 2018, the Warrego Highway needs sufficient upgrading to support both its current and future needs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026796"></A>
Last year, Main Roads completed its submission, which was forwarded by the Hon. Craig Wallace to the federal infrastructure minister, the Hon. Anthony Albanese. As a result of a request to meet with him to verbally support the submission, on 19 April this year Minister Albanese was good enough to travel to Toowoomba at my invitation to meet at my office with representatives of our region’s businesses, the transport industry--including the Transport Workers Union--the Toowoomba mayor, representing the region’s mayors, the local federal MP and me. In order to reiterate the importance of this case, on 2 June this year I travelled to Canberra where Minister Albanese was good enough to hear again my submissions in support of the upgrade. A joint press release was issued at the end of the meeting whereby the minister committed to continue to work in close consultation with the Queensland government to determine future priorities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026799"></A>
I am pleased that currently the Commonwealth is spending $140 million over a number of years, which includes $54 million to upgrade the Blacksoil interchange, $40 million for improvements between Roma and Mitchell, $10 million to build additional overtaking lanes and $5 million for new and refurbished rest stops. Of course, these amounts are additional to the $82.5 million that is being spent on flood repairs on the Warrego Highway. However, more has to be done, which is why I continue to do my best in advocating for the highway. I know our state roads minister, Mr Wallace, is right behind this cause and I am confident that the state government will always do what it can. I call on the federal government to quickly address this issue and increase its commitment to the upgrade as well as, of course, addressing the ever-present need for an alternative method of road transport down the range at Toowoomba. The need for a second range crossing to get rid of the transports through Toowoomba is beyond argument. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026801"></A>
Notwithstanding the Warrego Highway being a federal road and, hence, a federal responsibility, the state’s efforts have been commendable. At the community cabinet in Toowoomba in March 2011, $11 million of work to the Warrego Highway as constituted by James Street was announced to upgrade the intersection of Geddes, Neil and Hume streets and also the intersection of Tor and Bridge streets. This week, resurfacing work will be carried out on Tor Street between Hursley Road and Taylor Street. I was absolutely delighted to read in today’s <Hansard-Italic>
Chronicle</Hansard-Italic>
 that the state will carry out four-laning work on the Warrego Highway on a significant stretch between Toowoomba and Oakey at a huge cost of $96 million. Thank you, Minister. This is state money being spent on a federal road. I call on the federal government to at least match this amount or put a similar amount towards construction of the second range crossing. The state government continues to show the way in the most important example of regional transport infrastructure improvement. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The government missed its own 2014 deadline and backflipped on its own Flying Start discussion paper that overlooked the fact that there is a recurrent cost in moving 50,000 students into high school in this state. </A></Hansard-Body>

The other side tries to attack the opposition by saying that we have no policies. That is a myth. Months ago I laid out this side’s policy in relation to year 7 and I am pleased that in some respects I seem to have helped the government a little bit because it has taken up some of the issues that I raised. Moving year 7 to high school in the environment of a national curriculum has merit in principle. We in the LNP have certainly not opposed this principle. But, as with so many other things with this government, the devil is in the detail. The detail in this move is that it is being done on the cheap. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026818"></A>
The government, by sprouting $660-odd million over five years, conveniently ignores the fact that this money is predominantly coming out of existing education budgets. The government is taking money from other areas of education to fund the move that it was not prepared to fund adequately to make it work. Even the $80 million--meagre as that is in the scheme of this move for the non-government sector--is not new money. It is money that was already earmarked to go into capital works in the non-government sector. It has simply been shifted with only a bare minimum of new money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026819"></A>
This money is budgeted over five years. Our 50,000 students will be in high school in sooner than five years. It is smoke and mirrors--making money that is not there looking like it is. Like the Flying Start paper that ignored completely the issue of recurrent expenditure--the extra $100 million that it would cost just to have those students in high school--this latest release is just as deficient. With 50,000 new students in high schools, not one new high school is proposed in the government’s release. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026820"></A>
I need look no further than Kenmore State High School, located in the western suburbs of Brisbane. That high school already has the most stringent enrolment management so that people who can walk to the school cannot even send their kids to the school. It is at 103 per cent capacity. In 2015, it is going to be expected to take another 400 students. If there is any chance of making this proposal work, this government is relying on forcing thousands more Queensland parents to pay private school fees. We are still sending thousands of students to high schools in Queensland who do not meet minimum standards of literacy and numeracy. We cannot even get the basics right. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026821"></A>
The introduction of the prep year was a good idea, but it has not delivered on all of its benefits because we have sent teachers out without teacher aides. The government cannot even be honest about the age of children. If one goes to its website, it states that the children’s cohort that will enter year 7 in 2015 were born between 1 July 2002 and 30 June 2003. In fact, the oldest will be only 12 years old when they go to high school, the youngest only 11 years old. It cannot even be honest about the age of students entering high school. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026822"></A>
I have real concerns about the resourcing to make this effective and avoid harming our education system. Rural and remote students who have been offered a few little trinkets by the government in fact will be up for greater boarding fees, lower bandings and smaller enrolments in their community primary schools. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(12.10 pm): After meeting with a number of parents of children with ASD in my electorate, I took it upon myself to educate myself more about the difficulties faced by people with autism spectrum disorder, their parents and the people who care for and educate them. Earlier this year I visited the Autism Queensland headquarters at Sunnybank and was able to speak with the dedicated and committed people who have vast knowledge and experience in the field of autism spectrum disorder. After this initial visit I met with Dr Jill Ashburner, Manager, Research and Development, Autism Queensland, to learn more about a proposal for a cooperative research centre for living with autism spectrum disorder. This proposal for a CRC into autism was initiated by Autism Queensland and the University of Queensland. An information workshop was held in Brisbane in 2010 with 63 participants, including universities, hospitals and government organisations. At the end of the process there was full support for progressing the CRC application. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029515"></A>
The CRC application has three main areas of research which have been developed using information provided during the consultation process. I have been told by parents of children with ASD as well as teachers that, due to the time it takes to obtain a verification for ASD, it is often difficult to ensure the students are receiving the proper support needed for them in prep and year 1. This can lead to significant delays in the learning process, so it is not surprising that the first area of research of the CRC is to improve the ability to correctly diagnose ASD through the identification of biomarkers with the potential to be used in diagnosis to develop a nationally endorsed protocol for accurate, efficient and faster evidence based diagnosis. They are also going to look at procedures and development programs to support the period around diagnosis and deliver a seamless integration between diagnosis and early intervention services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029516"></A>
The second part of the program is called Creating a Future and is focused on providing an enhanced education outcome for people with ASD. This is an important part of the development of people and prepares them for life as an adult. It will also provide options for better supporting our teachers by developing ASD-friendly curriculum and assessment approaches. The third area of research is around finding a place in society for adults with ASD. This is important so that we can develop tailored programs to support young people and adults with ASD by developing adult education programs, social interaction programs, emotional regulation and relation programs and developing effective programs to support vocational education and training and higher education. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029517"></A>
I have seen and heard from parents, teachers and caregivers about the difficulties and stresses faced in caring for and educating children and adults with ASD. There is a great deal of goodwill amongst educators, carers and support groups. However, I acknowledge that there are issues that are complex and difficult. There are concerns from teachers that time spent dealing with one child with ASD is at times affecting their ability to deal with the other 26 or 27 children in the room. Parents are frustrated about what is best for their children: a fully inclusive program or a more focused and individual education process. I have had parents express to me that they would prefer more time being spent on developing social and living skills to ensure a better quality of life. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029518"></A>
I fully support the application for the CRC by Autism Queensland and the University of Queensland. However, I believe it is also time for the Queensland government, through the parliamentary process, to get a parliamentary committee to investigate ways that we can improve the delivery of services for people affected by ASD through improved cooperation between government departments. I believe that we can do better and, for the sake of people with ASD and their parents, we must do better. I have seen the despair of some parents and I think it is best highlighted by the words of Kerry Norris, a parent of a child with ASD. She says--</Hansard-Body>

You my child are like a diamond in the rough. A sweet innocent little boy yet who possesses the ability to change so suddenly to an angry and confused soul with a demeanour all so tough. Therefore I am left wondering just what shall become of you when you become more manly. Though in the meantime I shall watch over you as much as possible. Just as I shall burn a flame in my heart for you always for you are but one of my sons, treasuring your very existence, I am no fool. I know that you are somewhat different so in your name I shall not throw down my guns. For it would only be unwise of me not to live on and cherish you, but however I do wish that we would hear your beautiful voice a little more. However, I cannot hold this against you, not when you are struggling internally. This much I know to be true. It is as though you are fighting in your very own self inflicted war. All this aside, it does seem as though you can’t be stopped, for you are always in a hurry, running and playing until your heart is content, playing in your very own land of make believe. Still, I can’t help but worry, for dare anyone try to stop you or interfere ... Where you then lash out with your feet and fists. Because you harbour so much angst inside it must at some point rear its ugly head. Somewhere, somehow you let us all know that it exists only to then take it out on yourself when you have been disciplined. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

(12.15 pm): Two weeks ago today many Queenslanders woke up with a knot in their stomach. The previous evening they had seen on the ABC’s <Hansard-Italic>
Four Corners</Hansard-Italic>
 program graphic and disturbing footage of the processing of cattle in a number of Indonesian abattoirs. Like many Queenslanders I was shocked by the mistreatment of the cattle on the program. The LNP deplores cruelty to animals and we supported the decision at the time to suspend the supply of Australian cattle to the particular abattoirs using these inhumane practices. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029528"></A>
Furthermore, the LNP considers ongoing advances in animal welfare outcomes as integral to its ongoing support for the live export of cattle to Indonesia. The LNP believes Australia is best placed to encourage humane practices in Indonesian abattoirs. The efforts of the Australian live cattle export industry have led to the introduction of stunning in some abattoirs. There is a long way to go to see the wider use of stunning in Indonesia, but there would not have been any progress had the Australian industry not been involved. No other country exporting live cattle spends money raised by levies on domestic producers to educate their customer in the humane treatment of animals. The only reason the Australian live export industry has any influence is that it is a preferred supplier due to the quality of the product. The LNP believes the live cattle export industry and the federal government need to continue to make the promotion and adoption of stunning a priority in Indonesian abattoirs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029529"></A>
A week after the <Hansard-Italic>
Four Corners</Hansard-Italic>
 program was broadcast, the federal minister for agriculture, Senator Joe Ludwig, made a decision to suspend the export of live cattle to all Indonesian abattoirs regardless of practices they utilise. The live export of cattle is a major economic driver in North Queensland. The ban has serious ramifications on cattle producers, employees on properties, transport operators and businesses supplying and servicing the industry. Another week of uncertainty passed before Minister Ludwig yesterday addressed the issue of compensation. Minister Ludwig proposes to force the cattle industry to compensate itself by directing its industry body to use funds accumulated from voluntary levies collected for marketing and promotion and redistribute them to affected producers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029530"></A>
The full suspension of the live cattle export to Indonesia was an active decision of the Gillard government to close a major export market for North Queensland cattle producers. The Gillard government has created this crisis in the state’s beef industry. The current crisis demonstrates that Minister Ludwig did not fully understand the ramifications of his decision to fully suspend the live export of Australian cattle to Indonesia. The Gillard government should accept responsibility for its decision and compensate cattle producers for the loss of this market. The Gillard government must also announce and outline an immediate plan to re-establish a controlled trade with Indonesia that makes cattle identifiable and traceable from the property boundary in Australia to the abattoir in Indonesia. There are abattoirs in Indonesia that meet Australia’s expectations and there are producers in North Queensland capable of monitoring the movement of their cattle through the supply chain. </Hansard-Body>

The extent of the Bligh government’s response has been to set up a task force, supposedly to identify alternative markets. It is very disappointing that the Bligh government has made plan B its priority. Rather than admit defeat, the Bligh government should stand up for North Queensland cattle producers and demand that the Gillard government re-open a controlled export trade to Indonesia. There are too many livelihoods at risk in this industry for this to be the best the Gillard and Bligh governments can offer. The live cattle export trade is a significant part of North Queensland’s economy. The impact of an ongoing export ban will be enormous. The livelihoods of everyone working in this industry are in jeopardy. Premier Bligh and the state minister for agriculture should be fighting for the livelihoods of these Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>

The LNP does not believe domestic producers supplying cattle for export should be penalised because some Indonesian abattoirs use unacceptable practices. The ban on exports from Australia means Indonesia will source cattle from another supplier less interested and committed to encouraging abattoirs to adopt more humane practices. Small regional communities in Indonesia have no refrigeration capacity. The only way local people have access to fresh meat is to purchase it on a daily basis from a local wet market. There are those claiming abattoirs in Australia can accept and process these cattle. This is not true. In the first instance, the cattle are the wrong breeds. Secondly, the domestic market for beef would be flooded, reducing returns to domestic suppliers and impacting on the markets of substitute products such as chicken, pork, lamb and fish. If people are genuinely interested in animal welfare, they need to understand the best chance of cattle being treated humanely in Indonesian abattoirs is for the Australian live cattle export industry to continue promoting the adoption of stunning and other practices. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110614_122044" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Southport--ALP) (12.20 pm): How often have we said that you never know what is around the corner? Quite often I have said it myself but not thought deeply about it. However, a recent event gave me an example of exactly what it means and how a completely unforeseen and unpredictable event can devastate our lives. On the Wednesday of the last parliamentary sitting in Brisbane, I received a message from my son-in-law, Clive, that my daughter Ali and grandson Zac had been involved in a serious motor vehicle accident. He asked me to meet them at the Royal Brisbane Hospital. Upon arrival, I saw Zac and was told that, apart from a few bruises and some skin off his leg, he was virtually uninjured. Unfortunately, the news about Ali was not as good. </A></Hansard-Body>

Ali’s left leg was badly injured and she spent over six hours in the operating theatre, where the medical staff tried to save her leg. Notwithstanding their effort and expertise, Ali’s leg had to be amputated. Three weeks followed in ICU and ward 7A North amputee ward, where, with the care of the medical and nursing staff, Ali slowly recovered. She is now at home, using a wheelchair and crutches and preparing for the months ahead when she will be fitted with a prosthetic limb and will have to learn to walk again. She faces many challenges in the months and years ahead. However, if anyone is equipped to meet those challenges Ali is. She is a happy, energetic, intelligent and positive person. Of course, normally getting a rap from your father is not much of a rap, but I know that those who know her would agree with that assessment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031935"></A>
The response to this tragic event has been overwhelming from people who are good friends and those who are virtually unknown to the family. We have received cards, letters, emails, chocolates and flowers. Ali was able to share the flowers with other patients in the ward, because they could not all fit in her room. The Mater Dei Catholic Primary School and Ashgrove Memorial Kindergarten mothers have volunteered to make Henry’s and Zac’s lunches. They and other friends are still making meals. People have offered to look after the boys, mow the lawn and set up a roster to take Ali to and from the hospital for physio. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031939"></A>
On behalf of the family, Ali, Clive and the boys, and also Ali’s mother, Lin, I thank all those who have sent messages of support, including members from across this House, media people, some of whom have worked with Ali, constituents, and friends from here and overseas. I thank the many witnesses who assisted Ali and looked after Zac until the ambulance arrived, particularly the young mother who ran off with Zac so he could not see what had happened to his mother. I thank the two men who were on their way to the gym and who reversed the car and applied a tourniquet to Ali’s leg, without which she probably would have bled to death. I also thank those who cared so well for Ali, including the ambulance officers who attended the scene and took both Ali and Zac to the Royal Brisbane Hospital. I thank the investigating police officers. I thank the medical, surgical, nursing and general staff at the hospital. They were all brilliant, professional and understanding. Nothing was too much trouble for them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031940"></A>
However, this tragic accident raises and highlights an important issue, which is elderly people driving. The gentleman responsible for the accident, which could have had more serious consequences, was 88 years of age. Age itself is not an indicator of driving ability, but it is generally accepted that as we get older our reflexes and reaction times are slower. Ali bears no animosity to this gentleman but says to me, ‘Dad, he should not have been driving.’ Exactly what caused the accident I will leave to the investigating police officers, but Ali, with Zac in his stroller, was waiting for a lift in a shopping centre car park when an out-of-control car mowed them down and jammed Ali against another car. She was able to push Zac’s pram away so he avoided the main impact. Even as she begged the driver to reverse the car, he remained frozen until bystanders came and reversed the car. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031941"></A>
In other jurisdictions, after the age of 75 it is necessary to obtain a doctor’s certificate and to undergo a driving test. In Queensland, whilst a doctor’s certificate is required a driving test is not. With our ageing population, that policy should be implemented, not only in Queensland but also throughout Australia. In the meantime, families and GPs have a responsibility. I have had people say to me, ‘We won’t let the grandchildren drive with grandma or grandad,’ or, ‘We won’t drive with Mum or Dad.’ If that is the case, why do they let them continue to drive? A licence to drive is a privilege and should not continue until someone is killed or maimed, which is when we say, ‘You can’t drive anymore.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031942"></A>
My brothers and I had to get the police to take my father’s licence from him. He complained about losing his independence, but since when does the independence of an individual take priority over the community’s health, wellbeing and safety? On the other hand, my mother voluntarily gave up her licence because she realised that her reflexes were not what they should be. Doctor shopping is also a problem. Often if an elderly person’s GP refuses a certificate, the patient will try other GPs until the certificate is issued. You can issue a certificate for five years. If you examine someone at 75, how can you say they will be fit to drive at 80? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031943"></A>
Ali’s recovery continues. This week she received a real boost with the arrival from overseas of her sister Jane and brother Phil. She is still telling everyone how lucky she was that Zac was uninjured, that her injuries were confined to her left leg and that she has no spinal or internal injuries. Certainly she has a great attitude and is a great example to all of us. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 Document by Bailey Civil Contractors Pty Ltd titled ‘Fitzroy River to Capricorn Coast Water Supply Pipeline and Reservoirs’ [<HypertextLink>
<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=5311T4631" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL">4631</A></HypertextLink>
]. </Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031955"></A>
I refer to the Fitzroy River-Capricorn Coast water supply pipeline and reservoirs contract No. LSC002/07/08. This project was jointly funded by the federal, state and local governments. A contract to build the majority of this project was let in February 2008. The project is complete and in operation. In accordance with the contract, the contractor gave the council a bank guarantee for $750,000 as security and retention for the due and proper performance of the contract. That bank guarantee should have been returned to the contractor 12 months after practicable completion. The bank guarantee has not been returned. Also, the contractor’s final payment claim in the value of $5.69 million, excluding GST, has not been assessed or paid. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031956"></A>
It has been reported through all levels of government that this project has been completed--that is, the Australian federal government’s Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, the state government’s Department of Environment and Resource Management and local government through the Rockhampton Regional Council’s subsidy Fitzroy River Water. Furthermore, Rockhampton Regional Council officers have received an award for the successful completion of the project. Mayor Brad Carter and the CEO at the time, Mr Dawson, have also reported in the council’s 2009-10 annual report that the project had been completed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031959"></A>
The Rockhampton Regional Council has accepted that the project is complete and has reported such in its water committee meetings, specifically those held on 17 November 2009 and 15 September 2010. DERM has relied upon confirmation from the Rockhampton Regional Council, as it also reported the pipeline was completed in November 2009 and no doubt a funding milestone was represented as having been achieved. On 13 April 2011 the Rockhampton Regional Council reported that all works were completed on this project and it has been successfully commissioned. This would suggest that all state and federal funding had been received by the Rockhampton Regional Council. This funding would have been released upon advice from council to the state and federal stakeholders that all parts of the project had been completed and reached practical completion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031960"></A>
Where is the money for Bailey Civil Contractors if the contract has, in fact, been completed and reached practical completion? Which is correct? If the contract is not finished and practical completion has not been reached, the public and funding stakeholders are being misled and there is a strong possibility that the Rockhampton Regional Council wrongfully acquired the state and federal funding for the completion of this project. If that is the case, the government should step in and order the return of the contractor’s bank guarantee without further delay and assessment of the final payment claim. This must then be followed by an immediate CMC investigation into the conduct of the council over its handling and administration of the contract and its apparent misappropriation of grant funding. However, if the contract is finished as the government publication suggests, the council is illegally withholding the release of the contractor’s $750,000 bank guarantee purely to frustrate and antagonise the contractor, while abusing and exploiting the unsuspecting Rockhampton Regional Council ratepayers with a costly and unnecessary Supreme Court proceeding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034692"></A>
If this is the case, the government may have already participated in condoning the council’s action. Should this come to light, there must be an immediate investigation by the CMC into the conduct of the Rockhampton Regional Council and the state government in relation to their victimisation of this contractor and the exploitation of Rockhampton regional ratepayers. Further, there must be a return of the contractor’s bank guarantee without delay, an assessment of the final payment claim immediately by them and an investigation into the conduct of the council in its handling of the contract administration and its apparent misappropriation of grant funding. Either way, it is not a good look for state and local governments recovering from crisis requesting assistance. How many other contractors are in this same situation? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034697"></A>
Today I call on the Premier in conjunction with Brad Carter, the mayor of the Rockhampton Regional Council, to enter immediately into discussions with Bailey Civil Contractors to gain an outcome to this and make their money good. After all, it is their money and not the money of this government or the Rockhampton Regional Council. <Hansard-Speech-End>

As a Gold Coaster, I was very pleased to be involved in the delivery of Skilled Park, a commitment that secured the Gold Coast its very own team and now a world-class sporting venue that fans love to go to and players relish the opportunity to play at. </A></Hansard-Body>

It was not until John Witheriff, Gold Coast lawyer and business identity and Gold Coast Football Club chairman, launched the campaign for the Gold Coast’s AFL team that I learned how many people living on the Gold Coast love their AFL. Mr Witheriff formed a bid team, and so began the journey and the challenge to earn the league’s 17th licence. The bid team had to demonstrate that the Gold Coast had the capacity for 20,000 supporters. They set out to find sponsors and establish a home for that Gold Coast team. That was in 2008. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034710"></A>
Last month, Queensland’s newest stadium was officially opened. A people’s day held in May saw thousands of people move through the gates to see for the first time a completed Metricon Stadium. I was there at the gates with sports minister Phil Reeves and a very, very proud John Witheriff to welcome Gold Coast Suns fans. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034712"></A>
In 2009 the Bligh Labor government made an election commitment to provide funding to a stadium for an AFL team on the Gold Coast. This funding commitment would deliver a world-class sporting facility to the Gold Coast, stimulate the economy and create and keep jobs. Metricon Stadium was a $144.2 million project that has now been delivered to the people of the Gold Coast, $71.9 million of which came from the Queensland state government. It was a project delivered on time and on budget. It was a project that supported 1,100 jobs during construction and is set to inject more than $340 million into the Queensland economy over the next 10 years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034713"></A>
Now Metricon Stadium stands as an impressive sporting venue on the Gold Coast landscape. With a seating capacity of 25,000, 75 per cent of which is undercover, it is the proximity of the seating to the field that has fans talking. In addition, the 8.5-metre-high and 23-metre-wide high-resolution LED scoreboard is one of the largest in Australia, adding to the fan experience. The new stadium looks great with the installation of vibrant red seating throughout the venue, but with 450 metres of solar panelling producing solar power, the stadium is green in design and operation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034714"></A>
The Bligh government’s investment in this great facility is also about boosting the Gold Coast’s tourism industry. With recent economic analysis showing Stadiums Queensland venues currently contribute more than $308 million to the state economy each year, Metricon Stadium will also be an attraction that will bring patrons for a game and a holiday--creating business for airlines, the transport sector, hotels, bars, clubs and restaurants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034715"></A>
The stadium has been designed to enable seating capacity to increase to 40,000 should the Gold Coast successfully win the bid to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games. It will be the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies and the site of a new athletics track that will remain after the games for the Gold Coast community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034716"></A>
Whilst many AFL fans will remain loyal to their long beloved clubs, having our own Gold Coast team will inspire and encourage a new generation of young AFL players and fans. The Queensland government wants to make sure that local sport and recreation clubs continue to develop sport and the stars of the future. Junior AFL clubs on the Gold Coast have benefited from $156,000 over three years in Bligh government funding to employ a local coordinator as part of the Local Sport and Recreation Jobs Plan. This funding has enabled ALF Gold Coast Juniors to employ a coordinator to work with Coomera, Ormeau, Pacific Pines, Southport, Tamborine Mountain and Labrador junior AFL clubs. The mighty Tigers at Labrador is actually in my own electorate. I have had the opportunity to meet with Dean Vigus, who has been appointed as the coordinator for these clubs. Dean is out there helping the many club officials and volunteers who simply do not have time to take advantage of all the governance, fundraising, networking and marketing opportunities that clubs need to develop. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034719"></A>
I wish to place on record my sincere congratulations to John Witheriff and the team on creating a great Gold Coast AFL team. As Kevin Costner said in the movie <Hansard-Italic>
Field of Dreams</Hansard-Italic>
, build it and they will come. I had never before watched a full game of AFL until recently, when the Gold Coast Suns played Geelong at Metricon Stadium. I have to admit that, whilst not converted entirely, having our own team and a great stadium at which to watch a game has certainly made me a fan. It is fast, skilful and enthralling to watch. I am pleased to be part of Anna Bligh’s team on the Gold Coast delivering vital infrastructure that creates jobs and funding that supports the development of junior sport. It is this investment that continues to make the Gold Coast such an exciting and vibrant place to live. <Hansard-Speech-End>

I am pleased to announce The Queensland Party’s policy in terms of portfolio reform and ministerial accountability. We in The Queensland Party believe that the 18 portfolios should be reduced to 12 to streamline those responsibilities and ensure there is less bureaucracy in the state level of government. We also believe that those 12 ministers should have an appointed deputy minister so that two people are working in each portfolio. We know that the workload for a minister is such that it is impossible to be across every issue in their department. The Queensland Party believes that having a minister and a deputy minister would be far more efficient with 12 streamlined portfolios to save crossover, duplication, finger-pointing and buck-passing. Terminology is very important in politics, so I am pleased to announce also that The Queensland Party will be including in the portfolio line-up the terminology of cost of living, decentralisation, state assets, political processes and families. </A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1034731"></A>
I am pleased to announce that the finance and cost-of-living spokesperson for The Queensland Party will be the candidate for Mount Coot-tha, Matt Tuton. As a former Terrace boy, Matt has worked in the finance sector for many years now. He has employed over 25 people at the age of 26 on the front line of financial services, in helping people to acquire their home and be fiscally responsible. Matt has been working with this state’s flawed legislation and he will be a huge asset to both The Queensland Party and Queensland at the upcoming state election. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034733"></A>
Another portfolio will be state assets, mines and energy. We believe that state assets are such an important issue because, as state assets keep getting sold, the cost of living is being driven up in the long term. We are a party that has a 20-year vision, not a two-year vision to balance the books. However, those overseas and foreign companies that buy our assets will dictate the prices back to us. State assets are too important to be left out of the portfolio terminology. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034734"></A>
Health, mental and disability services will be streamlined. Police, corrective and emergency services and Attorney-General will be represented by Darren Hunt, who is the candidate for Cairns. He has been a police officer on the front line for 18 years and a parole officer. He knows only too well what needs to happen in the police, corrective and emergency services department. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034737"></A>
Mr Peter Pyke, a former member for Mount Ommaney, will be taking on the portfolio of education, vocational education and training and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues. Mr Pyke is a former police officer and also a police instructor at the Oxley academy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034738"></A>
We believe that the areas of entertainment, tourism and sport should be streamlined. It is extremely insensitive to have the areas of sport and child safety grouped together, particularly in the last five years. Only five years ago there were 62,000 contacts annually. That has now increased to 102,000 contacts to Child Safety Services. That is an almost doubling in six years. It is an absolute insult to have the sport portfolio connected to child safety. It is too important, and no family who has issues with their children wants to see a sport minister downing a bottle of beer during Indy. I think it is completely insensitive. That department needs to be separated. We need to make sure we get rid of these political characters and get a bit of common sense back in this place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034739"></A>
Environment will be a stand-alone portfolio. Local government and political processes will be another important portfolio. Queensland is probably the least accountable state in Australia in terms of our political processes. Main roads and public transport will be another portfolio. I am proud to say that the candidate for Sunnybank, Chris Burns, who is a qualified engineer, will be the spokesperson for main roads and public transport. Child safety, families and community services will be represented by The Queensland Party candidate for Burdekin, Ron Wadforth. He is a family man of three. He is a prison officer at the Townsville Correctional Centre and brings a wealth of knowledge to the party. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034742"></A>
Planning, housing and decentralisation will be another portfolio. Decentralisation is a key word that has been missing in action during the last 10 years in this state. The spokesperson for that portfolio will be Mike Kelly, the candidate for Logan. Mike has run the ‘save Greenbank’ campaign, of more than 6,000 people, which was a success. Michael has also been heavily involved in the housing industry for the last 15 years. He brings a wealth of knowledge to that portfolio area. It is completely unacceptable in this state to have a 10- or 11-year waiting list for housing. That is something that will correlate with decentralisation and planning in this state to cater for future growth. Finally, economic, trade and business development will be the twelfth portfolio. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034786"></A>
We have another seven candidates who will be rolling out in the coming weeks. That will bring the total number of candidates for The Queensland Party covering one-third of this great state, and we are still rolling them out. We will have 12 spokespersons. We will have 12 deputy spokespersons. We will unashamedly put our ideas on the table whether Queenslanders like them or not. We will not hide under a rock. We will have a leader in the parliament. We will have a spokesperson for every portfolio, and we will show that a credible alternative is emerging in this great state. The LNP are done and dusted. Regardless of how many times they play musical chairs, they still do not stand for policy and that is completely unacceptable in the 2 years that they have been in opposition since the last election. Again, they are yet to come up with a single policy that has been costed. Mr Deputy Speaker, The Queensland Party is building and I can tell you now that it will be a third credible force at the next state election. <Hansard-Speech-End>

For example, my electorate of Keppel, the electorate of Rockhampton and part of Mirani cover the Rockhampton Regional Council area that originally had four disaster management committees with different requirements. That area now has only one committee, which has a cogent policy and proceeds on the basis of a single view of the needs of the region. We see the cohesion which exists between the Rockhampton Regional Council and the Queensland Reconstruction Authority and also the federal government benefiting our region and those who suffered through flooding. We have had major funding provided to RRC for reconstruction, and I see it being sensibly applied to the needs of the community. Residents and sporting groups have been assisted by grants under a number of arrangements, and our region is getting on with building stronger and more vibrant communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034798"></A>
Our region must work together to advance its value, and a financial plan was launched in Brisbane on 8 June following the launch in Rockhampton. But we are currently undergoing a bombardment of invective and misleading rhetoric from Councillor Bill Ludwig, councillor for division 3, trying to recreate his own little patch of power as a separate council--obviously as mayor; he was the mayor of the former Livingstone shire--which could not stand on its own without financial help from outside. He completely ignores his oath of office which requires him to act on behalf of the whole council area. </Hansard-Body>

The former Rockhampton City Council and Mount Morgan, Fitzroy and Livingstone councils were, to differing degrees, propped up financially by the state government, and the ability to deal with one entity in a professionally managed manner is probably the greatest success. The former Livingstone shire council wanted other tiers of government to pay for everything while they showered their largesse on select people within the shire, and the state and Commonwealth could not afford to return to that set of circumstances. Beachfront upgrades, sewerage treatment works and CBD upgrades cost millions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034800"></A>
The former Rockhampton City Council was acknowledged as a well-managed council which was stunted in its growth by doughnut councils which would not cooperate for the benefit of the region. Rockhampton was once one of the largest cities in Queensland but slipped behind when Cairns, Mackay and Bundaberg joined with neighbouring shires to provide a larger regional voice. The current call for a separate council on the Capricorn Coast has not even reflected the substantial cost to establish that entity. I call on the LNP to publicly disclaim any support for the establishment of a new entity as it has been claimed that they will support it. If that is correct, they would be imposing a substantial cost on the state government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034802"></A>
There are estimated to be 12,000 ratepayers in the projected new region and there are two direct debts. One is $13 million for a water pipeline--and I did hear comments made by the member for Gregory that were concerning, but that in itself may well be a matter for the courts. Hopefully it will not get to that. The other is $3.5 million for the construction of a town hall in Yeppoon. That will need to be included with the additional cost of an estimated $5 million for the creation of a separate entity. The resultant costs would be $1,750 per ratepayer, plus the additional cost of the councillors and CEO and the additional cost of bulk water. And we have seen what has happened with the current water entities and the amount that they have passed on to users. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034804"></A>
If people are struggling under the cost of living at present, how much will the state government be requested to pay to keep this councillor in the manner to which he believes he is entitled? I understand that the LNP have said that they will support the separation of Noosa and Port Douglas, but there is certainly no agreement or any indication that they would support the current rhetoric. We as a responsible government will work to ensure that hardworking councils are viable and that the regions which they represent receive the assistance they need. Working together, we can help Queensland leap forward, and every person will be able to realise their hopes for a better future. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110614_124539" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Buderim--LNP) (12.45 pm): I rise to speak to the Fairer Water Prices for SEQ Amendment Bill. Just when we thought it was safe to go back to using some water, here comes Labor again. Labor’s water horror story in South-East Queensland continues. </A></Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034816"></A>
Right from the outset, the title of ‘Fairer Water Prices for SEQ’ pretends that this bill will result in fairer water prices across the water grid, from the water source to the treatment plant to distribution. However, clause 7(2)(b), under the definition of ‘water supplier’ on page 8, specifically excludes all bulk water supply entities owned by the state. This is unfair to allow the state entities unrestricted spending whilst restricting the local government owned water entities. This amendment bill is highly restrictive on local government owned water entities but not restrictive on the state owned water entities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034818"></A>
As a preamble to the introduction of this bill, on 7 April 2011--just weeks ago--the Premier stood in this chamber and announced, ‘Today ... the blame game on water in South-East Queensland ends.’ The Premier told us that the Labor government had decided to repeal the sections of the South-East Queensland Water (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) Act that required the distribution and retail entities to be established. The Premier said that this would mean councils that wished to return to their previous structure would be able to do so and those that wished to retain the current entities could also do so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034820"></A>
Then the Premier said the most bizarre thing, and I will quote the Premier directly. The Premier stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1034822"></A>
In a letter of May 2009, the Council of Mayors, led and chaired by Mr Newman, sought a structure that would deliver: Firstly, three vertically integrated commercially oriented water businesses as separate legal entities with boards nominated by council owners compromising a majority of independent directors; secondly, the separation of water and sewerage bills from rate bills; and, thirdly, pricing for a transitional period to be the responsibility of the businesses, not an independent pricing authority. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1034823"></A>
Further in the Premier’s ministerial statement on 7 April, the Premier stated--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1034825"></A>
The state government listened to the South-East Queensland Council of Mayors and we delivered exactly what it asked for. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1034826"></A>
What the Premier said next is particularly interesting. The Premier went on to say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1034827"></A>
The fact is that the three water utilities in South-East Queensland are a product of the architecture designed by Campbell Newman and the South-East Queensland Council of Mayors. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034829"></A>
The Premier repeated that claim that the three water utilities in South-East Queensland were the ‘product of the architecture designed by Campbell Newman and the South-East Queensland Council of Mayors’. Those were the Premier’s precise words. Let us remember that the Premier stated that the letter to which she referred was dated May 2009. I am not quite sure what the Premier was thinking in terms of dates. But the last time I thought about it 2007 came before 2009. I table a copy of a joint ministerial media statement by former Premier Peter Beattie and his then deputy, our current Premier, Anna Bligh. </Hansard-Body>

 Ministerial media statement, dated 24 May 2007, titled ‘New Era for Water in SEQ: Beattie’ [<HypertextLink>
<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=5311T4632" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL">4632</A></HypertextLink>
]. </Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034832"></A>
The date of this ministerial statement is 24 May 2007--that is, two years before the letter to which the Premier referred was even written. Let me say that again so that it sinks in for those opposite: two years before. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037607"></A>
The ministerial statement was headed ‘New era for water in SEQ’. The statement commenced--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037611"></A>
A streamlined 21st century water management system for South East Queensland water was unveiled by Premier Peter Beattie and Deputy Premier Anna Bligh in State Parliament this morning.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1037612"></A>
It went on--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037614"></A>
... the State will assume control and operate the larger water assets that hold, manufacture ... and distribute bulk water across the South East. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037615"></A>
Yes, the Premier assumed control--in other words, seized and took over water assets which council ratepayers already owned. The ministerial statement continued--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037617"></A>
Councils will still have an important role to play at the retail and distribution end--jointly owning a single distribution entity that will be responsible for the domestic pipe network and pumping stations, and three retail companies. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037618"></A>
Let me say that again: three retail companies. So despite the current Premier’s claims that the council of mayors were the architects and that her government is completely blameless for this current water distribution and retailing model in South-East Queensland, the members of the Labor government were in fact the architects of this debacle. They told the world about it on 24 May 2007. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037620"></A>
As for the Premier’s claim that ‘the state government listened to the South-East Queensland Council of Mayors and we delivered exactly what it asked for’, former Premier Peter Beattie’s media release made it clear: the model they were dictating on 24 May 2007 was being forced upon councils then and there. I am advised that the letter the Premier referred to from May 2009 was an attempt by the council of mayors to negotiate the best position in the circumstances that they could, having had it forced upon them two years earlier by this Labor government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037622"></A>
I will now turn to some of the comments made by the Minister for Energy and Water Utilities during his second reading speech on this bill. The minister stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037624"></A>
The bulk water price contributes to the cost of the South East Queensland Water Grid. The state does not make a profit from the water grid ... The state will not even reach a break-even point until around 2017-18. In 2010-11 ... the Queensland government will make a loss of $480 million supplying water to council owned water businesses. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037625"></A>
We constantly hear allegations from those opposite of councils price gouging over water, of how the councils are supposedly ripping off the water consumer. Well, hearing that water consumers are apparently being ripped off by the councils for water and that the government is making losses of hundreds of millions of dollars from the water grid leads any clear-thinking person to come to one conclusion and one conclusion only--that this is an unadulterated shambles. It is just as well this Labor government’s ‘new era for water in South-East Queensland’ is not listed on the Stock Exchange, otherwise we would have ASIC knocking on the door.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037626"></A>
This Labor government legislated to turn the entire system of water storage, distribution and retailing upside down, and all it has achieved is to wreck a system that was working and working well. If I sit back and think about what has happened with water storage and supply in South-East Queensland over the last however many decades--and I can go back as far as you like--I do not ever remember hearing ratepayers complaining about how much they were paying for water. I cannot recall hearing the state Premier or a government minister accusing councils of price gouging or ripping off water consumers until recently, and let me tell you how recently. Water consumers started complaining about water prices as soon as water bills started hitting the mail boxes in July last year--the very month in which Labor’s ‘new era for water in South-East Queensland’ commenced. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037630"></A>
Once the Premier and the Minister for Energy and Water Utilities started feeling the heat from the electorate, the allegations of price gouging started. Now having messed it up completely, the minister is saying that the councils have been given a once-only opportunity to take back their water businesses into direct council operations if they can demonstrate that they can deliver water cheaper to their ratepayers than their distributor-retailers. This minister is trying to unscramble an egg. The government is proposing a system that will see some councils opt out of their distributor-retailers while other councils will remain shackled to them, and I fail to see how this can result in better outcomes for the water consumers of South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037633"></A>
Even when the councils decide, Labor’s interference will not stop there. The minister made it clear that if councils choose to opt out of their distributor-retailers then further legislation will be needed. The minister also said that ‘councils need to step up, listen to their community and take responsibility for water and wastewater prices’. Isn’t that wonderful? The water utilities minister claims he has listened and the Premier is also claiming to be listening. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037634"></A>
Well, as the sun was setting upon the arrival of those first water bills arising from the ‘new era for water in South-East Queensland’, my colleague the shadow Attorney-General and member for Kawana held a forum. The purpose of that forum was to engage the Sunshine Coast community regarding concerns over their water bills. About 450 people attended this forum. The minister was invited to attend this meeting and engage with the community, but so concerned was this Labor Minister for Water Utilities about listening to the community about water that he did not attend the forum, nor did he have a representative from his office attend the forum. Indeed, the Minister for Water Utilities was represented at the forum by an empty chair. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037637"></A>
Right from the outset there has been a pretence with this bill that it is somehow all part of the plan. This bill, according to the explanatory notes, is all part of Labor’s water reforms, which are now infamously known as Labor’s ‘new era for water in South-East Queensland’. In the explanatory notes, the very first sentence of the policy objectives states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037639"></A>
Stage Two of the South East Queensland (SEQ) water reform program, which commenced in July 2010, involved the separation of the distribution and retail functions for water and wastewater from the 10 SEQ local governments (Councils) and the establishment of three separate vertically integrated distribution-retail businesses (Distributor-retailers) under the South-East Queensland Water (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) Act 2009. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037640"></A>
This is stage 2. The government is pretending that its water reform plan is coming together as it was meant to. The truth is that Labor’s water reform was doomed to failure from day one and now the minister is still trying to unscramble that egg. One of the objectives of this bill is to amend--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037641"></A>
... the Queensland Competition Authority Act 1997 to provide for removing the price determination role of the Queensland Competition Authority (QCA) for water and wastewater prices charged by Distributor-retailers, that was to apply from 1 July 2013.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1037642"></A>
Indeed, the explanatory notes for the bill state--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037644"></A>
The removal of the QCA’s price determination role from 1 July 2013, ensures that Councils and their Distributor-retailers take hands-on responsibility and accountability for distribution and retail water and wastewater prices.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037645"></A>
Here is another dilemma for this state Labor government. I am sure you can recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, as my colleagues over here and I can recall and, most importantly, the water consumers and voters of Queensland can recall--and even those opposite can recall this--that this Minister for Energy and Water Utilities has advocated the role of the independent regulator, the Queensland Competition Authority, in pricing water and even electricity. The minister has always done the old hospital pass to the independent regulator: ‘Don’t blame us. We’re only the government.’ This minister consistently refers to the independence of the Queensland Competition Authority--and, indeed, independence should be the case. However, I have in my possession a document signed by the minister dated 9 February this year. This document is addressed to the chairman of the Queensland Competition Authority. What is this document? It is a direction notice from the minister--a notice directing the Queensland Competition Authority to investigate grid service charges for South-East Queensland grid service providers to apply for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012. This minister can hardly claim that the Queensland Competition Authority is completely independent when he issues direction notices to it. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DICKSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I hope it did not hurt. But with the heat on from the electorate, which associates the Queensland Competition Authority with the government, the minister has had a thought bubble and decided that the best tactic is to take the government funded Queensland Competition Authority out of the equation when it comes to pricing retail water. Sadly, the minister thinks the public is stupid enough to fall for it. The government admits through this bill that the residential water bill, which includes both state bulk water costs and distribution, retail water and wastewater charges-- </Hansard-Body>

I introduce the Appropriation Bill for the Legislative Assembly and parliamentary service, which provides appropriation for the 2011-12 Budget. The Bill combines both the appropriation for the 2011-12 Budget and the supplementary appropriation for 2009-10 for unforeseen expenditure in the Consolidated Fund Financial Report.</Hansard-Body>

The Appropriation (Parliament) Bill will provide the necessary funds to ensure the continued operations of the Legislative Assembly and parliamentary service. These include advisory and information services to assist the Parliament, its Committees and Members to fulfil their constitutional and parliamentary responsibilities, the services provided by the Parliamentary Library, Committee Office, Parliamentary Reporting Service, Chamber and Procedural Services, and Security and Attendant Services as well as the provision of accommodation, hospitality and Members’ entitlements. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1043126"></A>
Mr Speaker, Queensland is about to prove the doubters wrong once again.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043127"></A>
This State Budget puts us right back where we belong--out in front.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043128"></A>
It is a Budget fuelled by reconstruction, but defined by optimism and opportunity.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043129"></A>
It provides the architecture for recovery--the recovery of local communities, and the recovery of our economy--as we rocket back to our rightful place out in front of the rest of the nation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043130"></A>
Nothing beats Queensland, Mr Speaker. And this Budget proves the point.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043131"></A>
We’ve seen off the best the world can throw at us.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043132"></A>
Looked fear in the eye and never blinked.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043133"></A>
Queenslanders have stood their ground, and now the horizon stretches out before us.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043134"></A>
It is ours for the taking.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043135"></A>
This State Budget continues our enduring task--to confront change with courage, to shape a better, fairer and more prosperous Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043136"></A>
Today I present a Budget that speaks of who we are, and who we can be.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043137"></A>
It marches back towards surplus.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043138"></A>
It books the billions of dollars from our reform program.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043139"></A>
It meets the gigantic task of funding our reconstruction program, and it invests in a future we must grasp.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043140"></A>
It is, like us, confident about Queensland’s future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1043141"></A>
<Hansard-Bold>
An Economy hit by Natural Disasters</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043142"></A>
Our community and our economy were hit hard by the natural disasters, and indeed the wet weather which preceded the floods.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043143"></A>
Our state has been smashed first by the brute and inhuman forces of global economics and then by the fury of Mother Nature.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043144"></A>
Through it all our confidence in our resilience, our fundamental strengths, our capacity to stand our ground and fight on has sustained us.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043145"></A>
The weather has cruelled exports in particular--in fact the Budget records the first ever annual contraction in overseas exports on record.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043146"></A>
Never before in our history have we had to confront such a comprehensive wipe-out in our exports.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043147"></A>
Exports had been contributing positively to growth in 2010.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043148"></A>
Queensland is an export economy. Even during the depths of the global financial crisis, exports were a solid contributor to the state’s growth.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043149"></A>
The wet weather was already impeding exports during the last part of 2010 before smashing them at the start of 2011.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043150"></A>
Overseas exports of goods had their largest fall on record of 18% for the quarter to March this year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043151"></A>
In the end we have finished on the canvas, with economic growth wiped out for the financial year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043152"></A>
Our traditional strengths, mining, agriculture and tourism, all took a beating.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043153"></A>
Lost production in the mining industry is estimated to total nearly $6 billion in 2010-11, with coal exports to be around 27 million tonnes lower.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043154"></A>
Agricultural losses totalled $1.4 billion--with sugar, cotton, bananas and avocados the hardest hit.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043155"></A>
The toll for tourism from the natural disasters in terms of lost export revenue is around $400 million.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043156"></A>
The Budget has had to absorb the losses consequent from the lost production in these industries, and across the economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043157"></A>
This has hit the bottom line--hard.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043158"></A>
This summer’s natural disasters have cost Queenslanders dearly.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043159"></A>
Many paid with their lives, their livelihoods, and many lost not just their houses, but their homes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043160"></A>
The human cost will be forever incalculable.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043161"></A>
The fiscal cost is stark too--$6.8 billion. This allocation is being met by the State and the federal government under our nation’s established natural disaster cost-sharing arrangements.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043162"></A>
Funds for local councils will now total $2.75 billion. As Councils have gone about making their full assessments, their estimated claim to the state has increased by $900 million.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043163"></A>
The costs for rebuilding our road network stand at $2.9 billion--with an extraordinary 9,170 kilometres of the state controlled network damaged.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043164"></A>
The tally of the natural disasters goes beyond the costs or expenditure required--it’s not just that more spending has been required to fund recovery, it’s the fact that less has been coming in due to the loss of production.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043165"></A>
Coal royalties are expected to be nearly $500 million below the original budget forecast.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043201"></A>
Stamp duty from the property market is down nearly $350 million from the original budget forecast.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043204"></A>
Gambling and land taxes are also slightly down from Budget.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043205"></A>
These costs are hitting the Budget bottom line, along with the increase in outlays as we fund the reconstruction effort.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043206"></A>
As a result the operating balance for this financial year is set to record deficit of $2.13 billion and is forecast to be $4.06 billion for 2011-12.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043207"></A>
Mr Speaker, despite these huge challenges the government has maintained its fiscal reform program and it’s a good thing we did.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043208"></A>
While costs from the natural disaster have risen since the Mid-Year Review, and the impact on the economy is greater, the deficits across the forward estimates are lower.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043209"></A>
The deficits in 2012-13 and 2013-14 are forecast to be around half the Mid-Year Review forecast.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043210"></A>
As a result, the aggregate deficits forecast are now a third lower than at the time of the Mid-Year Review.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043211"></A>
Disaster recovery costs were estimated at $5 billion at the Mid-Year Review, and they are now $6.8 billion--but despite this the Budget I present today has lower deficits.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043212"></A>
Debt this financial year will now be $17.5 billion lower than forecast at the start of the reform program I announced in the 2009-10 State Budget.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043213"></A>
Mr Speaker, </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043214"></A>
The Budget is marching back towards surplus.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043215"></A>
It would not be doing so without the benefit of the fiscal reform program I set out two years ago.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043216"></A>
This is a budget that carries the burden from natural disasters--but it’s not burdened by the cost of repairing coal railway lines or buying new coal wagons.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043217"></A>
It is however enjoying the benefits of our retained shareholding in the new QR National that is worth around $700 million more since it listed in 2010.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043218"></A>
The decision to float QR National--a decision we had the courage to make and the fortitude to implement--has seen the wealth of Queenslanders increase by $700 million since November.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043219"></A>
Our reform program has enabled us to absorb the massive hit from the natural disasters and maintain our commitment to deliver the budget back into surplus.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043220"></A>
Mr Speaker, despite the natural disasters, this State Budget keeps us on track to deliver a budget surplus in 2015-16.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1043221"></A>
<Hansard-Bold>
The Economic Road Ahead</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043222"></A>
Ultimately the resilience of our current economic recovery is astounding.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043223"></A>
Throughout the year we saw incredible resilience in the building strength of business investment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043224"></A>
Our economic strategy saw us deliberately step in to support activity and support growth as the GFC took hold, funding an infrastructure program to keep people in jobs and build for the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043225"></A>
This strategy was about sustaining our economy as we worked to bring business investment back to the state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043226"></A>
Mr Speaker, business investment is back and it’s back in a big way.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043227"></A>
Business investment grew by an estimated 13% this financial year--bouncing straight back off the canvas. This impressive result exceeded the 9% forecast last year--a forecast doubted by some.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043228"></A>
It is miles ahead of the national result which stood at 4.5%.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043229"></A>
While the rains pounded down, and others talked it down, business was voting with confidence in the future of our economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043230"></A>
And it is not about to stop.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043231"></A>
Money talks Mr Speaker, and business is speaking loudly, rising above the din of the nay-sayers and the agenda-runners.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043232"></A>
A massive investment surge is about to hit the Queensland economy and propel it into a new era of prosperity.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043233"></A>
Business investment in the coming year is forecast to increase by an astounding 27%, and remain above 21% the year after.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043234"></A>
No other state comes close--our competition in Western Australia is forecasting only 15% growth in investment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043235"></A>
This sets the stage for business investment to account for more than one fifth of our economy--the highest share on record.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043236"></A>
The value of our exports will increase by 10% in the coming year, and, Mr Speaker, we are about to turn the corner in our housing market.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043237"></A>
Economic growth for 2011-12 is forecast at 5%, and then 5.25% in the following year as this new era of investment ushers in new jobs and a broad-based expansion.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043238"></A>
This puts the projected growth in the Queensland economy at the front of the pack for next year, where we belong at Number 1.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043239"></A>
Unemployment will be driven lower as jobs growth climbs above 3%, bringing more people back into the labour force.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043240"></A>
We are on track to deliver 100,000 new jobs this term--just like we said we would.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043241"></A>
In fact, this Budget forecasts combined jobs growth of 140,000 jobs over the next two years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043242"></A>
Our economy is set for a massive jobs bonanza.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043243"></A>
We--today--are in the middle of a huge economic turnaround.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043244"></A>
It’s a massive opportunity being led by our natural resource wealth.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043245"></A>
At the forefront is LNG--as significant an economic development as the opening of the Bowen Basin in the 1970s.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043246"></A>
Ten years ago an LNG industry in this state was unimaginable.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043247"></A>
Five years ago it was unbankable.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043248"></A>
Today it is reality--generating jobs, regional prosperity, and delivering cleaner, greener energy for the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043249"></A>
Our world-first CSG to LNG export industry is helping power our region. Electricity produced from LNG in Queensland is up to 70% cleaner than that produced from brown coal in Victoria.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043250"></A>
It is 50% cleaner than the electricity produced from black coal.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043251"></A>
It’s subject to some of the toughest regulations in the world and is producing energy that means less carbon emissions--it is an industry of the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043252"></A>
And its genesis is right here in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043253"></A>
Bringing it to reality is a massive achievement--today more than $40 billion of investment is forecast in LNG.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043254"></A>
Already it forms more than 15% of the energy mix used for electricity in Queensland--in fact, more than 10% of electricity in Queensland has been produced from gas since 2005.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043255"></A>
The investment in our resources, in LNG, in coal, and in metals is leading the investment boom in our state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043256"></A>
This is the dynamic that has the Reserve Bank with its finger on the trigger. They see the investment boom coursing through the veins of our state, and of WA and running through the Australian economy as a whole.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043257"></A>
The Co-ordinator General has more than $55 billion worth of projects on their books as businesses are rushing to purchase a piece of the action.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043258"></A>
The Budget includes a $15 billion building program, investing in future infrastructure as well as funding reconstruction--but just as importantly leaving room for the investment surge being driven by the private sector.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043259"></A>
It is an investment that stacks up in size against the capital works program of WA and Victoria combined!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043260"></A>
At present we are in an economic step-change, and economic policies need to respond.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043261"></A>
This Budget comprehends those challenges, and puts in place a policy program to meet the task ahead.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1043262"></A>
<Hansard-Bold>
Housing Market Reform</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043263"></A>
Mr Speaker, </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043264"></A>
It’s more than a two speed economy, and there is no doubt housing has been in the slow lane.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043265"></A>
While underlying demand is set to drive a recovery in dwelling investment, the immediate outlook remains challenging.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043266"></A>
Housing markets in Australia have been challenged by supply side dynamics.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043267"></A>
That’s why I abolished mortgage duty in full and stamp duty for all first home buyers purchasing a home under $500,000 in my first Budget.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043268"></A>
That nation leading reform was about getting young people into the housing market.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043269"></A>
We led the nation on capping the first home owner grant to those who needed it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043270"></A>
Then we increased the benefits to first home buyers who wanted to purchase their own vacant land and build a new home.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043271"></A>
These remain some of my proudest reforms--helping young Queenslanders into the housing market is an enduring goal for me.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043272"></A>
The housing industry needs a boost Mr Speaker.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043273"></A>
Queensland needs more homes to be built.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043274"></A>
Young Queenslanders in particular could do with a hand in cracking into the housing market.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043275"></A>
And Mr Speaker we are going to act.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043276"></A>
Today I announce a bold plan to deliver a massive $140 million Queensland Building Boost program.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043277"></A>
For six months from 1 August this year, any Queenslander buying a newly constructed home or signing a contract to build a new home will be eligible for a $10,000 grant from the State Government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043278"></A>
This will stimulate activity, promote supply and support jobs in the housing industry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043279"></A>
For first home buyers this can mean $17,000--up-front. They will also pay zero stamp duty for properties under $500,000, zero mortgage duty and thus keep the full $17,000 from the $10,000 boost announced today being added to our existing $7,000 grant.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043280"></A>
The $10,000 will apply across the board to all buyers of new homes under $600,000:</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043281"></A>
... growing families wanting to build a new home,</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043282"></A>
... investors looking to purchase a new property,</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043283"></A>
... workers looking to build a property in the growth hotspots around regional Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043284"></A>
This program is targeted and time limited. It is not about churn, it is about adding new homes to our existing stock.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043285"></A>
It’s not about millionaires building mansions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043286"></A>
It’s about helping make the great Australian dream a reality for thousands of Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043287"></A>
Mr Speaker, we are about giving a hand to those who need it most.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043288"></A>
That’s what we stand for.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043289"></A>
For some, home ownership is not an option.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043290"></A>
That’s why we are also injecting more than $93 million over five years into the National Rental Affordability Scheme that will deliver over 11,300 dwellings.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043291"></A>
An allocation of $60 million from the Future Growth Fund will support the delivery of nearly 200 homes this year for those Queenslanders who are most in need under our social housing program.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043292"></A>
These commitments will build a supply of homes available at a discount to the market rate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043293"></A>
Mr Speaker, </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043294"></A>
Just as so many have been locked out of the Australian housing market, so too have some benefited.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043295"></A>
Existing home owners have enjoyed the wealth of the surging home prices of the last decade.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043296"></A>
As prices have risen, incumbent owners have benefitted while those outside the market have found it harder to break into home ownership.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043297"></A>
It’s a well-known story: those in the market look to trade up with the benefit of the increased value in their home.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043298"></A>
Currently this group of people get access to a special discount on stamp duty when they purchase a new home.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043299"></A>
No other state in Australia provides this level of discount, and the government has decided that it should no longer apply in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043300"></A>
However Mr Speaker, in doing so, we will ensure that we continue to have the lowest stamp duty rates for all homes in the mainland States of Australia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047575"></A>
In fact Mr Speaker we will maintain the cheapest stamp duty rates of all States--save only for those purchasing properties worth more than around $950,000 in Tasmania, if there are any.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047576"></A>
Average house prices have increased more than 200% since 2000 and more than 40% since 2005.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047577"></A>
The policy case for maintaining this discount in 2011 is not compelling. The discount does not add to the supply of houses, which is what really matters if we want our kids to be able to afford their own homes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047578"></A>
I announce the discount will end on 1 August--providing notice for those in the market at present.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047579"></A>
Removing the discount and implementing a stimulus measure to support new houses being built is a choice we are prepared to make.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047580"></A>
Mr Speaker, I must remind the House that first home buyers will continue to get the benefit of zero stamp duty for homes under $500,000.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047581"></A>
Everyone purchasing a new home after the 1st of August, and entitled to the $10,000 Queensland Building Boost Grant, will be better off after these reforms.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047582"></A>
These initiatives go to the core of this government’s policy commitments:</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047583"></A>
... we stand for helping those who haven’t had the surge in wealth enjoyed by so many in the last decade,</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047584"></A>
... we stand for helping more Queenslanders into the housing market,</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047585"></A>
... we stand for helping young Queenslanders getting a start in life,</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047586"></A>
... we stand for providing a home for those for whom home ownership is beyond reach,</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047587"></A>
and we are prepared to make the strong policy choices. We are prepared to make these changes so we can help Queenslanders who need a hand.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1047588"></A>
<Hansard-Bold>
A Helping Hand ...</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047589"></A>
During the golden era of Australian prosperity the income gap has grown wider, not narrower.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047590"></A>
Wealth has not been shared equally during the last decade. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047591"></A>
Those on low and fixed incomes are doing it harder.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047592"></A>
Today we maintain our position at the front of the pack when it comes to providing help to those who need a hand with the cost of living.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047593"></A>
Today I announce we will go further.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047594"></A>
Our pensioners deserve our support, and that’s why this Budget will increase the maximum pensioner local government rates subsidy paid by the State by 11 percent to $200 per annum.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047595"></A>
We will also increase our allocation for the subsidy scheme for pensioners and seniors for their electricity costs to $115.6 million this year, to increase the subsidy to $230 dollars for their electricity bills.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047596"></A>
We will increase the subsidy for pensioners in the SEQ Water Grid to $120.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047597"></A>
Mr Speaker,</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047598"></A>
Our decision to end the stamp duty discount regime means we can help out households with their day to day bills.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047599"></A>
I announce that from 1 July we will abolish the ambulance levy on electricity bills.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047600"></A>
This delivers a saving of $113 to around 1.4 million electricity bills across the state which would otherwise have faced paying this surcharge in the year ahead.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047601"></A>
Rising electricity prices are a challenge for all governments--the best way we can assist is by removing this charge, in full, once and for all.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047602"></A>
The government will instead meet the full costs of running the ambulance service--providing free ambulance cover for all Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047603"></A>
The ambulance will always be there for Queenslanders Mr Speaker, but now the bill won’t be.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047604"></A>
This will provide benefits not only to households and families, but to small businesses and community groups, sporting clubs and body corporates.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047605"></A>
The levy is regressive and adds to the cost of electricity bills. As a flat rate surcharge it’s a greater impost to lower income earners than it is to millionaires.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047606"></A>
As of 1 July, it will be no more.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047607"></A>
This Budget also funds a $60 million extension to the ClimateSmart Home Service to help Queenslanders reduce their energy consumption, electricity bills and carbon footprint.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047608"></A>
This service delivers savings of up to $480 per annum for households.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047609"></A>
These initiatives deliver for those who could do with a hand--our pensioners, those on lower incomes and those households struggling to make ends meet.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>

Investing in the future</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047611"></A>
Mr Speaker,</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047612"></A>
We do stand on the launch pad of a new era of prosperity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047613"></A>
Our economic future is being reshaped right now.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047614"></A>
We must move with the times and position ourselves for the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047615"></A>
Standing still is never an option.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047616"></A>
A strong Aussie dollar is a likely fixture in that future landscape.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047617"></A>
Increased competition from our neighbours, and increased demand from our neighbours will inform the economic reality of the 21st century.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047618"></A>
Investing in our human capital--in education and innovation is a must. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047619"></A>
Labor in Government has transformed our education system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047620"></A>
Since introducing our “learning or earning” initiative in 2006, the proportion of young people with a Year 12 or vocational education qualification has increased to 88%.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047621"></A>
We have invested in school based apprenticeships as we create the next generation of skilled workers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047622"></A>
This Budget extends the 125% payroll tax rebate for apprentices and trainees at a cost of $15 million--this will support more than 2,000 Queensland businesses that employ apprentices and trainees.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047623"></A>
We have delivered a whole new year of schooling in Queensland--the Prep Year--and are rolling out 240 kindergartens across Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047624"></A>
This commitment continues this year with $75 million for further kindies. There will be 23 new services by the end of 2011 and another 85 services by the end of 2012.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047625"></A>
It is this Premier who has driven those reforms, and it is this Premier who is driving the next wave of reform.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047626"></A>
This Budget continues Labor’s comprehensive modernisation of our education system with the funding to transition Year Seven into secondary school.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047627"></A>
More than $328 million is allocated for building works and new classrooms at state schools as well as further allocations for new teachers and teacher training as part of the Government’s Flying Start initiative.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047628"></A>
More than $80 million has been budgeted to assist the non-state sector to make the change. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047629"></A>
Mr Speaker,</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047630"></A>
This government is committed to investing in education--it’s an investment in our future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047631"></A>
Labor’s investment in education is delivering to Queensland an education system for the 21st century. An education system Queenslanders deserve.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047632"></A>
We are investing in the skills of tomorrow, in the brains, knowledge and capacity of the next generation of Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047633"></A>
We do so knowing that we must look to a future where we export the power of our ideas, not just the energy of hydrocarbons.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047634"></A>
The Smart State investment should only ever have been described one way--as an investment in the jobs of the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047635"></A>
Today we renew our investment and our commitment to research, innovation and the ideas that will power our future economy with a $100 million allocation, including $85 million from the Future Growth Fund ... to do just that, fund our future growth.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047636"></A>
We will invest in our universities, in our world class research facilities, and the world class researchers working in them, in innovation efforts by business, in the products of the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047637"></A>
These funds will also invest in our efforts to expand international education exports--vital for our state and for the future of our universities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047638"></A>
This investment is made possible by the earnings of the fund since its establishment in 2007.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047639"></A>
Despite the difficult times, this investment was quarantined and now we are using its earnings to re-invest in our future economic success.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047640"></A>
This is what good governments do.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047641"></A>
Mr Speaker,</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047642"></A>
Our tourism industry has also been doing it tough.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047643"></A>
Earlier this year we stepped in together with the federal government to provide a $10 million injection to support tourism jobs. Additional investment in this budget brings that total to $13 million.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047644"></A>
More needs to be done, and we are acting to secure a long term future for our state’s tourism industry as a major employer.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047645"></A>
The competition is heating up and today I announce that we are stepping up with an $85 million commitment for major events over five years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047646"></A>
This funding will give Events Queensland the firepower to get into the marketplace to secure new events and new tourism drawcards for our state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047647"></A>
Event-based tourism is a key to our future and we are backing it with a massive commitment in this State Budget.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047648"></A>
Our natural beauty has long been a drawcard for our tourists and we will continue our investment in the environment, with $28.6 million to secure Stradbroke Island’s future as a national park and green tourism magnet.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047649"></A>
We believe in Straddie’s future, and we are prepared to act for its future and the future generations who deserve to enjoy its uniqueness.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047650"></A>
We do so in the tradition of Labor. We are prepared to act for the future of our environment, to tackling climate change and to facing up to the economic reality of resource scarcity.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1047651"></A>
<Hansard-Bold>
Investing in a fairer Queensland</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047652"></A>
Mr Speaker, the Budget delivers on an agenda to make a difference for all Queensland families.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047653"></A>
Abolishing the ambulance levy and giving extra support to pensioners are aimed at giving a hand to those who need it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047654"></A>
There are a group of people who deserve our support, and this budget makes further commitments to Queenslanders with a disability and their families.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047655"></A>
$7.4 million will help young Queenslanders with a disability as they make the often difficult transition from school or the child protection system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047656"></A>
We are investing in helping troubled youth through our youth justice initiative and expanding help for domestic violence sufferers, especially in indigenous communities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047657"></A>
No-one should live in fear, regardless of their kin, regardless of their skin colour.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047658"></A>
That’s what a Labor Government believes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047659"></A>
We also believe in the power of opportunity for all. So we will fund the continuation of the Families Responsibilities Commission through to 2013 to make sure young Queenslanders in those indigenous communities get the chance to be all that they can be.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047660"></A>
That’s what a Labor Government believes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047661"></A>
And we will continue our investment in health. The budget contains a record allocation to health of nearly $11.1 billion.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047662"></A>
We are building the hospitals of the future, for our future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047663"></A>
This year’s health capital works program is a massive $1.8 billion as we roll out the nation’s largest hospital building program, with works currently underway in Cairns, Mt Isa, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton, Gold Coast, Brisbane and to commence this year on the Sunshine Coast and Ipswich.</Hansard-Body>

Conclusion</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051738"></A>
Mr Speaker, </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051739"></A>
We are about to be part of an enormous economic expansion, built upon the courage of reform.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051740"></A>
In each Budget of the Bligh Government we have made great strides--many of them hard yards--to remake and reform our State’s finances and its economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051741"></A>
We have done so as a team united in our purpose and united behind strong leadership.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051742"></A>
We’ve shown the courage to overhaul the state’s balance sheet, choosing to invest in new passenger trains and let the private sector shell out for new coal trains, choosing new National Parks over running a commercial timber business. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051743"></A>
Choosing jobs, not cuts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051744"></A>
Choosing the future, not defending the past.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051745"></A>
Promoting opportunity, not defending privilege.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051746"></A>
Mr Speaker,</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051747"></A>
This Budget makes choices--it doesn’t pretend that there aren’t always choices to be made. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051748"></A>
It reflects the choices of a Labor Government--as each of this Government’s budgets has done.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051749"></A>
Beyond the noisiness of the here and now, these choices will echo into the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051750"></A>
Beware the rush to judgment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051751"></A>
We have acted in extraordinary times, with extraordinary courage and extraordinary unity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051752"></A>
We do so with a clear focus on what Labor stands for--jobs ... the dignity of work.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051753"></A>
The jobs we saved, the jobs we protected ... </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051754"></A>
... the jobs we are creating.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051755"></A>
... the families our budget decisions have sustained, the hopes, dreams and aspirations at many kitchen tables we preserved because we had the courage to look into the future, the fortitude to act, and a unity of purpose--jobs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051756"></A>
This government demonstrated it had the courage to confront the past in order to confront the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051757"></A>
We looked then as we do now to a Queensland that can’t be stopped ... a prosperity that cannot be denied.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051758"></A>
Smashed this year by nature’s full fury, our will tested, our resilience tested--we have withstood it all.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051759"></A>
Where else but Queensland could you have seen business investment continue despite the state taking such a pounding from Mother Nature.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051760"></A>
That tells you everything you need to know. We believe in ourselves, as Queenslanders, and in our future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051761"></A>
Earlier this year, many people rediscovered the true spirit, the essence of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051762"></A>
It is a magic place, a place of optimism and opportunity.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051763"></A>
This century is ours for the taking.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051764"></A>
With courage, anything is possible.</Hansard-Body>

The Community Ambulance Cover Levy Repeal and Revenue and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 repeals the Community Ambulance Cover Act 2003 and amends the Duties Act 2001, Land Tax Act 2010 and Payroll Tax Act 1971 to give effect to the 2011-12 State Budget initiatives. The Community Ambulance Cover levy collected through electricity accounts is to be abolished on 1 July 2011, delivering a direct saving of $113 to most Queensland households. Abolition of the Community Ambulance Cover levy will not affect Queensland’s free ambulance service. Queenslanders will continue to receive free ambulance services anywhere in Australia. </Hansard-Body>

I seek leave to have the remainder of my second reading speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>

<A ID="pgfId-1051785"></A>
Leave granted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051786"></A>
A number of other beneficial changes are included in the bill, including extension of land tax land value capping arrangements. Under these arrangements, the increase in the value on which land tax is levied is limited to 50 per cent of the value that applied for the previous year. These capping arrangements have applied for the previous four financial years and are being extended for 2011-12. This will assist many land taxpayers, including those who may have experienced an increase in their land values as a result of the change to site value.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051787"></A>
The 25 per cent payroll tax rebate on wages paid to apprentices and trainees is also being extended for a further year to 30 June 2012. The rebate, currently due to expire on 30 June 2011, applies to wages paid to trainees and apprentices which are already exempt under the <Hansard-Italic>
Payroll Tax Act 1971</Hansard-Italic>
 and is allowed as an offset against an employer’s payroll tax liability. The extension of the rebate demonstrates the Government’s continued commitment to skills development in Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051788"></A>
Returning to the aspects of the Bill which abolishes the CAC levy, it should be noted the levy liability accrued for electricity account periods up to 30 June 2011 will continue to be imposed and collected in the ordinary way by electricity retailers. This means that electricity customers will see a levy amount in their electricity accounts after 30 June as the levy accruing before that date is billed. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051789"></A>
Electricity retailers and other electricity providers may take time to adjust their systems and business processes for this change. To protect consumers, the Bill provides that, if an electricity account is incorrectly issued with a levy amount for an account period on or after 1 July 2011, the amount is not payable by the customer. If the customer pays the amount, the electricity retailer or electricity provider must refund the amount or provide a credit against the next account. A further protection is that, from 1 January 2012, anyone who incorrectly bills a levy amount for a post 30 June period will commit an offence.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051790"></A>
To ensure timely winding up of levy arrangements, the period for claiming refunds of overpaid levies is being limited, other than for review and appeal decisions. Refund claims must be made before 1 July 2012.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051791"></A>
Mr Speaker, the Government recognises the difficulties being experienced by the housing construction industry in Queensland and announced an important assistance measure as part of the 2011-12 State Budget. The Queensland Building Boost Grant will provide a grant of $10,000 for six months from 1 August 2011 for all purchasers of newly constructed houses, townhouses and units valued at less than $600,000. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051792"></A>
The Queensland Building Boost Grant commences on 1 August 2011 and will be available until 31 January 2012. People entering into a building contract from 1 August to build a home, and owner builders who commence construction of a home from that date, are also eligible where they satisfy the scheme’s requirements. There will be time limits on when construction of the new home must commence and when it must be completed.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051793"></A>
The boost is about adding to the housing stock overall, so there are no requirements for the purchaser to live in the home themselves, with the grant being available for home buyers and investors alike. However, the grant will not be available for a builder who is building the home to sell. Rather, the purchaser may claim the grant. In addition, a person may claim more than one grant when purchasing separate new homes but, as the grant applies for new homes, only one grant can be claimed for a particular home. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051794"></A>
The Queensland Building Boost Grant will operate under administrative arrangements pending passage of legislation. The Office of State Revenue will be publishing information on its website to assist prospective purchasers understand how the scheme will operate, and is liaising with the Queensland Law Society and financial institutions regarding implementation from 1 August.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051795"></A>
At the same time that the Queensland Building Boost Grant commences, the transfer duty home concession for non-first home buyers will be discontinued. Anyone entering into a contract to purchase a home before that date will continue to receive the concession, subject to satisfying the eligibility requirements. No similar concession is currently provided by any other State. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051796"></A>
The Bill also implements the beneficial changes to transfer duty rates announced as part of the 2011-12 Budget initiatives. These changes ensure that transfer duty payable on a home remains lower in Queensland than under the standard rate in any other mainland State. These rate changes reduce the duty payable for properties valued between $75,000 and $540,000, saving up to $600 for transactions in this range. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051797"></A>
First home buyers will continue to pay no transfer duty for homes valued up to $500,000. Presently, there is a reducing duty rebate for first home buyers which cuts out at $550,000. This Bill will adjust the rebate arrangements by extending the cut off point to $600,000. Those buying first homes valued at $600,000 or more will pay transfer duty at the same rates that apply for all other purchasers. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051798"></A>
Purchasers of vacant land on which a first home will be built will continue to receive a full rebate of transfer duty on land valued up to $250,000, with the rebate phasing out at $400,000.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051799"></A>
Mr Speaker, the introduction of the Queensland Building Bonus Grant provides a real incentive for Queenslanders to buy that home they’ve been thinking about. It is particularly beneficial for those entering the market for the first time as they may qualify for the Queensland Building Bonus Grant on top of the First Home Owners Grant of $7,000 and the first home buyer transfer duty concession when purchasing a new home valued under $600,000.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051800"></A>
As announced in the in the Mid Year Fiscal and Economic Review 2010-11, the Bill also includes amendments to the <Hansard-Italic>
Duties Act 2001</Hansard-Italic>
 which will, from 1 July 2011, align Queensland’s land rich duty provisions to a landholder model. These changes will ensure simplified rules and reduce the scope for transactions to be structured to avoid the current arrangements. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051801"></A>
The Duties Act 2001 is to be amended to remove the 60 per cent land rich test so that landholder duty will apply to an acquisition of 50 per cent or more of an unlisted corporation holding land in Queensland worth $2 million. Duty will continue to apply in relation to the land of both the landholder and its subsidiaries. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051802"></A>
In addition, the <Hansard-Italic>
Duties Act 2001</Hansard-Italic>
 is to be amended to include listed corporations and listed unit trusts in the landholder provisions so that landholder duty will apply to an acquisition of 90 per cent or more of a listed corporation or listed unit trust holding land in Queensland worth $2 million. Similar to arrangements in New South Wales, landholder duty in these cases will be charged at a concessional rate of 10 per cent of the duty that would otherwise apply to the transfer of all the landholdings of the landholder.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051803"></A>
The extension of landholder duty to takeovers of listed corporations and listed unit trusts will improve equity with similar transactions for unlisted entities. Duty presently does not apply to the takeover of listed entities but can apply for unlisted entities.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051804"></A>
No changes are being made to existing transfer duty arrangements for unlisted trusts.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The move to landholder duty will closer align Queensland’s arrangements with landholder duty applying in the majority of other jurisdictions including New South Wales, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. South Australia is also adopting landholder duty from 1 July 2011 and Victoria has announced it will do so from 1 July 2012.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

While the changes are expected to raise approximately $30 million per annum from 2011-12 from transactions presently falling outside the system, this is not a revenue raising measure. It is about ensuring our system is robust, reducing red tape and continuing to more closely harmonise Queensland’s duty arrangements with those in the majority of other jurisdictions.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

As also announced in the Mid Year Fiscal and Economic Review 2010-11, responsibility for royalty administration will transfer from the Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation to OSR on 1 July 2011. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051808"></A>
Recognising the principles of good governance and accountability, which support a separation of responsibility for industry regulation and administration of the revenues payable by that industry, OSR will be responsible for all royalty administration activities including processing royalty returns and payments, compliance activities, public determinations, and policy and legislation issues relating to day-to-day royalty administration.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051809"></A>
DEEDI will retain responsibility for a number of broader royalty policy issues in consultation with Treasury. In its role as industry regulator, DEEDI will continue to have responsibility for other matters relating to Queensland’s resources industry, including tenure administration and collection of statistical information.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051810"></A>
This transfer of responsibility will mean that royalty information will no longer be obtained by DEEDI in the administration of the <Hansard-Italic>
Mineral Resources Act 1989</Hansard-Italic>
 or the <Hansard-Italic>
Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004</Hansard-Italic>
. However, DEEDI will continue to require access to this information for its administration of other aspects of the legislation, such as regulatory matters and tenure administration. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051811"></A>
This Bill will amend the confidentiality provisions of these Acts to allow the provision of information to DEEDI as required, and to address other issues with the current provisions. The confidentiality provisions have been modelled on those in the <Hansard-Italic>
Taxation Administration Act 2001</Hansard-Italic>
, which apply for the other revenue legislation administered by OSR, including ensuring appropriate safeguards for the disclosure and use of personal confidential information. The new confidentiality provisions distinguish between personal confidential information and other confidential information and balance the need to protect confidential information while also allowing its disclosure in appropriate circumstances. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051812"></A>
Another amendment will ensure that a person does not breach the <Hansard-Italic>
Mineral Resources Act 1989</Hansard-Italic>
 where they lodge a royalty return with, or make a royalty payment to, OSR despite a requirement to the contrary in the Act. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051813"></A>
The Bill will also amend the <Hansard-Italic>
Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004</Hansard-Italic>
 and the <Hansard-Italic>
Mineral Resources Act 1989</Hansard-Italic>
. These Acts both contain provisions for applying for a petroleum, coal or oil shale lease where there is overlapping tenure. Currently, both acts require separate applications to be made where a potential lease would cover both land that is tenured for the alternative resource and untenured land, or would cover areas of tenured land that are held by separate entities. These amendments would remove the requirement for separate applications in these instances and thus will streamline the tenure application system under both Acts.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051814"></A>
The Bill also includes an amendment to the <Hansard-Italic>
Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004</Hansard-Italic>
 in relation to the construction of CSG water pipelines across multiple petroleum leases in order to transport untreated water for treatment and to transport treated water for beneficial use. The amendment will aid efficient water transport while maintaining existing environmental standards. For an area of land which is not subject to a petroleum lease, the CSG producer will require a development approval under the <Hansard-Italic>
Sustainable Planning Act 2009</Hansard-Italic>
.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Some minor amendments to improve tenure application processes under these Acts are also proposed by this Bill. These amendments will not affect the need for an application to meet any of the other requirements under other relevant acts. They do not impose any additional requirements on applicants, nor do they affect the obligations of the applicant to negotiate with land holders or overlapping tenure holders. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
