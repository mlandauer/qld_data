Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.32 am): Our government is meeting the challenge of the state’s growing infrastructure needs head-on. Last year our $18.2 billion capital building program was the largest in Queensland’s history. In this budget we have again committed to the strongest infrastructure program in Australia with an investment of $17.1 billion. That is an extra investment that translates to 106,000 jobs and it means that we can build projects right across Queensland and, in some cases, such as the Springfield railway line, build them two years ahead of schedule. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998403"></A>
Our building program has a strong track record. Over the last 12 months much has been accomplished and there is more to come. What we have seen in the last 12 months alone includes the opening of the duplication of the Gateway bridges, now the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges, which will be remembered by a generation of Queenslanders. It was delivered six months early. The bridge and the associated motorway upgrades will make a massive difference to travel times and congestion.</Hansard-Body>

 With no money from John Howard despite being National Highway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998499"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the Deputy Premier: without so much as a dollar from the Howard government despite the fact that this is National Highway. Nearly 200,000 Queenslanders walked the bridge during the community open day on May 16. In the last 12 months Queensland has seen the completion of the $385 million Bruce Highway upgrade providing additional lanes from the Gateway Motorway to Caboolture and the $824 million Ipswich Motorway upgrade from Wacol to Darra. These are huge multibillion dollar projects but even they are dwarfed by the multibillion dollar Airport Link project. Just weeks ago the largest cutting head of the largest tunnel boring machine ever to operate in Australia was lowered into its launch pad. The scale of construction on Airport Link is breathtaking. I thank local residents for their patience as this vital project is constructed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998656"></A>
In the last year we have also marked the completion of stages of both the Eastern Busway linking the Eleanor Schonell Bridge to the South East Busway and the Northern Busway linking the Royal Children’s Hospital to Windsor. At the same time the Queensland government is getting on with the job of delivering with the big projects for the future such as the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998722"></A>
The government’s infrastructure program is much more than road and rail. Construction has commenced on the Queensland Children’s Hospital as well as the Gold Coast University Hospital and the Robina Hospital expansion. New schools are being built, such as the first stages of the $27 million Peregian Springs State School and the $26.8 million Bay View State School. The ecosciences precinct at Boggo Road is almost complete. This will become one of the largest hubs of scientists and researchers anywhere in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998806"></A>
Capital spending is not just happening in the south-east, with projects occurring right across Queensland. Much has been achieved in the past 12 months in regional Queensland. Projects in the last year have included the $100 million Bundaberg Ring Road and $81 million towards construction of 18 bridges as part of the Regional Bridge Renewal program. Projects such as these are essential if the state’s growth management strategy of encouraging population growth into the regions is to be successful. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998900"></A>
Work has commenced on the Mackay Base Hospital, the Cairns Base Hospital redevelopment and the Townsville Hospital expansion. Construction is also underway on the $25 million Townsville TAFE trade training centre and the TAFE trade training centre in Cairns. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is all happening in Townsville, yes. More recently, work commenced on the Goonyella-Abbot Point rail expansion, with $1.1 billion supporting the growth of the massive resources sector. In just the last 12 months our program has delivered. Much has been achieved and there is more to come. We are delivering what we said we would deliver. We are delivering on the promises that we made to Queenslanders. We really are building tomorrow’s Queensland today. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.36 am): Many of the projects that I have outlined are very large projects here in the south-east corner, but it is not only in the south-east corner where we will see activity in the next 12 months. From Cairns to Mount Isa, from Rockhampton to Toowoomba, Queensland’s regions were the big winners in this year’s budget. Our government recognises the importance of the regions of Queensland and the critical role that they play in the strength of our state. Evidence of our commitment to building the regions can be found in our building program. More than half--57 per cent--of the building program, the largest in Australia, is being spent on projects outside the Brisbane area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999197"></A>
In Cairns we have committed $42.5 million to the Cairns Cultural Precinct. Our commitment as a one-third funding partner is the first step in making this project a reality. It will breathe new life into the Cairns economy, it will add a major new attraction to the Cairns tourism experience and it will be a showcase for Indigenous art and performance. The budget reaffirms Townsville’s ‘capital of the north’ status. The northern region is a major construction zone with almost $1 billion worth of building in just this financial year. We have responded to the community’s call for projects like new boat ramps, a new marine precinct, the mall upgrade, the port access road and a massive expansion to the hospital to meet future growth. When members visit Townsville wherever they look they will see a construction zone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999359"></A>
There is also $66 million for a priority works program on the Mount Isa to Townsville rail line. In Mackay there is a $5 million funding boost for the showgrounds. In Rockhampton $10 million has been allocated to start work on an overpass to open up access to the Gracemere-Stanwell industrial precinct and new funds for the expansion of the City of Rockhampton’s riverbank redevelopment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999440"></A>
In Gladstone more than $50 million will be invested in building export capacity, improving safety and upgrading coal terminals and wharves. Construction of a material transportation service corridor to service the Aldoga project precinct will see $10 million of work over the next 12 months. In Mount Isa $2.58 million will be allocated to upgrading a floodway on the Burke Developmental Road at Corduroy, while $1.83 million will go to widening and sealing a section of the Flinders Highway. </Hansard-Body>

I take the interjection from the member for Mount Isa, who is a great champion from the north-west, where she knows that another $2.3 million will also be going towards paving and sealing a section of the Eyre Developmental Road.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001910"></A>
In Toowoomba, there is $4.7 million to upgrade the Toowoomba Airport to not only create jobs but also improve safety and provide more of an opportunity for commercial airlines to increase the number of passenger flights servicing this very busy growing region.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001911"></A>
On the Sunshine Coast, the budget provides $137 million for new health services and increased capacity at Nambour General Hospital and the Caloundra emergency department. The budget also confirms plans to start construction on the Sunshine Coast University Hospital by the middle of 2011 and locks in the funding for the entire project.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001912"></A>
The Gold Coast economy this year will see one of the largest budget allocations ever made, with a total capital spend in just this financial year of almost $2 billion. This will see $700 million on health projects, just under $750 million on community services, more than $450 million on transport and main roads, and spending to secure the Gold Coast’s reputation as the events capital of Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001913"></A>
We know that our regions are unique and their diversity is the key building block of Queensland. By investing in our regions, we build on the foundations for a stronger Queensland economy. The hard decisions that we made last year, including asset sales, mean that we can deliver new funding for projects in the regions of Queensland. This strategy is delivering--it is delivering more jobs, higher growth, lower deficits and lower debt and more projects needed by communities. Through the $17.1 billion building program, we are creating more jobs and we are creating them sooner. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Shanghai World Expo</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001916"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.41 am): Last week I announced that the Treasurer and the Minister for Employment and Economic Development will lead a trade mission to the Shanghai World Expo during Queensland Week at the Australian pavilion. Queensland Week runs from 20 to 26 June this year. The Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland will also attend the expo during that week where he will host a number of business events, including key events to showcase Queensland’s quality food and wine. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001919"></A>
Shanghai World Expo, the largest ever expo event--and we know that expos are among the largest events in the world--is expected to see between 70 and 80 million visitors. Queensland is a platinum sponsor of this expo and it builds on our very strong sister state relationship with Shanghai. Strengthening this relationship and promoting new partnerships in China are crucial to our state’s economic performance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001920"></A>
The Treasurer will launch Queensland Week, which will reinforce Queensland’s international reputation as a valuable and reliable trade and investment partner. China has a very strong demand for Queensland merchandise which continues to grow, rising from $2.7 billion to $5.7 billion between 2007 and 2009. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001921"></A>
The interest already expressed in this trade mission from more than 60 companies and organisations reflects the significance of the China market to Queensland business. Having hosted World Expo in 1988, Queensland knows the value of this very important global event in promoting international trade. We know that it can improve cultural understanding and build stronger relationships. We also know that it can transform entire cities and regions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001922"></A>
One in five Queensland jobs are underpinned by trade activity, and in regional Queensland that figure rises to one in four jobs. That is why Minister Mulherin will continue on to Indonesia, where he will lead a mission to sell the state’s expertise in a range of sectors, while the Treasurer will continue his mission in Japan--our largest export market--and will undertake the Japan leg of the annual post-budget QTC investment roadshow. Both ministers will sell Queensland’s industries and expertise in expanding global markets, particularly the very important markets of China, Japan and Indonesia. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (9.44 am): The Bligh government is sticking to our strong economic plan of delivering more jobs, building infrastructure and investing in Queensland’s economic recovery. There is no portfolio that more starkly illustrates the benefits of the Bligh government’s strong economic plan than Health. This year, the Health budget has grown by 10.5 per cent to $9.99 billion. That is four times the population growth, which is 2.6 per cent. The reason we can afford this record investment in health services and infrastructure is that we have chosen an economic path that invests in areas where government investment is needed most--hospitals, roads and schools, not coal lines. These are core government services and key public social infrastructure assets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001926"></A>
In the Health portfolio, the government’s strong economic strategy is delivering in spades in this year’s budget. In a national first, the Bligh government will lead Australia with an $8.5 million injection over four years to reduce the stigma and discrimination associated with mental illness. One in five Australians will experience mental illness in their lifetime. Australia is the only English-speaking OECD country that does not have a national anti-stigma campaign in place, despite around 45 per cent of the Australian adult population experiencing a mental illness in their lifetime. I am pleased to be able to say today that the Bligh government is leading the way to redress this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001927"></A>
Around two-thirds of people experiencing mental illness will not seek treatment or support because there is still a stigma attached to it. Part of this stigma is a lack of understanding from others, largely due to the fact that mental illness does not always manifest itself physically. But it has an enormous impact on people’s relationships, denies them opportunities with jobs, accommodation and general involvement in their community, and can often undermine their personal motivation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001928"></A>
Already the Queensland government has embarked on a $617.4 million strategy that is delivering a range of acute treatment and community based services, including 270 treatment beds and 74 new community care unit beds. But the reality is that the vast majority of people who suffer from mental illness do not need to be admitted to acute hospital beds--what they need is treatment and support in their community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001929"></A>
Today’s four-year $8.5 million Health budget commitment was specifically targeted to reduce discrimination and encourage social inclusion for Queenslanders experiencing a mental illness. Stigma not only significantly impacts on those experiencing mental illness but also has extensive social and economic consequences. Recent national estimates suggest that high levels of untreated mental illness in the workforce directly result in almost $6 billion in lost productivity due to absenteeism and workers who are unable to perform their jobs to the best of their ability. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001932"></A>
The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report <Hansard-Italic>
Chronic disease and participation in work </Hansard-Italic>
in 2009 found that, after arthritis, 25 per cent of the total loss in full-time employment was directly attributable to depression. The third leading cause is asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at just 10 per cent. What that tells me is that the time for not talking about mental illness is gone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001933"></A>
Lost productivity arising from people unemployed and on disability pensions as a result of a mental illness was also estimated to be around $9.7 billion per year nationally. These significant costs to the individual and the community further demonstrate the need for a comprehensive effort to reduce stigma and ensure people feel that they are able to access the care they need. The London School of Economics, in examining a similar program in Scotland, identified that for every £1 spent on the campaign there is an economy-wide saving of more than £8. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001934"></A>
We are pleased that the Bligh government’s initiative has won strong support from Queensland’s peak mental health body, the Queensland Alliance. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Cheverton has welcomed the announcement, saying that Queensland is leading the nation. He says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001938"></A>
This is a smart investment in Queenslanders’ health ... Reducing discriminatory attitudes towards mental illness means people are more likely to talk about their mental health needs and seek support and treatment early. When treatment is sought early--rather than at crisis point--there is a significant economic benefit, by reduced call on hospital services or productivity loss. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<A ID="pgfId-1001939"></A>
... </Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1001940"></A>
Queensland now leads Australia in responding to the negative attitudes which still survive in relation to mental illness. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001941"></A>
A range of stakeholders, including those currently experiencing mental illness, community mental health NGOs and professionals in the treatment sector, will be invited to contribute to the development of this anti-stigma campaign. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (9.48 am): Investment in innovation, along with new industries, remains a key component of our economic agenda. One program in this year’s budget which goes to the very heart of this is a new $2.5 million innovation vouchers program. It provides for Queensland firms the opportunity to access professional consultancies to develop their businesses, invest in R&amp;D and grow to the next level. This two-year pilot program targeting small to medium enterprises will offer up to $50,000 to access research and expert advice to convert good ideas into commercial reality--supporting R&amp;D, commercialisation, investment and, ultimately, jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003043"></A>
The program will be delivered in partnership with the Australian Industry Group. The last round of ABS figures on innovation in Australian business demonstrates that a higher percentage of Queensland businesses are embracing innovation than businesses in any other state, with 36 per cent developing or introducing new or significantly improved products or services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003044"></A>
The innovation vouchers program will support Queensland being at the forefront of business innovation. Recipients will be able to use the program to build capability and sustainability through either the commercialisation of research or the implementation of innovative new practices. The innovation vouchers program will begin this financial year and will showcase the successful applicants. I want to acknowledge the partnership with Ai Group and its advocacy for and within its membership for investment in innovation and in R&amp;D. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003045"></A>
This program demonstrates this government’s commitment to building a strong Queensland with a diverse economy that is powered by the bright ideas of the future. It is part of a budget that is determined to forge a new future for Queensland, not just a reprise of its history. The budget I handed down on Tuesday is investing in our future and the future of Queensland businesses to deliver the jobs of tomorrow. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (9.50 am): This week I have been proud to talk at length about jobs being created by this government, and I wish to do so again. Our economic strategy is delivering more jobs sooner. It is helping to protect Queensland from the effects of the global financial crisis by providing work in the construction industry, which has been amongst the hardest hit. We are delivering the nation’s biggest building program. We are providing a massive $17 billion for building projects to protect 106,000 jobs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003049"></A>
In particular, construction projects in regional Queensland have helped these parts of the state sustain less damage than they might have otherwise done and will help them recover sooner. Let us take two examples of our current projects. Looking at the north of our state, construction continues on a new government office building in Cairns. The Cairns region has been buffeted by the global economic downturn, especially its tourism industry. The $79.5 million William McCormack Place stage 2 building, which will be completed in September this year, will have created around 600 jobs by its completion.</Hansard-Body>

 Well, Mr Speaker, if they want to put their head in the tiger’s mouth, they cannot complain when it bites. I will say that again, seeing we got such a good effect from it. This stadium will be a state-of-the-art venue that will not only be a boon for residents of the Gold Coast, it will be a place for all Queenslanders to enjoy, including the nay-sayers from the Gold Coast who sit opposite. As well as sports events, the stadium will potentially be able to host many cultural events. Construction is on schedule and, by the time the stadium is finished in mid-2011 for the AFL season, it will have created approximately 1,100 jobs. Finally, I note a further $50 million has been provided in the budget for the $450 million state-of-the-art Police Academy at Wacol to be completed in 2014-15. The funding will be used to finalise documentation and do early site work.</Hansard-Body>

Budget, Resources Sector</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (9.53 am): The resources sector remains the backbone of Queensland’s economy. It is a huge job generator right throughout the state. That is why we have a plan to support the ongoing growth of this sector and the jobs it creates. This year’s budget is delivering on that plan, with a $55.8 million resource industry package over the next four years. This includes $18 million for the Greenfields 2020 program to target underexplored geological terrains in north and north-western Queensland. It also includes $12.5 million to streamline the government’s approval and regulatory processes and $10.7 million for upgrading tenure management systems. These initiatives are about ensuring the sustainable growth of the mining sector to deliver long-term benefits to Queensland. The Greenfields 2020 program is aimed at attracting the necessary explorers and investors to Queensland so that new discoveries of mineral, petroleum and geothermal resources can occur. This is a long-term plan to deliver long-term benefits because today’s exploration can become tomorrow’s mines and tomorrow’s jobs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003063"></A>
This plan builds on the work that has already been done by our government to support the growth of the resources sector over the past five years. Since 2004-05, we have seen exploration expenditure in Queensland rise from $270 million to $639 million in 2008-09, which is an increase of 136 per cent. Over the past five years, 490 production leases have been granted for minerals alone. A further 57 production leases have been approved for coal and 50 for petroleum. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003064"></A>
We know that sustainable mining is essential to Queensland’s future, and that is why we are supporting the growth of the industry today. While some people are out there making claims that this government is anti-mining, the proof is in the pudding. While the opposition is all distracted and caught up, we are getting on with the job of delivering a plan for the sustainable growth of the resources sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003065"></A>
This stands in stark contrast to the announcement by the federal opposition on what it would cut if it came to power in Australia at the next election. The list of federal government programs affected starts with the resource exploration refundable tax offset, which would be cut; then it goes to the trade training centres program, which would be discontinued; and finally it goes to the Carbon Capture and Storage Flagship Program, which would be reduced. All of that would cut at the very heart of the future of the resources sector here in Queensland. That just goes to show what a fraud Tony Abbott is in his campaign of standing up for the mining sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003066"></A>
We will be listening very closely later today when the Queensland opposition leader provides his budget-in-reply speech. We want to know what he plans to do. Will he go down the same path as his federal colleague and cut funding for essential programs for the future of our resources sector, such as we have already seen here today? <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (9.56 am): The Bligh government’s strong economic plan for the future means we can focus funding to where it is needed most. In my portfolio, that means better front-line services for our emergency services agencies. The $1.67 billion allocation for the Department of Community Safety in the 2010-11 state budget, which is an increase of $96 million on last year, includes $533 million for the Queensland Ambulance Service, $467 million for the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service, $97 million for Emergency Management Queensland, and $569 million for Queensland Corrective Services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003070"></A>
This budget allocation includes funding for an extra 75 ambulance officers and 24 extra firefighters. Such a boost means enhanced services, particularly in key growth areas in the state. The response times being recorded by our ambos are already some of the best in the country. The Bligh government is continuing to support both the Ambulance Service and the Fire and Rescue Service to maintain and grow their services in the face of strong population growth.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003071"></A>
The Community Safety budget allocation also includes funding to build new and refurbished ambulance and fire stations. Some $3.2 million dollars has been allocated to start or complete the construction of six new ambulance stations at Ashgrove, Coomera, Ningi, Pinjarra Hills, Springfield and North Lakes. A further $13.8 million will be spent replacing and refurbishing stations at Biggenden, Chermside, Gayndah, Gladstone, Gordonvale, Ipswich, Jimboomba, Moranbah, Normanton, Ravenshoe, Runaway Bay, South Mackay, Stanthorpe and Winton. In the fire service, new stations will be built at Agnes Water and Ripley, while replacement stations will be built at Brassall, Cherbourg, Craignish, Emerald, Noosa, Pullenvale and Toowoomba. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003072"></A>
The budget for Rural Operations will increase by over eight per cent to $31.7 million. More than $18 million will be spent on 165 new or replacement ambulance vehicles, and around $15 million will be spent on new and improved firefighting equipment and vehicles, including 48 new and replacement urban and rural fire appliances.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 There are more than 59 projects in the electorate of the member for Gregory. That is more than three times what those opposite spent on roads. It is the second largest roads budget on record. Our budget is about building better roads and generating jobs right across the state. It comes at a time when jobs and job security are more important than ever. We are providing around 30,000 jobs a year for workers on road construction. Our road projects are great and small from our massive $27.5 billion investment in the twin Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges and the Gateway corridor to the 97 road safety projects planned for every pocket of the state under our Safer Roads Sooner initiative. It is a $66 million investment to boost safety for motorists. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004287"></A>
How have we been able to deliver this $3.3 billion roads budget? We had a plan and we stuck to it. We made tough choices but the right choices so that we could deliver jobs and infrastructure needed to take Queensland into the future to build a first-class road network, to ease congestion, to slash travel times and to make life better for motorists no matter where they live in our great state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004289"></A>
Our road building program is reaching out across the state from the tip of the cape, Cardwell, Cooroy, Cornish Creek out west, the Capricorn Highway, the Calliope Range, Crows Nest, Carrara and Cairns. Our foot is firmly to the pedal. We are building bridges, bypasses, overpasses, underpasses, flyovers and footbridges. We are maintaining, repairing, widening, strengthening and expanding our vast road network. We are getting on with the job, unlike the opposition. If we applied their three per cent efficiency dividend to our roads budget it would mean hundreds of roads programs dumped. I want to hear this afternoon, as do the motorists of Queensland, what the Leader of the Opposition will cut from our roads budget to implement his plan. I want to hear it. The members opposite are job blockers and job knockers. Our roads record speaks for itself. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004297"></A>
The year 2010 will be remembered as the year Labor delivered key infrastructure for Queenslanders, not the tories. The Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges will stand above them all, ultimately 12 lanes--six northbound and six southbound--delivered six months early. It is a testament to our commitment to build a better, brighter future for all Queenslanders. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Kangaroo Meat Exports</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004304"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. TS MULHERIN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland) (10.02 am): Yesterday, I met with Russia’s new Trade Commissioner, Mr Yuri Aleshin, to discuss, amongst a variety of issues, the progress of reopening kangaroo meat exports to Russia. DEEDI and AgForce organised a bilateral agricultural trade and investment tour for the commissioner visiting Roma, Dalby, Ipswich and Dinmore over the last couple of days to learn more about Queensland agriculture. Many aspects of Queensland’s agricultural supply chain were showcased, including saleyards, grain production, biofuels and meat processing. Also on the commissioner’s agenda was Queensland’s beef, lamb and goat industries trade opportunities to Russia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004310"></A>
Prior to last year, when Russia suspended imports of kangaroo products, kangaroo meat exports generated around $25 million for Queensland’s economy. Since Russia’s export suspension last year, we have made significant progress in raising training standards in the industry. DEEDI and Safe Food Production Queensland are also running field trials on electronic identification tags that will allow more efficient traceability from kangaroo harvest to processing. The DEEDI trial uses a radio frequency identification device that electronically records specific information from each kangaroo including the time, date and GPS location of harvest. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004314"></A>
Safe Food Production Queensland is trialling a tag that utilises barcode technology already used in the red meat industry. The tag will capture time and date information from various stages throughout the supply chain. This new technology will reduce the current paperwork burden on those in the wild game industry. Industry stakeholders, including harvesters, processors and regulators, are excited about the trials because of the possibilities the tags offer for opening market access and saving dollars.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004315"></A>
The Russian Trade Commissioner’s visit builds on the discussion on meat exports, which the Premier raised on her trade mission to Russia last October. The close ties the Premier formed with our Russian trading partners helped the commissioner’s trip come to fruition. Discussions with Russia about reopening the export market for Queensland kangaroo meat will continue. Russia is an important export market for Queensland’s agricultural sector. This week’s visit by the Russian Trade Commissioner was an ideal opportunity to promote the quality products that the sector has on offer. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. D BOYLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships) (10.05 am): Across agencies, the Bligh government will be injecting a total of $1.3 billion into Queensland councils under the 2010-11 state budget. This budget will be delivering on Labor’s promise to create more jobs not only through our Capital Works Program of $17.1 billion but also through our $1.3 billion budget for local governments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004320"></A>
For councils, the budget features $281 million from the Communities budget, almost $100 million more than the previous financial year. It includes $183.4 million from Housing, $57.6 million from Community and Youth Justice Services, $20.2 million from Sport and Recreation, $17.88 million from Disability Services, and over $1 million under Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services. Of this $1.3 billion, half a billion dollars will be provided through my department in local government grants and subsidies over the coming financial year. Out of this, more than $122 million will be paid under the old grants scheme to complete water and sewage infrastructure and local projects, such as recreational facilities and community halls, ahead of the new $45 million grants program which will commence in 2011-12.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004321"></A>
Over the next financial year there is also more than $15 million for Townsville City Council’s Flinders Street Mall and Jezzine Barracks, and $31.3 million in subsidies to the Whitsunday, Cassowary Coast, Hinchinbrook and Tablelands councils to upgrade sewage treatment plants. Priorities have been given to these projects as a further protection for the Great Barrier Reef. There is also $7.581 million in top-up funding for the Torres Strait Island Regional Council, as announced in April. I welcome $13.7 million to assist the Cassowary Coast Regional Council upgrade the Innisfail water treatment plant and other priority projects, including the Jubilee Bridge. There is $59 million for priority Indigenous environmental health infrastructure projects to ensure access to reliable water and wastewater infrastructure in these mostly remote communities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004323"></A>
I am pleased also to confirm the state budget again supports show societies, with $2 million in grants for these important community events. The sum of this allocation for local governments--this $1.3 billion for Queensland’s 73 councils--means a subsidy of over $900 for every ratepayer. Despite difficult economic times, the Bligh government is reaffirming its commitment to the councils of Queensland and their communities. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PJ LAWLOR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southport--ALP) (Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading) (10.08 am): Tourism Research Australia has released the latest International Visitor Survey results for the year ending March 2010. The past 18 months have been tough on our state’s tourism industry, but indications are positive for a return to confidence. We have stuck to our plan of an extra $36 million over three years to steer the tourism industry through the global financial crisis. The signs are positive that we are slowly recovering, but rest assured we will be marketing Queensland as aggressively this year as we have been over the past 18 months.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004328"></A>
The visitor results show that two million international visitors came to Queensland in the year to March and spent 40 million nights and $4 billion in our state. The shining light continues to be China, with 153,000 Chinese visitors spending 2.5 million nights in Queensland--a nine per cent increase in visitors and a significant increase in nights. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005494"></A>
Chinese visitors also spent $326 million in Queensland in the year to March, $87 million more than the previous year. We pursued China Southern Airlines to come to Queensland. The flights starting from Guangzhou to Queensland later this year should help to grow these figures even more. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005496"></A>
Growth in European visitors, particularly those aged under 30, has also been recorded. Visitors aged under 30 from Germany, France and the Netherlands all increased their travel to Queensland at a higher rate than the national average. The UK market, also one of our most important, increased by one per cent. Over the next 12 months a key focus will be an increased emphasis on attracting international visitors from Queensland’s ‘Big 5’ international markets--New Zealand, the UK, Japan, the US and China. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005497"></A>
The last 18 months have been tough, but it could have been tougher without our plan to protect the tourism industry. More than 222,000 Queenslanders from the length and breadth of Queensland owe their living to tourism and, although the past 18 months have been challenging, Tourism Queensland’s $63 million budget will be put to good use to help ensure a more positive 2010-11. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PG REEVES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mansfield--ALP) (Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport) (10.10 am): As the Minister for Child Safety, I am determined to ensure that the Queensland government continues to create brighter futures for the more than 7,600 children who cannot live safely at home. In a bid to achieve this, the Queensland government has stuck to its plan and has this year delivered a child protection budget of $695.9 million. I am pleased to announce that this funding includes an extra $3 million in 2010-11 to recruit 35 front-line staff in high-demand areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005502"></A>
By employing additional team leaders, child safety officers and child safety support officers in high-needs areas, abused children and young people will get the help they need and existing front-line workers will receive greater support. This extra funding underpins the Queensland government’s value and support for our front-line child protection workers in the important work they do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005503"></A>
On a daily basis, child protection officers in Queensland are confronted with multiple rather than single family issues such as alcohol and drug misuse, mental illness and domestic violence. Since I have become minister I have travelled the length and breadth of Queensland and visited every child safety office in the state--all 57 of them. I can attest firsthand that they do an amazing job, often under very difficult circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005504"></A>
Sadly, our need for more of these dedicated staff continues to grow with Queensland’s booming population. The increased funding of $3 million will go a long way to improve our attraction and retention rate, develop our child protection workforce and boost our response in high-demand areas across the state. We all acknowledge that, as a profession, child protection can be challenging. It is no secret that recruiting and keeping people in this field is difficult. That is why the Queensland government has been working towards the position as an employer of choice for child protection professionals. Over the past few years this has started to reap rewards through improved retention rates. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005505"></A>
The extra $3 million investment in our child protection workforce underpins the Queensland government’s absolute and ongoing commitment to keeping children and young people safe. I would also like to express my personal thanks to our dedicated child protection officers who work every day to keep our children and young people safe. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.13 am): The regions are the jewel in the crown of Queensland. Whether it be Cairns, the Gold Coast, Mount Isa, Mundingburra or Moranbah, the Bligh government is making sure communities are receiving the support they need. We are spending $11 million to support people at risk of homelessness in North Queensland. We are spending $5 million to provide support to vulnerable families in the Wide Bay region. We are spending $44 million to help people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness in the greater Brisbane area. To improve and expand social housing across the state, we are spending $291 million in greater Brisbane, $185 million in the Far North, $63 million on the Gold Coast, $89 million in North Queensland, $28 million on the Darling Downs, $25 million in Mackay and $33 million in Western Queensland. This is the biggest investment in social housing this state has ever seen.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005510"></A>
Just one example of our investment in Queensland communities--a small example but a very helpful example--is the money we are spending to construct the new Mount Isa community centre. In another example, around 1,400 pensioners, people with disabilities and people on low incomes in the Mundingburra area will be helped with almost $155,000 to assist with transport to medical appointments. When I visited this great volunteer community transport service, TOTS, I was told they had clocked up 86,100 kilometres last year helping people. That is equivalent to travelling twice around the world. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1005513"></A>
Our most significant investment is the $55 million we are spending to roll out the new Helping Out Families initiative that I announced earlier this week with the Minister for Child Safety. Under this program, more families will receive more help sooner through the creation of a family support alliance to provide coordinated case managed support. The Helping Out Families Initiative will be trialled in Logan, Beenleigh and the Gold Coast and provide support early because that is when it matters most. We know that if we get in early with family support we will benefit in the long run with a pay-off of between $2 and $19 for every dollar we spend. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005515"></A>
Our investment is part of this government’s comprehensive plan to strengthen and grow support for families and communities. This stands in stark contrast to the cuts in service delivery the LNP put to the Queensland people. We know what the Queensland people did when faced with that choice. They put a 1 in the box for better services. They put a 1 in the box for stronger communities. They put a 1 in the box for the ALP. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Inala--ALP) (Acting Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability) (10.16 am): This year’s budget more than any other before it was a green budget. Our government has had a plan to reach our green targets and we have stuck to it. People will not find many areas in this budget with a sharper focus on the future than in the environment portfolio. They will see a new investment of $56 million over five years for new national parks--the biggest funding injection for national parks by any state government. This will go towards acquisition as well as management and will see us catapult towards our target to reach 12.9 million hectares across the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005520"></A>
Some $45.5 million has been allocated to further protect koala habitats in South-East Queensland. This is the largest funding amount for koalas ever made by a Queensland government. Some $8.4 million has been allocated to continue the successful Nature Assist Program to roll out more government funded nature refuges in this state. We are already nearing the two million hectare mark for nature refuges. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1005521"></A>
We know how important it is to further protect the cape and give its unrivalled natural qualities the recognition they deserve. We will invest $3.5 million in progressing a World Heritage nomination for Cape York, focusing on ongoing consultation and engagement with traditional owners and other landholders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005522"></A>
Last of all, we now have the financial capacity needed to turn Queensland from a dumping state to a recycling state. We will be carrying out a series of initiatives and reforms, particularly focused on helping businesses improve their waste management strategies. Put simply, we want to see one company’s trash become another company’s treasure. If we continue to dump waste to landfill we are not only wasting valuable resources, we are also wasting new business opportunities. Recycling creates three times more jobs than disposing of waste to landfill and at the moment these opportunities are going begging.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005523"></A>
This budget allows us to plot a new course for waste management to meet contemporary waste and environmental challenges. This is a government that has stuck to a plan. This is a budget that is a huge win for conservation, a huge win for sustainability and a huge win for the environment.</Hansard-Body>

On another matter, in this morning’s <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 the Lord Mayor accused me of misleading parliament yesterday regarding Brisbane City Council’s plans for a large residential development near a medical waste facility. The Lord Mayor took exception to my statement that it was only recently that DERM became aware council had proposed a large residential development for a parcel of land adjacent to Ace Waste.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005527"></A>
It is clear that DERM has been involved in planning meetings for the Lower Oxley Creek area since 2006. However, it was only during meetings last year that council’s plans for houses to be built so close to this facility were seriously contemplated. These plans were set out in the draft Paradise Wetlands neighbourhood plan, which was submitted to the state government for the first state interest check in the middle of last year and which DERM was asked to provide its response on in July 2009. As recently as February this year, DERM reiterated its position to council that council should adhere to a draft state planning policy recommending a separation distance of 1,000 metres from facilities such as Ace Waste. I know the local member, Karen Struthers, is also fully supportive of this as well. I stand by my statement in this House yesterday. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (10.19 am): The Bligh government has a clear plan to reform and modernise Queensland’s justice system, and the 2010-11 state budget is further evidence of our commitment to this plan. A massive court building program supporting thousands of jobs, more front-line staff and better services for vulnerable Queenslanders are the focus of this year’s record $1.046 billion budget for the Department of Justice and Attorney-General. A key component of this year’s justice budget is the $330 million capital works program, which includes $290 million for the new District and Supreme Courts complex in Brisbane. This project, worth a total of $600 million, will create nearly 5,000 jobs during the construction phase and is part of the Bligh government’s $17.1 billion building program. It will also provide courts in a building that will service Brisbane and Queensland for decades to come.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006941"></A>
This year’s justice budget also provides an extra $20.3 million over four years to expand the services provided by the Office of the Adult Guardian. This funding will deliver an extra 41 guardians and front-line staff to help the growing number of Queenslanders who are unable to make their own decisions because of accidents, dementia, mental health and other disabilities. Funding has also been provided for the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal, which started in December last year and represented the biggest change to the state’s civil justice system for 50 years. QCAT has received a funding boost of $1.5 million a year for extra adjudicators, case managers and support staff, primarily to deal with minor civil disputes and guardianship matters.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006947"></A>
The budget provides $6.7 million over four years to establish the new Sentencing Advisory Council, which was announced in February. There is also an extra $4 million over four years for the Crime and Misconduct Commission. This will allow the CMC to target the proceeds of crime as well as supporting its other core activities, such as misconduct complaints and policy research. An additional $460,000 a year has been provided to create five new positions in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. This will be used to employ an extra Crown Prosecutor and legal officers in Ipswich and legal officers in Brisbane, Beenleigh and Cairns. The Bligh government is committed to making Queensland a safer and fairer place to live, and this year’s budget supports our ambition.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Planning Applications, Smart eDA Online Service</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. SJ HINCHLIFFE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Infrastructure and Planning) (10.21 am): The Bligh government’s new user-friendly Smart eDA online service for preparing and lodging planning applications will continue to be rolled out throughout the state. Further funding of over $1.8 million towards the maintenance and support of the Smart eDA system announced in Tuesday’s budget will see this smart and green initiative made available to more local governments. The system, developed by the state government in consultation with the Local Government Association of Queensland, councils and industry stakeholders, streamlines and simplifies the development assessment system. Paper based development applications are generally difficult to handle, disperse and monitor and place significant demands on councils in terms of staff and costs. The electronic system provides Queensland with a more efficient, transparent and consistent development assessment process that will reduce the cost of development. For example, anyone using any part of the Smart eDA system can follow the progress of their applications online. They can also receive notification should council request further information. This was previously unavailable and valuable council resources were undoubtedly tied up in handling requests for this information.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006959"></A>
This system is now available in 15 local government areas including the Redlands, Bundaberg, Cairns, Western Downs, Mackay, South Burnett, Somerset, Gladstone, Whitsunday, North Burnett, Burdekin, Isaac, Southern Downs, Cassowary Coast and the Central Highlands, among others. From September 2010 plumbing applications may be lodged through the Smart eDA service with one-off payments of $10 per application. This provides excellent value for preparing, lodging and tracking plumbing applications through a 24/7 online service. The recently announced budget allocation will allow the Bligh government to continue to roll out the Smart eDA system across the state, with an additional 15 councils expected to go live within the next 12 months. My department will continue to work closely with councils to train staff and inform local planners about the Smart eDA system’s efficiencies. This initiative is part of the Bligh government’s commitment to improving planning services for councils, residents and applicants across the length and breadth of Queensland.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. RG NOLAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport) (10.24 am): The Bligh government’s record $7 billion Transport spend will secure the jobs of more than 26,000 people in this state over the next year. It is only possible because we made the tough decisions. Those decisions are about protecting jobs, building infrastructure and providing services across our transport network. Public transport funding is up by $179 million to $1.38 billion in South-East Queensland. That includes an extra $60 million for rail and $50 million for buses. It means 220 new and replacement buses and approximately 12 new trains to conveniently move people around the network. But providing services does not stop there. We have also committed $169 million for school transport up and down the length and breadth of Queensland. There is $156 million for long-distance transport and $34 million for public transport in our regional cities, including Toowoomba, Cairns, Rockhampton, Gladstone and Mackay. Our funding even stretches as far as the Torres Strait, with $8 million for the local ferry service.</Hansard-Body>

I am delighted the opposition has so far been accepting of our Transport budget. I have been keeping an ear to the ground. I watch the news of an evening, I listen to the radio and I read the papers. As far as I can tell, the opposition leader and his shadow transport minister have made absolutely no comment. The opposition--</Hansard-Body>

Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Two full days after the budget was handed down, the opposition leader and his shadow transport spokesman have made absolutely no comment on Transport spending--not one comment, not one contribution, not one suggestion, not one policy. It is a ‘Simpson Desert’ of policy ideas on that side of the House and parched members are starting to turn away in droves. Their last foray into the world of public transport was prior to the last election--about 15 months ago now--with a planned three per cent efficiency dividend that would lead to the loss of 170,000 public transport seats per week, not to mention 230 jobs. They committed to Redcliffe rail--‘subject to the global financial crisis’--and they committed to Sunshine Coast rail, but it did not connect to anything. I eagerly await the opposition leader’s budget reply speech with breathless anticipation and his contribution to the Transport policy debate in this state is eagerly awaited, I am sure, by all members of this House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Queensland Health, Payroll System</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008568"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.30 am): My first question without notice is to the Minister for Health. The minister’s department is leaking. The man hired to fix the health payroll system, Michael Walsh, has briefed the minister on these facts: (1) the payroll system remains barely stable; (2) it has no chance of being fully functional for at least 12 months; and (3) the current problems will continue for that time. Does the minister deny receiving this advice? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008571"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I have been in constant discussion with both Michael Walsh and others in relation to the payroll system. I have made it crystal clear that our immediate priority in relation to the payroll system is to work towards its stabilisation so that people can get paid. That is a critical part of it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008572"></A>
I have made it clear that we have both medium- and long-term assessments and issues that we need to do in relation to the payroll system. That is very, very clear as well. Why would we not have KPMG continuing to look at the payroll system if we did not want to establish what needs to be done in the longer term? So obviously there will be things that need to be done in the medium and the long term as well as short-term things.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008573"></A>
I have indicated repeatedly publicly that I have sat alongside payroll people and watched them entering data into the system. I have made it clear repeatedly that I do not believe that the payroll system worked appropriately in Queensland Health, on my observations and from discussions with other people, for probably 10 or 20 years. I have made that repeatedly clear and I am more than happy to indicate to the members opposite why.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008575"></A>
There is no doubt that the current system is not working as well as Lattice was, but there is also no doubt that people said to me repeatedly that Lattice was not working appropriately. Indeed, the opposition members would be aware from publicity, including in the media last year, that made it crystal clear that there were overpayments under Lattice. I have made it clear repeatedly that the system under which nurse unit managers have to go through enormous amounts of paperwork, both now and in the past, to ensure that rosters are done--for example, the nurse unit manager types up a roster and then it goes across to payroll and then payroll types the same roster in and then it goes back to the nurse unit manager--strikes me as a ridiculous way to do that. That essentially happened under the Lattice system as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008576"></A>
So the idea is to make sure not only that the current system is stable but also that it works into the future. Of course it will take time to work on this system and, of course, ultimately we need to take the appropriate expert advice. Michael Walsh is there to head the team, but we are also having people like KPMG and others look into how we might do it appropriately. I make no apology for that and I think the people of Queensland would expect nothing else. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My second question without notice is also to the Minister for Health. By what date will valid and accurate end-of-financial-year group certificates be issued to all Queensland Health employees? Will this be by the usual required standard of within a fortnight of 30 June? If not, why not? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008583"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I know that the honourable member in fact has no interest in issues relating to the Health payroll. The reason I know that he does not is that his actions yesterday spoke volumes. The Leader of the Opposition, with his two ciphers the member for Currumbin and the member for Clayfield, was recently out in the media suggesting that the matter be referred to the independent Auditor-General, who, of course, is looking at it and he does so with our absolute and total support. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008584"></A>
But you could tell last night indeed, by the actions of the member for Caloundra, that he was not in the least bit interested. In having referred the matter in a political stunt to the independent Auditor-General, he was not in the least bit interested in what the Auditor-General had to say, because he only wanted to put it in charge of the lawyers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008585"></A>
I will tell members one thing about the lawyers, because I happen to know a little bit about them: spending tens of millions of dollars on lawyers will not get a computer program. Spending tens of millions of dollars will not get, by 30 June, a payroll slip done the right way. The simple fact of the matter is that the Leader of the Opposition, paralysed with indecision, not capable of remembering what his political tactics were on an issue last week--let alone last fortnight, let alone last month--is well out of his depth on this issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008586"></A>
What is for sure is that this payroll system needs to be fixed and that it is unacceptable. What is also for sure is that I am not technically qualified to give this House advice in relation to the technical aspects of the system. I have made it crystal clear that what I want to do is, as far as possible, have the system stabilised as soon as we can and, indeed, to the extent that it can be done--</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1008588"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The member for Toowoomba South does not want to hear the answer. The reason he does not is that his side referred the matter to the Auditor-General and then it did not want the Auditor-General to look at it. The member’s side supported the matter going to KPMG and then it did not want them to look at it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008589"></A>
I say to the members opposite: it is absolutely legitimate for our staff to want to be paid properly, on time and correctly and they should be able to expect it. It is critical that the system does that, but what I will not do is provide assurances about matters that I cannot and am not capable of doing because I am not a technician. What I will do is assure the House that every possible resource is being directed towards doing this. I did not choose what payroll system we should roll out and neither did my ministerial colleague. I did not certify that it was appropriate to roll it out. The documents have been tabled in this House. But I tell you what: I want to get it fixed. </Hansard-Body>

 I thank the honourable member for the question. As he well knows, in his own electorate there are a number of projects on the go. One of the ones we have committed to in this year’s budget is the project to demolish the old hospital. The hospital is no longer needed because we have built a brand-new, state-of-the-art hospital for the people of his area which is now getting very well used. The old hospital is located on one of the most beautiful pieces of beach-side land. We committed to giving it back to the people of Yeppoon by transferring it to the council so that it can be used as recreational space. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008596"></A>
There has been a long debate about who should be responsible for demolishing the hospital. I was very pleased to join with the member, along with the Treasurer, at the recent community cabinet in Yeppoon and to see for myself just what state the building is in. That means that we can now move, through the allocation in this year’s budget, to demolish it. It is a building that was built at a time when a lot of asbestos was used. We will not only demolish it but also do basic landscaping, and then it will be a matter for the council long term to decide what should be on that site. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008597"></A>
So I thank the honourable member for his advocacy for that project. It is an example of what we are doing to make Queensland’s regions more liveable places for families and more attractive places for people to move to, live in and work at. What we will see today, of course, is a chance for the opposition leader to lay out his economic strategy, to talk to us about what he wants to see for regional Queensland and to give detail about how he will stimulate the Queensland economy. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1008598"></A>
We saw Tony Abbott set the standard on opposition responses for this year in his own speech. Even Tony Abbott indicated what he would do differently to fund his own budget promises. We know it is true because he wrote it down; it was in his budget reply speech. He gave a great deal of detail on the programs that he would cut. Tony Abbott will cut the National Broadband Network; he will cut the computers in schools program; and he will cut the national infrastructure funding. At least Australians know where he stands. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008599"></A>
We have heard this morning that the Leader of the Opposition will be proposing in his speech today a $247 electricity rebate for pensioners. He needs to tell us what the cost of that is and how it will be paid for. There are only three sources of funding (1) he cuts something else out of the budget; (2) he lifts a tax to pay for it; or (3) he pays for it with increased deficit and increased debt. If he does not answer that question then it is not a rebate; it is a Nigerian money scam. One gets it in an email and thinks, ‘You beauty, something great’, and when you look behind it there is nothing--absolutely nothing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008600"></A>
I look forward to hearing what he is going to cut, what he is going to tax and how much more debt he is going to add. The test for the Leader of the Opposition today is whether he can tell as much truth as Tony Abbott.</Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Health. Queensland nurses once had pay slips which they trusted and understood. Following the collapse of the minister’s new payroll system, I table a pay slip and also a 32-page instruction manual which is issued on interpreting that pay slip. Can the minister explain to the House how a nurse can use this 32-page instruction manual to understand their new whiz-bang pay slip?</Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. It is self-evident that the material that is provided under the new system to our staff is not good enough. Queensland Health has the most complex payroll of all payrolls in the Queensland government. The next biggest department to Queensland Health is Education. Education has nowhere near the complexity. It has far fewer categories of employees and its employees generally work standard hours. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010247"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Off the top of my head, we have 24 different award classifications. We operate 24/7 with people on all sorts of allowances, on-call allowances and the like. The new system has adopted a number of codes for different shifts, allowances and the like. When an employee starts at all different times, unlike most other jobs--even police tend to have standard shifts--that adds to the complexity of the system. There is no doubt that when one examines a payroll slip that it is, in fact, confusing. That is one of the things that KPMG are legitimately looking at and, in fact, I think is a very significant criticism of the new system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010248"></A>
The large document that the honourable member tabled was produced in response to allowing people to actually see what the codes represented. Frankly, I would have thought that when it was designed it would have been designed appropriately with our staff in mind. It clearly was not. They forgot that the customers in payroll are actually the people who are getting paid, not IT people. I am very, very concerned and angry that that became the case. I would have thought that they could have designed it in a way that would have made it apparent for our staff. The honourable member tables a document that clearly demonstrates that they did not. That is a matter that needs to be fixed. That is a matter that is not satisfactory.</Hansard-Body>

Ms MALE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Premier. Can the Premier please outline to the House what the government is doing to give Queenslanders a helping hand with cost of living pressures?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010260"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I know that she, like me and all members of our government, is concerned to make sure that Queenslanders have a good standard of living and that we manage the cost of living well. I understand that there are a number of Queenslanders doing it tough and for those people every little bit counts. Our side of the House has a long and proven track record of giving Queenslanders in need a helping hand. This budget is no exception. There is a further increase to pensioners and seniors for electricity rebates, a new rebate for those who require cooling for medical purposes and a $24 cut to CTP which helps out motorists. That is not all. These join a range of other measures in areas including help for those who want to bring their electricity bills down by moving to solar with our solar hot water rebate, significant public transport concessions for students and seniors and extra help for first home buyers in regional Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010261"></A>
We gave a guarantee that we would not increase taxes and charges for Queensland families in this budget and we kept our word. We understand that for Queenslanders every dollar counts and in every budget we bring down we will look to relieve the pressure wherever we can and we will do it responsibly and, importantly, we will do it affordably. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010262"></A>
Those on the other side would have people believe that they are in a position to relieve the pressure without talking about increasing taxes, but of course they have form on this. Remember that in their very first budget in government last time they introduced seven new taxes and charges. They introduced fees on ATM machines, new fees for cheque accounts, new fees for EFTPOS. They even introduced a tyre levy. They wanted to tax the tyres on cars. Those opposite will say that it was a long time ago, that they are not like that now. No less than six members of the senior team of the opposition were part of the government that did that. That is their form. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010263"></A>
No wonder the members opposite are having trouble with the budget. Interestingly, in his local paper last week the member for Gympie was calling for volunteers to help him analyse the state budget. He stated--</Hansard-Body>

This is the best resourced and laziest opposition in the country. This is the rising star. This is one of the new policy powerhouses. They do not just want to run mental health institutions with volunteers; they want to run the entire opposition with volunteers because they do not want to do the hard yards. Those opposite cannot even do the basics. If the member for Gympie is the policy powerhouse then God help the rest of them. </Hansard-Body>

It has been 3 months now since I left work and I am still awaiting my termination pay</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Having said that, I will have the matter immediately actioned. The fact that these matters, in terms of the backlog that existed when the Lattice system was transferred to the new system, have not been eradicated is a matter of great concern because people are entitled to this pay. It is their pay. I make that crystal clear.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012003"></A>
Queensland Health has spent significant time and resources in recent years with very, very substantial increases in recruitment in Australia. In fact, Queensland Health has worked very, very hard to recruit more people. Our pay rates are better than the private sector and are better than the public sector in other states. But, frankly--and I say this to the people who designed this payroll system and brought about its implementation--if there are errors in our payroll system, that does nothing to attract people to work for us and it is in fact damaging, and I acknowledge that. That is why it has to be fixed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012006"></A>
Queensland Health has recruited significantly more doctors, nurses and allied health professionals in Queensland, and the numbers are there for everybody to see. We have worked at significantly increasing what we pay people to make ourselves an employer of choice. Members would be well aware of the leakage from the private sector to the public sector in areas such as nursing homes and private hospitals. It is not good enough, however, that this happens to our staff. It may in many instances dishearten them and in fact cause them to move on. I regret that immensely. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
I thank the honourable member for the question. On Monday we saw the Leader of the Opposition indicate what he was expecting this week, and that he expected the government to take on the issue of debt and deficit. He has complained about the interest bill on many occasions but has never publicly supported privatisation post the election. He opposes debt and he opposes the interest rates on it but he then does not support privatisation, which will reduce debt and indeed is designed to improve our credit rating to AAA. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012017"></A>
This budget contains record investment in the health of Queenslanders, but it is all about choices in this job. We get paid the money here in terms of the policy alternatives and the choices that we make, not to sit and chuck rocks from the sideline. A responsible government can choose a $446 million hospital redevelopment in Cairns that will deliver nearly 2,600 construction jobs, or you can choose to hang on to an airport that will be there anyway. In Mackay, you can double the size of the existing hospital at a $408 million investment and nearly 2,400 construction jobs, or you can hang on to an airport that is still there. In Rockhampton, you can have a $166.7 million hospital redevelopment--the largest health infrastructure project in Central Queensland--or you can hang on to some coal lines that no matter what will still be there. On the Sunshine Coast, you can have 96 beds at Nambour being built as we speak or the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, or you can hang on to a port in Brisbane in my electorate that will grow and still be there. You can have a Gold Coast University Hospital, worth $1.7 billion, or you can hang on to a forestry investment, which got much more than those opposite even predicted on a 0.5 per cent rate of return, that will still be there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012021"></A>
It is all about choices and the Leader of the Opposition has had four occasions over the last year to tell us about choices. He had two opportunities at CEDA, where he had us all waiting for it. He had the last budget reply. He had the Queensland Media Club. On each occasion he had the choice to tell us what he would cut to deliver a policy, and on each occasion he has squibbed it. This is an opposition long on cowardice and short on courage. In the opposition cowardice is king. You have had the opportunities to tell the people of Queensland what you would cut. Tony Abbott did it. </Hansard-Body>

Clearly the system ought be designed to provide maximum information to staff when it comes to interpreting their payroll.

That is difficult to understand, it creates further work and it needs to be fixed. I remind the member for Toowoomba South that when one is talking about a payroll system like this it needs to be fixed appropriately and in a manner that is dictated to by those professionals. If I could snap my fingers--it is not like typing a different word in a Word document. It is a payroll system that operates for 75,000 staff at Queensland Health.

 Mr Speaker, the honourable member was having a go at me for not looking at her. I was talking to you. The information provided on the payroll slip is clearly not satisfactory. One would have thought that by properly engaging our staff, who are the people who are the experts in pay, this matter would have been sorted out before its implementation, but it is self-evident that it was not and that is why it is appropriate that these inquiries take place. I have said this over and over again. Some of the members opposite are from a previous government, and I wonder if they involved themselves in payroll design. </Hansard-Body>

Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Yeerongpilly for his question and his commitment to helping those Queensland individuals and Queensland families who most need a hand from a government which is committed to giving them support and giving them a hand. That is why this government announced its policy commitment to increase the electricity rebate for pensioners and seniors in the budget that we handed down on Tuesday, a budget that included that commitment at a cost of more than $50 million. That is why we announced a new program at more than $6 million to provide support to those Queenslanders who have an illness and are required to use air conditioners more than is standard in order to regulate their body temperature because of that illness. This issue was raised with me by many members of this government and it is an issue that we addressed in the budget we handed down on Tuesday. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013906"></A>
We are now inside T minus 30 for the most anticipated budget reply in the history of Queensland. Men and women across Queensland are moving towards their television sets. They are tuning into the website ready for the budget reply that has been promised now for more than one year. This is going to be worth two budget replies because we were promised it last year. It is not just the men and women of Queensland who are looking forward to the speech; the children of Queensland are as well because the primary school guide to the parliament, which so many schoolchildren have seen, says that the role of the Leader of the Opposition is to present the views of an alternative government and that the shadow cabinet’s duty is to respond to government policy initiatives and offer alternative policies to the electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013909"></A>
So it is the men and women of Queensland and the schoolchildren who visited parliament who will lay down their pens at 11.30 and wait for the policy explosion that is due to come from the Leader of the Opposition--the pent-up volcano of policy work that has been building up in pressure for more than one year before it is about to spew forth and create the policy lava to flow across the land.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013910"></A>
This most anticipated budget reply in the history of Queensland must say how the Leader of the Opposition is going to fund the promises he makes, what programs he will cut, what projects he will stop building and what taxes he will raise. This is a Leader of the Opposition who has been promising so much for more than a year, promising to put the policies forward. We are all about to find out what the coven of the deputy leader and Jake Smith have allowed him to say. We are about to find out what Uncle Bruce has sanctioned that he is allowed to go out and say. We are about to find out what the Leader of the Opposition read this morning when it was handed to him--as he turned away from the mirror, dragged himself away from the opportunity to stare, once again, lovingly at the image he has created for himself. Here we are on the final countdown. Are we going to see the policy explosion, the fire and brimstone, or will it just be another big powder puff? </Hansard-Body>

Fancy the member for Clayfield standing up in this place and asking a question about privatisation, when we heard earlier this week that he stood in this place only a few years ago calling on this government to not just sell the retail arm of electricity but sell the poles, wires and generators. The level of hypocrisy that the member for Clayfield brings to this chamber knows no bounds. Now it is T minus 25. How is the opposition going to pay for the promises it will be making? Will the opposition come clean and finally bring forward the electricity privatisation agenda that the member for Clayfield so accurately portrayed only a couple of years ago in this chamber?</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1013927"></A>
The question I was asked was about wild rivers. There has been much debate over the last few days about our most recent declaration in the Wenlock River. Absent from that debate has been the opposition. Apart from a mealy-mouthed statement from the member for Callide on the day of the declaration, opposition members have been mute in terms of any commentary in relation to the Wenlock decision. Why would that be the case? I cannot wait to hear what Tony Abbott has to say about the Wenlock declaration. Will he continue his faux campaign against wild rivers, or will he cower in silence knowing that he cannot stick his head up in relation to this matter because of what John Howard and his then environmental spokesman did and buy that land covered by this Wenlock declaration in memory of Steve Irwin for wildlife protection? I suspect the faux campaign by the LNP has gone into a slumber. Hopefully, no-one will notice that the LNP members have vacated this debate, because even their own hypocrisy knows the level in this regard.</Hansard-Body>

There has been much debate about whether wild rivers declarations have an impact on native title. I do not often do this, but I congratulate the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 on its very balanced coverage this morning on this particular matter because it is about time people were told the truth. When it comes to wild rivers legislation, clause 44(2) of the Wild Rivers Act states that a wild rivers declaration or a wild rivers code, in applying for the purposes of any of the other acts, will not have an impact on the exercise or enjoyment of native title. That is what the act said. That is what the LNP supported when we brought in that legislation only a couple of years ago. That was brought in after negotiation and agreement was reached with Noel Pearson. This campaign that continues on is about rewriting history. It has no basis in fact, and any legal challenge mounted by the Cape York Land Council will be defeated. </Hansard-Body>

Will the minister confirm that her government has, in fact, allowed Ace Waste to emit dangerous chemicals at a level 10 times greater than international recommendations and whether this higher than normal level has, in fact, been breached on at least nine separate occasions over the life of the facility? </Hansard-Body>

Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Sorry, Mr Speaker. The limits that the member stated were addressed through the Stockholm convention. We are very closely monitoring this. Independent audits are conducted on the waste facility on a regular basis through the EPA. The EPA is a regulator in this matter. We need to make sure that health concerns are addressed, and council has undertaken this work. DERM is assisting council with this study and the first stage has been completed. We are now going through the second stage and we will assist. I welcome the Lord Mayor’s comments that council has withdrawn the neighbourhood plan until we get this right. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015849"></A>
The health of individuals living around this facility is paramount. What we have seen very clearly from the council is a move to bring residential areas close to this facility. This facility has been there for 16 years and council now has plans to move the residential area closer. This is unacceptable to the state. The State Planning Policy makes it very clear that there needs to be a buffer zone of 1,000 metres, and the state will not move from this. DERM will be liaising with council this week. We will be going out to residents and we will be talking to residents to make them aware that this air monitoring is happening. I am advised by the department of health that there are no health issues. </Hansard-Body>

In relation to the budget reply that the Leader of the Opposition is going to deliver today, I think we need to listen to what he says and any new ideas that he offers.

The Leader of the Opposition hops in his car, goes around the Monopoly board, pays his Monopoly money, gets to Park Lane where the member for Clayfield is, pays his Monopoly money, thinking about his budget reply: how are we going to fund these policies? Why do I use Monopoly? Because this is what the Leader of the Opposition said. The Leader of the Opposition said--</Hansard-Body>

Mr WELLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is addressed to the Minister for Main Roads. I refer the honourable gentleman to the vital importance in a vast state like Queensland of a safe and secure road network and of jobs to keep our far-flung communities thriving, and I ask: what is the Bligh government doing to deliver safer roads and to stimulate local economies and provide jobs?</Hansard-Body>

Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for Murrumba for his question. He has the fastest growing suburb in this state. He knows the importance of a good road network. I have the second fastest growing suburb in this state. I recognise that as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015865"></A>
The roadworks being signed, sealed and delivered right now across Queensland are making a big difference to people’s lives. We are rolling out a record building program--$18 billion to build a road network that is second to none--and we are generating jobs for workers. I have said it before and I will say it again: $18 billion translates to around 30,000 jobs a year. In Queensland today roads mean jobs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015866"></A>
But let us talk about safety. Today I can announce a major milestone on a vital safety upgrade of the Bruce Highway between Cooroy and Curra. We have hit the halfway mark, with earthworks removing 2.5 million cubic metres of earth from the site. It means our road workers have literally moved heaven and earth to help deliver this important road safety project on time and on budget. It is one of Queensland’s highest priority road projects. We are planning to upgrade the entire 65-kilometre stretch of the highway. On top of the road safety benefits, we are kick-starting the local economy--and I know the member for Gympie will appreciate that--with jobs for local workers. We are generating around 1,700 jobs and, fortunately, a lot of those jobs are being filled by locals. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015870"></A>
It could not come at a better time, a time when jobs and job security are more important than ever before. We have a vast road network in Queensland, about the same distance from here in Brisbane to London and back again. The Bligh government is back at work making it bigger and better. You can bet London to a brick on that one. We have made tough decisions--the right decisions--so we can deliver a road network that is second to none, unlike the opposition. As I have said before, its members have not built a road in Queensland for donkey’s years. Let us remind the House of their plans for roads at the last election. </Hansard-Body>

We want to hear this afternoon--now T minus 15 minutes--what the opposition is going to do to our roads. Whilst we are getting on with the job of building a safer and more secure road network across Queensland, they are asleep at the wheel. I for one will be all ears this morning to hear what the opposition has got to say about our roads. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would like to thank the member very much for his question. As I stated earlier, more than $100 million over the next five years is going to help protect our threatened and endangered species across our national parks estate: $56 million over five years to acquire and manage land, particularly in national parks across Queensland, and $45 million, as I mentioned to the House earlier, for our koala response strategy focusing on habitat restoration in South-East Queensland. That is by far the largest funding injection for protected areas by any state government and the largest funding injection for koalas by any Queensland government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015888"></A>
It follows on from our current ongoing efforts to protect other species from the brink of extinction. We have been establishing new colonies of northern hairy-nosed wombats and bilbies so if their original habitats are wiped out by flood or disease we have an insurance policy. We have a number of measures underway to safeguard cassowaries in the north such as a tracking project to monitor their movements, and I am quite sure the member would be well aware of that. That is part of our commitment to threatened, vulnerable and endangered species in Queensland. Wombats, bilbies, koalas and cassowaries and other species are all looked at through new investments and new projects. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015889"></A>
There is one threatened species that is proving a little harder to save. Can anybody help me? That species is known as the LNP. The new species was first discovered only a couple of years ago but it is already on the brink of extinction. It has two subspecies--Liberal and National. We have tried everything to save this species. To better protect our wildlife like wombats and bilbies we need the right type of environment for them to thrive and flourish so that their population increases. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015890"></A>
Try as we might, the LNP continues its downward slide. We have seen heavy losses, with two challengers recently being cut out of the pack to fend for themselves. We have had other subspecies go rogue in other threatened locations such as the seat of Ryan and the seat of Wright. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015891"></A>
What else do you need? You need a species that is free from ruthless predators. That is what we have been able to do from our closed off wombat colony near St George. But for all of our hard work the LNP just cannot seem to free itself from predators. Of course I speak of Clive Palmer and Santo Santoro--the latter having been witnessed in a rare sighting in the habitat of parliament earlier this year stalking his prey. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015892"></A>
What else do you need? You need a strong instinct and a will to survive. That is something we know the LNP is bereft of. Well may we protect vulnerable species in Queensland, because nothing can protect the LNP from itself. </Hansard-Body>

 I have signed a letter to the honourable member explaining our position on this. Unlicensed contracting in Queensland is a couple of things. One, it is entirely dangerous for the consumer. What it means is that people who engage unlicensed people run the risk of having no recourse whatsoever. If the honourable member is suggesting to me that we should suddenly turn a blind eye to unlicensed people who are advertising, then let her say so. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 If you wish, you can defend unlicensed contractors all you like in this place. That is up to you. The fact of the matter is that licences are there for a very good reason. To have people competing against unlicensed work is not something this side of politics agrees with. The licences are there for a very good reason. Licensees need to be protected. Those who advertise need to make sure that they are advertising correctly. All of that is on the BSA website. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015948"></A>
In terms of the BSA, there has been a crackdown on licences because we are getting a lot of complaints from consumers and we are getting a lot of complaints from licensed builders. They are telling me repeatedly that there are too many people out there who are exploiting the $3,300 limit and doing unlicensed work and competing against them unfairly. We believe in a level playing field in the building industry. I know that those opposite do not believe in a level playing field. </Hansard-Body>

Are they going to stand up for them? </Hansard-Body>

Brisbane City Council Budget, Public Transport</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms FARMER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Transport. Yesterday the minister challenged the Lord Mayor to provide more funding for buses in the Brisbane City Council budget. Can the minister advise what the council delivered for public transport?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015960"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, I can. There is no doubt that the Bligh government is passionately committed to delivering more and better public transport, and our budget proves that. The budget that we handed down two days ago delivers a 15 per cent funding boost for rail, bus and ferry services across the TransLink network and delivers public transport infrastructure of a billion dollars. That is a billion dollars to be spent on the Northern Busway, the Eastern Busway, rail capacity upgrades to Ferny Grove and Darra and to bring forward the new Springfield railway line. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015963"></A>
Where does the only LNP administration stand when it comes to public transport? As the member for Bulimba said, yesterday I challenged Lord Mayor Campbell Newman to match the Labor government’s commitment to public transport funding. Instead, what did we get? The Brisbane City Council budget handed down yesterday on the Lord Mayor’s own figures--that is, figures that include both capital and operational spending--delivered a substantial public transport funding cut. On his own figures, last year the Lord Mayor delivered $231 million for public transport. I table the brochure in which those figures are included. </Hansard-Body>

This year the Lord Mayor delivered $205 million for public transport--a substantial funding cut. What is the figure that most matters day to day for Brisbane commuters? It is the operational funding for Brisbane City Council buses. When the LNP administration at the Brisbane City Council was elected in 2004 there was a longstanding fifty-fifty funding arrangement between the state and the council for Brisbane transport buses. What was the figure revealed in yesterday’s budget papers for the Brisbane City Council? Yesterday the Lord Mayor revealed that, at present, the Brisbane City Council provides 38.68 per cent of the funding for Brisbane City Council buses--a decline of 12 per cent in the five years that the LNP has been in power. If the Lord Mayor matched our funding there would be $40 million more for Brisbane City Council buses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015971"></A>
The Labor government is passionately committed to public transport and is delivering. We do not know what this LNP will do because they never say, but we do know that when the LNP are in power, as they are in Brisbane right now, they deliver public transport funding cuts.</Hansard-Body>

Very shortly we will hear from the opposition about what it proposes as an alternative government in its budget reply. In the last 12 months the opposition has been making itself a small moving target. When the budget was brought down on Tuesday, what did opposition members do? They went back to their electorates and whinged and whined and said there was not enough money for more government services or infrastructure that will drive jobs, yet at the same time they said that we had to reduce debt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015986"></A>
Here today the opposition has the opportunity to come clean and tell the people of Queensland what its proposals are. What services will it cut? What infrastructure will it cut? All we know is that the opposition went to the last election saying that it would put in place a three per cent productivity dividend which would have cut $1 billion out of the Public Service. In the former department of primary industries and fisheries, that would have meant an $11 million cut. That would have meant that you would have gone out and closed more and more departmental services in rural areas.</Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition) (11.30 am): This week’s state budget reconfirms two things in the minds of Queenslanders: Labor is not listening and Labor cannot be trusted. After almost 20 uninterrupted years in office, Labor is not listening when it comes to privatisation and is not listening when it comes to the spiralling costs of living. After almost 20 uninterrupted years in office, Labor cannot be trusted when it comes to balancing the books, cannot be trusted with our credit rating, cannot be trusted when it promises no new taxes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1206662"></A>
At no stage in the last 20 years has there been a clearer choice for Queenslanders, a more important choice for Queenslanders. It is a choice between the LNP, which has a plan for debt reduction; or Premier Anna Bligh and Labor, who believe in debt accumulation. It is a choice between the LNP, which has a plan to stop privatisation, stop the fire sale of $15 billion worth of assets; or Premier Bligh and Labor, who will pursue privatisation, pursue the fire sale of $15 billion worth of assets. Queenslanders have a choice between the LNP, which has a plan for job creation; or Premier Bligh and Labor, who want to tax mining jobs and who want to jeopardise jobs through privatisation, jeopardise jobs at Queensland Rail, at our ports and in our forestry companies and motorways. Queenslanders have a choice between the LNP, which has a plan to reduce the cost of living; or Premier Bligh and Labor, who believe in higher fuel prices, higher electricity prices, higher water charges, higher council rates and Labor’s higher road charges.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027182"></A>
On the most fundamental of issues on those core economic principles, Queenslanders have even more choices. It is a choice between the LNP, which has a track record of retaining Queensland’s always-cherished AAA credit rating; or Premier Bligh and Labor, whose only track record is to lose the AAA credit rating--the only mainland state to have lost it, much to our national and international embarrassment. Queenslanders have a choice between an LNP government prepared to stand up for Queensland and stand up to Canberra; or Premier Bligh and Labor, who will give billions of dollars in royalties to Canberra along with an entire health system. And it is a choice between the LNP, which has a clear plan to enshrine budget honesty and budget transparency; or Premier Bligh and Labor, who believe in fabricating costings, believe in making false election promises, even believe in introducing special laws to this parliament to ensure that the Treasurer and every minister do not have to answer truthfully one single question put to them by the budget estimates committee--the very committee designed to allow scrutiny of every claim made by every minister as a part of the 2010-11 budget.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027186"></A>
Two years ago the same Labor Treasurer and the same Labor Premier sat in those same two seats in this same chamber and gave exactly the same commitments that they give now. Two years ago they could manage the debt, they said. They were committed to a AAA credit rating, they said. Everything was fully costed, they said. Nothing would be privatised and no fuel taxes would be introduced, they said. The health crisis could be fixed, they said. Infrastructure was on time and on budget, they said. And our schools as a part of the Smart State were national leaders, they said. But, of course, Queenslanders know that everything that was said was a complete fabrication.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027189"></A>
Behind all the grandiose promises, all the grandiose claims, the grandiose projections, this Labor state budget gives the green light to record tax and record debt. Behind all the glossy brochures, behind all the tarted up graphs and charts, this state budget gives the green light to record hospital waiting lists and record traffic congestion. Behind all the audacious backslapping, behind the carefully rehearsed one-liners from the Treasurer, this state budget gives the green light to the mass fire sale, the privatisation of $15 billion in assets--assets owned by Queenslanders, the same Queenslanders who were never once asked if they approved of Labor’s fire sale.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027194"></A>
Behind the rhetoric, behind the glib dismissal of scrutiny, this state budget gives the green light to job losses, not job creation. It gives the green light to Labor’s job-destroying tax on mining and it gives the green light to Labor’s job-destroying privatisation agenda. Behind the scripted smiles on the faces of Labor MPs, behind the thousands of self-congratulatory media statements, we have a state budget that gives the green light to spiralling costs of living. The cost of fuel is up by 9.1c per litre thanks to Labor’s fuel tax. Electricity prices are up by 54 per cent since Labor privatised the retail arms of Energex and Ergon. Water charges, up; car registration, up; motorway tolls, up; and now the simple task of taking rubbish to the dump will also incur a tax, a tax of between $35 and $150 per tonne. After more than a decade of mining boom, Labor should have more to show than record debt and record taxes. And there should be money in the bank--money put away in the good times to help out in the bad times. But there is not. Where did all the money go and why were the warnings not heeded? Queensland deserves better. Queenslanders deserve better.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027198"></A>
In the past, state budgets and state elections have been about a competition of ideas to improve Queensland. Today they are a competition of ideas on how to fix Queensland. That is how much the landscape has changed during the almost 20 uninterrupted years of Labor governments in this state. This year’s state budget is defined by record debt--a debt that has climbed from $20 billion in 1999 to a debt of $51 billion this year, a debt that will grow to $83.5 billion in 2014-15. This year’s state budget is defined by deficit--the only mainland state with a deficit budget, an inability by Labor to spend within its means. Labor’s failure to spend within its means will ensure a $300 million deficit--a $300 million deficit this year alone, and Labor plans to operate with a budget deficit all the way from now until 2015-16. That means in total between now and 2014 deficits will total $6.5 billion.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027200"></A>
This year’s state budget is defined by spiralling costs of living--increases in fuel, electricity, water, registrations and road charges. This year’s state budget is defined by yet more dishonest projections--dishonest projections because it deliberately and calculatedly does not factor in the job impact and revenue impact of Kevin Rudd and Labor’s super tax on mining. This year’s state budget is defined by a job-destroying failure to deliver on capital works. We were told that the centrepiece of the 2009-10 budget was an $18.2 billion Capital Works Program--a program the government said was critical to creating jobs. We now know that was never delivered on. We now know that the government underspent its Capital Works Program by $880 million. That means 6,725 new jobs went astray. They were lost.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027236"></A>
In the forward estimates Labor has cut $22.3 billion of capital investment. That is the schools, roads and hospitals for Queensland’s future that will not be built because Labor has cut them from the budget. It also means that the federal government’s stimulus package was used as an excuse by the state government to cut its commitments.This year’s state budget is also defined by a government that refuses to listen to the public, that refuses to put a halt to its dangerous economic philosophy of selling off $15 billion worth of assets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027237"></A>
This year’s state budget is defined by record hospital waiting lists. The government’s answer to record waiting lists is to reduce the number of beds per person. In 2008-09 there were 2.34 beds per 1,000 Queenslanders. That ratio will now get steadily worse and fall to 2.3 beds--no improvement. It is the same for the ratios of police to population, of firefighters to population, of emergency services officers to population. This year’s state budget is defined by a blow-out in public housing waiting times, hurting battlers. It had been estimated that 21,000 people would be on the long-term social housing register, but it is now 28,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027238"></A>
This year’s state budget is defined not by a Smart State agenda but by a dumbed-down agenda when it comes to numeracy and literacy in our schools and when it comes to classroom behaviour standards. At primary school, the percentage of parents satisfied with their child’s school has again fallen. No wonder the government has announced that it will discontinue this measure in the budget papers. It is a similar story for secondary schools, where the percentage of parents satisfied with their child’s school has dropped an entire percentage point. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027239"></A>
This year’s state budget is defined by a record tax take--a tax take at a time when working families are already doing it tough. This government so often likes to dishonestly claim that a lack of infrastructure is all the fault of massive population growth--population growth that the government struggles to keep up with. It is a dishonest claim, because the government fails to mention that its tax take has grown at four times the rate--yes, four times the rate--of population growth. Between 1999 and 2009, Queensland’s population grew by 26 per cent--from 3.5 million residents to 4.4 million residents. For the same period, state government tax revenue grew by 104 per cent--from $4.6 billion to $9.4 billion. There is simply no excuse for a budget deficit. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027240"></A>
Sure, there are some welcome announcements in this budget debate--mainly small announcements. But, like all Queenslanders, no-one really knows anymore what we can believe and what we cannot believe from this 20-year-old Labor government. We often speak about a state budget in terms of large dollar figures. We use economic jargon that dehumanises the true impact of budgets and budget implications. So for a moment I want to talk about Labor’s mismanagement of the budget from the perspective of an average Queensland worker who woke up this morning in the average family home. If they were keeping a diary for this morning alone, this is how it would read. This is a day in the life of a Queenslander under Labor: ‘At 6 am, wake up and switch on the light. Power bill up 54 per cent. At 6.10 am, shower. Water charges up 47 per cent. At 7.45 am, get the kids in the car for the school run. Registration up 21 per cent. At 8.05 am, stop at the petrol station to fill up. Labor’s new fuel tax means another 9.1c per litre. At 8.10 am, traffic jams everywhere. Take the Gateway to try to save time. Tolls up 33 per cent. At 8.30 am, drop kids off at school. Queensland has one of the worst literacy and numeracy rates and standards in Australia. How did this happen in the so-called Smart State? At 8.45 am, get to work. I work for Queensland Health. Hope I actually get paid today.’ That is a snapshot of a day in the life--in fact, a morning in the life--of a Queenslander today, a Queenslander feeling the impact and paying for the impact of Labor’s economic mismanagement, Labor’s economic bungling.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027241"></A>
For all the promises that fuel taxes and registration increases would lead to more money for better roads, what do we find hidden in the detail of the state budget? We find that road funding is to be cut. In the 2008-09 budget, $3.83 billion was spent in the capital works budget for Main Roads. In 2009-10, this figure was reduced to $3.5 billion. In 2010-11--this year’s state budget--it is cut again to $3.3 billion. How does Labor explain that? As motorists pay Labor’s fuel tax, Labor spends less on roads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027242"></A>
There is a similar story with our power bills. Who could ever forget Labor’s decision to privatise the retail arms of Energex and Ergon? Who could forget the Premier’s own words when she gave this commitment--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027244"></A>
Most importantly, it does not matter where you live, nobody--not one Queenslander--will be worse off under the government’s proposal. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027245"></A>
Once again, the Premier’s words meant nothing. Electricity bills have skyrocketed by 54 per cent since Labor privatised Energex and Ergon. What do Queenslanders get for this massive increase in electricity charges? Under Labor, they get a cut in electricity investment. The capital works papers show that investment in energy generation will be cut by 48 per cent this year--cut in half. So while power bills increase by 50 per cent, Labor will cut investment in energy generation by 50 per cent. Investment in energy generation will be cut from $710 million to $367 million. Queenslanders pay more and Labor delivers less. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027246"></A>
Everywhere I go people come up to me and say, ‘I just want my Queensland back.’ That is the Queensland that used to be the economic powerhouse of Australia, the Queensland that was the nation’s job-creating engine room. That is the Queensland that could give you a hospital bed--not a chair and not a trolley but a bed and a bed on time. That is the Queensland that did not have a fuel tax, the Queensland that did not have to sell off everything in a panic fire sale. That is the Queensland where a balanced budget was a given, not when a balanced budget was a goal. That is the Queensland where a AAA credit rating was a given, not where a AAA credit rating was a goal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027247"></A>
Queenslanders, financial markets, columnists, rating agencies, analysts and the media do not judge a government on one single budget. Rather, they judge a government on a succession of budgets. They judge a government on its performance over a period of time rather than on a snapshot in time. They are looking for the government’s economic DNA. When it comes to Premier Bligh and Labor, that DNA has been identified. It has been found. Debt is in Labor’s DNA: $83.5 billion in debt is being racked up by this Labor government. Already, each and every man, woman and child in Queensland is carrying government debt of $18,700 each. It is a simple question that should be put to every Queenslander: can you afford to put another $18,700 on your credit card? No. Premier Anna Bligh and Labor have just put it there for them. We have to pay it back. And if it is not us, then our children and grandchildren will have to pay it back.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027248"></A>
Labor sent Queensland bust in a boom. Instead of bringing down a budget that reins in debt, Labor brought down a budget that confirms that, during the last year alone, another $9 billion was added to the state debt. As at 30 June last year, Queensland’s debt was $42 billion. As at 30 June this year, Queensland’s debt will be $51 billion and it is projected to peak at $83.5 billion. In Queensland there is now more government debt per person than in any other state. To compound the problem, there is still no debt repayment strategy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027249"></A>
One day after the state budget was handed down, the latest business index, the Sensis Business Index for small and medium businesses, was released. It finds that Queensland recorded a strong fall in business confidence among SMEs, with confidence now just below the national average. It finds that small and medium business support for the Queensland government recorded the largest fall of any state and territory during the past quarter. That means that the impact on Queensland business confidence from Kevin Rudd’s mining tax is the same as the impact of the global financial crisis. Queensland’s economic recovery starts the day that new sign goes up on our border that says ‘Queensland under new management’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027277"></A>
The LNP is determined to restore Queensland as the economic powerhouse of Australia. The LNP gives this commitment: restoring Queensland’s AAA credit rating will be the No. 1 priority of an LNP government--the No. 1 priority of Queensland under new management. The LNP also gives this commitment: we will introduce a requirement for an annual state debt repayment strategy to be prepared and updated each year. We will do this by introducing amendments to the Charter of Fiscal Responsibility, which comes under the Financial Administration and Audit Act, to require the government of the day to table a state debt repayment strategy as a stand-alone budget document.</Hansard-Body>

Never before has Queensland experienced the dizzying levels of debt that Labor has allowed to accrue. A state debt repayment strategy is not only important for Queenslanders and for Queensland taxpayers; it is also an essential tool for regaining the confidence of the financial markets and regaining the confidence of the credit rating agencies, the agencies that have been calling out for a clearly defined plan to reduce debt levels so Queensland can regain its once cherished AAA credit rating.</Hansard-Body>

As a part of ensuring taxpayers really do get value for money, as a part of ensuring there are no more special mates deals that escape proper budget scrutiny, we will ensure the most transparent contract system ever. The LNP gives this commitment: to ensure new levels of transparency in government, to ensure taxpayers are getting real value for money, every government contract over $500,000 will be published and publicly available for scrutiny. This is in sharp contrast to Labor’s $10 million threshold.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027280"></A>
The LNP understands that people want government to be more effective in what it does and to do it for less money. That means transforming the way the state goes about its business, using decentralisation, accountability and transparency to reduce dramatically the cost of government. We will bring the operation of government out into the open so that everyone can see whether we are delivering good value for money.</Hansard-Body>

The Bligh Labor government has a terrible record at managing procurement, with hundreds of millions of dollars wasted on mismanaged projects. This mismanagement is exemplified by the CorpTech whole-of-government payroll and HR project. Despite spending over $400 million between 2004 and 2008, this project was never completed. Government departments relying on the delivery of this project were forced to use stop-gap measures such as the Queensland Health interim payroll solution. This is the solution which, despite being switched on 12 weeks ago, still cannot correctly pay 70,000 Queensland Health workers. Today we heard the Minister for Health confirm that it may take as long as, or longer than, one year to get this right.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027282"></A>
The LNP’s commitment to publish all government contracts worth over $500,000 includes a commitment to publish all performance indicators, break clauses and penalty measures. Of course this extra level of budget transparency, this extra level of budget accountability, comes on top of two other policies the LNP has already announced. Already the LNP has announced its plans to rescind Labor’s laws that made it legal for ministers to lie to parliament’s budget estimates committees. The LNP has already announced--indeed already introduced--a private member’s bill to ensure truth in political advertising to make sure that never again will Queenslanders be taken for a ride with the false election promises, false scare campaigns and the false election costings that became the hallmark of Labor’s 2009 election campaign.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027283"></A>
Incredible as it may seem, the LNP’s No. 1 priority of restoring the state’s AAA credit rating is not a priority shared by Labor. It is, in fact, one of those core economic principles that divide us, a core economic principle that underlines--doubly underlines--the difference in economic policy and priority, the difference between the LNP and the Labor Party which sent Queensland broke in a boom.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027284"></A>
In his first 18 months as Treasurer, the member for Mount Coot-tha lost Queensland’s AAA credit rating. On the weekend, he claimed to now have a goal to retrieve it some time in the next four to five years and he would have us believe it was all part of his cunning economic plan to lose it in the first place. He was never given the task of attaining a AAA credit rating; he was given the task simply to retain the AAA credit rating. But the Treasurer failed. He now wants five years to retrieve what he lost in 18 months. Meanwhile, Queenslanders will be asked to pay another $1.2 billion in interest on our debt all because our credit rating has been downgraded, all because Labor cannot manage the books. If Queensland is ever to regain its credit rating, we must first understand exactly how it came to be lost. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027285"></A>
Last year the Premier made much out of her so-called Ministerial Charter of Goals, the goals and priorities she would demand of her cabinet ministers. Amongst the 40 pages of goals and priorities, nowhere was restoring our AAA credit rating mentioned--not anywhere. Restoring our AAA credit rating was so far removed from the priorities of this Labor government that it did not appear anywhere in 40 pages of goals for the Treasurer and cabinet ministers. When the LNP publicly exposed its absence, suddenly, like an afterthought, the words were added in a column lamely titled ‘Other Strategic Priorities’--other.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027286"></A>
Queensland did not lose its AAA credit rating because of some global financial downturn. We were the only state to be downgraded. Queensland did not lose its AAA credit rating because of a downturn in the resources sector, otherwise Western Australia would have lost theirs too. No, Queensland lost its AAA credit rating simply because of the economic amateur hour of the government. In the government’s Charter of Fiscal Responsibility it says that protecting Queensland’s cherished AAA credit rating was, ‘an integral part of the government’s commitment to the community.’ Well, the Treasurer failed to deliver on the most integral part of his charter, just as he failed to deliver on the most integral commitment in the so-called Toward Q2 document, the document the government said was designed to maintain Queensland’s AAA credit rating. It is the same Treasurer who ignored the warnings of the credit ratings agencies.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027287"></A>
Let us remember what ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor’s said on 20 February 2009 when Queensland became the only mainland state to be downgraded--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027288"></A>
Queensland’s balance sheet is unlikely to remain consistent with a ‘AAA’ rating. Standard &amp; Poor’s has previously indicated that the rating would be under pressure if net financial liabilities as a proportion of operating revenue reach 100-110%.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1027289"></A>
I want to repeat those words--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027290"></A>
Standard &amp; Poor’s has previously indicated ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027291"></A>
In other words, Standard &amp; Poor’s warned this Labor government and warned this Labor Treasurer. And what did this Labor Treasurer do? Well, he laughed and said that he knew better, just like he laughed yesterday in this chamber making out that he actually had the backing of the credit rating agencies. He does not seem to understand that the credit rating agencies downgraded him--they lost confidence in him. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027292"></A>
The credit ratings did to this Treasurer what they never did to Keith De Lacy or David Hamill, what they never did to Joan Sheldon, what they never did to Terry Mackenroth. The credit rating agencies stripped this Treasurer--and therefore Queensland--of its greatest economic asset, its greatest investment lure: its cherished credit rating. Just to ensure there was no doubting the economic buffoonery of this Labor Treasurer, three months later Moody’s also downgraded Queensland’s credit rating.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027293"></A>
Now the government was forced to revert to what it knew best: spin. The credit rating downgrade, Labor claimed, was all the fault of a global financial downturn and other states would soon be stripped of their rating too. More dishonesty--breathtaking dishonesty--so breathtaking, in fact, that Standard &amp; Poor’s was forced into releasing a special response on 17 March 2009. In that response they posed this question: why is Queensland the only state whose ratings have been lowered? What was the answer? Standard &amp; Poor’s said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1031311"></A>
The partial finances released on February 20 2009 suggested that Queensland’s debt burden would be significantly in excess of its trigger.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1031312"></A>
The special statement went on to pose the question: which state might be next to be downgraded? The answer--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027296"></A>
The outlook on six of the seven states is stable, which means that we do not expect the ratings on these states to be lowered based on interpretation of current and prospective conditions.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1027297"></A>
Then, on 20 May, Moody’s specifically said in relation to Queensland--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027298"></A>
The downgrade reflects the state’s deteriorating financial and debt performance and financial flexibility.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1027299"></A>
Against this backdrop of financial negligence, against this backdrop of financial incompetence, against this backdrop of a rank amateur hour performance by the Premier and the Treasurer, Queenslanders are looking for a government committed to job security and job growth. The LNP is determined to restore Queensland’s status as the job-creating engine room of Australia. In 1996-97 when the LNP was in government--then as a coalition government--Queensland was responsible for creating exactly 50.1 per cent of all new jobs in Australia; half of all the new jobs in Australia were being created right here in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027333"></A>
Last year, the 2009 calendar year, just 13.4 per cent of all new jobs in Australia were being created here in Queensland. And now, at the worst time possible, Kevin Rudd and Labor are threatening to stunt our jobs growth even further. Just as Queensland is looking to and hopeful for a return to the resources boom, Kevin Rudd and Labor have announced they are about to introduce a super tax on mining and mining jobs. Labor is about to tax the very industry we are relying on, particularly in Queensland, to drive jobs growth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027335"></A>
When it comes to job security and job creation, the LNP gives this commitment: in conjunction with Tony Abbott, Warren Truss and the federal Liberal-Nationals, the LNP will stop the super tax on mining and mining jobs. We have to protect Queensland jobs and we have to project Queensland’s share of its mining royalties if our state is ever to regain its once cherished AAA credit rating. In conjunction with a federal Liberal-Nationals government, an LNP state government will stop Labor’s super tax on mining, which means we can save jobs, strengthen regional communities and protect mining investments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027340"></A>
Critical to the rebuilding of Queensland’s economy is a strong understanding of Queensland. The Premier of this state last campaigned across Queensland hand in hand with Kevin Rudd. Kevin Rudd claimed that the Bligh-Rudd team was critical for Queensland. I challenge the Premier to give a commitment that she will again campaign with Kevin Rudd in the upcoming federal election. I challenge the two of them to walk hand in hand in front of the snapping photographers and TV cameras and again tell Queensland that they are the team for Queensland’s future. I challenge them to do this in the mining and regional communities throughout our state. Of course the challenge will not be accepted. Labor’s Kevin Rudd, who Queenslanders put so much misplaced confidence in, has sold out the very state that delivered him government. This Labor Premier believes that protecting Kevin Rudd’s job is more important than protecting the jobs of Queenslanders. She refuses to decline the federal presidency of the Labor Party. The Premier believes it is more important to be the national president of an organisation committed to job destruction in Queensland than it is to be the Premier committed to job creation in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027341"></A>
So often, by accident, political leaders throughout the world forget to talk about the heartland voters of their political opponents, but I do not think there is anyone in the LNP who does not feel for the people the Labor Party claims are its heartland. We may have had our differences over the years with some sections of Queensland that Labor claims is its heartland--I acknowledge that. But any differences we may have had have been based on an honest exchange and an honest divergence of views. Today there is no-one on this side of the chamber who does not feel for the Queensland Rail worker who may have voted Labor; who does not feel for the forestry worker who may have voted Labor; who does not feel for the nurse, particularly the unpaid nurse, who may have voted Labor; who does not feel for the ETU member, the QPSU member, the AWU member who may have voted Labor. They were conned. They were cheated. They were betrayed by a government and a Premier who concealed the truth, concealed the true policies of Labor, from the ballot box. And of course many were betrayed by their own union bosses who thought that it was more important to protect the job of the Premier than it was to protect the jobs of their own rank and file members. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027343"></A>
But the LNP’s mission to save jobs and to grow jobs knows no political bounds. The LNP gives this commitment: as a part of the LNP’s plan to secure jobs and to preserve our assets for future generations, we will put a halt to Labor’s fire sale of $15 billion in assets. If they are not sold, we will not sell them. If the contracts are not signed, they will not be signed. This is not just a common-sense job security policy but also a common-sense economics policy. We should harness these assets to return a constant income for Queensland. The income from these assets is needed to pay off Labor’s $85 billion of debt. Queenslanders cannot chance these assets and these jobs to a one-off fire sale. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027345"></A>
We all know that this debate is more than about privatisation; it is about debt and it is about honesty. The government went to a state election last year promising that its election announcements were properly costed, promising that it could balance the books, promising that privatisation was not on its agenda. We now know that Labor did not cost its policies, we now know that Labor could not balance the books and we now know that privatisation was always on Labor’s agenda. We now know why Premier Bligh and Labor rushed to the ballot box six months early. They rushed to the ballot box before the full impact and before the full ramifications of their economic mismanagement would come to light. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027346"></A>
If ever there was an argument to privatise these assets--if ever there was--it most certainly does not exist now. The so-called $15 billion hole Labor talked about is now halved. GST revenue to Queensland surged this year--the 2009-10 year--and the GST revenue will surge again in the coming financial year, and royalties are expected to add another $1.2 billion to the bottom line, up from $2 billion to $3.2 billion in 2010-11. If there never was a case for privatising these assets in the past, then there certainly is not a case for privatising these assets now. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1027347"></A>
Delivering jobs for Queensland means building Queensland. Last year the state government announced what it said would be an $18.2 billion Capital Works Program. We now know that program never happened. We now know that it was underspent by more than $892 million. We now know that that cost us 6,725 new jobs. The LNP is determined to lift Labor’s building freeze. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 We are determined to work with the private sector to streamline development approvals, fast-track vital infrastructure and of course give a meaningful commitment to public-private partnerships. The LNP gives this commitment: to help fast-track the rebuilding of Queensland, the LNP will once again make the Coordinator-General, who is supposed to be responsible for streamlining and fast-tracking important infrastructure, answerable to the Premier. Under this government, the Coordinator-General is answerable to a junior minister, ranked 11th in the cabinet line-up, effectively making the position powerless and unable to be of meaningful assistance to investors and builders. Under an LNP government, the Coordinator-General will be directly answerable to the Premier, directly responsible for fast-tracking and streamlining critical infrastructure, job-creating infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027352"></A>
When it comes to building Queensland, when it comes to delivering services for Queenslanders, we know that small business has a massive role to play. The LNP wants to re-empower small business. The LNP wants to make it easier for small business to retain a steady cash flow, a steady cash flow that allows it to pay bills, employ more people or pay for job-creating services. To help small business dealing with government, the LNP gives this commitment: during the course of its first term in government, the LNP will ensure government departments pay their bills within 30 days, not the current 90 days. Small businesses have to pay their bills on time and rely on the state government to do the same. In this simple way, government can do its bit to help small business, do its bit to help jobs growth in small business. Of course, where it is contractually agreed that payments can be made over a greater period, this policy does not change the terms of those contracts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027353"></A>
The LNP is also committed to jobs in rural and regional Queensland. Creating jobs in agriculture has always been a point of sharp contrast between the LNP and Labor. We know that Labor has embarked on a campaign to close down agricultural colleges--a deliberate plan to deter young people from a career in agriculture, a deliberate plan to reduce access to programs to upskill workers or potential workers in the agricultural industry. We know that Labor has gutted staff and therefore gutted the crucial support services for our agricultural sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027387"></A>
In 2009-10, the state government had budgeted for 800 full-time staff in agriculture, food, tourism and regional services. Of course, Labor never delivered on the 800 full-time staff. Instead of delivering, Labor cut. It cut the staff down to 716. To compound the problem, Labor now announces that it plans to cut staff again in the 2010-11 state budget to take it down to 708 full-time staff. So that is a cut from 800 staff down to 708 staff who are employed in agriculture, food, tourism and regional development. Again, we find another contrast between the LNP and Labor when it comes to budget priorities, when it comes to economic priorities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027388"></A>
The LNP is committed to protecting prime agricultural land for sustainable food and fibre production for generations to come. The LNP gives this commitment to the protection of prime agricultural land. As a part of the LNP’s plan to protect prime agricultural land for sustainable food and fibre production for generations to come, the most productive agricultural lands will be scientifically identified, be off limits to mining and be reserved exclusively for agricultural production.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027389"></A>
The role of governments is to identify lands and waters for national parks based on their pristine environmental value, create industrial reserves based on their suitability for industry and create tracts of land for development purposes. Similarly, the LNP believes the most productive agricultural lands should be scientifically identified, be off limits to mining and be reserved exclusively for agricultural production. We will differentiate top-quality agricultural land from other good-quality agricultural land. Such lands will be classed as category 1 (Strategic Cropping). </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027390"></A>
Just as it is unlawful to consider applications to clear vegetation in areas mapped as remnant vegetation, so, too, should it be unlawful to consider applications for open-cut mines on lands identified as top-quality agricultural lands. Food security, economic security, environmental security, biosecurity and national security are all dependent on Australia protecting prime agricultural land, protecting our ability to produce competitively on the domestic and international markets and protecting our ability to truly deliver a ‘Buy Australian’ campaign and withstand a flood of inferior imported produce and the associated disease and health risks.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027391"></A>
When it comes to food security, the LNP gives this commitment. Food security and Queensland’s trade capacity will also be enhanced under an LNP government with the creation of an independent Commission for Future Foods and Fibre. This commission will spearhead development of world-leading agricultural produce that will focus on food security at home and cement an international reputation for clean, green food. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027392"></A>
These commitments complement the LNP’s Resourcing the Regions policy, which will precisely track the flow of mining royalties to ensure all Queenslanders, no matter where they live, benefit from the wealth generated from the resource sector. We recognise that many areas of Queensland are experiencing massive growth in population and pressure on existing infrastructure due to the growth of existing and new opportunities from the resource sector.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027393"></A>
Despite these growing pains, the growth in the resource sector does not only represent a great opportunity for Queensland but, properly managed, also represents a great opportunity for regional centres and communities across the state. Under Labor, however, the enormous revenue generated from the resource industries in regional Queensland is not being reinvested in our communities. The $83.5 billion debt, coupled with the loss of Queensland’s AAA credit rating, means that more money than ever before is being eaten up in massive interest payments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027394"></A>
The LNP believes that growing our economy is the best way to start paying off the generational debt that Labor has allowed to accrue. We believe that the best way to grow our economy is to ensure our regions share in a meaningful investment into their communities--not just for services and infrastructure but also for long-term investment that ensures our regional communities have the best opportunity to develop economic resilience and adaptability to meet the challenges of the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027395"></A>
To underpin our Resourcing the Regions platform, the LNP will undertake precise economic modelling, to be published as a part of our first state budget, on the flow of mining royalties to ensure all Queenslanders, no matter where they live, benefit from the wealth generated from the resource sector. That is our commitment to economic transparency. That is our commitment to ensuring that the wealth created today is invested into industries, invested into communities, to diversify so that we can create the wealth of tomorrow. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027396"></A>
We all know that thousands upon thousands of jobs in rural, regional and metropolitan Queensland are dependent on the enormous and diverse tourism potential of our state. As the member for Surfers Paradise, I know the importance of this industry only too well. Tourism is doing it tough, but it has been made tougher by the state government’s failure to deliver on promises of extra flights, and it has been made tougher by the state government’s decision to hit drive tourism with the 9.1c per litre fuel tax. Labor’s fuel tax has zapped a major competitive advantage Queensland had over every other state when it came to drive tourism. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027397"></A>
It was amazing on Tuesday to listen to the Treasurer outline, in a half-hour speech, what he claimed was an economic vision and an economic plan for Queensland. Yet not once did the Treasurer utter the word ‘tourism’. Not once did he acknowledge the existence of this major driver of our economy. Not once did he say what sort of role Labor envisioned for the tourism industry as a part of rebuilding our once proud economy. Now we know why. The answer is contained in book 2 of the Service Delivery Statements. In this booklet, we find Labor’s secret plan to gut funding from Tourism Queensland--the state’s peak tourism marketing body. In this hour of need for the tourism industry, what has this Labor government gone and done? Labor has made an $8.8 million cut to the budget of Tourism Queensland--a 14 per cent cut to the budget of Queensland’s peak tourism marketing body. In 2009-10, the state government contributed $63.9 million in funding to Tourism Queensland. That will be cut to $55.1 million in this year’s state budget. This is an inexplicable, shameful and contemptuous cut to one of the state’s most prized job-creating industries.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027398"></A>
The government’s dismissal, its rejection, of regional job-creating opportunities is also mirrored in the Indigenous communities of Queensland. Labor’s blind pursuit of wild rivers laws prevents so many of our Indigenous communities in the cape from developing job-creating businesses. These laws would have to be one of the worst social and economic policies ever imposed by a government on our Indigenous communities. The LNP believes fundamentally in this philosophy when it comes to our Indigenous communities in the cape. The LNP believes in turning communities of welfare into communities of achievement and enterprise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027399"></A>
Of course, a large part of our state’s natural appeal rests on the protection of its natural environment. When it comes to protecting our environment, we believe that action is more important than words. The LNP gives this commitment: during our first term in government the LNP will consolidate the splintered environmental agencies--the EPA and the offices of clean energy and climate change--into one coordinated body charged with spearheading environmental protection. Protecting our environment starts at home, and that means having the world’s most pristine and protected environmental areas, not the world’s largest environmental bureaucracies. Where savings are made from reducing overlapping bureaucracy, the funds will be used to directly employ additional on-the-ground staff in areas such as our national parks. In the last 10 years the ratio of rangers in our parks has actually worsened, rising from one ranger for every 11,283 hectares of park land to one ranger for every 15,489 hectares of park land.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

During the rest of this week’s sitting, the LNP shadow ministers will speak in greater detail about the individual portfolios for which they are responsible, the individual portfolios that have been so mismanaged by an almost-20-year-old Labor government which is out of ideas, out of energy and out of credibility. They will talk about the four themes that define this government and this budget: debt, mismanagement, dishonesty and the spiralling cost of living. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027401"></A>
It is on that last issue that I want to close today. The LNP has seen the bitter disappointment that Queenslanders have felt towards this government. We have seen and felt the hurt and despair of Queenslanders who are paying out of their own pockets for the personal incompetence of the Labor Premier and the Labor Treasurer. We have seen the horror on the faces of Queenslanders as Labor MPs, the Labor Premier and the Labor Treasurer all had the audacity to congratulate themselves, all had the audacity to high-five each other, as fuel taxes went up, electricity went up, water went up, car registration went up--all because an uncontrolled Labor debt also went up. The LNP is committed to reducing the costs of living. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027402"></A>
The LNP makes this commitment to Queensland motorists: the LNP will freeze for its entire first term in office registration fees for cars and light vehicles along with recreational boats, trailers and horse floats. To help seniors and pensioners with the costs of living, the LNP makes this commitment: an LNP government will increase the electricity rebate by 30 per cent for seniors and concession card holders. This will take the rebate from $190 per year to $247. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027403"></A>
Queenslanders are being personally penalised, personally taxed by Premier Bligh and Labor simply to pay for the economic mismanagement that Premier Bligh and Labor have personally presided over. These announcements are the first stage of the LNP’s policy agenda to ensure the Queensland economy once again becomes the economic powerhouse of Australia. This is the first stage of the LNP’s policy agenda to help lower the cost of living, to restore confidence in this state, to give our state back the quality of services and to do it with honesty and integrity. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr NICHOLLS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Clayfield--LNP) (12.21 pm): On 12 May the <Hansard-Italic>
Brisbane Times</Hansard-Italic>
 ran the headline ‘Queensland budget will be as boring as Swan’s: Fraser’. Treasurer Fraser is quoted as saying that Queenslanders would see the same lack of big ideas, the same lack of razzle-dazzle, a complete lack of zing. The same lack of big ideas is certainly true. The Treasurer could have gone on to say that the Queensland budget would have the same sense of desperation, the same sense of debt, the same sense of deficit and the same sense of big new taxes on business as the federal budget. In fact, it is the same as all Labor budgets: debt, deficits and taxes. They would have been the truest words spoken or printed by Labor about the 2010-11 state budget because the bulk of the Treasurer’s budget statements are designed to obscure and confuse--obscure the real reasons for the parlous state of the Queensland Treasury and confuse Queenslanders about the real cost of Labor’s mismanagement and hide the real dangers of the mammoth state debt incurred by Labor. </Hansard-Body>

Prior to the last election, the LNP said that under Labor Queensland had gone bust in a boom. We pointed out the debt being incurred before the GFC, the $65 billion debt Labor racked up before the global financial crisis washed across our shores. We warned of the dangers of debt before the global financial crisis was a speck in the eye of the Treasurer and the Premier. We warned of the deficits--and there was more than one--that started back in 2007 that saw an accounting deficit of $1.6 billion in 2007-08 and a projected deficit in 2008-09 that turned into a very minor surplus because of some accounting tricks, but nevertheless that saw cash deficits in 2007-08 of almost $5 billion and in 2008-09 of almost $3 billion. We warned of mismanagement by Labor that saw costs in the public sector continue to grow unabated--costs growing by more than $1 billion each and every year, mismanagement that saw costs blow out on major projects and projects either delayed or delivered late. On its own figures government blow-outs exceeded $9 billion, and that was in the last three years alone. For example, the Gold Coast desalination plant, which was costed at $850 million then blew out by $350 million to $1.2 billion; the Wyaralong Dam, originally costed at $149 million then blew out to $333 million; the northern pipeline, costed at $300 million blew out by $400 million to $700 million; Airport Link, original state contribution, $47 million, final contribution $267 million; North Bank, that gleam in the eye of the Deputy Premier that was going to cost the taxpayers nothing--</Hansard-Body>

All of the warnings we gave about costs, about deficits and about debt blowing out turned out to be only too true. That was confirmed only yesterday, Wednesday, in <Hansard-Italic>

Thank goodness. It goes on--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027454"></A>
But it brings taxpayers back to the original question. How could Queensland, a state in the fast lane, have nothing in the bank to show for the last boom? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1027455"></A>
Here is his answer--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027457"></A>
Simple answer is the Sunshine State took growth for granted and ran the budget into the ground. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027458"></A>
There you have it, the simple answer for Queenslanders is Labor took growth for granted and ran the budget into the ground. Under Anna Bligh and Andrew Fraser and Labor, Queensland went bust in a boom. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027459"></A>
When people look back at the history of budgets under Labor they will see the classic example of how not to budget in a growth state: increase taxes, increase charges, new taxes and charges, sovereign risk and investment uncertainty--all the hallmarks of a failure to provide an adequate return for business, adequate certainty for business and an adequate environment for employment for business. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027461"></A>
What is the state of affairs today? We have had the Treasurer say that the deficit is down for 2009-10, but the fact is that it is still a deficit and a deficit despite significant increases in revenue both last year and projected for next year. So instead of receiving just over $37.1 billion in 2008-09 as budgeted for last year, Queensland in fact received almost $40 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion in one year alone. How much more is expected in 2010-11? Last year the anticipated revenue for that year was $37 billion. How much is the government now expecting? Over $40.5 billion. The numbers for revenue for the forward years just keep going up towards almost $42 billion by 2013-14. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027462"></A>
The Treasurer is indeed being disingenuous when he claims only that the deficit is less than last year’s forecast. He tells only one side of the story because he does not also say, ‘Aren’t we lucky? We have had all this extra revenue and it is going to be $2.5 billion more than we forecast last year.’ Where does that revenue come from? It is coming from growth in transfer duties, growth in land tax, motor vehicle registration and of course royalties and land rents of which by far the biggest contribution is coal royalties. It also includes Commonwealth grants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027463"></A>
Let me touch on motor vehicle charges and costs because this is something that affects most Queenslanders, particularly because of the decentralised nature of our state and the great distances many people have to travel to work, to play, to get to school, to see friends and relations and to attend medical appointments. Motor vehicle costs in Queensland have skyrocketed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027483"></A>
Members would do well to remember that just three years ago this government increased the transfer duty on motor vehicles by a whopping amount. The transfer duty on a six-cylinder car worth $15,000 increased from $300 to $575. Just last year annual registration jumped between 17 and 23 per cent depending on the size of the engine of the vehicle. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027484"></A>
For a six-cylinder car, a standard family car, the charge jumped to over $800. That is a car owned by ordinary families in Queensland. It is not the flash Prius that the greenies drive around in or that the chardonnay set over there want everyone to drive but an ordinary, regular car driven by ordinary, regular families. The cost has gone up and up and up. Last year we also had the abolition of the fuel subsidy. This government also increased tolls above the rate of inflation, and in some cases by 33 per cent, with further increases predicted for the next 12 months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027485"></A>
So the poor old motorist gets it in the neck from this government that wants to tax people off the roads but still fails to deliver an adequate public transport network and an adequate road network. Despite the extra revenue, it cuts its investment in roads in Queensland. We have said it long and loud and now even the RACQ is joining us. Queensland is the most expensive state in the nation in which to own and operate a family car, and it is all down to Labor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027486"></A>
What does the government do after adding all these taxes on to the poor old motorists and increasing tolls as well? It claims to be easing the pain by reducing CTP insurance by $20 and removing the HIH levy of $4. Search as we will, we will find in this budget no figures to support this promise. The reason for that is that it is not at any cost to this government. Heaven forbid that should be the case!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027487"></A>
Despite reaping hundreds of extra dollars from families from registration fees, despite all the new revenue amounting to $2 billion this year alone, Anna Bligh and Andrew Fraser still cannot help ordinary Queenslanders meet the increases in the cost of living. That is why we will introduce the vehicle registration freeze when elected. Queenslanders deserve some consideration from their government and this is a tangible way of doing so. Queensland motorists will stop being the milch cows for Labor waste and mismanagement. It will not be the paltry 6c a day that this government proposes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027488"></A>
Earlier in my speech I referred to debt, deficit and tax increases--the hallmarks of Labor budgets in Australia. Debt continues to rise under this government. The Treasurer made great store about a reduction in the total state debt. He lambasts those who criticise debt. He claims that we in the LNP are short-sighted about debt. It was the ALP and Labor who were short-sighted on debt. We have always pointed out the problems with debt incurred by this Labor government. Maybe some commentators have not liked it and maybe some even thought it was fair enough, but we knew the danger of debt and our warnings proved true. Queensland under Anna Bligh and Labor lost its AAA credit rating because those warnings were not heeded. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027489"></A>
Debt is no less this year. State borrowings are not going down. Debt is still increasing by another $9 billion over the next 12 months and over the forecast years it will still be going up--to $83 billion, and interest will be $5.4 billion in that year. That is $14.8 million a day, each and every day. The total debt amounts to $18,700 for every person in this state--every man, woman and child. There is no end in sight for the annual deficits--deficits amounting to nearly $6 billion over the next four years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027490"></A>
The Queensland state budget under Labor is a structural deficit brought about by an inability of this government to control the increases in its own expenses. Expenses under Labor continue to exceed revenue growth. To meet those expenses, the government continues to borrow more. To pay the interest on the borrowings it also has to borrow more. So the debt grows. Then out of desperation what do we have to do? We have to sell assets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027491"></A>
This is the vicious cycle started and presided over by Labor. That is why we will stop the asset sale when we are elected. Selling assets when you are in structural deficit is not going to stop the problem. You continue to have to borrow and you run out of things to sell eventually and you still have the problem. When there is a structural deficit you have to deal with your expenses. That is why reducing Labor’s debt and regaining our AAA credit rating is our No. 1 priority. Without reducing Labor’s debt, regaining the AAA credit rating is a fantasy. Without reducing Labor’s debt, a return to a strong surplus cannot be achieved. We know what Standard &amp; Poor’s says. It says that we have to reduce debt and have a strong surplus. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027493"></A>
Flogging off the family silver without addressing the underlying problem of a structural deficit is not a plan. Continually increasing taxes and charges is not a plan. Introducing a big new tax on business is not a plan. Labor has no plan. It only has knee-jerk reactions. That is why we will introduce a state debt repayment strategy. We will make it part of our charter of fiscal responsibility. We will publish the plan with the budget each year and Queenslanders will be able to read, measure and judge the plan. The plan will deal with the structural deficit. It will outline the need to manage the growth in government expenses. It will identify the importance of growth in the Queensland economy if we are to fix the state’s finances. A plan to repay debt is a necessity that this government has failed to address. We will not make the same mistake. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027494"></A>
Let us look at the government’s own charter of fiscal responsibility, which it is so proud of, and let us see how it is going. Principle No. 1 in the government sector is operating revenue to exceed operating expenses. What those opposite carefully fail to say here is that they do not include depreciation as part of this. So they actually take $1.5 billion out of the equation. No accountant, no economist, no manager would ever make that mistake, but here in Queensland that is exactly the mistake that is made. The true fiscal sustainability in the general government sector is the net lending or borrowing amount, which is forecast to be $7.3 billion deficit in 2010-11 and $5.7 billion deficit in 2011-12. This fiscal principle gets a fail. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027495"></A>
The next principle is own-purpose expenses. By its own account, in 2010-11 the government will fail to achieve this fiscal principle. Own-purpose expenditure growth of 5.97 per cent is anticipated above the real per capita constraint. That is another fail. That is two out of two fails. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027496"></A>
The next principle is to achieve a general government net operating surplus as soon as possible but no later than 2015-16. Notice that that is outside the forward forecasts of the budget. That is way out into the future. Any credible fiscal framework would target a net operating surplus within the time frame of the current budget forecasting cycle--that is, by 2013-14--not the sleight of hand or trick of putting it out beyond any meaningful measure. The measure is therefore not credible. It is meaningless to target 2015-16 as some far-into-the-future date--two elections away, in fact--to demonstrate basic fiscal responsibility. After the boom years of the last decade Queensland should be in a net operating surplus now, not waiting another five years. That is a fail on that measure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027497"></A>
The next one is a competitive tax environment for Queensland. Queensland has introduced a waste tax and dramatically increased the prices of electricity and water, with these rises in part driven by inefficient regulation and levies and a plethora of other regulations and red tape. They have the same effect as a drag on investment, jobs and growth as a tax. Further, agreeing to the Commonwealth government’s ridiculous super tax on mining is the absolute opposite of maintaining a competitive tax environment. By no equation can Queensland be considered to be having a competitive tax environment. That is a fail. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027498"></A>
The next one--net financial liabilities--is a fail. It should never have been allowed to get out of control in the first place. That is the thing that keeps our AAA credit rating. Then we have the doozy: target full funding of long-term liabilities such as superannuation. Well, whoopee do! That has been done for the last 40 years in Queensland. What are those opposite proposing? Is this the Treasurer’s next three-card trick--that we are not going to fully fund superannuation in Queensland? What a joke! The measures themselves are a joke and the government itself has not even met them. This government fails both in meeting its own fiscal charter and in setting the charter itself. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027532"></A>
If we are going to advance, if we are going to provide services Queenslanders demand, we must make Queensland the home base for economic growth. In simple terms, we have to grow the pie. Simply cutting it in different slices will not work. Productivity comes from efficiency in government spending, getting value for money, having the right regulation for the right industries and reducing the red-tape burden on business. Wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on poorly designed, poorly managed and poorly targeted capital expenditure does not boost productivity. How does spending billions on a desal plant that only runs at 30 per cent capacity--when it runs at all--boost productivity? How does spending $100 million on a driver’s licence that does nothing new or better increase productivity? It does not. How does increasing red tape and regulation of business boost productivity? It does not. How does introducing a big, new tax of $371 million increase productivity? It does not.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027534"></A>
The LNP is committed to making government more efficient in dealing with business in areas such as approvals and licensing; in lowering the regulatory burden on small business, not adding thousands of more pages of regulations; in regulating essential services in a predictable manner and free of ridiculous ideologically driven on-cost, and that is why our proposals for putting downward pressure on electricity prices will have a real effect. Those proposals will make the system work better. Costs will be contained and Queenslanders will be able to control their own use of power to control their costs. Truly, it is power to the people. We will do other things to improve the cost of living, as identified by the Leader of the Opposition in his speech earlier today.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027537"></A>
Last year I described the budget as the worst Queensland had seen in 150 years. It still holds that ranking, but this budget is little better. Debt is not quite as high and deficits are not quite as large, but in all other respects it misses the point. The Premier says she is building Queensland’s tomorrow today. The reality is that Labor is spending tomorrow’s income today. The increase in royalties from the mining boom is being spent on extra interest already. Queenslanders deserve more than a government that has run out of ideas and is running out of our money. Queensland needs an LNP government.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr SPRINGBORG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southern Downs--LNP) (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (12.41 pm): Nowhere is the ideological difference so clear and so defined as what we have seen in this parliament over recent days. The difference between the Labor Party and the LNP when it comes to financial management, when it comes to understanding business and when it comes to understanding government has been starkly contrasted in this parliament in the last two days. There has been an enormous contrast between the speech which was delivered by the Treasurer on Tuesday and the speeches which were delivered by the opposition leader and the shadow Treasurer today. It is very apparent to me that the government that sits opposite believes that money simply grows on trees. It does not believe and it does not understand that the supreme responsibility of government is to make sure that you grow the economy, to make sure that you create incentives, to make sure that you cut your cloth to suit, to make sure that you have a fundamental belief and application to the efficiency principle when it comes to spending taxpayers’ dollars in Queensland. If you do not understand that, then you will create a situation which leads to a downgrade of your credit rating, which leads to a blow-out in debt, which leads to a blow-out in deficit. That is precisely what we have seen under this Labor government in Queensland over the last 10 years, and it was warned.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027545"></A>
What does this government believe in? It believes in big government. This government believes in big tax. This government is fundamentally and principally anti business. That is why there has been a destruction of consumer and business confidence in Queensland over and above that which is the national average. Surely you should understand that private enterprise is the basic core of what government should be about serving--that private enterprise is the fundamental mechanism, the fundamental body, that actually creates the money which then is able to be used by government to then apply itself in the areas which private enterprise cannot necessarily deliver on for a range of reasons. The fundamental role of government is to understand that by human nature an individual wants to be encouraged to be able to achieve and encouraged to be able to invest and that when they achieve and when they invest they create more economic activity. When they create more economic activity, that creates more revenue in the state. That is one of the reasons why we are seeing a complete lapse of confidence not only in Queensland but also across Australia at the moment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027547"></A>
Today when the opposition leader mentioned the importance of fighting and fighting vigorously and fighting continuously against the so-called resources super tax, the government scoffed. The government laughed, because the government does not understand how the introduction of a so-called resources super tax is going to penalise the community at large, is going to punish incentive and is going to destroy incentive in Australia, particularly in Queensland and Western Australia which are so crucial to the economic viability and future of Australia. Let me put in simple terms what this resources super tax actually means. It is like this: if you decide to do overtime, you are taxed at a higher rate. If you decide to do overtime, you are going to earn more money so you are going to be taxed at a higher rate. What would happen under this super tax is not only would you be taxed at that particular rate but the government is going to look at the little bit that is left over and take another 40 per cent. Is it any wonder that mining companies and those major investors feel a lack of incentive? If you applied that principle to hard work and profit in the general community--that is, where you tax them once and then tax them again basically at the same proportion on what is left--is it any wonder that you are going to kill incentive and you are going to kill economic activity, and we are already seeing that? Again, this is another example of a government which is fundamentally anti business.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027548"></A>
The thing that really disturbs me and should disturb anyone who has watched what we have seen grow in this parliament over recent times on the government side is that government members do not know this fundamentally. It is alien to them. It is not in their DNA so they are not in a position to question it and take it forward. Why is that the case? Because they have never run their own businesses. They do not understand what business is about. They do not understand what incentive is about. They do not understand about the things that everyday businesspeople have to do in Queensland, and that is why they are removing themselves more and more from the implication of these policies which destroy incentive.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027549"></A>
We have also heard the government continue to blame the global financial crisis as being the great bogeyman for everything that is going wrong in Queensland and Australia today. The global financial crisis has had an impact, but it has not had the impact which the government says it has had. I have sat in this place when it has been the responsibility of the government of the day to deliver a balanced budget and to create and keep a Capital Works Program going during the likes of the Asian economic crisis, which had just as profound an effect, if not a more profound effect, on the Queensland and Australian economies as the GFC. I have sat in this place when Australia has been in a recession and have seen the impact that a recession has had on our economy in Queensland and across Australia, and most members have not sat in this place when we have been in recession.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027551"></A>
We have not been in recession for about 20 years and we are not in recession today. Even the Prime Minister says that we dodged that bullet and even the Premier comes into this place and says that we did not go into recession. If members think we are going to be affected collectively by a so-called global financial crisis which has touched us but our economy has continued to grow, then they should sit in this place when we have seen a revenue reduction as a consequence of negative growth under an Asian economic crisis or a recession. And do members know what? When I have sat in this place when we have had those events in the past the governments of the day have been able to balance their budgets. Conservative governments and Labor governments have been able to balance their budgets and have been able to deliver on a Capital Works Program and have been able to keep people employed and have been able to grow the economy, therefore creating more economic activity. This Labor government today is unable to do that because it is moribund of economic credentials and fiscal responsibility. In the early parts of 2008 our economy was seen as growing strongly and the then new Treasurer, Wayne Swan, was running around saying that we were overheating so much that we needed to take the baseball bat of higher interest rates to the overheating Australian economy. That was some six months before we even saw the popularly used term ‘global financial crisis’ come forward.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027586"></A>
We had the Senate economics committee being warned by Standard &amp; Poor’s that if Queensland kept up with its irresponsible spending, with its debt accrual and with its failure to manage within its means, then its credit rating would be under threat. It was the one Australian government that was placed on notice before the Senate economics committee in February 2008. So the members opposite should not come into this place spinning some sort of superfluous argument that it was all because of the global financial crisis. The warning signs were there months--if not years--before the term global financial crisis was even invented. They are the facts and if the members look at the <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
 record of this place they will see that to be the fact. Certainly, if one reads what was put before the Senate economics committee they would absolutely understand that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027590"></A>
The other questions that we need to ask are: why is it, as the Leader of the Opposition said earlier today, that the other Australian states have managed to run surplus budgets and that all other Australian mainland states have managed to retain their AAA credit rating? Why is it that the other Australian mainland states have been able to have levels of employment growth that are generally above that of Queensland? Why is it that other Australian states that do not have a resources boom or a resources based economy and the opportunities that go with that are able to now create levels of growth that are above and beyond that which Queensland is currently experiencing? That is a question that can be answered self-evidently by the fact that those states have had governments that have been more fiscally prudent and responsible in the way in which they have run their balance sheets.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027591"></A>
Only the day before even the New South Wales government, which is seen as the cot case of all Australian governments, was able to bring down a balanced budget, was able to provide an incentive of up to $20,000 in stamp duty reduction for homeowners, which is going to generate economic activity in its own right. That state has a level of debt that is much lower than Queensland’s--indeed, a level of debt about half of Queensland’s--and it is a state that has a population that is almost twice the size of Queensland’s. That state does not have a resources based economy as significant as Queensland and it does not have opportunities that are anywhere as broad as Queensland’s. Again, why is it the case that other Australian states are able to bring down balanced budgets and Queensland cannot? It is the administrative, managerial and economic incompetence of the Treasurer who sits opposite. That is the common denominator. This is a Labor government that has been spending like there is no tomorrow, that does not understand the fundamentals of fiscal prudence, that does not understand that it is not only the amount of money that you have coming in but also how you spend your money that counts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027592"></A>
A moment ago the shadow Treasurer pointed that out very adequately when he indicated the $9 billion in project cost blow-outs, which were evident in the past three financial years. If you do not manage your programs properly, if you let them blow out, if you are incapable of being able to plan properly the scope of the project to properly cost it and, more importantly, to properly deliver it, you are going to have blow-outs. When you have blow-outs you affect your budget bottom line. Imagine what would have happened if, instead of having $9 billion in cost blow-outs, we were able to put that money into our budget bottom line to deliver more jobs, more nurses, more doctors, more police officers, more firefighters and more officers in the other front-line service delivery areas of government. How many more capital works projects could have been delivered if it were not for the waste and incompetence of Labor? At the very least, we would have been able to wipe away the budget deficit, which this government has accrued in Queensland as a consequence of its incompetence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027593"></A>
I say again that, if this global financial crisis was as bad as the government makes it out to be, then why have all the other Australian mainland states retained their AAA credit rating? Why do they have balanced budgets? Why were they able to give decent, proper relief to their taxpayers in recent budgets?</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 They do not have the resources that Queensland has. As the honourable member for Gregory would know, in the eight years between 2000 and 2008 this Labor government, overseen for some of that time by the Treasurer opposite, accrued $34 billion in windfall revenue. That is revenue that was never budgeted. That is money that the government had beyond its wildest dreams. What did it do? It still went broke in a boom. It was still not able to deliver the fundamental public service expectations that Queenslanders have. It was also not able to deliver capital works without sending us into an unending debt spiral.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027596"></A>
The question that people continue to ask is: where did all of that money go? In recent days we have heard a mixed narrative from the government. It has tried to go out there, in a mincing way, to explain what it is going to do with the sale of Queensland assets. The government is saying that it is going to retire debt in order to retrieve our AAA credit rating. Yet the Treasurer was quoted in the <Hansard-Italic>

 yesterday as saying that, by the sale of Forestry Plantations Queensland, the government would be able to put money into social services such as those that were needed on the south side of Brisbane. Today the Minister for Health--who has an opinion on everything but the nurses’ pay debacle--stood up in this place and said, ‘When we sell these things we’ll be able to deliver some of our core responsibilities of government, including building hospitals.’ But the Treasurer then retreats to what is his so-called safe ground and says, ‘We’re going to sell this off to pay off debt.’ They cannot have it both ways. They cannot on the one hand say that they are paying off debt and on the other hand sell this stuff to continue with the fundamental responsibilities of government in the delivery of social services and the building of hospitals. It makes no sense. It is a mixed and minced narrative. The Treasurer knows that and, as a consequence, he should hang his head in shame.</Hansard-Body>

Honourable members should make no mistake when they look at the sale of the likes of Queensland Rail--an extraordinary asset that was started about 150 years ago. That asset was built up through the contribution of taxpayers and the extraordinary application of many Queenslanders. It was a great job creator in the early part of the 150 years of this state and it continues to be so. It will be sold overnight to pay the interest on 18 months of debt, if we can believe the Treasurer’s first assertion that the sale of assets was about debt repayment. But now over the past few days the government is walking away from that. It is saying that the proceeds of the sale of assets is going to go into running the arms of government and that it will not go into debt repayment. They cannot have it both ways. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027599"></A>
The other thing we need to understand is that the difference between the LNP and Labor on privatisation is very simple. We do not believe that you fire sale these assets. We do not believe that you sell these assets, particularly those that return a very good revenue stream to the state, and throw away that revenue stream, which should be working for the taxpayers of Queensland. If the government is going to take that step, then it needs to be honest and open with the people of Queensland, to bring them into its confidence and not play a confidence trick on them, as we saw this government do at the last state election. That is the fundamental difference between the LNP and the Labor Party: openness, honesty, transparency, proper fiscal management, making sure that you balance the books, making sure that you cut your cloth to suit, making sure that you grow your economy in Queensland versus a government that believes that the private sector is something that simply needs to be fleeced for the future, that needs to be bled dry as some sort of blood bank for the government so that it can continue with programs whilst not necessarily cutting its cloth to suit. That is the big difference. </Hansard-Body>

Certainly, one of the biggest issues that is faced by people in the electorates is the cost of living. So many people come up to me and talk about the cost of living--the cost of just simply putting food on the table and the cost of increasing interest rates. At a time when interest rates are increasing, which is causing a great degree of heartache and strain on families throughout Queensland, we are seeing the government put up electricity prices, we are seeing the government put up water prices, we are seeing the government bring in a fuel tax--which is pummelling the family budget--and we are seeing record registration increases. Therefore, I support wholeheartedly and absolutely the intention, if the LNP can wrest the reins of power from Labor in Queensland, to freeze registration increases over the next three years. That will ease the burden on Queensland families. That will ease the burden on Queensland businesses. That will reinstate confidence in the economy, which will also help to grow the economy. That, with the other initiatives that were announced by the opposition leader today, will go a long way towards restoring the confidence of Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

When it comes to running a government, it is not only individual announcements that make a big difference, it is the philosophy that underpins a government: being pro private enterprise, pro growth and smaller government versus, when it comes to the Labor Party, being anti private enterprise, no growth and larger government. </Hansard-Body>

I will turn very briefly to the portfolio of the Attorney-General. There are some extremely worrying signs for the people who consume justice services in Queensland. Only under a Labor government is it possible to spend more and deliver less. I will give members a classic example. When it comes to Legal Aid in Queensland, the government will tip in $12 million additional revenue this year. But is it going to deliver more services for Legal Aid clients in Queensland? No, it is not. For $12 million more in taxpayer revenue in Legal Aid in Queensland, the government will deliver 4,100 fewer grants of Legal Aid services. How does that add up? Labor spends more and delivers less.</Hansard-Body>

Twelve or so months ago we came into this place to pass telephone interception legislation--an essential crime-fighting tool and technique for our crime-fighting bodies in the battle against organised crime in particular. What has happened in the past 12 months? Not one single person has been employed to staff the operations of telephone interception powers in Queensland. Is it any wonder that Queensland again has been rated as the drug production capital of Australia? This government cannot deliver in any of its fundamental organs of government, let alone in the office of the Attorney-General. Is it any surprise that the people of Queensland are calling out for change and calling out for it to happen quickly.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Child safety is everyone’s business and the Bligh government is committed to protecting Queensland’s most vulnerable children and young people. That is why since 2004 this government has doubled the workforce and tripled the Child Safety budget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033635"></A>
I am pleased to introduce the Child Protection and Other Acts Amendment Bill 2010. The bill has two main functions. The first is to enhance the administration of Queensland’s Child Protection Act 1999 to enable it to respond more effectively to the individual needs of children at risk and in care. Secondly, the bill provides the legislative foundation for this government’s Helping Out Families initiative. That initiative aims to deliver the right type of service to vulnerable families as early as possible. Early intervention and prevention is one of my main priorities as child safety minister. Helping Out Families will strengthen the capacity of non-government early intervention and family support. This will be achieved through the establishment of a lead Family Support Alliance organisation and a network of service providers in three pilot sites--Logan and Beenleigh-Eagleby in October 2010, and Gold Coast by 30 January 2011.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033636"></A>
Under the Helping Out Families initiative, child safety service centres will refer a family, via their new regional intake service, to a Family Support Alliance organisation. To support this approach, referrals will be made from Child Safety Services to the Family Support Alliance organisation without requiring the family’s consent. The bill provides amendments to the Child Protection Act 1999 to allow this information to be provided and to ensure the referral information remains confidential. Under the new system, supported by this bill, the Family Support Alliance organisation will be established to receive this information, engage the family and coordinate the most appropriate response.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033637"></A>
Indigenous family support organisations will link with the Family Support Alliance organisations to provide services to Indigenous families in the three pilot sites. The government has allocated $8.5 million state-wide to Indigenous family support organisations. The bill will require the consent of families for information to be supplied to other services beyond the Family Support Alliance organisation, and this will be part of their engagement process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033638"></A>
As mentioned, the bill also includes amendments to the Child Protection Act 1999 that allow our statutory child safety system to respond more effectively to the individual needs of children at risk and in care. These include: enshrining the safety and wellbeing of children, along with the best interests of a child, in the paramount principle that guides all decision making; including a framework of principles to improve decision making to promote children’s safety, wellbeing and best interests; recognising the important role of long-term guardians, other than the chief executive; enhancing the ability of Child Safety Services to secure the safety of children in need of protection; recognising the cumulative nature of harm; overcoming barriers in the gathering and sharing of information when responding to allegations of child abuse or concerns about unborn children; and creating a new three-business-day temporary custody order. The department can apply for this order where it already holds the view that a child is in need of protection and does not need to conduct an assessment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033639"></A>
The bill will also amend the act to give the court a discretionary power, when it declines a further order, to set a future end date for an existing child protection order. The future end date will not be more than 28 days after the day of the court’s decision. This is to ensure that Child Safety Services can have time to prepare and assist a child to return to their parents’ care in a planned way that minimises disruption and trauma to the child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033640"></A>
To emphasise the importance of stability in decision making about a child, the bill will also amend the Child Protection Act 1999 so the Children’s Court must have regard to the child’s need for emotional security and stability before deciding whether to grant a further short-term order or an extension to an existing short-term order. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033641"></A>
The bill will also recognise stability for children of arrangements under long-term guardianship orders. Long-term guardians are often related family members and it is appropriate to recognise their important role in providing stability for the children in their care. Currently when an application is lodged with the court to revoke a long-term guardianship order the act specifies that the court may revoke the order if it is no longer necessary to protect the child. The bill will change this so that the court must also consider the child’s need for emotional security and stability. This will acknowledge the importance of a stable home, emotional security and the child’s attachment to their guardian developed over time. The bill also gives children and long-term guardians who are not the chief executive more control over when their case plan will be reviewed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033642"></A>
These and other significant changes are outlined in the bill’s explanatory notes and are administered under the principle that the safety, wellbeing and best interests of a child are paramount. I commend the previous child safety minister, the member for Albert, Margaret Keech, who laid much of the groundwork for these amendments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033643"></A>
The policy positions underpinning these amendments were set out in the policy paper <Hansard-Italic>
Proposing amendments to the Child Protection Act 1999</Hansard-Italic>
. Widespread consultation was undertaken and the high level of response from both government and non-government stakeholders shows the Queensland community’s strong interest in protecting our children and young people. The proposals in the paper were generally supported and I thank PeakCare Queensland, Foster Care Queensland, CREATE Foundation, Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Protection Peak, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service, Queensland Aboriginal and Islander Health Council, South West Brisbane Community Legal Centre, Historical Abuse Network, Save the Children, NAPCAN, Legal Aid Queensland, QCOSS and the Queensland Law Society for their feedback which informed the refinement of the amendments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033644"></A>
Child protection is everyone’s business and this government is committed to protecting our most vulnerable children and young people. This bill will enable our tertiary child protection system to work hand in hand with the non-government sector to better support families in need before they require ongoing statutory intervention. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033645"></A>
As well as enhancing the administration of the Child Protection Act and providing the legislative framework for the Helping Out Families initiative, the bill also contains a range of other amendments to the Child Protection Act 1999 aimed at achieving better outcomes for children, young people and their families and technical amendments to a number of acts to support the original policy intent of the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Act 2010. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms JARRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Whitsunday--ALP) (2.39 pm): What an amazing morning it has been. This morning we have seen a conga line of LNP speakers stand in this place and say that they do not believe Queensland suffered any adverse impacts from the economic downturn that enveloped the world. They are GFC deniers who simply do not understand the real challenges of government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033684"></A>
But we have seen the first small glimpse of the brave new world that would emerge in this state should the LNP ever get their hands on the levers of the economy. It is the sort of world where money magically materialises from a hole in the wall and never has to be accounted for--because, if it did, we would see that their spending had bought us a mountain of higher debt and deficits that would end in a whole world of pain for Queensland. That is right--60 minutes on his feet and the leader had not one reference to how the LNP would pay for their promises. The equation is very simple: the LNP will either have to lead Queensland down the path of even higher debt and deficit or freeze building projects and sack Queenslanders, or increase taxes and charges. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033685"></A>
There was not one word about debt repayment strategy and the cursory mention of asset sales was a yes, but no, but maybe response. Queenslanders are none the wiser about what an LNP government would mean for them, and I think they have every right to be suspicious that it would spell disaster for employment and disaster for our hopes of regaining our AAA credit rating. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033686"></A>
What a contrast to the clear and unambiguous plan spelled out by the Bligh government earlier this week--a plan that is already well on its way to realising our key objective of maintaining and creating jobs. I congratulate the Treasurer on today’s job figures that yet again demonstrate his ability to deliver for Queensland. Almost half of the 18,400 jobs created in Australia last month were created right here in Queensland. That is 8,800 jobs in one month and most of them full-time jobs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033687"></A>
As I listened to the Treasurer deliver his budget speech this week, I reflected upon his opening statement and its relationship to the wellbeing of this state. The Treasurer reminded the parliament that, while the government has faced some tough choices in recent years, it has been our decision to put the dignity of work at the epicentre of our policy and budgetary platforms, and today’s job figures reinforce the wisdom of that decision. Our commitment to job creation through the rollout of the biggest infrastructure program in the country has reaped dividends beyond forecasted levels by providing thousands of jobs for Queenslanders and supporting growth at around three per cent in 2009-10, some two per cent above expectation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033688"></A>
In my opinion, nothing is more important to an economy during uncertain times than to outline a plan and stick to it. For small business--which, after all, makes up 96 per cent of all businesses in this state--it is a strong, stable economy that provides the best environment for them to tackle the other challenges like the credit squeeze and the loss of consumer confidence. And a strong economy cannot exist in parallel with high unemployment, so our infrastructure program has been absolutely critical to the state’s progress.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033689"></A>
Yes, times are tough, and in my electorate the tourism sector is experiencing a real challenge as visitor numbers slump due to a more conservative approach to travel by people right around the world. But it does not bear thinking about how much worse it might have been if this government had not embarked on our infrastructure program, if we had simply taken a decision to roll up into a ball in an attempt to ride out the GFC. With 2,000 people moving to the state each week, an economic retreat would by now have seen demand for roads, schools, hospitals and electricity rise above any government’s capacity to fund it. It has been our commitment to our infrastructure program that has provided jobs, kept local economies turning and seen vital infrastructure built right across this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033690"></A>
Indeed, our building program represented seven per cent of the state’s economy in 2009-10 and supported 120,000 jobs for Queenslanders. That is just a little less than the mining sector contribution to the state’s economy. As I travel around Queensland in my role as parliamentary secretary, I have visited a number of large provincial cities where almost literally the only construction projects occurring are projects funded by either state or federal governments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033691"></A>
In the Mackay-Whitsunday region it has been projects like the duplication of the Mackay Bucasia Road, the building of the Edmund Casey Bridge, the duplication of the Forgan Bridge, the expansion of the Abbot Point coal loading facility and the creation of a third Great Walk in the region that have kept the wheels of employment turning, notwithstanding that we have been more fortunate than some regions in terms of private sector activity. Into the future, projects like the redevelopment of the Whitsunday Coast Airport, the Mackay Hospital development and upgrades to the Mackay showground will continue this trend. I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
, and I have passed that by the Deputy Speaker. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033697"></A>
Leave granted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033698"></A>
As I mentioned earlier, one of the main industry sectors in my electorate is tourism and at the moment things are a bit grim for many of the small businesses that are either directly or indirectly reliant on tourism. I’m grateful therefore that Tourism Queensland will continue to take advantage of the $36 million of additional funding announced at the last election to help assist the industry through these difficult times. With a total budget of $63.7 million this financial year the focus would be on investment in activities that target Queensland’s five biggest international markets--New Zealand, the UK, Japan and China.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033699"></A>
This effort will include cooperative marketing campaigns with key partners, working with travel trade, providing publicity, supporting trade missions and working with airlines to encourage new routes and increased capacity.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033700"></A>
I am very hopeful that with the completion of the Whitsunday Coast Airport redevelopment due by the end of this year, we can soon begin to work with the airlines to secure additional flights into the Whitsundays. This is absolutely essential if we are to grow and take advantage of the recent and proposed development in our region.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033701"></A>
We are fortunate to still be reaping the benefit of TQ’s most successful Best Job in the World campaign and I fully support the range of ancillary campaigns that have built on the success of this promotional genius. One of the latest campaigns launched by the Minister is the Season of Sailing campaign that alerts would-be visitors to the wealth of opportunity in Queensland during the winter sailing season. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033702"></A>
If I can be parochial I would say that the Whitsundays is the home of sailing in Australia and with the Airlie Beach Race Week and Hamilton Island Race Week just around the corner, there is every reason for people to book in to watch or participate in their own sailing adventure. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033703"></A>
Of course the other sector to be feeling the downturn in my area is the construction industry. I am confident that the Bligh Government’s focus on regionalisation will help to spark a resurgence in people choosing to move to and build in our area.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033704"></A>
Regional areas such as Mackay Whitsunday will surely benefit from the introduction of an additional $4000 towards the first home owners grant. This windfall will provide a much needed boost to the local construction sector and encourage more people to regions like ours. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033705"></A>
A growing population is being met by increases in essential services and this means more teachers and teacher aides, more doctors and more nurses, and more police throughout Queensland. In this financial year we have budgeted for 720 new nurses, 180 new doctors, 300 additional allied health workers, 203 more police officers, 316 teachers and teacher aides and 75 additional ambulance officers.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033706"></A>
As one of the state’s fastest growing regions we will certainly see our fair share of these positions taken up in our communities. This of course means more housing construction and a boost to the local economy.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033707"></A>
Our government’s focus on improving education for all has been borne out in the government’s commitment to deliver 240 new kindergartens across the state and I’m pleased to say that 3 of these will soon be located in my electorate. The Seaforth Kindergarten has already been announced and plans are well advanced. I’m delighted that in one of the fastest growing areas of my electorate, the Eimeo Road State School will receive a double unit kindergarten in the next round and that Emmanuel Catholic School has been identified as the site of one of the 40 new fast-tracked kindies.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033708"></A>
Together with our support for long day care centres to upgrade training to provide a kindergarten program for 3-4 year olds, this roll out of kindies means a better start for local children and that’s great news for families.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033709"></A>
At the other end of the education spectrum I also welcome government initiatives that will ensure the training and skilling of our workforce. In particular, I welcome the Treasurer’s decision to extend the 125% payroll tax rebate for apprentices and trainees and the $10 million to continue the development of the Mackay Trade Training Centre at the TAFE in Mackay. As a major hub for the mining services and agriculture sectors, many of our young people look to these sectors for work following school and it is important to encourage businesses to continue to take on apprentices and trainees in these areas.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033710"></A>
There are great jobs available in our own region and these initiatives will encourage our young people to stay and work in their own backyard rather than leaving for work in the capital city or even overseas. I look forward to the work of the new Skills Commission adding value to these opportunities in regional Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033711"></A>
This year for the first time the state health budget stands at $9.99 billion. As our population ages and treatment expectations continue to rise, we are pouring more and more money into the health sector. We are the grateful recipients of this increased funding as evidenced by the opening of new maternity and post-natal services in Proserpine and a mums and bubs drop-in facility in Cannonvale. Probably the single biggest commitment of funds in the health sector though is the redevelopment of the Mackay Base Hospital and the budget contains further funding to keep this important regional project on track.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I also welcome the decision to establish a new service for children with autism in Mackay and the funding to ensure a doubling of the number of children who receive a cochlear implant to overcome hearing and speech difficulties. What a wonderful gift to offer the sense of hearing to a child. This is a worthy funding program that I know will bring joy to many.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033713"></A>
I also acknowledge the importance of the decision to establish a pain centre at the Townsville hospital. This will be the first time that this service will be available to regional Queenslanders without the need to travel to Brisbane. Living with chronic pain diminishes the quality of life so I welcome the support that will be provided to my constituents through this initiative.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

This budget has achieved a fine balance between a focus on hard infrastructure provision with a $17.1 billion capital component, and a focus on delivering support to families and the most vulnerable members in our communities.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr RYAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Morayfield--ALP) (2.45 pm): It is indeed an honour to rise in this parliament as the state member for Morayfield and contribute to the debate on the 2010-11 Queensland state budget. Around the world, governments and economies continue to face some of the toughest economic and financial challenges since the Great Depression. Around our state, Queenslanders continue to experience tightening household budgets and employment uncertainty. Whilst economic outlooks may have marginally improved since last year, the current circumstances nonetheless demand that we must stay on course. If we had not acted decisively, if we had not decided to continue building a modern, contemporary Queensland, then we would have denied the dark realities of the moment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033718"></A>
With this state budget this state government is continuing to build the Queensland of tomorrow. With this state budget this state government is delivering real and practical support for vulnerable, marginalised and disadvantaged Queenslanders. With this state budget this state government is creating and supporting jobs for Queenslanders by delivering the public services and public infrastructure desperately needed in our communities. This is a budget for a modern Queensland, and I am proud to support it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033719"></A>
The 2010-11 Queensland state budget continues the work of last year’s budget, of reprioritising the role of government. In these contemporary times we must focus on the proper role of modern government. This focus means investing in people. This focus means providing strong, stable and compassionate government for the Queensland of today and the Queensland of tomorrow. This 2010-11 state budget continues the government’s investment in strategies which create and support jobs and expand the infrastructure building program, which is delivering new public assets like new hospitals, new schools, new public transport infrastructure and new roads for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033720"></A>
It is for those reasons that the people of the Morayfield state electorate will welcome the initiatives and projects funded in this year’s state budget. From a local perspective, I am very pleased to see that the full upgrade of Narangba Railway Station will be funded in this year’s budget. Along with the state member for Kallangur, I have been vocal in my advocacy for this critical infrastructure improvement for the Narangba community. The full upgrade of Narangba Railway Station will not only improve disability access to this busy train station but deliver more commuter friendly facilities for rail users. I would like to thank the Treasurer and the Minister for Transport for their support of this important infrastructure project for the people of the Morayfield state electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033728"></A>
In addition, this state budget provides funding for the commencement of the four-lane upgrade of Morayfield Road from Uhlmann Road at Burpengary to Gaffield Street at Morayfield. I am especially pleased to see that these roadworks are expected to commence within the next 12 months. Whilst I take this opportunity to thank residents of the Morayfield state electorate in advance for their patience during construction, I am sure that all residents will be excited, as I am, that this long-awaited road project will soon be underway. This commitment is outstanding news for the Morayfield state electorate. I would like to thank the Premier, the Treasurer and the Minister for Main Roads for their strong support of this construction project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033783"></A>
I note that this budget also allocates $472,500 to upgrade parts of Raynbird Road at Narangba and $335,000 to upgrade parts of Oakey Flat Road, which is also at Narangba. These upgrades will be warmly received by users of those roads. In addition to funding these infrastructure building projects, funding will also be allocated to plan the provision of a new facility for integrated community based health care at Caboolture, to build new classrooms at Caboolture Special School and to complete a new zone electricity substation at Burpengary. These building projects will not only deliver the public infrastructure needed for the rapidly growing Morayfield state electorate; they will create and support local jobs during construction. These projects are concrete proof of this state government’s commitment to provide new public assets for Queensland and support jobs for Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033788"></A>
This budget also delivers on this government’s commitment to support vulnerable, marginalised and disadvantaged Queenslanders. Madam Deputy Speaker, in light of the time, I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my budget speech in <Hansard-Italic>

The decisions made by the State Government in this year’s budget allow the Government to continue supporting jobs and infrastructure expansion around Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033802"></A>
Governments cannot be all things to all people. But government can make decisions to support jobs and help marginalised and disadvantaged people by investing in public infrastructure and public services. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033803"></A>
This year’s budget does that.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033804"></A>
From a broader Queensland perspective, I am pleased that this year’s budget contains the following measures: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1033805"></A>
• 	A $24 per annum cut to CTP insurance on car registration;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

I am pleased that the 2010-2011 Queensland State Budget is delivering critical public infrastructure and key support measures for the people of the Morayfield State Electorate. I commend the Appropriation Bill to the House and encourage all Members of this House to support this year’s State Budget. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr WETTENHALL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Barron River--ALP) (2.50 pm): I rise to support the Appropriation Bill 2010. Off the back of a global financial crisis that wiped out more than $7 billion of state revenue, the 2010 state budget has been framed around maintaining our $17 billion infrastructure program that supports 106,000 jobs in this state. That commitment to building the hospitals and community health centres, schools and TAFEs, social housing, roads and bridges, public transport, courts and prisons, and police, fire and ambulance stations has steered this state through the global financial crisis towards 3.75 per cent economic growth and falling unemployment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1206699"></A>
As most builders in Cairns will probably readily concede, state government capital projects and stimulus measures together with the Commonwealth government’s stimulus have saved the Cairns construction sector from grinding to a virtual halt. But it is not just our government that has played a part in avoiding a crippling recession; every Queenslander has played their part in building our state every time they have paid their payroll tax, stamp duty, land tax, car and boat registrations, or even electricity bill. Many workers have shouldered the burden with reduced hours. Some have lost their jobs altogether. Employers, particularly in small and medium sized enterprises, have shaved costs and done what they can to hang on to loyal, trusted and experienced staff.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033817"></A>
This government’s unwavering commitment to building is demonstrated by the fact that we have the highest capital expenditure per capita of any Australian state. It is achieved whilst maintaining Queensland as the low-tax state, with Queenslanders paying $418 less tax than they would in other states. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033818"></A>
This Labor government knows and understands that people are doing it tough. That is why I am particularly proud that we have found room in this budget to give people in need a helping hand by boosting electricity concessions for pensioners, by cutting the cost of compulsory motor vehicle insurance and by introducing new measures to help people with particular needs. These are modest measures, but they will make a real difference for people struggling to balance their household budgets.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033819"></A>
Cairns and the Far North have been particularly hard hit by the global financial crisis. Unemployment reached nearly 14 per cent in the last quarter of 2009. The members for Cook, Cairns, Mulgrave and I took a recovery plan to the Premier and Treasurer late last year. I am proud that this government recognised and responded to those circumstances with a targeted suite of stimulus measures contained in the $116 million Cairns economic future plan, launched in November 2009.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033820"></A>
The key features of that plan were supporting new and traditional industries by positioning Cairns as a business gateway to Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Rim, building Cairns as an aviation hub, growing the marine industry, supporting and strengthening tourism and primary industries, and establishing Cairns as a key player in the global expertise market. New job creation programs, accelerating key infrastructure projects and developing the skills base for the workforce of the future were also major components of the plan. The Cairns economic future plan was designed to support an estimated 760 new jobs, and it is starting to yield results. This budget builds on that foundation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033821"></A>
Unemployment is coming down, with the latest figures showing a significant drop to around 10.5 per cent. This is of course still a high figure, but we are heading in the right direction. Housing starts are on the rise, and the new $11,000 regional first home owner grant will undoubtedly stimulate new residential construction in Cairns. Infrastructure projects--like the redevelopment of the Cairns Base Hospital, the construction of the Cairns North Community Health Centre, the new state government offices in Cairns and Mareeba, the heritage listed Cairns Cruise Terminal and the redevelopment of Cairns TAFE--are not only providing crucial construction jobs but laying the foundations for future growth in key industries such as tourism. Madam Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech in <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
. It has been shown to the Speaker’s office.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033822"></A>
Leave granted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033823"></A>
Mr Speaker, this budget not only supports these key infrastructure projects, but contains funding commitments for new projects. Two are of particular significance for Cairns and the Barron river electorate. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033824"></A>
Mr Speaker, not only does Cairns and the tropical north offer the world famous natural attractions of the Great Barrier Reef and the tropical rainforests, our region has produced a vibrant arts and cultural sector enriched by Aboriginal and Torres Strait cultures and a diverse multicultural community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033825"></A>
Somewhat surprisingly, our city lacks a dedicated facility to showcase the cultural heritage of the region and to enable large scale performing arts events that locals deserve and visitors expect. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033826"></A>
Our city is served by an ageing 600 seat auditorium built in the mid seventies that is well past it’s use by date.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033827"></A>
The case for a new performing arts centre and museum to form a cultural precinct on state owned land on the Trinity Inlet waterfront in the city centre is compelling and has become a rallying point for the Cairns community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033828"></A>
The cultural precinct proposal has emerged as the number one priority project for the region and the alignment of civic, business and political support for the project is, I believe, unprecedented.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033829"></A>
The announcement in the budget that the Bligh Labor government will contribute one third of the construction costs of the new cultural precinct has been warmly welcomed in our community and will prove to be a great confidence boost for the regional economy even before the foundation stone is laid.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033830"></A>
$2.5 million will be contributed toward the design costs and the prime waterfront site worth $40 million will be transferred for a peppercorn rent.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033831"></A>
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Premier for her personal support for this project. As Premier and Minister for the Arts, Anna Bligh has listened carefully to the representations made by her far northern Labor MPs, she has listened to the mayor of Cairns Regional Council Val Schier and the business and community leaders who have lobbied strongly for the project.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033832"></A>
Mr Speaker, the other budget announcement of which I am particularly proud is the decision to allocate $25 million for the capital costs of establishing clinical training facilities at the James Cook University dental school at the Smithfield campus in my electorate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033833"></A>
The far north has a high need for oral health services and a chronic shortage of dentists to meet that demand. To their credit, both the university and the federal government have recognised this issue and the new dental school currently under construction is the result.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033834"></A>
Like all medical disciplines, dental students need opportunities for supervised clinical training before they can practice their profession. State of the art teaching facilities at the new dental school enable students to undertake clinical training from the third year of their five year undergraduate degree course.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033835"></A>
Our funding commitment will provide 60 dental chairs at the Smithfield campus which will not only complete the “missing link” in the dental school but will dramatically increase access for eligible public patients for dental health services for people who live in Cairns and throughout the region.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033836"></A>
The experience of medical and other professional disciplines shows that teaching and training students in the regions significantly improves the likelihood of them staying in the regions to practice their profession. This gives me great confidence that JCU dental students will stay in the north and make a huge improvement to oral health.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033837"></A>
I also believe that a world class dental school will attract overseas students and fuel enrolment demand at JCU which is already experiencing strong growth across its course offerings.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033838"></A>
I want to take this opportunity to thank the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health Paul Lucas for his support for this crucial education and public health initiative for the far north.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033839"></A>
Mr Speaker, there are a number of other funding commitments in the budget that will be of immense benefit to the people of the Barron River electorate that I wish to briefly mention.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033840"></A>
Building on the reputation of Smithfield State High School for excellence in science and technology, four science laboratories are to be completely refurbished this year at a cost of $1.14 million and $1 million has been allocated to plan stage 4 of the rapidly growing Redlynch State College.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033841"></A>
Improving roads with a particular focus on road safety in my electorate continues to be a high priority and $2.2 million is allocated for various projects including widening narrow sections of the Kuranda Range Road, surface improvements on the Captain Cook Highway, a new bridge on Redlynch Intake Road and new bike paths.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033842"></A>
Supporting vulnerable people in our community is always a core objective of this Labor government. Many services are delivered in partnership with the community sector. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the management and staff of St. Johns Community Care Ltd, the Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust (Q) through Blue Care, the Roman Catholic Trust Corporation for the Diocese of Cairns through the Marlin Coast Respite Centre, Lifeline Community Care, Alternate Care Pty Ltd, Marlin Coast Meals on Wheels, and Ngoonbi Cooperative Society Ltd. Each of these organisations have been funded to provide a range of vital community services in my electorate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033843"></A>
Mr Speaker I mentioned at the outset that the budget contains a number of measures to give people a helping hand. The pensioner electricity rebate is increased from $190 to $216, compulsory third party motor insurance is cut by $24 and I am particularly pleased that a new Medical Cooling and Heating Electricity Rebate scheme has been introduced for people who have a medical condition who depend on air-conditioning to regulate their body temperature. The burden of high electricity bills for people with conditions like multiple sclerosis in a hot and humid climate like Cairns has been brought to my attention and I have lobbied hard for the introduction of this scheme.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033844"></A>
There are of course other state government programs that have been introduced to help people save money and help the environment.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033845"></A>
A rebate of up to $1000 is available upon installation of a new solar hot-water system, the solar bonus scheme pays people 44 cents per kilowatt hours for solar power fed back into the grid and the ClimateSmart Home Service can identify savings of up to $325 on annual power bills.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033846"></A>
Pensioners and students receive half price travel on our bus network, pensioners receive half price car registration and up to $180 back on council rates. People with a disability get discount taxi fares. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033847"></A>
Mortgage and stamp duty for first home buyers has been abolished for homes up to $500 000 and land up to $250 000 saving up to $9500 in stamp duty and $300 on mortgage duty on a home worth $500 000. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033848"></A>
Mr Speaker I want to take this opportunity to briefly analyse some budget income and expenditure figures to put to rest a belief that is gaining currency in some quarters in the north.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033849"></A>
I think it is probably true that many people who live in locations that are geographically isolated from major metropolitan centres have always felt that their city cousins fared better in terms of government spending. As well, I hear people say that the far north generates more wealth and government revenue than is returned in government infrastructure spending and service delivery.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033850"></A>
And of course there is a traditional rivalry between Townsville and Cairns.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033851"></A>
Let us examine this in a little more detail. As I have already pointed out, 57% of the state government’s record building program is occurring outside the south east.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033852"></A>
In 2009-10, $1.2 billion was spent in capital projects in the far north which is $4 766 per capita compared with $4 120 across Queensland. The average across all states is $2 761 per capita.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033853"></A>
Stamp duty and payroll tax make up nearly half of the state taxation revenue. 80% of that is generated in south east Queensland. But I don’t hear my colleagues from the south east demand that it all be spent in the south east.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033854"></A>
In fact, the far north statistical division generates just 1% of the states payroll tax, 4% of stamp duty and 5% of land tax.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033855"></A>
What about royalties? Over the last three years, mining royalties have contributed about 10% of total state government revenue.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033856"></A>
In 2009-10, royalties accounted for less than 5% of the state budget.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033857"></A>
Less than 1% of mining royalty is generated in south east Queensland, so for sure it is a regionally generated revenue stream worth $1.5 billion in 2009-10.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033858"></A>
Mining royalties generated in the far north statistical division in 2008-09 were $46.3 million or 3.6% of the capital spend in 2009-10. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033859"></A>
By comparison, our cousins in the northern statistical division generated a mere $7 million in mining royalties, representing 7% of the capital spend in the region.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Whilst we are making comparisons between the far north and the north, it is worth noting that in 2009-10, the per capita spend in the far north statistical division was $4 766, higher than the $4 227 in the north statistical division. Both are higher than the per capita spend in the Brisbane statistical division of $4 147.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033861"></A>
So Mr Speaker, as important as the far north is to the state, as indeed are other regions in our decentralised state, it can be seen that we are not being bled dry by those greedy south easterners.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033862"></A>
In fact the reverse is true, our region is supported by the property and payroll taxes generated in the more populous south east and more is spent on infrastructure on a per capita basis in the far north than in the north or indeed Brisbane.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033863"></A>
Mr Speaker, I want to conclude by mentioning tourism. Tourism employs 222 000 Queenslanders and one in five people in our region. As the parliamentary secretary for tourism, I recognise the importance of tourism to our regional economy and to the whole state economy.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033864"></A>
So does the Bligh government. That is why of the $48 million in election commitments made at the last election in 2009, $36 million were to support tourism.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033865"></A>
I have read some commentary since the budget was handed down that is critical of the 2010-11 tourism allocation. The $63.7 million allocation, although down from 2010-11 due to the ending of a revenue stream from the past sale of the Sunlover Holidays business, is still the second highest tourism budget allocation on record. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033866"></A>
It is frankly ridiculous and mischievous for anyone to represent this as a poor outcome when our election commitment is pumping an extra $12 million every year until 2012 into overseas and domestic marketing, tourism infrastructure and grants for eco-tourism.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033867"></A>
I have already mentioned the $11.2 million re-development of the heritage wharf sheds in Cairns into a modern cruise terminal to support the growing cruise market. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033868"></A>
The new cultural precinct will be a major tourist attraction in its own right and will provide much needed break out space enabling the adjacent convention centre to host even bigger conventions and events than is currently possible.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033869"></A>
But the government has done much more than simply spend on infrastructure. We have partnered with Jetstar to deliver more flights between Cairns and Japan, including the re-instatement of the Cairns Osaka route--an extra 62 000 seats every year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033870"></A>
The investment in aggressive and targeted marketing campaigns in the domestic market over the last year has been very successful and, building on the success of the best job in the world campaign, key international markets will be the focus in the year ahead as global travel conditions improve.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033871"></A>
The government also provides $301 000 annual base funding to Tourism Tropical North Queensland and at least $3 million will be spent on industry development and marketing the Tropics and the Great Barrier Reef in 2010-11.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033872"></A>
As well, the state government is progressing work on the Dreaming Track, a 2000km network of walking trails in Cape York and will again sponsor the Cairns Indigenous Art Fair which attracts major art buyers from interstate and overseas following the phenomenal success of last year’s event.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033873"></A>
Funding has also been provided to Queensland events to develop and support regional events and a new events strategy for our region.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1033874"></A>
Mr Speaker, the 2010-11 budget stays the course on the government’s economic reforms that are built around the central importance of jobs--building the infrastructure and delivering the services that meet the needs of our growing state.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Ms SIMPSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maroochydore--LNP) (2.55 pm): This Labor budget is highway robbery. A quarter of a billion dollars has been cut from road funding in this disgraceful Labor budget, while motorists are forking out a record amount in taxes and fees--three-quarters of a billion dollars more from petrol tax and registration hikes. Queensland motorists are now the heaviest taxed in Australia, paying an extra $220 per person, thanks to the broken promises of Premier Bligh and Labor. This comes on top of higher water, power and toll charges, public transport fees and other costs, which add up to an extra $1,200 per person. This is a heavy burden in increased costs of living for each household.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033878"></A>
Motorists now pay another 9.1c a litre thanks to Labor, up to 23 per cent more for registration, 30 per cent more for tolls and as much as 40 per cent more for public transport. In the fairytale, Robin Hood stole from the rich and gave to the poor, but in Queensland Premier Bligh and her merry band of incompetent ministers are robbing from everyone and creating poverty. After they have put their sticky fingers in the pockets of hardworking Queenslanders to rip out their last dollar, Labor ministers turn around and sell off the house to pay the grocery bill. That is, in essence, Labor’s dishonest sale of Queensland’s assets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033881"></A>
I want to see this proud state restored to be the leader again in regards to being an investment attracter for jobs and providing an affordable cost of living and livability. Today, we have heard some of the plans the LNP has to achieve that: freezing rego in the first term; reclaiming the AAA credit rating that this government lost--government members should hang their heads in shame, as it is costing more than $200 million every year in penalty interest rates to pay for the loss of that AAA rating; stopping the mining tax that their buddies in Canberra want to foist on this state which will take away jobs from Queensland; providing electricity relief for seniors; helping small businesses by paying them quicker under government contracts; having transparency of contracts; and lifting the freeze on infrastructure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033884"></A>
The LNP has a commitment to changing the government and making Queensland an affordable place to live again, with efficient services and where the focus is on government serving the people, not serving itself, as this government has done. Our key policy focus is to cut waste and ensure those precious dollars are spent efficiently and well for maximum service delivery.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033886"></A>
Cutting road congestion requires a SEQIPP and a RIP which are properly scoped and which give greater certainty to the market and the public, and we are not seeing that. SEQIPP, which is the infrastructure plan to accompany the South East Queensland Regional Plan, and RIP, which is the roads plan for Queensland, no longer have the certainty that was so much prized, particularly with the RIP. I will come to that when we look at the cuts in spending on Main Roads and infrastructure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033888"></A>
Our focus is about bringing back professional engineers into government, into the department. We have a commitment to the professional public sector with a focus on value for the taxpayer and project delivery. We are not about more paper pushers; we are about getting more bitumen, more concrete and more outcomes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033945"></A>
Our focus is on making sure it is not just about more planning studies, which this government pours endless money into, but is also about actually building those plans. For example, this government has spent $6 million just on the planning documents for CoastConnect, the bus priority measure for the Sunshine Coast. But has it taken a shovel, dug some ground and put some bitumen down or wired a bus priority measure? No! That $6 million has been spent just on planning and there is no evidence of any outcomes. The padding of projects and delaying rather than delivering value for money is typical of this government, be it in relation to bus stations or other roads and priority measures. It is typical of how this government is running as a whole. Labor’s plan is bigger debt, bigger deficits, selling Queensland’s income-earning assets, waving goodbye to the AAA rating of government, new taxes and a higher cost of living. Certainly the government is all about waste and inefficiency. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033949"></A>
I will present some more facts about this dishonest Labor budget. The only transport system Ministers Wallace and Nolan can be trusted with is a barrow. They are good at pushing their own barrow, but they are not good at delivering major projects that have been properly costed. Road charges are going up, but road spending is diving in this budget. But what’s new? Last year the Transport and Main Roads portfolio underspent by $200 million on what was promised in capital works. If we add in Queensland Rail and the port projects, the figure was down $342 million on what the government promised to spend on vital infrastructure. This year Transport Minister Nolan has the audacity to announce an increase by taking the $180 million in capital that her department did not spend last year and adding it to this year’s capital budget. She announced it as if it were new money. It is not new money; it is rollover money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033950"></A>
However, the cheekiest bit of spin relates to boasts about increases in transport. When we look at the fine detail we find out that, yes, there is an extra $30 million but what is it for? Guess what? It is to pay for the bloated budget of the dumbest smart card we are yet to see. We are yet to see it, but we are already seeing the bills for it. Queenslanders are already paying for the new Queensland driver’s licence, which the budget papers initially costed at about $20 million. It then crept up to more than $80 million and--guess what?--this year it is more than $112 million. Over the next few years motorists will be paying back even more as the cost of a five-year driver’s licence more than doubles to over $150. That is not value for money and that is what Queenslanders are sick of. The new smart licence was supposed to prevent criminals ripping people off, but we find that the government is doing it instead. The smart card bungle is a money-laundering exercise for an incompetent Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033951"></A>
The government overspends on dud projects, underspends and delays the rollout of others, and provides a whole lot of uncertainty to the market at a time when the market wants to see certainty with infrastructure delivery and improved passenger and vehicle travel. The government says that it is borrowing in order to build. Let us look again at the budget papers. Last year $17 billion was budgeted for infrastructure. How much has been budgeted for this year and the next few years? It is down to $9 billion. We have record borrowing, record debt and a slash in the amount of money that is going into infrastructure. This government does not know how to manage the precious dollars of Queenslanders and it is not delivering what is vitally needed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033952"></A>
Let us look at some other projects that have slipped behind, despite this high-charging, high-debt state government. The capital spend on national and state highways is down $213 million, or seven per cent. The capital spend on busways is down $10 million, or nearly three per cent. Dealing with a number of other specific projects, last year the Gold Coast light rail project was actually underspent by $90 million, the Ipswich Motorway by $200 million and the Cardwell Range by $16 million. Last year the Cooroy-Curra section, which I heard the minister going on about, was underspent by $150 million and the Pacific Motorway additional lane between Springwood South and Daisy Hill was underspent by $65 million. Last year the Calliope Range realignment with the Dawson Highway was underspent by $26 million. All that funding was rolled over into the next year. They pat themselves on the back and pretend that it is new money, but in reality the whole budget is going down. There are many other vital regional and urban roads that desperately need investment, but there is no certainty in the program that the government is rolling out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033954"></A>
One thing that industry operators say to me, particularly small to medium sized operators, is that they want to be able to operate and deliver infrastructure in Queensland but the thing they hate the most is the uncertainty. The thing they hate the most is when a tap is turned on and suddenly it is turned off, and no-one can tell the truth about when there will be a steady stream of works. Once again the projects that the government is presenting do not deliver that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033955"></A>
Let us look at what happened with the Transport and Main Roads capital budget by region. In this budget, Brisbane is down by $147 million, the Gold Coast by $95 million, West Moreton by $9 million, the central west by $27 million, Mackay by $152 million and the far north by $23 million. Looking at the total capital budget by region, Brisbane is down by $640 million, the Sunshine Coast falls by $75 million, West Moreton is down by $239 million, the south-west is down by $72 million, the central west is down by $43 million, Mackay falls by $128 million, the northern region falls by $47 million and the far north is down by $295 million. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033956"></A>
This story has been repeated. The government says one thing, but in reality we see cutbacks in areas where we need to see our economy stimulated and we need certainty of spend. Once again, government is borrowing record amounts and raising record taxes, but it is not going into the areas that really should be about driving the jobs in our regions throughout Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033957"></A>
What about the sale of Queensland Rail and the delivery of freight certainty, let alone passenger certainty, into the future? The transport minister claims that she has her ear to the ground. Last year she was so tuned in that when I asked in this parliament on 21 May about the sale of Queensland Rail she said, ‘Queensland Rail is not for sale.’ Four days later in the newspaper, guess what was being flagged by the government? It was looking at the sale of Queensland Rail. If I knew that they were looking at the sale of Queensland Rail, the public sector was leaking like a sieve and the minister was so away with the fairies that she did not know about it, how on earth will the minister be in a position to protect the best interests of Queenslanders as her cabinet colleagues proceed with the sell-off? What is missing at the cabinet table is someone to protect the interests of this asset for our communities. This government is more focused on saving itself rather than looking at the long-term interests of Queensland, Queensland workers and communities that depend upon this vital Queensland asset to get products to market. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033960"></A>
Increasingly we hear how under this minister’s watch Queensland Rail is retracting regional services, even at the risk of jobs in her own electorate. This is appalling mismanagement. A lack of certainty about livestock trains is a real threat to Queensland abattoirs, including one in the minister’s own electorate. Week by week we hear stories of how services have been pulled and how people have found that they cannot get stock to market. That is an absolute disgrace. More and more people are being forced to put their cattle onto trucks and transport them by road, bypassing abattoirs in Queensland. This minister has done nothing to address that issue, which has ramifications across the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033961"></A>
In Bundaberg the brickworks is closing down. The operators blame this government and Queensland Rail, which has not had a policy to invest and ensure that transport infrastructure is able to grow and help our regional economies develop. That brickworks has been in operation for decades but it is closing, and many jobs will be lost because of a lack of certainty of access to affordable transport infrastructure, which it used to have with Queensland Rail. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033962"></A>
In recent times we have heard nothing from this government about the cross-city rail. There is barely a whimper about it in the budget papers. If there truly is a focus on building for the future, the government should ensure not only that there is a plan to deliver projects in a timely way but also that the system has the capacity prior to that new infrastructure coming on. Nothing in these budget papers addresses the failure of service delivery here in South-East Queensland in relation to the Citytrain network. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037671"></A>
There will be some upgrades of some stations but there is nothing in the budget papers to address the issue of the failure of trains to turn up on time. There is nothing to address the fact that there are increasing breakdowns. There is nothing to address the fact that more and more passengers are sick of the lack of certainty. That situation is going to be get worse unless there is some intervention to deal with the ongoing maintenance of the rail network. The capacity issues are going to get worse before gridlock is reached in 2016. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037673"></A>
The Cross River Rail project is supposed to address any future gridlock. The reality is that all the reports are warning about the need to address the lack of capacity in the system before then. There is nothing in this budget to do that. I fear that the gridlock that Queenslanders face on their roads due to a lack of planning by this government is increasingly more likely to occur on our rail system which is already struggling. That will not only have an impact on passengers who are wanting to get to work on time and know that their service is going to arrive on time but also an impact on freight which is one area that makes money for this state. We will see a lack of slots and a lack of certainty due to this government’s failure to address capacity prior to bringing on the Cross River Rail project--a project which is behind schedule. It was first promised in 2005 that we would have a feasibility study done. That feasibility study has not been completed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037674"></A>
I want to address some issues with regard to my own electorate. I have mentioned before the CoastConnect project. CAMCOS and the multimodal corridor have now been rolled into one project by this government. We are yet to hear an announcement as to what it is doing with respect to those three projects. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037676"></A>
CAMCOS was supposed to reach Caloundra by 2015. There has been no announcement from this government as to what has happened to that time frame. In good faith, we were using the existing programs of this government in terms of the forward planning for CAMCOS but it made no announcement that it had pulled the project time frame. It has gone silent on its investment schedule on this and on many other critical public transport infrastructure projects. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037679"></A>
This is the issue. The government is ensuring that there is population growth in our regions but the infrastructure to make that growth sustainable has not kept pace. Now we see a $17 billion infrastructure spend drop down to $9 billion and no connection between growth and timely infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037680"></A>
It is time that the growth in Queensland’s dollars into the future were increasingly set aside to address the debt that is ripping the guts out of our budget and to ensure that there is certainty when it comes to our infrastructure spend. This budget does not deliver certainty for our infrastructure spend. That is why we are seeing a situation where the growing deficit is undermining our ability to meet service delivery. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037681"></A>
Why is this happening? The shadow Treasurer outlined a number of examples of waste. I will outline yet another one, that is, the Northern Pipeline Interconnector stage 2. That was proposed as a drought measure. Guess what? Is there a drought today? No. Is the government still building that pipeline? Yes. Why is it building a pipeline costing half a billion dollars which has the capacity to carry 200 megalitres of water a day when it will only at the most sometimes, maybe, possibly carry 20 megalitres a day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037682"></A>
This is typical of the way this government has been building infrastructure. It does not do its plans. It does not do its business studies. In fact, there was no business study for this particular project. The government turns around and says, ‘We can justify it; there is a drought.’ Guess what? There is no drought and yet it has committed itself to build a half a billion dollar pipeline. That money should have been spent on the Sunshine Coast Hospital. That money should have been spent on delivering timely infrastructure instead of being spent on a wasteful project. That pipeline was really a Traveston Dam pipeline. So we should add that to the other half a billion dollars that was wasted by this government on its fraudulent Traveston Dam project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037686"></A>
That is why we have seen such wasteful spending by this government. That kind of rot has got to stop. That has not changed under this government. It blatantly will not say sorry for the mistakes it has made and the costs that it has imposed on ordinary Queenslanders who are now some of the most heavily taxed in Australia. We see real examples where regions like mine are suffering. We have a 450 hospital bed shortfall. My region has more people in its catchment than Townsville and yet we have a situation where we are 450 hospital beds short. Still this government builds a pipeline to nowhere for half a billion dollars. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037687"></A>
This government has no shame. It does not care for the people who are dying at the doors of our hospitals--even just a few months ago because there were no hospital beds available. This government has its priorities wrong. It is time for a change of government. It is time for a change in how government is done so that the precious dollars of Queenslanders are spent with care and due attention to ensure that people get value for money and no longer get ripped off by a government that has made this the highest taxing, lowest service delivery state in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037688"></A>
Productivity is about getting value for Queenslanders. They deserve better. They deserve a change of government. They deserve a focus on ensuring that there is investment in this state that will create the jobs that they need, particularly in my area when it comes to tourism and construction. We need the expansion of job-creating industries. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Gregory--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.15 pm): I rise today to speak in the debate on the appropriation bills 2010. In doing so, I wish to canvass many issues regarding the portfolio for which I am the shadow minister, that is, Police and Corrective Services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037691"></A>
We hear about all the good things in the budget, but there is one thing that I was bought up with, and that is honesty. This is the 21st budget I have heard presented in this place. Every year we hear about the good things that the government is going to do in the year ahead. I am sick and tired of the deceit when it comes to the rollover policies of this government in relation to its capital works programs. Year in and year out we hear lip-service paid to them. Then all of a sudden we see the same programs mentioned again in the budget for the next year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037692"></A>
I refer to the police budget. Last year there was a commitment in relation to the Beenleigh Police Station of $2.9 million--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037693"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Moorhead:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 It is being expanded to include the communications district. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037694"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 You listen to this. I take the interjection from the honourable member for Waterford. Some $120,000 has been spent. He might say that it has been expanded to include another part of the program but the point I make here is that this happens year in and year out. The Camp Hill Police Station is a classic example. Some $177,000 has been spent out of an allocation of $2.4 million. For Lockhart River $600,000 was spent out of $3 million. For Murgon some $2.5 million was budgeted for 2009-10. This is leading to more delays in its completion. For Mareeba it is $750,000. The list goes on and on. We could be here all day talking about these projects. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037695"></A>
Another area where there is a blatant tax grab in this budget is application fees for weapons licences. They are to increase from $35.45 to $79.50. Licence renewal fees will increase from $58.50 to $131.25. That is a staggering 124 per cent increase. These increases will net a windfall of almost $5 million for the police budget. But one has to ask what relevance this has to shooters and what benefit it will bring them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037696"></A>
The requirement for all shooting licence applicants to be personally interviewed by a police officer was an unjustifiable waste of scarce police resources. In the past weapons licensing has been handled by administrative staff so that uniform police could do more pressing activities. Individuals who are applying for weapons licences are actually obeying the law. The uniform police would be better off solving crime and preventing crime. It would be better to have those police out on the beat rather than have them taking care of the government’s tax grabs to justify its existence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043977"></A>
Every year there seems to be something in relation to criminal activity where the government is highlighted. The numbers of people charged with the possession of an unregistered firearm in 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09 were 760, 634 and 445 respectively. This means that the honest people out there doing the right thing who have registered their firearms are penalised but the crooks are still running free with unregistered firearms, and if the police concentrated on chasing those people we would have a better outcome. The macropod harvesters in Western Queensland have hardly fired a shot in the last 12 months because of the shutdown of that industry, but they are going to be taxed again for unfair reasons.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040821"></A>
I turn now to Task Force Argos. The figures released in this budget show that the policies and actions of the Bligh Labor government have done nothing to deter the activities of organised paedophiles, institutionalised abuse and child exploitation in Queensland. Figures from 2008-09 show the arrest of 60 offenders on 254 charges, while 2009-10 saw this figure jump to 97 offenders arrested on 369 charges. If the Bligh Labor government’s policies were working, these figures would be decreasing, not increasing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040822"></A>
Staffing is an integral part of Queensland policing. With regard to traffic police, the 2009-10 budget papers promised 2,829 traffic staff for that year and the 2010-11 budget papers delivered 2,729 staff for 2009-10--that is, a decrease. This is a government that is not committed to visible policing on the roads to reduce speeding and reduce the number of deaths. I know for a fact that this is about revenue raising. There is no doubt about that. This government would rather spend another $22 million on revenue-raising speed cameras than on delivering the number of traffic police that were promised. Every day the union says that it needs more police presence out there but, no, we are giving them these devices. The devices are not really there for the police; rather, they are there to bring dollars into Treasury’s coffers because we have this outstanding imbalance of figures which is costing this state dearly and the people of this state dearly. What are people going to save? This government will save people $24 a year. That equates to about 50c a week. Big deal! What could you buy with 50c a week? Get a life! Kids in grade 1 would know more about--</Hansard-Body>

Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you for your protection, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I certainly need protection in this place from time to time. I can see the Minister for Local Government laughing. I am a pretty harmless sort of a bloke, but I tell you what: don’t fire me up because I’m ready to go. I have got another 13 minutes.</Hansard-Body>

Today’s <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 reveals that Queensland Police Commissioner Bob Atkinson has launched a pre-emptive strike against looming criticism of his leadership by issuing a warning to the 14,500-strong force--I do not know where it got that figure from; I thought we had 10,000 officers--that there is no place for misconduct and that officers have a shared responsibility to stamp it out. The real issue relates to leadership, and that leadership has to be put in place by government policy that will give police the direction to apprehend and bring to justice criminals. And then we need to have the criminal justice system in place that will put those people away so that it makes the police force’s job worthwhile. No wonder morale is down in the Police Service, because this state does not have the justice system to back the police in this state. I talk to police on a regular basis and they have had an absolute fill of the lack of support in terms of what they are trying to do when the court system lets them down every time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040843"></A>
Rather than increase these numbers, the government has decreased them. That is why for the third year in a row public confidence in police has dropped. In 2007-08 the figure was 83 per cent, in 2008-09 it was 82 per cent and in 2009-10 it was 80.8 per cent. We do not want to see our police being criticised and subjected to this pain because we have a government that pays them lip-service. Every day we see some kind of attack on the police.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040844"></A>
The Ethical Standards Command has a role to play, but that is certainly not to be investigating police on a regular basis. It seems to me that the CMC is the watchdog in that regard. On top of that, people in the community are violating police as they go about the execution of their duties on a daily basis. There is no protection of the police, but there seems to be plenty of protection for criminals. These are situations that I fear we will see repeatedly happen over the next 12 months until we get to the next election, when the people of Queensland will have a say.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040845"></A>
There are a couple of good things in the budget. There is $50 million highlighted for the continued development of the state-of-the-art Queensland Police Academy at Wacol. This is long overdue--I know it was put on hold last year--and I hope that we will see some serious work done on it in the coming year. The academy is expected to be completed by 2014-15. In this regard, we should take advantage in terms of training police from other jurisdictions while at the same time giving our police officers the added advantage of having the best technology available to them and the most sophisticated equipment in the Western world in order to undertake police surveillance for the detection of criminal activity. That is certainly happening on the Gold Coast at the moment in relation to the likes of the Russian Mafia and drug squads et cetera, and these people have to be brought to justice.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1040849"></A>
A few weeks ago Channel 9 conducted a poll on one of its evening news bulletins asking the people of Queensland how many of them supported the use of a police helicopter. The Queensland police should have a helicopter. Some 97 per cent of people in this state supported the police having a helicopter. Queensland is the only state in Australia that does not have one. What does that tell you? The government talks about fixed-wing aircraft, and I know it is a large state--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 And when I get provoked, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have to retaliate, and I tell you I can. I say to the honourable member for Pine Rivers that it is not about cutting programs; it is about working a lot more intelligently to ensure we have these programs in place. For example, in terms of the apprehension and confiscation of some of the property belonging to these criminal gangs, there is the money straightaway to pay for some of these programs. If the police are properly resourced it is revenue neutral, and that is how you manage situations that are responsible in trying to balance the budget. However, this government does not understand how to do that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040859"></A>
Some $50.2 million is provided for communication technology projects including computer-aided dispatch, Technology Refresh, the digital integrated traffic camera system, the new weapons licensing system and telecommunications interception. That is the one we have been waiting for. We heard all the hoo-ha that the Howard government blocked this from happening in Queensland and all of a sudden we have it. We debated it here two years ago and it is finally in the budget two years later. That is absolutely fantastic. The police in Queensland will be saying thank you very much for this, and I just hope that there is enough chaff in the barrel so they can get on with the business of detecting criminal activity with these telecommunications interception powers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040863"></A>
In the few minutes I have left I want to talk about issues relevant to my electorate and issues relevant to Western Queensland as a whole. This afternoon I heard the honourable member for Maroochydore, the shadow minister for transport and main roads, during her contribution to this debate talk about cuts in road funding throughout the whole of Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044090"></A>
This morning I heard the Premier say that 57 per cent of the Capital Works Program in this budget is going to be spent outside the south-east corner. I would like to see where that 57 per cent is being directed in regional Queensland, especially in the area of road infrastructure. On the eastern side of my own electorate, I can see only one major piece of work of any significance and there is a few dollars to be spent on the western side. This morning, the minister again announced funding of $3.8 million for the replacement of the Cornish Creek Bridge on the Torrens Creek Road. I applaud that allocation. The Kennedy Developmental Road, which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Mount Isa, is certainly a road that provides benefits for my electorate. This year, the minister announced $23 million for that road and there is $5 million allocated in the budget. That is going to be an excellent project. It is certainly a significant project for that part of Queensland. Of course, there is the ongoing sealing of the road between Jericho and Windorah and the Blackwater to Emmet road, from 14 to 23.5 kilometres west of Blackall. There is $1 million there. There is an allocation of $1.175 million for pavement and sealing of the Emmet-Yaraka Road, east of Yaraka. These are all very welcome items of capital expenditure. Road funding is very significant for the ongoing development of that region.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044098"></A>
 But the one thing that I am sad about is that there is no mention whatsoever of the upgrade of the Clermont-Alpha Road in the area of the Galilee Basin coalfields. Large volumes of cattle move through that area to the Borthwicks meatworks at Mackay or the railhead at Alpha and ultimately into Emerald or wherever for trucking or sale. The cattle train concept has led to a grave situation in Western Queensland. Queensland Rail has no comprehension at all of the management of this strategy. This morning, I spoke with the minister about this issue. We are going to talk more about it later today or tomorrow. These abattoirs in South-East Queensland cannot have a continuing supply of cattle for their needs if they have to rely on road transport. Queensland Rail, through its cattle train, must transport those cattle. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044102"></A>
In a letter that I wrote to <Hansard-Italic>
Queensland Country Life</Hansard-Italic>
, which was published today, I stated that we do not recognise the needs of those meat-processing companies in the south-east corner and the number of cattle that they process on a daily basis. Those cattle come from the electorate of the member for Mount Isa--places such as Cloncurry and Julia Creek, right through to Winton. The Queensland Rail cattle train is the only way to convey those cattle to the processing plants at Rockhampton or down to the south-east.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044103"></A>
After the severe flooding earlier this year I believe that the Quilpie line is going to be open in July. It is very important that the Queensland Rail cattle train network recognises that one train a week is not going to be sufficient to carry the fat cattle out of that region in the coming months. Because of the wet season that we have had in the Channel Country, there is going to be more than one train a week needed to carry those cattle. Otherwise, those cattle will have to come by road, which is a logistical nightmare. That is a complete impossibility.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044105"></A>
The minister talks about the $25 million cross-subsidisation of the Queensland Rail cattle train, but it is going to cost more than $25 million to repair the pavement that is going to be damaged by heavy transport because they cannot put those cattle on rail. It is a common-sense issue. I have spoken with the Minister for Primary Industries and the Minister for Transport and other people involved in the meat-processing industry about this issue. I hope that those people can work out the best way for the conveyance of that stock. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044106"></A>
In the couple of minutes that I have left to me I want to make a comment about the moneys that are available for the Emerald North State Primary School, the Emerald State High School, the Emerald State Primary School, the Denison State Primary School and also the Blackwater State High School for the upgrading of their air-conditioning units and their electrical wiring.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044112"></A>
Another issue that is very important in my electorate is police housing at Woorabinda. Some serious money is being injected into that area for the upgrading of police accommodation. The police at Woorabinda do a fantastic job and $3 million-odd is going to be spent there for the upgrading of police housing. That is certainly going to give the police there a better quality of life as they go about the execution of their duty in a difficult situation. We have to look at how we can make police housing better right across this state, particularly in some of those remote areas, because they are not the easiest places to live in, especially for the wives and families of those officers. It is very important that they be given some comforts of life so that they can carry on their work in a professional and safe manner.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044113"></A>
In closing, I hope that the Minister for Transport and Minister for Main Roads will be available to consider some of the issues I have raised so that we can address some of the anomalies that exist currently in those western areas. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Warrego--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.35 pm): I rise to speak in this 2010 budget debate. I support the contributions of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer. They made a detailed contribution in this debate. I recommend that people study their speeches in detail. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044116"></A>
It is amazing to consider that Queensland is the only state in mainland Australia that is in deficit. That situation will remain until 2015-16. Really, as has been said before, only Labor can go broke in a boom. I know that in the past members on this side, when in government, were criticised if there was a slowdown in the Capital Works Program but, basically, this government has had its own $1 billion public works freeze. The members opposite just cannot seem to get their minds around the fact that they have to progress this work.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044117"></A>
It is forecast that, for the 2014-15 year, Queensland will be $83.5 billion in debt, which is $18,700 per man, woman and child. New South Wales has a debt of $9,700 per person. It is no wonder at all that the government is going down in the polls. When we consider the sorts of things that have happened, it is no wonder that the finances of this state are in such a bad way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044118"></A>
I want to refer to a couple of issues that relate to my shadow portfolio and then deal with issues that relate to my electorate of Warrego. I refer to the local government figures that have been released. The minister’s press release referred to $1.3 billion for Queensland councils and that that is good news for councils and good news for ratepayers. The press release states further that that funding equates to about $900 for every ratepayer in Queensland and it represents an expenditure increase of almost $100 million on the expenditure for the last financial year. Most members would know that that is not right. Of course it is not right, because that figure has been calculated through what has come in from the other departments, the bigger portfolios. These are just words. I do not know how the government members can write this stuff and put their name to it. It is no wonder people do not believe a word the government says. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044119"></A>
In the past during estimates hearings I have asked for these figures in terms of what comes in from every department and I was told that it is too hard to put together. Yet the government is now bringing this figure forward and trying to claim that it is new money. For heaven’s sake! It is no wonder people do not believe the government. I will leave it at that. I am still amazed how the members opposite can say these things and hold their heads up high. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044120"></A>
I refer to the budget allocation for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. Nothing much has gone into that area. In fact, if it were not for the federal government putting money particularly into all of the Cape York welfare reforms, the allocation would be virtually zero--perhaps $7 million. There is $15 million going into the Cape York welfare reforms. We presume that funding is coming from the state government. It is hard to believe until you drill down and find out where it is coming from. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047304"></A>
It is a very vast state when one considers the implications of amalgamation for Indigenous communities and Indigenous councils. There was some assistance announced early in the year for the Torres Strait Islander Regional Council, which was certainly welcomed, but it is nowhere near enough to deal with what the government imposed upon it with the forced amalgamation. Mark my words--a lot more money will be needed to be able to keep the operation going the way the government has modelled it. If the government had done it the right way it would not have to, but that is the situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047307"></A>
Let me move to matters in relation to the electorate of Warrego. Warra is a great little town on the Warrego Highway. The police station there is to be closed down. There is much concern within the Warra district about the replacement of the policeman. The residents’ fears that the police officer will not be replaced are well founded. There is a police officer living at the police house at the moment, but that position is no longer attached to that community and therefore this arrangement can change at any time. The residents of Warra are very concerned. This is a further erosion of a service they have always had. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047308"></A>
Another important issue is in relation to not-for-profit clubs. I appeal to the government to look at reducing the red tape that is stifling these clubs. They are the backbone of a society. One of the common complaints and ridiculous imposts by the state government is that of liquor licensing laws and requirements on small not-for-profit and sporting clubs. Smaller clubs are categorised as those under 2,000 members and the fee is $500. Some communities do not even have a population of 2,000, let alone less than 2,000 being members of their club. Volunteers have to do the responsible service of alcohol course which costs approximately $80. There needs to be a category for very small clubs that have under 200 members, that are not for profit and that are run by volunteers who can operate a liquor licence for members. There is a huge amount of nonsense to go through for the local tennis club members to have a beer at their social barbecue once a month. Very few drink more than one or two beers because they have children with them and they have to drive home as well. These liquor licensing laws are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and are totally out of proportion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047309"></A>
Another very important issue in my electorate is the condition of the Warrego Highway. There is no doubt that it is in need of an upgrade. The section from Roma to Wallumbilla has been reduced from 110 kilometres per hour to 100 kilometres per hour because the road is so rough. The section between Warra and Macalister is a 15-kilometre deathtrap. Constituents have written to me that they have witnessed fatal accidents on this section of the road. The road shoulders are dangerous and extremely dangerous after rain as they cut out along the edge of the bitumen and the convex surface tends to make it very difficult for trucks and trailers, many of which are fully loaded on this Brisbane to Darwin freight route. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047311"></A>
Another section of this road floods very quickly on the Brigalow floodplain. The dip is very sharp and constituents who have been unaware of the depth of water over the road have hit the water and rolled their car and were lucky to escape serious injury. Would people in Brisbane tolerate a black spot like this that has form for accidents? No. This section needs a culvert, and the sooner the better. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047312"></A>
Another issue is the upgrade of the Warrego Highway from Mitchell to Roma for type 2 road trains. This again is an AusLink project, but the works are managed and undertaken by the state department of main roads. Currently the third trailer is unhitched and left at a pad at Mitchell then collected later or by a subcontractor. This adds another $1,000 to the cost of freight of cattle and general freight. I wish to see this project shovel-ready as soon as possible. I know a tender has been awarded and that is good. I want to see this road completed as soon as possible. There will be inevitable delays due to wet weather, but the days of transporting livestock under the current conditions are coming to an end. Without the road upgrade, the largest selling centre in the Southern Hemisphere could be unjustly affected. I am willing to work with all parties to make sure that this upgrade is done as soon as possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047313"></A>
The flood issues have been particularly important. In Roma a levy bank and all flood mitigation options must be brought forward for public consultation without delay following the February-March floods. All options must be brought forward with a clear plan to give confidence and protect the community and commerce of Roma from severe flood events such as those experienced in March. The levy bank to the north of the town and diversion of Bungil Creek to the east must be given full consideration. Ten years ago the cost was estimated at $2 million. The council at the time could not afford to pay its share, but in reality its share today was the price of two houses. Members can see in reality the job has to be done. Even on today’s estimates the real cost is only a fraction of the total damage bill in Roma. Further levies will be required around the south-east of town and already under investigation are improved floodways under the Warrego Highway. In fact, the eastern side of Roma on the Warrego Highway particularly contributed to the flooding of the town. That certainly needs to be improved. We have been talking to Main Roads about that. Let us hope that we can do something with that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047314"></A>
Keeping the water out of homes may impact on properties to the east of the town and those landholders must also be considered and appropriately assisted. Many towns today have good levy banks that protect their town. Doing nothing in Roma is not an option. The community needs to work together on a flood mitigation option as the commerce of the business sector, protection of property and personal safety must be paramount. I do not want to see this community go through another preventable flood event and nor will those who provide flood insurance. Insurance companies will not offer flood cover unless mitigation is undertaken. They did this after the 1990 flood in Charleville and it is likely they may do the same in Roma after 2010. Insurance companies are telling me now that not enough is being done to minimise the high risk of flood in some communities. There is a lack of accurate flood maps in all parts of Australia. There is a high cost to collect data and many local councils continue to approve new developments in flood-prone areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047315"></A>
I understand the impact of flood. My house was flooded--not by a great deal of water, but enough. I had insurance. It certainly is a hassle. For those people with no insurance it is traumatic and I really feel for them. In Charleville there needs to be a whole new reassessment of the Charleville flood mitigation options, including diverting Bradley’s Gully and further raising of the existing levy bank. The levy bank built on the Warrego River to protect Charleville will not keep out a 1990 flood event. The council will need assistance from the state government to do this. Unfortunately, because the flood mitigation works have not been completed in Charleville, the current levy appears to hold up water inside the levy. A full analysis of the flood mitigation option for Charleville must take into account the highest expected flood level--or higher--and the gully must also be dealt with in the next stage of works. Raising the existing levy bank must be in the options and the final stage of works. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047316"></A>
 I have observed from a low-level flyover that there is potential to divert the gully to the Warrego. Whilst there is a significant rise in the catchment, there are some natural floodways that may be suitable and must be investigated. Houses can be raised up, more flood-free land can be made available and further cleaning out of the river can be done. However, the town CBD cannot be moved. The engineering advice and costs on diverting the gully and raising the levy must be brought forward to the community. The state government has provided some funds to assist with identification of flood mitigation strategies and I urge the community and all levels of government to be proactive on the flood mitigation options, as the commerce of the business sector, protection of property and personal safety is paramount.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047317"></A>
I have written to the Premier advising of the success of a project undertaken in 1990 to raise homes above flood level in Charleville. This is a good option for many communities including Bollon, Meandarra, Thallon, Roma and again Charleville. I have asked the flood recovery task force to give particular emphasis on this aspect of flood mitigation for St George as it appears that a levy bank to protect the 25 houses that were flooded is not an option. On inspection of these houses at least half could be raised above flood level.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047318"></A>
There is a gap in government assistance for small businesses and self-employed people when natural disasters such as the March 2010 floods occurred. Because such a large area was affected, many small business and self-employed people simply could not get to work. These are the people who did not have water physically through the premises but who could not work because they either could not get to work or get their equipment to work. Many macropod harvesters found themselves in this situation, as did contractors with machinery for earthmoving, logging et cetera. The flood was really the peak of the monsoonal event because many of these businesses had not worked for three to four months before the flood even got there. I appealed strongly on behalf of these people and there was the ability of the state government to activate the Small Business Emergency Assistance Scheme. However, I and many of the small businesses affected in my electorate are disappointed that the state government did not agree to activating this scheme. In talking about the gaps, many eligible small businesses and primary producers have accessed the QRAA assistance and there are still people coming to my office inquiring about this assistance even three months later. Fortunately, this scheme can receive applications up to September and this is most helpful. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047319"></A>
I distinctly recall the Premier talking about insurance companies buying locally. I distinctly recall the Premier saying in our meetings following the flood that the recovery effort would involve the locals first then everyone else can have a go. Well, in Charleville this certainly was not the case. Both local electrical stores, Home Service Centre and Retravision, have reported that they have not had a fair go.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050590"></A>
I personally contacted the insurance companies involved and asked them to consider the locals. In the case of local suppliers, they believe they were quoting below the rates given to the insurance companies from stores located away. I have been told that replacement cars are being bought from Brisbane instead of from the local dealership. I can tell members that a Toyota Camry in Roma will cost the same as a Toyota Camry in Brisbane, so that begs the question: why not shop locally? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

I have heard both sides of the story and have also been told that local suppliers are too expensive compared to those from away; hence why the insurance companies do not shop locally. There must be a better way. Insurance companies certainly do not endear themselves by firstly shopping away and then considering the locals afterwards. This must be reversed in the future. Local suppliers must have the opportunity to at least quote. If they are then unable to compete, so be it. </Hansard-Body>

In relation to the ambulance levy and the Freemasons, I wish to advise the parliament of how mean and tricky the state government is in relation to its revenue raising. Recently the Office of State Revenue contacted Freemasons Queensland advising that under the Community Ambulance Cover Act 2003 religious bodies and other institutions exemptions would not extend to premises owned or occupied by Freemasons Queensland. In fact, the lodges were advised that they would be charged for the last five years of ambulance levy on their premises, or $488 per lodge. How lousy is this? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050596"></A>
This is an extraordinary and desperate move by the state government for revenue, considering every member of the lodge is paying the ambulance levy at least once on their home. It is also ignorant of contributions that lodges make to local hospitals and aged-care facilities, including the Board of Benevolence and the Aged Masons, Widows and Orphans Fund, which is a benevolent institution. I am a mason, and I am proud of it. I know exactly the sort of work that they do. The government is so lousy to try to get some money out of these people who do so much for people behind the scenes.</Hansard-Body>

There is no doubt that the coal seam gas industry is bringing the benefits of increased economic activity to the southern Queensland region. However, it is inevitable that those most affected will ask the question: at what cost? I want to make it clear that the LNP and I are not opposed to the development of the coal seam gas industry. However, we have serious concerns about the present legislative framework that governs this industry. The state government’s legislative framework is clearly inadequate for an industry that is progressing from development to a major world-scale energy producer.</Hansard-Body>

The state government’s own commissioned report titled <Hansard-Italic>
Queensland Department of Infrastructure: liquefied natural gas whole of state environmental impacts study</Hansard-Italic>
, December 2007, outlines a number of recommendations which the state government has only started to implement after the state LNP opposition started asking questions in parliament. Clearly the state government is not fully aware of the potential impacts, nor does it seem overly concerned about mitigating these impacts. One has to ask the question: why is the government loath to act, or is it just incompetent? I think it is probably incompetent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050602"></A>
This has been demonstrated by questions I have asked the government in parliament. I asked whether there will be impacts on water pressures and levels of the more than 13,000 existing groundwater bores in the Surat Basin. An estimated 350,000 megalitres--equivalent to one-third of the capacity of the Fairbairn Dam--of groundwater from the Great Artesian Basin will be used annually in coal seam methane gas extraction. The minister’s response that ‘no-one can answer that question at this point in time’ is unsatisfactory. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050603"></A>
The LNP opposition has asked 16 questions on notice in the parliament seeking assurances and further information about the coal seam gas industry. The parliament and public will have answers to these questions by the end of June 2010. The questions cover the topics of long-term effects on the Great Artesian Basin; water interconnectivity; studies, modelling and reports on coal seam gas water extraction; assurances for groundwater users and communities with water supplies from artesian and subartesian supplies; wastewater ponds on flood plains; contaminated sites; chemicals used in the fracking process; compliance with the Great Artesian Basin Resource Operations Plan; and what action is being taken to mitigate impacts on water bores. The government has the tree police running around chasing people who might have pushed some trees over, yet it may be allowing someone to destroy the Great Artesian Basin, which is one of the wonders of the world the way we see it.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1050605"></A>
There is public pressure and concern growing in the wider community about the coal seam gas industry as the companies push into the closer settled areas of the Western Downs. From my observations and on-ground inspections, some of the companies involved have taken a cavalier attitude to their development on prime agricultural land and irrigation areas. This has obviously resulted in protest meetings at Cecil Plains and a wave of discontent. Unless there is a huge concerted effort by all of the participants in the coal seam gas industry, this wave of discontent will snowball and the public mood against the industry will be one of great negativity.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050606"></A>
The reality is that the state government has allowed this industry to significantly develop to a potential energy powerhouse in people’s backyards without the proper checks and balances. The LNP and I will harass the state government as much as we can to enact a more appropriate legislative framework. We are not opposed to it; we want it done right. I challenge and encourage the industry to step up to community expectations and not just meet the requirements of the existing legislative framework.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050607"></A>
There are responsible players in the industry and I encourage them to lift the standards of the whole coal seam gas industry in terms of sustainable and long-term environmental outcomes for the community. The coal seam gas industry is welcome, but we have to ensure, as does the industry, that it is doing the right thing by the environment and by the people so that the longevity of these projects will have long-term benefits, not environmental consequences.</Hansard-Body>

Ms CROFT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Broadwater--ALP) (3.55 pm): This is a budget that is moderate in its expenditure. It had to be. The global financial crisis stripped $7.6 billion from the state revenue, so the government needed to be disciplined in its expenditure. Yes, Labor committed to spending prior to the global financial crisis. That is when we as a state reaped the rewards. Every electorate represented in this House benefited from those times. On the Gold Coast, Labor delivered the Tugun bypass, Skilled Park at Robina and a 20-bed medical ward and renal dialysis unit at the Gold Coast Hospital. We delivered the Hope Island road upgrades stages 1 and 2, duplicated the Gold Coast rail line and extended the rail line from Robina to Varsity Lakes. Labor delivered a new Gold Coast elective surgery centre, providing up to 6,000 extra surgeries a year. We delivered more police, more ambulance officers and more nurses for the Gold Coast. We have delivered record funding to our schools and road infrastructure, and Labor has been committed to maintaining the Gold Coast’s status as the events capital of the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050618"></A>
I do not hear opposition members saying, ‘I wish the government had not built that police station, school or road in my electorate.’ What they are saying is, ‘In hindsight, what the government should have done is save that money for a rainy day or a global financial crisis.’ Every member in this House, the media and our constituents wanted the government to supply more and more services, infrastructure and schools. Then the global financial crisis hit and the government’s priority above all else was to save jobs and stimulate our economy. The opposition would have people think that the global financial crisis hit five years ago. But in fact it was only two years ago, and many of the state’s industries are still clawing their way back from economic downturn as most households stopped their spending and uncertainty made businesses make decisions that I am sure they would have preferred not to make. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050619"></A>
The Bligh government has been responsible in its approach to deliver a budget for Queensland that continues to build on a strong economy for growth. It sets a course for financial recovery and a stronger economic outlook. It is a budget that delivers, with our massive building program of $17.1 billion. This was our commitment at the last election. As promised, we are investing in jobs for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050620"></A>
I have spoken to many people in my electorate about the economic decisions this government has made. Many of those people have very strong, conservative views. But they say to me that what we are doing is right. What we are doing--focusing on jobs and infrastructure--is critical. Interestingly, many of them, in particular the conservative voters in my electorate, support the government’s decision to sell some assets. Those constituents, many of them businesspeople themselves, know that this government has made a tough decision, but it is a right one for Queensland and I am sure it is what the opposition would do if faced with the same circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050621"></A>
If it is a choice between keeping assets--such as Forestry Plantations Queensland, the timber business that grows and harvests trees; Queensland Motorways Ltd, which has the tolling rights for the Logan and Gateway motorways; Abbot Point Coal Terminal; Queensland Rail’s coal business; the Port of Brisbane--and selling these assets to provide funding where it is urgently needed, then I support selling these assets. I support these asset sales so that we can provide a helping hand where it is needed--to our seniors, children at risk, people with disabilities, people who are sick and needing medical assistance, and those with mental health issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053954"></A>
This state government is not going to stand still and wait for good economic times to do these things. We need to build our economy and continue to provide care for people who need care in our community. That is exactly what this state budget has done. What exactly has the opposition put forward as an alternative? What do opposition members say to their constituents when they need social housing, when they arrive with a child with a disability to ask desperately for respite care, or when a family is sourcing assistance to ensure their elderly parent can stay in their home for as long as possible? Clearly, opposition members would want the government to do nothing because that is what they have offered the people of Queensland--nothing, zip, zero. No policies, no solution to the impact of the global financial crisis, no commitment to supporting the state’s most vulnerable and needy. Madam Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>

The commitment to the cruise ship terminal in Townsville has not changed, but with $60 million promised from both the state and federal governments for this major project, it is worrying to say the least that the Townsville City Council is yet to play its critical role. For a $30 million share, it will get a $90 million outcome, which in infrastructure alone is real value. That is before you value-add with the flow-on effects of employment and tourism. This project is too vital for the region to pass up, and I ask the Townsville City Council to embrace the cruise ship terminal instead of ignoring it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054013"></A>
It is at this point that I reflect on my electorate. It is an electorate which enjoys the Townsville lifestyle, including the climate, beaches, the superb meandering river environment, parks, walkways, high employment and promising growth. Mundingburra is unique as a regional electorate. I know we all think our electorates are very special, but I believe Mundingburra is representative of middle Australia in all its human characteristics. Mundingburra is land locked and has no government centre like a local body but it embraces almost 30,000 people. My constituents go to work or not, earn wages or not, attend TAFE and university and complete apprenticeships. They comprise families, workers, pensioners and vulnerable groups requiring support. Many constituents leave Mundingburra for work, but the electorate also boasts a large small-business sector. Public servants and NGOs are also part of the electorate’s make-up.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054014"></A>
Mundingburra has no ports, railways, large industrial sites or heavy industries, but the issues which affect all of us can be found in abundance--that is, jobs, health, education, wellbeing and the environment in which we live. It is to these matters that I now turn my attention. At this period in our global evolution, markets everywhere are shaken, job figures are bad in the United States, fears of renewed sovereign debt in Europe are rampant and the slowdown in China’s economy could go further than expected. But in Australia we continue to ride the storm thanks to the concerted government efforts, both state and federal, of investing in infrastructure. Queensland is no exception, and this budget reflects this. We are the envy of the world. The editorial in my local paper has the heading ‘Little for North in Budget’, and it states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054016"></A>
Pensioners, motorists, people with a disability, first home buyers and hearing-impaired children are the only ... winners ... there was little to sing about.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054017"></A>
But these winners are the people who make up my electorate. These are the very people who have not been forgotten and, as the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
, said, ‘Full credit to the state on Budget win’. The <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 described it as a budget that--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054018"></A>
... would be the envy of many struggling state governments around the world--a Budget of ... lower debt, higher growth and more jobs.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054019"></A>
This is back-to-basics common sense, with a focus on continuing to stimulate the economy with capital works spending. Let us not forget that this investment translates to almost seven per cent of the economy. I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my speech in <Hansard-Italic>

This budget is about giving my electorate a helping hand, by helping to ease the living pressures on working families, pensioners and those doing it hard. And when times are tough, every dollar counts.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054024"></A>
But it’s worth reminding our critics that delivering infrastructure through the massive building program has always been, and will continue to be, about protecting jobs. There will be more frontline staff in health and more ambulance officers, police officers, fire-fighters, teachers, teacher-aides and child safety officers.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054025"></A>
Concessions, rebates and subsidies will be provided to people in need for electricity costs. And tax rebates will remain for employers of apprentices and trainees as well as attractive concessions for first home buyers. Queensland continues to have the lowest payroll tax in the nation and employment progress will continue to deliver jobs. I say that this budget, although not filled with “bells and whistles”, has all the ingredients to keep people employed, safe and healthy and filled with hope for the future. The Business Industry support this budget as well, with a comment from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Qld saying that, on balance, this is a fair budget, and that we are pursuing the right path, especially with respect to strengthening the balance sheet. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054026"></A>
The latest job figures have just been released and once again for the tenth month in a row, Qld has generated jobs--more than any other state and of the 8800 jobs, 8200 are full time.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054027"></A>
This means 50,700 jobs, half way to our commitment. Is it any wonder that even the erstwhile Colin Dwyer, my last LNP challenger, has given the budget his tick of approval? QCOSS have welcomed our electricity rebates for seniors, pensioners and our most vulnerable and of course C&amp;K and Independent Schools Qld have embraced our commitments to bringing forward the construction of additional Kindies. The local Government Association, Wilderness Society and Waste Contractors and Recyclers Association have praised our plans for industry, endorsing the fact that this budget focuses on Queenslanders needs for the future. We are on track to return to a surplus, deliver jobs and regain our AAA rating. Our infrastructure plan is second to none and it is delivering. While it is fiscally strict, it’s about building a sustainable recovery by taking care of people and business now and I commend it to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. D BOYLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships) (4.03 pm): It is very important as the member for Cairns that I put on the record my thanks, together with the thanks of the people of Cairns, to the government for providing help in Cairns at a time when we need it. The Bligh government is supporting the cultural and arts precinct in Cairns. The government has committed to giving the land to the council for this precinct. We have $2.5 million available immediately for the further planning, business feasibility and design studies that are needed. This has all been widely welcomed. Yes, there are some nay-sayers, but they are in the minority. As they understand the importance of this project for the long-term future of Cairns, they will no doubt come around in time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054032"></A>
In releasing this good news in the budget, the government has also signalled that we will be a one-third partner with the Cairns Regional Council and the federal government in constructing this precinct. The precinct will include a performing arts centre, exhibition space--which is sorely needed, I have to say, to supplement the existing busy convention centre--and, at last, a regional museum. The precinct will showcase our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It will not only provide them with a home in our region to showcase their culture and their present significance in our community; it will also be a place where tourists and other visitors to Cairns can engage with first Australians, particularly those from Far North Queensland and the Torres Strait. It will be an entertainment precinct as well--full of life, full of activity, full of good times--for visitors, which is very important economically, and for all of the locals as well. I have been accused of hyperbole because I have referred to it as the Darling Harbour of Cairns, but I have no doubt in my heart that it will leave Darling Harbour in the shade. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054037"></A>
I need to put on the record my sincere thanks to the Premier. If it were not for her clear and unequivocal support for Cairns as a primary destination for arts and culture with a focus on Indigenous arts and culture, this may not have happened. Since her commitment to the first Cairns Indigenous Arts Fair about a year ago, she has stepped forward and provided further commitments for a second Cairns Indigenous Arts Fair this year as well as the broader development of the Indigenous arts industry in Cairns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054038"></A>
There is no doubt that this project will be talked about tremendously over the years to come, as we do the detailed planning and the business case and then progressively construct the facilities that will be part of that precinct. If this is to happen soon, it requires the federal government to commit to the project as well. We have not yet heard that absolute commitment, though I am pleased to see we have had some encouraging words from Prime Minister Rudd. I understand that further considerations are underway at a Commonwealth level. It will without doubt be a project that will come in time to symbolise Cairns and will be the next stage in the development of Cairns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054039"></A>
Those of us who have lived there a long time know that it was a huge fillip to Cairns when the Cairns International Airport was built and was controlled locally and through the state government and then had its facilities massively expanded. We know that another fillip to the development of Cairns was the establishment of the Cairns Convention Centre some 12 years ago. We know, similarly, that when the Esplanade Lagoon project was funded and then opened that was a fillip to the Cairns economy and the development of our region. It will be the same when the cultural, arts and entertainment precinct gets underway.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054040"></A>
As the member for Cairns, I thank the Bligh government team--the Premier and the Treasurer in particular--for the further commitments under the Health heading. The expansion and redevelopment of the Cairns Base Hospital, the new Cairns community health centre, which is well underway, and the expansion of the emergency department are hugely important projects, as are other capital works in the port, in education and in other spheres of state government activity. In my own electorate alone, these works for just the next year add to $160 million and more. This means lots and lots of jobs, and that is what we need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054098"></A>
I also recognise the importance of Cairns being allocated over $5 million, which is about one-quarter of the budget for Green Army jobs. That creates a splendid opportunity to generate even more jobs in a region that sorely needs them. We have expansions of services in child safety, housing, youth, and services and benefits for seniors and pensioners, and we welcome those too. As the member for Cairns, I reiterate that this is a very important budget that highlights the support and facilities that we need in the immediate term to get us through this difficult period. Clearly, it also positions Cairns well for a stronger, long-term future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054101"></A>
I am proud to be the Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships. This budget provides some excellent things for both of those sectors. I have sought the Speaker’s permission and I now ask the leave of the House to incorporate my further remarks as a minister in my budget reply speech. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054102"></A>
Leave granted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054104"></A>
The 2010-11 state budget underlines the Bligh government’s commitment to working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, with an investment of more than $97 million in initiatives across the state. We are 100 per cent committed to working with communities to ensure better outcomes for Indigenous peoples. This government has a strong economic plan for the future that means we can continue to invest in a range of programs that are helping local communities. This will be complemented by a significant investment across government in areas such as health and education. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054105"></A>
I welcome the budget’s inclusion of $15.6 million to support the groundbreaking Cape York Welfare Reforms. Working in partnership with Indigenous communities, the federal government and the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership, these reforms are making a real difference in the trial towns and helping to build stronger communities. Increasing rates of school attendance and falling rates of crime against the person provide early evidence that reforms are on track.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054106"></A>
The 2010-11 Budget includes $7.25 million across the Department of Communities to fund the groundbreaking Remote Indigenous Land and Infrastructure Program Office. The Program Office is playing a critical role in resolving the issues that have historically road blocked economic and social development in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. By June 30 2010, the Program Office will have completed land infrastructure plans for all 16 Indigenous councils. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054107"></A>
This coming financial year, we will see Indigenous communities abuzz as work continues on developing survey networks and overseeing the development of council planning schemes. Housing, welfare reforms and justice are some of the key planks in our whole-of-government strategy to address Indigenous disadvantage. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054108"></A>
I also welcome $4.2 million to continue the Murri Court and Queensland Indigenous Alcohol Diversion Program. The Murri Court is administered by the Department of Justice and Attorney-General. The Murri Court works by involving Elders in cases where an Indigenous person has already pleaded guilty to an offence. The Elders provide advice on culturally appropriate sentencing options. Funding for the Murri Court is one part of the Bligh government’s strategy to address Indigenous over-representation in the justice system.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054109"></A>
With less than a year to run on the current Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Justice Agreement, the Bligh government is working on a new strategy aligned with the National Indigenous Law and Justice Framework. The new strategy will include a strong focus on prevention and early intervention. The 2010-11 state budget importantly builds on our foundations and it puts Queensland in the box seat for a stronger economic recovery that will benefit all Queenslanders. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr KILBURN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Chatsworth--ALP) (4.10 pm): I rise to support the government’s Appropriation Bill 2010. The 2010-11 state budget continues this government’s commitment to building a strong, green, smart, healthy and fair state. When I spoke in this House at this time last year I acknowledged that many people in my electorate opposed the government’s plans to sell off or lease state owned assets. I understand that many people in my electorate are still angry with this government over the sale of assets and are opposed to the sale process. However, this does not detract from the fact that in this instance it is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do because, in these difficult economic times, the government should be focused on delivering on our commitment to a strong, green, smart, healthy and fair state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054112"></A>
In this budget we are starting to see the benefits of the hard decisions that the government made last year. This budget provides for a record investment of $10 billion in health, $9 billion for education and a $17.1 billion infrastructure program. But what do those numbers mean for the people of Queensland and, particularly, for the residents of Chatsworth? The $17.1 billion Capital Works Program is supporting 106,000 jobs throughout Queensland. The program includes continuing work on the South East Busway, the completion of the Gateway Arterial upgrade and the commencement of the extension of the Gateway project from Mount Gravatt-Capalaba Road to the M1. The record Health budget continues to invest in hospital emergency departments throughout Queensland, including the Princess Alexandra Hospital, which would be the hospital that residents in my electorate would use in case of an emergency; building the new Queensland Children’s Hospital; $39.1 million to pilot a persistent pain health service strategy at four locations in Queensland, including the Princess Alexandra Hospital; $31.2 million over four years to support the important research work that is being conducted at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, and that will benefit Queenslanders long into the future. 2010 will also see another 720 nurses, 180 doctors and 300 allied health professionals employed and working to improve health outcomes for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054113"></A>
Earlier this year the Bligh government released the Flying Start education green paper, and in this budget we continue to demonstrate this government’s commitment to education. In the past year I have witnessed extensive investment in schools throughout my electorate, both from the federal government and the state government. The Tingalpa State School has been completely rebuilt and the new Bayside P-12 College has commenced operation and is providing excellent facilities to residents of the Gumdale and Wakerley area. In this budget we have a record $1.38 billion school building program, which includes $1.2 million for the extension of the C&amp;K kindergarten at Carina school, $250,000 for a kindergarten at Gumdale State School, $201,000 for general learning area renewal at the Belmont State School, $492,000 to commence a much needed upgrade of the science laboratories at the White’s Hill State College--that is something that I lobbied hard for with the minister and I am pleased to see that we have commenced that upgrade this year--and $101,000 for general learning area renewal at Mayfield State School. The government has also provided $44,000 to assist the ABC Learning Centre at Carindale to provide an approved kindergarten program and $26,400 to assist the ABC Learning Centre in Carina to provide an approved kindergarten program for 15 hours per week for 40 weeks. The education department will also recruit and train 3,000 volunteers throughout Queensland to become Queensland ready readers, to assist our young people in classrooms. I know already that many people in the Chatsworth electorate have applied to be involved with this wonderful program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054123"></A>
Whilst all this expenditure is welcome, the real strength of the budget is that it sets a foundation for a strong financial future for Queensland. The forecast debt levels in the forward estimates have been reduced, the return to surplus has been brought forward and the framework has been set to return Queensland to a AAA credit rating. These improvements in tough financial times demonstrate the importance of the decisions this government made last year. In yesterday’s paper, the Leader of the Opposition took out a full-page advertisement which, as we heard yesterday, he wants Queensland taxpayers to fund. In that ad he claimed that this government failed to listen to the opposition on infrastructure spending. I for one am glad that we did not listen, because the simple fact is that following the economic advice of the opposition would have meant that there would have been no infrastructure built. There would be no Gateway Bridge duplication to assist the residents of my electorate, no Gateway Arterial road upgrade, no South East Busway to deliver improved public transport to my electorate, no State Schools of the Future funding for the Tingalpa State School, no new Bayside College, less money for hospitals and on and on it goes. We have seen the LNP at all levels oppose all the stimulus spending at every opportunity, although they line up to get their photos taken with the infrastructure that is developed by those very same programs. The programs they oppose have delivered new libraries, multipurpose centres and halls to all the schools throughout my electorate. The programs have provided or supported thousands of jobs for people in the Camp Hill, Carina, Carina Heights, Carindale, Belmont, Gumdale, Wakerley and Capalaba West areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054124"></A>
The budget outlines the importance of the government’s economic reform program, a program to return Queensland’s AAA credit rating. At times it has been a difficult job to explain the need for those changes in the electorate, and those changes needed to be made. Explaining the need for the changes is a job that is worth doing and one that I am committed to. I encourage those residents of Chatsworth who have concerns or need more information regarding the government’s plan for Queensland’s future to contact my office and make an appointment to see me. I will sit with them and explain how the plan we have put in place will benefit Queenslanders now and into the future. The future is what this government is focused on. While the opposition sulks about the last election result, we are building the infrastructure needed for the future. While opposition members position themselves for a leadership change, we are modernising this state’s education system to prepare our youth to be the leaders of the future. While the opposition argues that taxpayers should fund its political ads, we are positioning Queensland to be a world leader in medical research. While the LNP opposes every bill that has been brought into this House to protect the environment, we have invested in the Boggo Road Ecosciences Precinct, a project that will allow over 1,000 scientists to focus on solving Queensland’s and Australia’s biggest environmental issues. We have committed $35 million to protect koala habitat, $56 million over the next five years to expand national parks and $115 million for solar power initiatives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054126"></A>
Today while the Leader of the Opposition was delivering his embarrassing budget response--a response that, once again, delivered a raft of feel-good statements with no substance--the latest job figures were released. Queensland generated jobs for the 10th month in a row with 8,800 new jobs, the most of any state, and 8,200 of them are full-time jobs. Today our job target stands at 50,700. We are halfway towards our commitment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054127"></A>
This budget has clearly identified that this government has a plan that is delivering jobs, a plan that benefits Queenslanders now and into the future. I commend the Premier and the Treasurer for having the leadership to make the tough decisions that needed to be made to deliver this fiscally responsible budget, a budget that delivers on the commitment to make Queensland a strong, green, smart, healthy and fair state. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland) (4.19 pm), by leave: During question time this morning the member for Condamine asked a question in relation to an operational matter around the DEEDI office at Oakey. I gave an undertaking that I would provide him with the facts around this office. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061511"></A>
The facts are that the part-time administration officer located at Oakey accepted a voluntary early retirement package in February 2010. Subsequently, Biosecurity Queensland moved the remaining staff member, an inspector, to Toowoomba for operational efficiency. Oakey is about half an hour away from Toowoomba. The inspector will service the same areas as when located at Oakey. These areas include Oakey, Pittsworth and Millmerran. The Oakey office is currently unstaffed but no decision has been made to close it. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs STUCKEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Currumbin--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.20 pm): Last year I referred to the budget as the sale of the century, as a result of the Premier sneakily announcing to the trusting public that she was going to sell Queensland out from under them. I must have been right because here we are a year later and my office, like those of other honourable members across Queensland, is being bombarded with angry voters wishing the Premier a ‘happy Anna-versary’. But their messages are not friendly. Rather, they are accompanied by terse, unflattering comments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061524"></A>
I wonder how those opposite who all support these asset sales are responding to these concerned people? Do they admit that they sold them out at the last election? Do they admit that they were re-elected by stealth and default? I bet they do not. It is up to us on this side of the House to make sure all Queenslanders know that it was Labor who betrayed them. It is up to us to restore honesty and integrity to this parliament before Queenslanders forget what it is. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061525"></A>
Strangely, we have not seen the Premier put her hand on her heart and pronounce ‘You can count on me’ much lately. Perhaps she knows that only a minority of Queenslanders have any faith in her, her Labor government, her flimsy promises. This budget is another monument to incompetence, to Labor’s addiction to debt and to Labor’s indifference to the burden this places on taxpayers in the immediate future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061526"></A>
Taxes are up eight per cent, prices for electricity and water are up, and government owned corporations’ income is up through price rises, flowing on to a 50 per cent increase in their dividend and income tax equivalents to $1.46 million. General government debt will rise by 50 per cent in 2010-11 to $23.38 billion, climbing to $38 billion in 2013-14, by which time interest expenses will represent a $2.34 billion burden to the state’s capacity to service the public’s needs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061527"></A>
As is clear from the inexorable rise in general government debt year after year, at about $3.5 billion each year through the forward projections, Labor has no plan to retire the debt or indeed any capacity to do so as the comparable year-over-year increase in revenue is about an average $1.1 billion. That is, of course, unless Labor sells more GOCs or increases taxes or cuts services or all three. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061528"></A>
Does the careful observer note a trend here? Could Labor take action to reduce general government expenses--up seven per cent--when the rest of Australia, at least in the private sector, has done so? Could Labor take to heart the suggestion made on page 147 of Budget Paper No. 2 relating to GOCs? It states--</Hansard-Body>

Overall though, the rates of returns on assets and equity remain well below private sector equivalent levels, representing an opportunity cost to taxpayers. This highlights the need for ongoing reform and operational improvement. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Then there was the pathetic attempt by the Treasurer, the ‘economic dunce’ as the Leader of the Opposition called him, to dupe us into believing that all is well because the debt that Labor in part created was coming down marginally. </Hansard-Body>

Having delivered four straight budget deficits in a row, this government is now burdening the state with a record $84 billion debt--a debt of $18,000 for every man, woman and child; a debt that will encumber future generations. To add further insult, the Treasurer is unable to inform Queenslanders of the true cost of the AAA credit rating that we lost under this Labor government. The 2010-11 budget fails to deliver a debt repayment strategy which will make it even more difficult than ever to regain our once-prized rating. Even our poor neglected cousins New South Wales have managed to hang on to theirs. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1061533"></A>
The shadow Treasurer quoted this morning that the direct cost of the loss of this AAA rating would be in the vicinity of $200 million per year. The Premier’s promise to create 100,000 full-time jobs was always looking hollow, and her reluctance to protect jobs in regional Queensland through her silence on the federal government’s super tax on mining shows that she is not serious about creating and saving jobs. </Hansard-Body>

Worst of all, though, this budget will be remembered as the one that fast-tracks the government’s sneaky plan to sell off $15 billion of our assets in its disgraceful and unpopular fire sale privatisation agenda. Why should Queenslanders believe a word this Bligh government says when it cannot even pay its nurses, doctors and other invaluable health workers? </Hansard-Body>

A boost to the Health budget will not restore the faith of these workers, some of whom have already left the system in disgust at their treatment at the hands of this Labor mob. It is the last straw for a number of these dedicated workers whom the Minister for Health told to drink more coffee to stay awake for the long and punishing shifts expected of them in this sick and underresourced system, long neglected by Labor. </Hansard-Body>

In allocating $4 million to fix the Health payroll debacle of its own making, the Treasurer shows either his ignorance or his arrogance with regard to this poorly managed and avoidable disaster. As consultants say, it will take countless millions more and still may never be fixed using this system. About 100 consultants and public servants are said to have been called in to fix this problem. Amongst this number is a mix of consultants and senior public servants of the level AO6 and above. If one takes into consideration that the basic pay for a consultant is around $700 a day--anything between that and $1,700--then $4 million is going to run out very quickly. </Hansard-Body>

I move now to my electorate of Currumbin. As of 31 March 2010 there were 495 one-, two- and three-bedroom households in government managed social rental housing within in Currumbin area. The budget brought down by the Treasurer allocates $3.19 million for more public housing in the form of 17 one-bedroom apartments at Tugun. Only six car parks have been provided which seems too few. Parking is at a premium as this is a small suburban street which will be impacted upon heavily if adequate spaces are not allocated. </Hansard-Body>

There is still a site vacant at a prime location on the Gold Coast Highway which in February 2007 I was told by then minister for housing, Mr Schwarten, $1.4 million was spent purchasing. Now, over three years later, with an average wait of eight years for public housing in my electorate, there is not even a foundation in sight. So much for then Minister Schwarten’s commitment to provide housing for the poor in my electorate. </Hansard-Body>

A number of schools in my electorate will receive substantial funding for projects in this budget.

I note that there is no provision for funding for any antibullying education or training in the education budget. The events of the last few years have proved that bullying is an enormous growing issue in our schools--one that cannot continue to be ignored by the state government. I wish to advise the House that I will be launching a recognised antibullying program called Walk in My Shoes to be run later this month in the two high schools in my electorate of Currumbin. </Hansard-Body>

I am happy to put my money where my mouth is to support the government’s Say No to Bullying campaign--a campaign that might sound strong on paper but needs action and funds if it is to have any real effect.

During last year’s budget the inexperienced Minister for Infrastructure was crowing like a barnyard rooster about his department’s achievements, claiming that the Tugun desalination plant was a successfully completed project. As I stand here today we have more defects undergoing repair, and still the government will not take over the plant and commission it fully. What is it afraid of? Have the costs blown out so much it cannot admit the amount? Is this what the minister counts as a winning sign of his government’s competence in managing infrastructure? If it is, then he gets an F for fail. Just what is going on? Is the minister going to mothball it indefinitely? I asked the minister on 25 May if he was closing the plant for six months as per the rumours, but to date I have only had an acknowledgement that he has received the question despite my request for an urgent reply. Residents in affected suburbs are still shattered by the aftermath of the construction of this project. But forget about the desal plant: this government cannot even fix unsightly broken noise barrier panels on the Tugun bypass. The minister brags about this showpiece--this showpiece that cost $545 million, another massive cost blow-out--yet he has not bothered to replace countless shattered panels for almost two years now and either cannot or will not tell us what it will cost to replace them or what material has been chosen for the job. He rants and raves like a delusional village idiot here in the House yet cannot fix the most basic of things.</Hansard-Body>

Last year’s budget contained $1.5 million as a result of a desperate attempt to win the surfing vote at the 2009 election. This was for fixing Kirra, a world-renowned surfing break. Half or more of this money has already been spent and no long-term strategy has been put in place. Here we have another sign that both the minister and her government have not a clue. They just played another trick on trusting voters. A refusal to reveal what is in the bilateral state contract would indicate there is something to hide. Are those opposite protecting Labor mates in New South Wales from penalties for breaches?</Hansard-Body>

Over the next couple of years a huge residential development of more than 5,000 dwellings will be built at Cobaki located literally on the New South Wales and Queensland border, prompting the call for an interchange to prevent traffic pouring down Boyd Street in Tugun which is where the desalination plant resides. A request for this revealed yet another false promise by Labor, as the government instructed Main Roads to inform stakeholders that there were no plans at all for this much needed infrastructure--yet in plans in 2002 one was clearly there. The Premier has exhibited her preferred approach: stealth followed by the surprise attack--do not tell Queenslanders the truth and then spring it on them.</Hansard-Body>

With five million visitors through our Gold Coast Airport each year, this government simply cannot ignore the need to fast-track rail from Varsity to Coolangatta. One station every 11 years is telling of its hopeless capacity to build infrastructure to meet growth. The M1, which was built under a coalition government, is in dire need of an upgrade. Kevin Rudd robbed us of funds for the Nerang to Tugun section, which is so typical of Labor--promise one thing and do another. It is in its DNA. All that the southern Gold Coast will get is four kilometres or so from Nerang to Worongary. In yet another instance of a crippled and tired government, it is worrying to learn there is no committed funding for rail to Coolangatta. Mind you, at the rate of one station in 11 years, it would take over 40 years to get to Coolangatta under this Labor government! Tracking through previous budgets, the last known funding for the extension of the rail was $6 million to be spent on planning from Varsity to Tallebudgera back in 2007-08, but nothing can be built as the necessary infrastructure and widening of the M1 is required first.</Hansard-Body>

The Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary was included in the 2009 Weller report and residents are keen to learn the outcome of the recommendations. The new state-of-the-art wildlife hospital is highly successful but is bleeding costs to the tune of $600,000 every year. In a display of utter contempt for heritage and environmental protection, this government refuses to assist this unique sanctuary in any way, starving it of much needed funds. The Blair Athol crisis accommodation centre is a lifesaver for many homeless people on the Gold Coast. Located at Bilinga opposite the airport, this facility turned away over 6,600 men, women and children--that is 550 people every month--in the last 12 months. Manager Liz Fritz tells me that the biggest increase in service demand has been from families trying to hold on to their accommodation in spite of higher housing costs and/or reduction in employment opportunities. Blair Athol continues to struggle with the limited staffing resource it has and is most deserving of decent funding.</Hansard-Body>

Given the violent assaults and tragic deaths that have occurred in Coolangatta due to alcohol-fuelled violence, I would have expected some funding from the government. Cross-border issues flag the need for new legislation along the lines of a cross-border justice act that has been flagged for South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. In addition, Queensland must streamline special constable training. Mounting pressures and dangers are faced by our police, and this Labor government could not give a toss. How many of the additional 203 police officers in this budget will be allocated to the Gold Coast district? What will happen to the One Punch Can Kill campaign when the $400,000 allocated in the budget stops next year?</Hansard-Body>

Sergeant Leon Staines of the Gold Coast Traffic Branch expresses his concerns in an article about the dire state of the Queensland Police Service’s resources. Unfortunately, our front-line police are the butt of the nation when it comes to equipment, lagging behind neighbouring states for critical technology and safety equipment upgrades such as in-car computing systems and emergency distress buttons. Police have indicated that they are unhappy that inaccurate staffing numbers are being peddled and that actual numbers were not reported in question on notice No. 240 this year. The figures just do not add up. There is a discrepancy of about 25 police. Was the minister misleading? He should do the sums and check if he has made a mistake and correct these figures.</Hansard-Body>

In the remainder of my speech I will comment on my shadow portfolio of public works and information and communication technology. The Department of Public Works will spend some $3.3 billion in the 2010-11 budget and employ 7,627 staff. All of these considerable resources perform a key role by working with other government agencies in assisting them to deliver their services to the people of Queensland. However, this statement does not demonstrate the quality and value of its work through comparison with private sector businesses which offer, in many cases, comparable services with the performance of other states’ instrumentalities, and nor does its client departments have the opportunity to source their work to competing private business. This arrangement does not provide an environment which focuses effort on quality, price and service delivery.</Hansard-Body>

CITEC characterises both the doubtful competence of its work, in particular in terms of hospital payrolls, and its belief that neither it nor its minister will be held accountable. There is no comment on this payroll disaster in the Service Delivery Statement--an appalling indictment on this government. The comment referred to earlier in my address about the need for reform and improvement in performance would apply particularly to a department that exists solely because of its monopoly in servicing tied departments or because stand-alone government entities have been formed that have no capacity to stand alone. The minister was very keen to boast in the House on Tuesday that ‘even before the budget Public Works is delivering $8.5 billion worth of building infrastructure’. He continues--</Hansard-Body>

Understandably he would not want to mention the massive cost blow-outs caused by CorpTech. Treasury flicked this inept agency over to Public Works in mid-2008 and the minister did not bother to check it out. The fact CorpTech has accrued a cost burn of $400 million between 2004 and 2008 should have set off alarm bells, but the minister either was not interested or ignored these warnings. CorpTech is increasing employee expenses and user charges by collecting funds from other agencies, yet it cannot even deliver a whole-of-government HR and payroll strategy.</Hansard-Body>

Considering the mishaps of the past 12 months with the safe handling of materials containing asbestos, I would have thought significant funds would have been secured by the minister for more education and monitoring procedures. Sadly, these are missing. Of significant concern is the lack of transparency and deliberate confusion from this government, which has once again changed the terminology used in the budget papers. Apart from a lack of consistency, these changes remove familiar concepts such as ‘outputs’ and ‘performance measures’ that are readily accepted terms and replaces them with ‘services’ and ‘service standards’ which do not so clearly define their topic. But I guess that is the idea--make it darned hard to decipher the labyrinth that would expose the truth to the general public that it is not performing and it is not producing projects on time and on budget for Queensland, despite statements to the contrary.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1061642"></A>
This minister presides over a portfolio that dispenses billions of dollars worth of Commonwealth funds under the BER.

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065663"></A>
It is little wonder that some refer to the Department of Public Works as the ‘Department for Public Waste’. As the minister likes to talk up this government’s green credentials I will, on this occasion, agree with him on one point: this is the greenest budget that this department has ever seen. You could call it a recycled budget, as most of this spending is simply reannounced from last year’s budget. As honourable members would see, most sections of this portfolio’s Service Delivery Statements require investigation as they reveal numerous shortcomings and underspends--things such as new government office buildings in Maroochydore supposed to have $53 million spent on them. Instead, only $39 million was spent. The money that was provided to complete the Boggo Road precinct redevelopment in 2009-10 was $23 million. Yet this year’s budget has $6.4 million allocated. The Zillmere Joint Contact Centre, the new government office building at Mareeba, the installation of power generators at Edward Street, Brisbane, are all further examples. This is not new money being announced; it is recycled money. </Hansard-Body>

Mr CRIPPS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Hinchinbrook--LNP) (4.40 pm): The Bligh government has handed down a traditional Labor budget that imposes more debt and higher taxes on Queenslanders. Despite claims by Treasurer Fraser that the state’s economy is improving, the 2010-11 budget papers reveal that Queensland’s debt increased from $43 billion in 2008-09 to $51 billion in 2009-10 and is on track to blow out to nearly $84 billion on current projections. The debt and the interest on that debt continues to grow and the 2010-11 budget papers still contain no repayment plan. The debt and the interest on this debt will eventually need to be serviced by Queensland taxpayers. Under the Bligh Labor government, taxes, fees and charges on Queenslanders will continue to increase. We have more debt and higher taxes--a traditional Labor budget indeed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065670"></A>
My constituents in the Hinchinbrook electorate are very anxious about how this debt will affect them in the future. Under the Bligh government, the cost of living for Queensland families and the cost of doing business in Queensland is spiralling out of control. Labor has introduced a new fuel tax, after promising that it would not. It has increased car registration, it has overseen a huge increase in electricity prices, it has increased a range of licence fees and, in the budget this week, it has delivered a new commercial waste levy. The Bligh Labor government is taxing us more than ever.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065671"></A>
Despite insisting that Queensland’s economic position is improving, the budget papers show that the Bligh government still intends to undertake a fire sale of state owned public assets, including Queensland Rail, our ports, our motorways and our plantation forests. That is despite the fact that its policy is strongly opposed by the overwhelming majority of Queenslanders. The LNP opposition has made it clear that it is opposed to the fire sale of state owned assets which is proposed by the Bligh government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065672"></A>
The fact that the 2010-11 Queensland state budget papers do not take into consideration the possible impact of the Rudd Labor government’s proposed super profits tax on the mining industry means that, if the mine tax goes ahead, the figures and the projections in it cannot be trusted. The truth is that, if Premier Bligh fails to stand up to Kevin Rudd on behalf of all Queenslanders and join with the LNP to oppose the super profits tax on the mining industry, it will be unlikely that we could rely on anything in Treasurer Fraser’s budget to be accurate. Of course Premier Bligh and Treasurer Fraser will not stand up to Kevin Rudd on the super profits tax on the mining industry. Instead of standing up for Queensland, where the mining industry underpins the economy, especially in regional areas of the state, they will kowtow to the Rudd Labor government. The Premier and the Treasurer--Raggedy Ann and Andy, the spineless rag doll playthings of Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan--will sell us out. They will capitulate and they will hand over our mining royalties to Canberra. </Hansard-Body>

The contribution in the 2010-11 state budget papers to my electorate of Hinchinbrook is rather underwhelming. In the area of education, I am rather disappointed that, despite more than 40 schools being either located in or servicing communities in my electorate, only one school will benefit from any capital funding in this budget. I welcome the $1.5 million allocation for the construction of a new kindergarten at Bluewater State School. Bluewater is a growing area of the northern beaches of Townsville and I am pleased that the needs of this growing school in my electorate have been recognised. But for that allocation to be the full extent of new capital funding for schools in my electorate is a real concern. In terms of modern school facilities and resources, students and staff in schools within and servicing communities in my electorate of Hinchinbrook deserve a fair go from the Bligh government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065677"></A>
I want to flag the need for a new primary school to be constructed in the near future to service the rapidly growing needs of the suburbs on the northern beaches of Townsville. Bohlevale State School has approximately 780 students. Education Queensland considers that the enrolments of Bohlevale State School are currently at about 93 per cent of capacity. Residential growth on the northern beaches of Townsville in my electorate in the new North Shore development and the suburbs of Burdell, Bushland Beach and Mount Low is very strong. Bohlevale State School also accepts students from the adjacent electorate of Thuringowa, from the suburbs of Deeragun and Jensen, and the new suburb of Cosgrove is planned for the Bohle Plains area. So there will be ongoing residential growth in that area, which will mean a requirement for additional educational facilities. I implore the Queensland government to plan properly for the growth in that area. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1065687"></A>
In the area of the environment, I am concerned about the absence of any clear allocation in the 2010-11 budget for the new Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service ranger base in Cardwell, which was first promised by the Bligh government in the 2008-09 state budget papers. This project is long overdue. The new QPWS ranger base at Cardwell was already a recycled item in the 2009-10 state budget, but now it appears that it has disappeared altogether from the budget papers. I certainly hope that this is just an oversight and that this important project for Cardwell has not been abandoned by the Bligh Labor government. I have written to the environment minister seeking advice about the failure of the Bligh Labor government to deliver this project on time and about the absence of any specific budget allocation for the facility in the 2010-11 budget papers.</Hansard-Body>

In the area of infrastructure, previously announced funding for infrastructure upgrades in the Cassowary Coast region of $13.7 million for a water treatment plant and $26.7 million for a sewage treatment plant in Innisfail and the $6.6 million previously announced for a sewage treatment plant upgrade for Lucinda and Dungeness in the Hinchinbrook shire have been confirmed in the 2010-11 state budget. I welcomed these allocations when they were announced. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065693"></A>
However, in respect of the allocations for the Cassowary Coast region, I note that these allocations give effect to recommendations contained in the Orion report, which I have been lobbying the state Labor government to act on for several years in this House in the wake of the amalgamation of the former shires of Johnstone and Cardwell, to deliver relief to ratepayers across the Cassowary Coast region. I regret that it has taken so long and so many reminders from me for the state government to act on recommendations contained in a report that it commissioned.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065696"></A>
Apart from those previously announced allocations, there are no new infrastructure initiatives in my electorate, which would indicate that all the rhetoric from the Bligh Labor government about decentralisation and regional development is just political spin. I cannot see any funding to encourage commercial or industrial development in regional communities in my electorate such as Ingham, Cardwell, Tully, Mission Beach or Innisfail notwithstanding the Bligh Labor government talking up the need to encourage population decentralisation and regional development.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065697"></A>
In the area of energy, for several years I have been pleased to see regular allocations by Stanwell Corporation in the Kareeya hydroelectric power station on the Tully River to undertake maintenance and capacity upgrades. This year, I welcome the $2.68 million allocation for upgrades to the Kareeya hydroelectric power station, west of Tully, which is an important strategic part of North Queensland’s electricity infrastructure network. Stanwell Corporation is an important employer in the Tully district and it maintains a positive relationship with Tully State High School, supporting bursaries and encouraging potential career paths for students. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1065700"></A>
In respect of main roads and transport, while previously announced federal funding commitments have been confirmed in the state budget, there are no new announcements for the state road network in the Hinchinbrook electorate. I acknowledge that the first instalment of $20 million for the previously announced $115 million for the upgrade of the northern section of the Cardwell Range on the Bruce Highway and the first instalment of $20 million for the previously announced $150 million upgrade of the Bruce Highway between Innisfail and Cairns are confirmed in the state budget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069531"></A>
I also acknowledge that the $14 million from the Queensland government for the replacement of the Jubilee Bridge in Innisfail is confirmed in the state budget. Again, this is an Orion report recommendation that should have been acted on some time ago. The issue has come to a head in recent weeks with the closure of the Jubilee Bridge. I will continue to work towards securing the balance of the cost of the new Jubilee Bridge from the federal government to deliver relief to all ratepayers in the Cassowary Coast region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069534"></A>
I am disappointed not to see new funds in the budget for upgrade to roads that have been a priority for me in the Hinchinbrook electorate. These include the Innisfail-Japoonvale road and the Silkwood-Japoonvale road, known as the Canecutter Way, and the Bruce Highway between Black River and Bluewater north of Townsville for which I believe planning needs to be progressed to expand this stretch to four lanes following on from the upgrades between the Bohle and Mount Low Parkway turn-off overpass. However, I will keep pressing the state government and the federal government on behalf of my constituents. </Hansard-Body>

I note the allocation of $226,000 by the Far North Queensland Ports Corporation for a new commercial fishing facility at Mourilyan Harbour. The details concerning where this new facility will be located within Mourilyan Harbour, what features it will include and when it will be constructed are not yet clear. The commercial fishing industry is an important employer in the Innisfail district. As the only all-weather and all-tide port between Cairns and Townsville, Mourilyan Harbour is an important port for the local commercial fishing industry. It is important that the port authority consult with local stakeholders before this facility is built. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1069536"></A>
In the area of health, once again I am rather disappointed that the Bligh government has failed to recognise that many rural and regional Queenslanders continue to be disadvantaged by its failure to increase the Patient Travel Subsidy Scheme. There is no mention in the state budget papers of any increase in support for rural and regional patients to access healthcare services. The withdrawal of services from smaller hospitals in my electorate, like Ingham and Tully, means that more patients are required to travel longer distances to Townsville or Cairns for basic health care like renal dialysis. It is not just the cents per kilometre subsidy that is inadequate but also the accommodation subsidy. The process involved in applying for the subsidy is also rather complicated. This poses difficulties for many people to whom the subsidy is important to be able to afford treatment, such as those on low and fixed incomes. The removal of the fuel tax rebate by the Bligh government means that transport costs have increased for patients, many of whom have chronic illnesses.</Hansard-Body>

I turn now to my shadow ministerial responsibilities of disability services and multicultural affairs. The Minister for Disability Services, Annastacia Palaszczuk, from the time that she came into the portfolio, has clearly articulated her priorities in the disability services sector, being young people in aged care, assisting ageing carers and early intervention and support for children with disabilities. I make no criticism of the minister because those priorities are worthy priorities and she has worked diligently in this regard. Last week we had the early release of the disability services budget. The claim by the minister and the Premier was that the budget for disability services would reach $1 billion in 2010-11, with an extra $12.5 million this year to support young people with a disability leaving school, to support people with spinal cord injuries, for early intervention and support services for families of children with disabilities and for early intervention centres for children with autism in Bundaberg and Mackay. Again, these are worthy initiatives for this budget and I make no criticism of the allocation of these funds.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069538"></A>
Budget allocations are just that: they are allocations. They are not expenditures. The real measure of commitment to any policy objective is where the rubber hits the road. It is all very well for the Premier and the minister to announce a record budget, but it will only make a difference if those budget allocations are expended on disability support services over the next financial year. Unfortunately, in the disability services sector Labor has a long record of announcing allocations but not delivering on them. Between 2002-03 and 2008-09, the state government has on average failed to spend 51 per cent of infrastructure funds promised to the disability support sector. Of the $295.5 million in infrastructure spending promised by Labor during that time, only $145.9 million was actually spent. That means that $149.6 million of infrastructure funds promised to the disability support sector in those seven budgets was not handed over by the state government. That is a disgrace and an indictment on this government. </Hansard-Body>

Those seven budgets were not overseen by the current minister, Minister Palaszczuk. That disgraceful legacy has been left behind by former ministers in that portfolio. The worst underspending was a shocking 83 per cent underspend in the area of infrastructure funding to the disability support sector in the 2005-06 budget. This new minister had an opportunity to turn over a new leaf and address this legacy. Unfortunately, the budget papers reveal that in many programs in the disability services budget the underspending continued in the 2009-10 financial year. So it appears that the minister is unfortunately continuing the tradition. </Hansard-Body>

A broken promise is not easy to cop from any government. When a government pledges funding and resources to people with a disability and those who support them, they make a moral commitment to each and every one of them. This group of people is amongst the most vulnerable in our community. When a government makes announcements about what it is going to do, it fosters hope and optimism in people who start to believe that their extraordinarily tough lives might be about to get that little bit more manageable. If you let them down--not once, not twice but in eight consecutive budgets on infrastructure spending--it is very hard to justify. </Hansard-Body>

Yesterday at the budget breakfast here at Parliament House, jointly hosted by National Disability Services Queensland and the Queensland Alliance, the non-government service providers belled the cat during question time. Representatives from Granite Belt Support Services in Stanthorpe asked why their desperate pleas for a capital grant had been ignored by the state government for several years. It is a perfectly legitimate question when we consider that infrastructure underspending averaged 51 per cent against budget allocations over the financial years 2002-03 to 2008-09. A representative from the Endeavour Foundation spoke about the serious problems that non-government service providers have faced meeting the costs of implementing recommendations in the Carter report. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069542"></A>
I have spoken several times in this place, including during debate on the State Penalties Enforcement and Other Legislation Amendment Bill in November 2009 and during the debate on the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill in February this year, about the lack of financial support provided to non-government organisations to help them meet the cost of compliance in respect of Carter report recommendations. Clearly the minister was not listening to me, but, more importantly, she has not been listening to the non-government disability service providers who support clients who exhibit challenging behaviours and in doing so utilise restrictive practices.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069543"></A>
Well might these NGO service providers ask such a legitimate question when once again we find that, after seven consecutive years of serious underspending against budget allocations, the latest budget papers reveal that that serious underspending has continued in the 2009-10 financial year. </Hansard-Body>

The minister has made much of her plan to deliver more early intervention support services for children with autism. Once again, it is a commendable priority. The test is what is happening on the ground, especially in regional and rural areas of Queensland. I acknowledged before the initiatives in Mackay and Bundaberg, but the story is not the same everywhere. I have previously raised in this House the concerns and frustrations of Waminda Services Ltd, a non-government service provider based in Dalby and delivering disability support services to communities throughout the Western Downs. Let me quote directly from a press release issued yesterday by Waminda Services Ltd which provides a view of disability support services funding to NGOs in regional and rural Queensland. It states--</Hansard-Body>

Lastly, in the area of multicultural affairs, I note from the Service Delivery Statement that the department will continue to focus its delivery of programs in partnership with non-government organisations and local governments that promote multiculturalism, improve community relations and increase the capacity of people from culturally diverse backgrounds. I endorse this approach. The SDS also indicates that, for the first time, the department will commence measuring the number of grants provided through the annual grant application process and the number of people participating in events and festivals sponsored by Multicultural Affairs Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073406"></A>
Some may argue that such measures are overdue. However, I would caution against an overly simplistic interpretation of these measures. The new SDS measures will record simple numbers in terms of grants and participation. While that data, in a quantitative sense, will be useful, it will of course be unable, in a qualitative sense, to inform us for the purposes of the budget papers of the effectiveness in the community of individual grants to achieve the goals set out in the multicultural services budget. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Mermaid Beach--LNP) (5.00 pm): I rise to speak on the Appropriation (Parliament) Bill 2010, the Appropriation Bill 2010 and the Revenue Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. This year the Labor government state budget has continued Queensland’s slippery slide deeper into the red with no relief to pay off the massive debt that the Bligh Labor government has created for many years to come for each and every Queenslander. </Hansard-Body>

This government has delivered no new funding for new initiatives in tourism, fair trading and racing. I wonder what the budget would look like if the government had not taken into consideration taxes from the mining sector, which will be absolutely devastated when mining companies pull out of their projects in Queensland. The Bligh Labor government has plunged our state into the greatest debt that Queensland has ever been in in history--that is a fact--which is set to blow out to a massive $83.5 billion in debt. Not a week goes by without the Premier thinking about what she can sell next to pay off the Labor Party’s debt that it has forced on each and every Queenslander. The amount of $10 million per day is paid by Queenslanders today for this Labor Party’s debt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073417"></A>
The Labor members’ latest catchcry is that they have a plan to fix this and a plan to fix that. It is the same catchcry New South Wales Labor used to get Morris Iemma elected when Bob Carr became on the nose in New South Wales. Now that Anna Bligh has Bob Carr-ish approval ratings, I reckon about September-October will see Anna off to Hollywood as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073420"></A>
The current economic position of Queensland is in a precarious state and return to growth has been slow, with the current national account growth data recording Queensland as having the lowest quarterly growth in the nation at just 0.2 per cent. No wonder businesses and markets are jittery. With Kevin Rudd’s new resources super profits mining tax, we will have an even slower recovery from the global financial crisis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073421"></A>
The resources super profits mining tax that the Rudd Labor government is insisting on placing on Australia’s driving force of the economy, the mining sector, is absolutely absurd. This, as we have seen, has had the short-term effect already, with jittery markets and mining companies pulling out of new projects left, right and centre. The fall in the mining share prices and the banking sector have seen Queenslanders’ superannuation fall further as a direct result of Labor Party fiscal mismanagement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073422"></A>
With Queensland relying on the mining industry to pay off its growing debt, I hope the Treasurer has done his figures correctly and has not taken into account future financial taxes from the mining sector, as they will not be there if Rudd continues his determination to destabilise the Australian economy with this hideous tax. Rio Tinto has expressed its intention to shelve plans to spend $11 billion expanding its massive iron ore projects in Western Australia and BHP Billiton has been reassessing the viability of coal and iron ore projects in New South Wales and Queensland. There is a distinct possibility that if the tax on mining profits goes ahead in its current form the $60 billion worth of coal gas and LNG projects at Curtis Island, in Queensland, and the surrounding areas could be placed in jeopardy. Stephen Bartholomuesz of the <Hansard-Italic>
Business Spectator</Hansard-Italic>
 reported that Origin’s Grant King believes that there will be a ‘significant negative impact’ on the value of resource projects. The final investment decisions of the four proposed LNG plants on Curtis Island are due to be made in the second half of the year, and this tax will have a significant impact. Bartholomuesz goes on to say--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1073429"></A>
With, after some deductions, the government generously allowing resource companies to earn the long-term bond rate (today less than six per cent and hardly anyone’s idea of super profitability) before the RSPT cuts in, it is improbable that the projects will get a go ahead on schedule and there is a significant prospect that the tax, if introduced, will kill off that investment and the billions of dollars of export income a year that it would generate from turning coal seam methane into a high-value product. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073430"></A>
The latest casualty is the decision by Xstrata to shelve two projects. One was to extend the life of the Ernest Henry copper mine in Cloncurry, in Queensland, in the current Labor electorate--which may not be the case after the next election--of Mount Isa. The other was to go ahead with the Wandoan coal project in the Surat Basin. This is almost $600 million worth of investment for a project worth $6 billion, and over 3,000 jobs will be lost. What is going to be next? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073435"></A>
In the meantime, the Rudd government is spending $38 million of taxpayers’ money to sell the mining super profits tax to Australians and Queenslanders. And the government talked about the ads that were in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 the other day! It has a hide. As Tony Abbott said, why didn’t the Prime Minister spend this money alerting the public about the potential hazards of the botched insulation program? I note that Minister Lawlor and the Bligh Labor government did not do much about warning Queenslanders about the botched insulation program either. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073436"></A>
Business is concerned about the mining tax, and it is concerned that Queensland is losing its tax competitiveness as we recover from the global financial crisis. I do not believe we are out of the woods yet, and this is indicated with the Reserve Bank of Australia holding its position on interest rates at the last meeting. There is also a chance that we will just not recover as quickly as everyone had first predicted we would. How can we when we have Labor governments who just like to spend and truly do not understand the need to be disciplined in their fiscal and monetary policy? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073439"></A>
The Bligh government’s unpopularity is soaring. As I talk to people, they are sick of the deceit and are fed up. The people of Queensland are sick of the deceit about the assets sales, with QR’s coal freight network, Forestry Plantations, Queensland Motorways, along with the Abbot Point Coal Terminal and the Port of Brisbane, in line to be sold without any consideration of the consequences by this government. The people and workers of Queensland are sick of the misleading information the government has fed them over the Queensland Health pay debacle. It is absolutely disgraceful that people are still not getting their full wage entitlements. One of my constituents, a grandfather, rang me about his granddaughter to say that she was not getting paid and when she went down to the office--she worked at Prince Alfred--to pick up her pay, she pointed out that she was owed for nine shifts. They said, ‘Oh, won’t two shifts do you for the moment? What are you--broke or something?’ It is absolutely disgusting that these workers are not getting paid. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073442"></A>
Queenslanders are sick of being the recipients of that botched insulation scheme when the state government only warned them when it was all too late. The people of Queensland are sick of essential services rising exponentially in cost when their wages do not match these exorbitant prices. Electricity prices are set to soar more than 13 per cent next financial year, following the approval of a multimillion dollar spending scheme for Energex and Ergon in part for telemarketing of their own product. Also, what is solar energy going to do to energy prices? If we keep promoting solar energy, obviously the consumption of energy through these other suppliers will fall. So, again, they will put the price of electricity up as solar becomes more popular. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077287"></A>
The hike was approved by the Queensland Competition Authority, which ruled the price rise was necessary to balance ‘customer acquisition and retention costs’. What nonsense that these companies could have this funded by the public of Queensland to go and sell more product. This was also caused by the failure of successive Labor governments to manage electricity over the last 12-year period. Last year, electricity went up 20 per cent and now it is going up another 13 per cent. The government is reckless and irresponsible, and the people of Queensland are paying for the Bligh Labor government’s failure to manage the budget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077291"></A>
The Bligh Labor government has continued the budget blunders with the continuation of our downgraded AA credit rating. We are the only mainland state to have a AA rating. What an embarrassment that we are worse than the basket case of New South Wales. This almost makes us terminal under Bligh Labor. On top of Rudd’s new mining tax, this will have an absolutely disastrous effect on business confidence and investment in this state. Bligh’s promise of 100,000 jobs in this term of office will be another broken promise because the Bligh Labor government will not be able to achieve anything if this mining tax goes ahead. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077294"></A>
The disastrous Bligh Labor government policy of abolishing the fuel subsidy and increasing car registration, which is the highest in Australia, has impacted heavily on all Queenslanders, including the drive tourism component for Queensland. The cost of living is beginning to be out of reach for many Queenslanders. What is the government doing about it? Selling off the state’s assets to compensate for its failure to manage the budget.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077296"></A>
The tourism industry has been through a rough period, with fallout from the GFC, the swine flu, the Icelandic volcano, which I cannot pronounce, and a high Australian dollar. This has caused certain sectors of the Australian industry to come to a complete halt. Tourism Australia’s lacklustre ‘There’s nothing like Australia’ campaign has not given the tourism industry the spark to get it going again. It is plain boring, has no creativity, has no thought-out catchy jingle and has as its lure an out-of-tune melody which is wishy-washy. It is on a par with the minister’s <Hansard-Italic>
Hey, hey, we’re the Monkees</Hansard-Italic>
 bomb-out. I get the feeling the ad agencies doing these disastrous jingles are singing to the tune of their disastrous Labor mates. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077297"></A>
The federal Labor government has made sure the industry will have a hard time recovering from the GFC, with Tourism Australia’s budget next year being reduced by $19 million from last year’s budget. What a time to reduce the budget for tourism. This makes it incredibly difficult to maintain tourism promotional activities for this sector in Queensland, where we rely heavily on the volume of tourists to the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077299"></A>
Now we have seen that the Treasurer has announced no new money for the tourism sector in Queensland, with an actual reduction in direct payments to Tourism Queensland, our chief marketing body, of $8 million. Where is the money for the tourism hot spots like the Gold Coast, Cairns, Townsville, the Great Barrier Reef, the Sunshine Coast, the outback, Mackay, Brisbane and Port Douglas? Can the minister explain particularly to the good folk in Cairns why he has decreased direct funding? Where is the additional money for developing new markets, cultural tourism, ecotourism, outback tourism and grey nomad tourism? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077302"></A>
Successive Labor governments are already responsible for the dramatic decline in Japanese tourists over a 12-year period, and they seem to be ignoring our biggest sector--the New Zealand market--by allocating minimal funding to promote Queensland to this market. The New Zealand Minister of Tourism is the Prime Minister, John Key. He has a country with about four million people which is about the same size as Queensland. He has about two million tourists; we have a few more, with a bit over two million tourists. New Zealand is allocating $100 million. He has given another $30 million this year for the promotion of tourism. What have we done to our chief promotional body? We have cut it by $8 million. That is why New Zealand is going ahead with its tourism in difficult times and Queensland is going backwards.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077304"></A>
While I acknowledge the direct and indirect benefits of the Best Job in the World campaign, I would like to know from the minister how this directly equates to more tourists for Queensland, as the tourism figures are still falling. This shows that we have not actually got a direct result out of that campaign. New markets for tourism have to be explored, and I believe this government is not doing enough for the tourism industry in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077305"></A>
In this budget, the Bligh Labor government has given no consideration to the racing crisis that has exploded out of the recent passing of the ill-conceived Racing and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. The government talked about $80 million before, yet there is no commitment from the government as to where this $80 million is going. It is supposed to be going to the Gold Coast Turf Club, yet quite clearly the Gold Coast Turf Club is not going to sign away its ownership to Racing Queensland. Quite clearly, in terms of racing, the government is not committing this money where it was supposed to go. I cannot believe the Treasurer, who has responsibility for taxpayers’ money, allows this $80 million to go to a body that has no certainty on where it is going to spend it over four years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077309"></A>
In fair trading, the responsibility for the monitoring of insulation company practices has come unstuck, with the minister failing in his duty to properly monitor the industry. It resulted in the death of four workers, three of whom were in Queensland. The prosecution of the Beenleigh company in relation to this death was far too late, and the lack of monitoring of the industry proves the minister has failed to manage the fair trading industry. The raiding of the Gambling Community Benefit Fund of $9.9 million over three years to finance the do it bright solar program will leave less money available for grants for community groups. Minister Lawlor is obviously not interested in fighting for all those community groups who desperately rely on those grants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077311"></A>
In relation to the Gold Coast, the announced funding of $56 million for the M1 is a rehash of funding that has been announced before. Quite clearly, $56 million is a drop in the ocean in terms of fixing up the M1 highway right through to Tugun. It needs major funding which this government has not included in this budget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077313"></A>
In conclusion, I would like to reinforce to my constituency the Bligh Labor government’s lack of budget management capacity. If the government continues on its course, Queensland is unlikely to reach its full potential in the coming years. There is only one answer to change this course for the state, and I urge all Queenslanders to change this government at the next state election as it is only with a Liberal National Party government that Queensland will financially develop into the thriving state it deserves to be. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms O’NEILL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kallangur--ALP) (5.16 pm): I am proud to speak in support of this budget which delivers millions of dollars worth of infrastructure upgrades to the electorate of Kallangur. This budget addresses traffic congestion, improves access to public transport and protects and assists the most vulnerable in our community with a commitment to more housing, community services and child care. This year’s budget delivers on Labor’s promise to create jobs and deliver infrastructure to cater for Queensland’s growing population.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077316"></A>
Kallangur is one of the fastest-growing areas in the south-east, and I welcome the massive improvements to local rail, school and road infrastructure. As the member for Morayfield and I have been lobbying hard for improvements to Narangba station, I am delighted that the Narangba train station will receive a $20 million accessibility upgrade, and as constituents often ask for better facilities at Petrie station, I am also delighted that Petrie station will receive a two-phased upgrade to parking facilities valued at almost $1.5 million. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077317"></A>
Some $2.4 million will be spent on refurbishments at Kallangur State School, Narangba State School and Petrie State School, with more funding also committed to continue construction of the new high school at Murrumba Downs. For transport and roads, there are improvements to traffic flow, with the widening to four lanes of a section of Old Gympie Road between Anzac Avenue and Ann Street, Kallangur, with a total state government contribution of $455,000. There is improved road safety, with $15,000 towards pedestrian refuge facilities on Lawnton Pocket Road at Lawnton Special School, with a total state government contribution of $15,000, and there is $1.47 million for the installation of a guardrail on a section of the Brisbane-Woodford Road. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077318"></A>
I am happy to see that local front-line community services will also receive a funding boost, with more than $1.3 million provided for Home and Community Care programs and a further $2 million going directly to counselling and residential care services. Early education initiatives will also receive funding, with over $316,000 committed locally for extra kindergarten and child-care services. There is money for community infrastructure to provide access to counselling, life skills workshops and appropriate program participation, support groups, parenting education and community information--all providing much needed assistance for our community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077319"></A>
We have improved book stocks for our libraries, more housing, increased disability services, respite care and continued funding to Meals on Wheels Pine Rivers and Near North Housing Service to continue their invaluable work in the district. There are improvements to community safety, with money allocated to the Queensland Police Service to complete the refurbishment of the Pine Rivers district office. There is much needed support to provide counselling services for families, children and young people referred by Child Safety Services in the Department of Communities to provide therapeutic assistance to work through goals that will prevent further statutory intervention. There is welcome funding to provide a residential care service for young men and women. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085159"></A>
Some highlights in education and innovation include $30.24 million to provide assistance to low-skilled workers and those disadvantaged in the labour market, and to support the Queensland Green Army strategy. A sum of $1,900 is allocated as a part payment of a $5,000 contribution to encourage an Indigenous student to complete years 10, 11 and 12 and provide support and financial assistance for education related expenses. I am happy to see $30,849 going towards providing a limited hours child-care service at the Narangba Station Kindy, with a total state government contribution of $92,547. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. CA WALLACE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Thuringowa--ALP) (Minister for Main Roads) (5.19 pm): When I was a kid growing up in Home Hill, my old granddad, who lived through the Depression, said to me, ‘The best thing any government can do is give a person a good job.’ That is what this budget does. It delivers on our promise to create more jobs sooner. It delivers on our promise to build a better, brighter future for Queenslanders. It is a solid budget for young and old, and Thuringowa is a big winner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085216"></A>
The budget allocates more than $2 million in education in Thuringowa. Two new kindergartens--one at Kelso State School and another at Weir State School--will give our young ones a flying start. Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been allocated to spruce up our schools. It provides training and support to give young people a leg up, to give them the skills they need to get on with life. We are reaching out to young families in Thuringowa with $4,000 extra for the first home buyers grant. There is our share in a $39 million funding pool for a persistent pain centre pilot program in Townsville. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085219"></A>
These are the actions of a compassionate government, a Labor government; they are not the cuts proposed by those opposite. In this budget Townsville is the construction capital of North Queensland: $48 million for the Douglas Arterial Road; $340,000 to build additional lanes on Kern Brothers Drive, which all up is a $3 million project; and $250,000 for traffic signals and a new intelligent transportation system on Ross River Road. This year will see the start of a new world-class tennis centre and clubhouse, including 10 international standard courts, lighting and centre court, all courtesy of this Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085222"></A>
A sum of $2.5 million will go towards the staging of the Townsville V8 Supercars that will attract people from all over the country. I say, come to Townsville. The member for Springwood is coming to watch that magnificent event. I invite all members to come along.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I extend the member for Whitsunday a personal invitation to a great event funded by this Labor government. There is more: $13 million towards the Flinders Street Mall upgrade, working in concert with the Townsville City Council and the Rudd Labor government; and more than $57 million to help build a first-class marine precinct at the Port of Townsville, with those much needed boat ramps. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085226"></A>
This budget will pave the way for Townsville to take its rightful place as the state’s second capital. It is a budget that will build a stronger economy. It is a budget that will deliver jobs at a time when jobs and job security are more important than ever before. It is a budget that lays a strong foundation for Townsville’s future. We have a lot going for us in the north: a defence base, a first-class university, a TAFE complex, a strong government presence, international marine research facilities and our port precinct. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085227"></A>
With this budget we will get even more projects underway. It is a golden opportunity for us to build on our strengths and map out a path that will lead to a better, brighter future. Thuringowa came out a real winner in this budget. To see this, one only has to look at the per capita spend: $3,500 for every person in the south-east corner and $4,000 for every person in North Queensland. We are the big winners thanks to the Treasurer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085228"></A>
How did the Bligh Labor government deliver these budget achievements? We had a plan and we stuck with it. We made the tough choices--the right choices--so that we could deliver the jobs and infrastructure needed to take Townsville, Thuringowa and Queensland into the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085229"></A>
Our roads budget is $3.3 billion, which is more than three times bigger than the tories’ last budget. It is a budget to build better roads right across our great state. It is a budget for growth. It is a budget that will deliver jobs for Queenslanders. It will deliver around 30,000 jobs for workers in road construction this year.

Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (5.24 pm): This is a good budget for tough times. It is a good Labor budget and, most importantly, it is a good budget for the people of Rockhampton. The $10 million down payment on the next industrial park will grow jobs in manufacturing and service industries for the mining and liquefied gas industry. This $10 million will provide funds for planning and some early works on what will be a $50 million overpass that will open up land for industrial development. This is about the future of Rockhampton. It is about jobs and industries for our kids and their kids. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085290"></A>
On top of that, there is $100,000 to plan phase 2 of the riverbank development. The riverbank renewal project has transformed the area from an overgrown, unsightly eyesore into a highly functional leisure area for everyone from kids to the elderly. It has a high usage, especially the playgrounds as families take advantage of the barbecue facilities and the state-of-the-art playground equipment. This project links our almost unique heritage sector with our dining and accommodation sector, which then links up with the playground and onto the redeveloped showgrounds and some of the best sporting facilities in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085291"></A>
We have already funded the best set of tennis facilities of any regional centre in Australia at Victoria Park. We have put over $1 million into a world-class basketball stadium and now, in this budget, we add $5 million for an Olympic standard swimming pool, which will complement the sporting and exercise precinct. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085293"></A>
Just up the hill from this development, where over $300 million has been or is being spent, last week the Premier, Deputy Premier, Treasurer and I turned the first sod on the new $148 million hospital redevelopment. I give my thanks to Kirsten Livermore for her advocacy for the extra funding from her federal Labor colleagues, something the Howard government would never do. This budget provides funding for the ongoing running of cancer treatment at the hospital. Most people understand that the cheapest part of a hospital is the building, and this is a good example, as the ongoing running of cancer treatment will be around $10 million per year. It is not just the capital costs; the state government is getting behind the people of Rockhampton in recurrent expenditure. The bottom line is that over $130 million is needed to run the hospital--and over $330 million for the whole district--on a yearly basis. That figure was $68 million in 2004-05, and $184 million for the district. Since 2005 we have employed an extra 59 doctors, 123 nurses and 34 allied health workers. Today there are 780 doctors, nurses and allied health staff employed at the hospital and with every new service, such as the recent addition to the $6 million MRI machine provided by this government, which clocked up its 1,000th treatment recently, there has to be more staff.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085295"></A>
I also want to thank all the staff at the hospital, especially those in the payroll section, who have worked beyond the call of duty to try to sort out the payroll debacle. None of this is their fault and we are currently having an independent investigation as to how this occurred. The fact is that both the Minister for Health and I were advised that this new payroll system was right to go. Those were highly paid experts who advised us. Neither the health minister nor I are experts in the IT field or, indeed, the highly complicated health payroll field, where there are around 140,000 pay changes per fortnight, so we relied on their advice. We accepted their assurances in good faith and we are now awaiting the results of the Auditor-General’s independent inquiry to see what action needs to be taken. In the meantime, we are trying to ensure these problems are worked out. So, again, I say thank you to the hardworking staff at Rocky Hospital who are trying to pay people and to all who are affected by the payroll problems for doing what you do.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1085298"></A>
Mr Speaker, </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085299"></A>
This budget delivers us our fair share of the huge expenditure on health, education and other services. Almost $10 billion in health spending and $9.5 billion on education funding is huge when you consider that when I became a Minister those figures were around $1 billion. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085300"></A>
Since I entered this Parliament my view on how and where public money should be spent has never changed. Almost all of my first 35 years of life were spent under National Party governments which believed that being in government was about allocating public funds to voters in friendly electorates. Joh said so in relation to Rocky and he made sure that the very minimum of funding went to Labor electorates like Rockhampton.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085301"></A>
I have always strived for, and I believe I have achieved, our fair share except for the three years when Lawrence Springborg and Mike Horan were ministers in the Borbidge Government and took away $9 million from our hospital funding and put it in Toowoomba.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085302"></A>
The inconvenient truth for a lot of people who live in the regions is that the State coffers are not being filled from agriculture or mining. They are filled by GST, property taxes, car registration, income tax, fuel taxes and payroll tax, which far outweigh mineral royalties, which account for just 7.9% of the budget.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085303"></A>
For all the rhetoric the fact is that the 1.4 million people who live in south-east Queensland pay over 80% of the State’s revenue and account for the major slab of GST and income tax. So I would caution anyone against suggesting that we demand that revenue be spent where it is raised, otherwise we would have to close most of our services for half the year. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085304"></A>
It is government’s responsibility to share taxes around equitably. Although there are always projects and services that we want, and I will always fight for the best deal I can get, I remain confident in my ability to deliver and similarly confident in this Government’s ability to provide an equitable share of the State’s revenue to those who elect me.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085305"></A>
Mr Speaker, </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085306"></A>
One of the most contentious issues I have ever confronted is the privatisation issue. My record as running the only Government printing, building, car fleet, office supplies business in Australia for the past 12 years is testament to my belief in government owned businesses. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085307"></A>
However, the fact is every Labor Government for the past 80 years has had to decide what businesses to stay in, or get out of or buy into. Witness, for example, Federal Labor’s decision to buy into broadband services to Australia while the Hawke Government moved out of banking and aircraft. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085308"></A>
The Goss Government got out of the meatworks, the Beattie Government the TAB and airports, so the fact is Labor Governments right back to the ‘20s have privatised but they have always bought into further assets.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085309"></A>
Take for example the decision this Government took to exit the forestry industry, for which we were criticised by those opposite and, we are told, by the majority of Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085310"></A>
First I will deal with the majority of voters issue. It strikes me as more than a bit ironic that those who oppose daylight saving, which is the overwhelming majority in Rockhampton, do not want this Government to hold a referendum on the issue because they know that the majority of Queenslanders, that is those who live in the SE corner, would vote yes. In other words they want Government to make a decision despite its unpopularity with the majority in the interest of the whole state. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085311"></A>
So it is a fact that Governments are expected to make decisions that are not supported by the majority in the interest of the State.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085312"></A>
The decision to privatise forestry, a business which has no public service aspect at all, brought in $600 million. Last year that business earned the taxpayer just $3 million. If we put the $600 million in a 4% bank interest account it would earn us $24 million. If any individual owned this business they would do the same.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085313"></A>
QR Coal was established back in the late 1960s to entice foreign investment into the coal industry in Queensland, remembering of course that the State owned coal mines at places like Ogmore were privatised or sold out by the National Party. The State was keen to get foreign capital to exploit this resource.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085314"></A>
The fact is that the Queensland Government of the day did as other governments did. It forced the coal companies to borrow their own money to build rail lines and rolling stock then it is arguable that the industry would not have developed the way it has. So I am not critical of that decision but the fact is the industry has come a long way since then and it no longer needs to be borrowing on the state account and crowding out borrowings for other government priorities such as education, housing, hospitals and so on. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085315"></A>
It is a fact that no one elector has ever come to me suggesting we borrow for coal trains but I am constantly being asked to find more money for schools, cancer treatment, better roads, disability services and so on. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085316"></A>
Most people think of course that QR coal is a cash cow for the State Government but the fact is it returns about $200 million--and because we have this debt on the taxpayers’ books it is driving up the debt and ensuring the money we borrow is at a higher interest rate than other states have to borrow. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085317"></A>
The fact is this debt was sustainable before the global meltdown which robbed us of our main income from property taxes, GST and payroll tax. It’s quite simple: when your wages are down you have to curb your debts. We have doubled our spend on health since 2005 but we have not doubled the state’s income from taxes. If we did that there would be an outcry. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085318"></A>
I understand why rail workers are worried--no-one likes change but the fact is carting coal, maintaining coal wagons, looking after coal rail lines is a growth business and those who work in the coal industry tend to be paid a lot more than those caught under the umbrella of public service wage increases. Also we as taxpayers have invested in the very best of practices and services and equipment. Our rail workers are among the most highly competent rail coal workers in the world, so I have every confidence they have a strong, secure future. Moreover I am confident that they as shareholders in this company will get ownership of their future. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085319"></A>
I understand the anger of some, I understand their concern but the fact is we as a state, we as taxpayers, have to decide what is going to be provided for the future generation. Should we invest in coal trains or classrooms, pay teachers equivalent to the states that have no coal lines or trains on their debt sheet, fund health services instead of paying high interest to the money lenders? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085320"></A>
Or should we borrow money for long-term infrastructure like the $50 million industrial park and keep building workers with jobs and feed their families or borrow money for our hospital to again keep building workers employed while providing much-needed health services for the community? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1085321"></A>
Finally, the budget also delivers us our fair share of other services and social infrastructure. Funding includes: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1085322"></A>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

As I said, it is a good Labor budget which is financially responsible, delivers on social obligations and infrastructure needs. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

It is a budget which gives a fair share to my electorate and provides a platform to build the social and economic future for our city. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr MALONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mirani--LNP) (5.27 pm): I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill 2010. I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition for his address in reply to the budget, which he delivered today. It was one of the better speeches I have heard over a period of years. I would like to reiterate some of the issues that he brought before the House today.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090913"></A>
<Hansard-Bold>
Government members</Hansard-Bold>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090914"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MALONE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is interesting to hear the members opposite thanking me on behalf of the opposition leader for his great speech. That is good to hear.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090915"></A>
One of the first priorities the opposition leader raised was regaining our AAA rating. As businessmen will know, the interest rates they pay are very important when it comes to the business going ahead. The situation in Queensland now is that we have to pay an extra $1.2 billion in interest just to get back to where we started. Obviously, one of our first priorities is to regain our AAA rating. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090916"></A>
We in the opposition have also committed to halt privatisation. The people in my electorate and surrounds are very pleased about that. The railway workers, the train drivers and all those in QR are concerned about their jobs. More importantly, they are concerned about their families who work at Jilalan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090918"></A>
At the last election the Labor candidate for Mirani said that the government would not sell off Jilalan. There was a lot of advertising right across the electorate and Central Queensland saying, ‘Labor will not sell Jilalan.’ Two days after the election Jilalan was up for sale along with QR. I wonder what would have happened if the Labor candidate actually made it into this House. He certainly would have had to stand down due to nervous anticipation. All of those who work in QR are desperately concerned about the direction being taken. If the contracts are not signed at the time of a change of government we are not going to sell it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090920"></A>
As any good businessman would know, one needs to set up a debt repayment strategy. Quite frankly, this government is still spending more than it is earning and government is nothing more than big business. Somehow or other we have to put in place a situation where we start paying down the debt. Queenslanders are going to saddled with this debt for many years ahead. We have to get into the situation where we can start paying it off. The first way to do that is get back our AAA credit rating. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090921"></A>
The big elephant in the room is the super tax. I look across the House tonight and see the members of the electorates that will be affected by the super tax. It is not just the mining companies that will be affected. We have to get that through our heads. People working in the mining industry who are earning very substantial salaries are paying over a thousand dollars a week in tax. This comes back to both the state and federal governments. The businesspeople from whom they buy their cars, their tyres, their homes on the coast et cetera benefit. It goes round and around. Every time there is spending both the state and federal governments pick up something. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090922"></A>
Any reduction in the mining industry activity and any projects that drop off have a huge multiplier effect on the economy of Queensland and of Australia. The first thing we have to do is get some common sense back into this debate about the super tax and make sure it does not go ahead. We need those mining industries. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090925"></A>
I will give members a bit of history. I can recollect when the first mines started inland from Mackay--that is, when Utah moved in there. They built the town of Moranbah. They built the railway line. They bought the wagons and locomotives. They built the port as well. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090929"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MALONE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In actual fact they handed it back to the state government. Under Joh Bjelke-Petersen the miners actually built all of that and handed it back to the government and now those opposite are selling it. That is not a bad trick, is it.</Hansard-Body>

Honourable members please. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090938"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MALONE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I reinforce what the Leader of the Opposition said in his contribution to this debate in this parliament earlier today about the real cost that ordinary Queenslanders are bearing under this government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090939"></A>
I continually have people approach me in the street as I move around the electorate saying that they are really concerned about where we are going. There have been increases in electricity charges. I can recollect when former Premier Beattie said that nobody would be worse off under the sale of the retail assets off Ergon and Energex. Two or three years later we have had a 50 per cent increase in power costs. We have single mums, people on fixed pensions and superannuants et cetera who are finding it really difficult to fund their living costs. Indeed, I am hearing that people who are earning up to $60,000 are finding it very difficult to live from day to day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090942"></A>
We have had increases in electricity charges and increases in the costs of running a car. A lot of people in my electorate have to have at least two cars because of the distances they travel and the needs of their children. The breadwinner may be working away from their property or town. The costs go on. On top of all of that, with the amalgamation of shires we are seeing critical infrastructure like sewage and water having to be put into smaller towns. The subsidies that were available under the SCAP schemes and a few other schemes for smaller communities are now not being funded by the state government. The amalgamated shires have to pick up that cost. That cost is passed on to the ratepayers. The rates are going up. The general charges for councils are going up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090945"></A>
Right across-the-board there has been a huge escalation in the cost of living. Somehow or other we have to get on top of that and give some encouragement to the people out there who are battling the economic woes of the situation we are facing currently. It is interesting to note that in this budget this government has given something like 50c a week back and it is crowing about it. That is unbelievable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090946"></A>
We have to help small business because it is the cornerstone of our communities. Unless we have got those small businesses operating, employing people and putting bread on the table for a lot of families we are going to go out the back door. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090947"></A>
I will quickly touch on the issues relating to my shadow portfolio. As I move around the state I have to say that I am overwhelmed by the competence and professionalism of the emergency services personnel throughout Queensland. It is really heartening to see the excellent work they do right throughout the community. They work under some very difficult conditions from time to time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090948"></A>
In terms of the QAS, I am continually being told that resources are being held up by ramping up in emergency departments at our public hospitals. Even though I have asked many questions in this House of the health minister and the emergency services minister there does not seem to be any recognition of the pressure this is putting on paramedics right throughout Queensland. While they are ramped up at a hospital there are still calls coming in. They are put under pressure. That is something we do not need to happen. They have enough pressure as it is. There has to be a resolution of that situation. There has to be common sense in this regard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090950"></A>
It is not a big percentage but there are still cases where ambulances get lost and the systems are failing. That is difficult for patients. We have seen a couple of tragic situations under those circumstances. It is also a tragic and very difficult situation for the paramedics and the people at the call centres. Even though the minister criticises me for raising the issue, I have the best interests of the people at heart and I am trying to have a situation where those things do not happen and pressure is not put on the paramedics and the communication centre operators who are handling the calls. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090951"></A>
As I move around I am amazed by the volunteers we have in emergency services--the people in VMR, the surf life savers, the SES volunteers and the rural fire brigade volunteers. We will probably find that this year is one of the worst seasons we have had in some time when it comes to wildfires in our grass country throughout Queensland. We have had a really good wet season pretty much right across Queensland. There is a huge amount of grass out there. The rural firefighters who cover well over 90 per cent of Queensland are going to be at the forefront again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090988"></A>
These people need our support. There needs to be common sense put back into the management of rural fires. Proposals to take away the local issuing of fire permits et cetera is a step in the wrong direction. As I said, we need to give control back to rural fire brigades in local areas. Quite frankly, I could talk a fair bit about that issue.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090992"></A>
Another issue which I have raised in the parliament which is concerning many rural communities is the increasing charges for ambulance services at events. Many of those events are run by volunteers such as campdrafting events and rodeos et cetera and the cost of supplying an ambulance and paramedic to be on site is pushing the limits. In many cases many of the events are being run at a loss simply because of the cost of that ambulance. Obviously the ambulance officers have to be paid and there is a certain cost in terms of the supply of the vehicle. However, there seems to be quite a difference between what is being charged and the reasonable costs of a paramedic and the supply of a vehicle.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090994"></A>
In terms of local issues, $1 million has been allocated to the South Mackay ambulance centre. That centre was built in 2006 and at the time I was concerned that it was basically a Titan shed with three relocatable buildings on the site. Some $2 million was spent on it in 2006 and now we are spending another $1 million. I am really concerned about the cost of infrastructure in some of these departments. There has to be some concern raised by not only the Minister for Emergency Services but others on the other side of the House in terms of the delivery of infrastructure. I can think of many other instances where the delivered infrastructure was delivered at a very high cost to the community and maybe it is along the same lines as some of the buildings being built by the federal government in our education system. The South Mackay ambulance centre should have been planned better than it was. If we need to spend another $1 million only four years after it was built, one would have to go back to the drawing board and find out why it was not fully catered for in the original plans. Maybe there is a need to look at an ambulance centre on the other side of Walkerston. That would work in well with the Pioneer Valley and also the Peak Downs Highway, which of course is a very busy highway.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090998"></A>
In terms of the Mackay area, the allocation of $5 million towards the showgrounds is well past time and it is pleasing to see that at last there is some direction in that regard. That has been a terrible situation where the volunteers who make up the showgrounds committee have basically been hung out to dry over a number of years. They did not know where they were going in terms of the showgrounds. Some $5 million is a small amount, but it certainly will help in terms of future planning. With those few words, I support the bills. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr EMERSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Indooroopilly--LNP) (5.43 pm): If you live in the electorate of Indooroopilly and are looking for some relief from Labor’s mismanagement in this budget, forget it! Labor and the Bligh government have let you down once again. If you are hoping for an end to the Labor-driven increases in the cost of living, I am sorry but, again, there is nothing in the Bligh government budget. You are going to be paying more for car rego; for train, bus and ferry fares; for road tolls; for electricity; and for water. If you are stuck in a traffic jam every day crossing the Walter Taylor Bridge or on the Western Freeway and you are hoping for some solution to this shocking congestion, too bad! Again, Labor has no solutions in this budget. If you catch a train every day--apart from increasing your fares--Labor has forgotten you as well. Not one train station in the Indooroopilly electorate is mentioned in the budget papers for an upgrade. There are no new or additional park-and-ride spaces at these stations in Indooroopilly because, remember, Labor has banned them! If you are hoping Labor was going to manage population growth to ensure that local state schools have enough places for local children, there is no guarantee in this budget. In fact, suburb by suburb Labor has forgotten you.</Hansard-Body>

One only has to look on Labor’s own building Queensland interactive site showing what the budget is doing for your local community in the Indooroopilly electorate. Once you take away the Commonwealth funded projects and those linked to the University of Queensland, the list is very bare. Taringa--zero. Labor has forgotten you in Taringa. St Lucia--Labor has forgotten you. Fig Tree Pocket--Labor has forgotten you. Chelmer--Labor has forgotten you. Tennyson--Labor has forgotten you. In Graceville there is some good news--some money is going to a landfill project--and Indooroopilly and Sherwood get some funds for two local schools, but that is it. The only thing that Labor has not forgotten to do is hit you with increased costs. Labor’s mismanagement has seen it constantly increasing taxes and charges to pay for its mismanagement and waste.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091005"></A>
Repeatedly we have seen it deny it had any intention of increasing taxes and charges and then go ahead and do so. Queenslanders will pay more every time they fill up their cars, turn on the taps, flick on the lights. They are paying more thanks to the Bligh government and Labor. Householders have to find an extra $1,200 a year because of rising utility costs, rates, food expenses, registration, road tolls and public transport fees. Is it any wonder that a recent poll found that 65 per cent of Queenslanders think the Bligh government is at risk of making it too expensive to live in Queensland--too expensive to live in this state?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091007"></A>
Let us have a look at some of those extra costs, the deceitful rhetoric from the Bligh government and the reality of the Labor-driven increases in the costs of living. Queensland now is the most expensive state in Australia to own and run a car. Queenslanders are paying an average $220 a year increase just in registration and fuel costs. On 15 January 2009 ahead of the state election Treasurer Andrew Fraser said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1091009"></A>
Make no mistake about it. We’ll be delivering a fuel subsidy scheme. It will stay in place.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1091010"></A>
I say that again--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1091011"></A>
It will stay in place.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1091012"></A>
After the state election he scrapped the fuel subsidy in the 2009-10 budget, costing Queensland motorists an extra 9.1c a litre for fuel.</Hansard-Body-Continued>

Mr EMERSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 We do not make promises we do not keep. This Labor government has in its DNA three things--debt, deficit and deceit. Let me say it again: debt, deficit and deceit. That is in Labor’s DNA. Deceit is exactly the word--deceit on the fuel tax. Let me say it again, because some members of the Labor Party did not hear it: it will stay in place, the Treasurer said, and what did he do? He won the election and came back--</Hansard-Body>

Mr EMERSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the member for Keppel’s interjection. The member for Keppel of course has real troubles with the asset sales. Do we know exactly where he stands on that? He says he does not support it and then he does and then he does not. It is just like the Treasurer when he says that the fuel subsidy will stay in place and then it does not. That is what we see over and over again from Labor. We cannot follow what it says. As I said, suddenly the fuel subsidy was gone and there was a fuel tax in place and fuel price monitor MotorMouth found that Brisbane had the highest average price for unleaded fuel of mainland capitals in February 2010.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091020"></A>
From 1 July 2010 tolls for the Gateway Motorway will increase by more than 30 per cent. The toll for a private car or small truck will rise from $2.95 to $3.85 from 1 July--a spike of almost $1. The Bligh government has also developed detailed proposals to charge distance tolls to use major south-east roads, including charging motorists 12c a kilometre. The government has ruled it out, but can it be believed? It ruled out scrapping the fuel subsidy, yet suddenly after the election it scrapped the subsidy and put the tax in. Can Labor be believed? Deceit is in its DNA. The new driver’s licence was supposed to be cost neutral. Instead, a five-year licence will jump from the current $73.30 to $96.05 next year and $152.50 by 2014-15--the equal highest cost in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095791"></A>
Registration fees will increase from 1 July as well. The RACQ says that, once compulsory third party insurance is removed, the true increase in the government’s take was between 17 per cent and 22 per cent. Car owners will be paying more than $45 to $113 more for registration from 1 July and from that date it will cost $627 to register a large car in Queensland compared to $178 in Victoria and $246 in Tasmania. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095792"></A>
For those not driving--those taking public transport, and I would encourage people to take public transport--go card fares have already risen about 20 per cent from 1 January, with paper tickets climbing by around 40 per cent, and fares will continue to jump by 15 per cent annually from 2011 to 2014. So if you think you have already paid more for your fares, wake up and get ready for it. They will increase by 15 per cent every year until 2014. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095793"></A>
When Labor announced in 2005 that it would deregulate the electricity retail market, then Premier Peter Beattie said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1095795"></A>
We can guarantee that no-one will pay any more. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1095796"></A>
At the same time his then deputy, Anna Bligh, said--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1095798"></A>
Nobody--not one Queenslander--will be worse off under the government’s proposal. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095799"></A>
Since then, electricity has risen more than 50 per cent--an 11.3 per cent increase in 2007-08, a 9.06 per cent increase in 2008-09, an 11.82 per cent increase in 2009-10 and now a 13.29 per cent increase in 2010-11. The latest price rises include--can you believe this?--the increased costs of telemarketing. Average household electricity bills are about to soar to $240 a year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095800"></A>
South-East Queensland will pay among the highest water charges in the world. The Bligh government increases will see the price of water jump by at least $1.30 per week for people living in Brisbane, and there will be further increases every year for the next 10 years. The rise in the cost of water in Brisbane equates to an estimated additional $68 per household in the first year, $65 in the second year, $62 in the third year, $58 in the fourth year and $56 in the fifth year. Prices keep going up for water, for electricity, for driving a car and for taking public transport.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095801"></A>
I turn to the cost of water because, remember, this is what Anna Bligh said in 2007--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1095803"></A>
The cost of the infrastructure of water will mean we’ll all pay a little bit more for water. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095804"></A>
Deceit is in Labor’s DNA. Given all of these Labor driven rises in the cost of living, what did the Bligh government do in this budget? It gave back to the average Queenslander just 45c a week--$24 a year to cut compulsory third party insurance. That 45c a week is to make up for householders having to find an extra $1,200 a year because of the rise in utility costs, rates, other expenses, registration, road tolls and public transport fees. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095805"></A>
But there is some hope for Queenslanders. The LNP believes that it is time to give motorists a break. Today the LNP announced that vehicle registration fees will be frozen for its entire first term under an LNP plan to ease the cost of living pressures on Queenslanders. Under the Bligh government and Labor, following the introduction of the fuel tax, increased registration fees and higher tolls, Queensland has become the most expensive state in which to own and run a car. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095806"></A>
The LNP has also announced that electricity rebates for seniors will be increased by 30 per cent, taking the electricity rebate from $190 per year to $247 per year--double the increase flagged by the Bligh Labor government. The LNP is working to help Queenslanders fight the increased cost of living--those increased costs driven by Labor. All Labor does is make it harder and harder for people to manage the cost of living. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095807"></A>
It is just not householders who are doing it tough under Labor and who are paying more. Business is the main driver of employment opportunities and new jobs. The government must encourage an economic climate that prompts the private sector to invest in future growth. Queensland was once a low-tax haven for companies. Now, taxation as a percentage of gross state product is 3.64 per cent compared to 3.24 per cent in Western Australia and 4.44 per cent in New South Wales. And let us not forget Labor’s 40 per cent, $9 billion super profits mining tax. The Bligh government’s budget does not even take into account the potential implications of the federal government’s proposed resource super profits tax. Labor’s super tax on mining will cost jobs and stymie Queensland’s economic recovery. We have already seen Xstrata blame the super tax for freezing $586 million in investment, which would have developed the $6 billion Wandoan thermal coal project on the Darling Downs, and a $600 million project to extend the life of the Ernest Henry copper mine near Cloncurry, putting 3,250 new jobs at risk and immediately cutting the jobs of 60 contractors. Premier Bligh needs to put the job security of Queenslanders ahead of her loyalties to Kevin Rudd. She knows that this proposed tax is causing pain to Queenslanders, but she will not stand up to federal Labor. She will not put Queensland first.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095810"></A>
Xstrata’s decision came after economic data showed that Queensland was the slowest growing state. The shelving of these projects will not just have an impact on regional jobs; many consultancies and design jobs will now be lost due to Labor’s job-destroying mining tax. Total mining royalties contribute $1.8 billion to the state’s finances, and economic activity by mining companies provides 20 per cent of Queensland’s gross state product--20 per cent, one in five. According to the Queensland Resources Council, the proposed resource super profits tax will short-change Queensland by up to $2.5 billion in only the first two years. I urge this state government to stand up to Kevin Rudd and fight for Queensland instead of just kowtowing to federal Labor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095812"></A>
Let us not forget the waste under the Bligh government and Labor. On water, billions of dollars have been squandered on poorly planned and rushed infrastructure. Ratepayers are now being forced to pay for it all. What about the tens of millions of dollars that have been wasted on the Health payroll system, which serves Queensland Health’s 75,000 employees? The public works minister, Robert Schwarten, claims that the new system has not failed. In this parliament he said--words that will become infamous--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1095814"></A>
... there has been nothing brought to my attention to suggest that the system is a failure. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095815"></A>
Today the health minister, Paul Lucas, could not even say if the payroll woes could be fixed within the next year. He also could not say if workers’ group certificates will be right. Queenslanders can be forgiven for asking how Labor and the Bligh government could have got everything so wrong. How could Labor make a state that was so rich in resources become so strapped for cash? How did Labor end the prosperity that kept Queensland taxes and charges the lowest in the nation for decades? How did it make Queensland so broke that it was stripped of its AAA credit rating more than a year ago and that that AAA credit rating may not be restored for several years? It is all because of Labor’s mismanagement. Labor and the Bligh government squandered the state’s growth dividend in the boom years on unsustainably high levels of recurrent spending. </Hansard-Body>

CommSec’s April <Hansard-Italic>
State of the states</Hansard-Italic>
 report showed Queensland falling from fifth to seventh position in terms of economic performance, beating only New South Wales. Labor and the Bligh government have delivered four budget deficits in a row. Under Labor, Queensland will now be the only mainland state in deficit next year. That deficit will be $1.75 billion and that deficit comes despite a $12 billion surge in coal royalties over the next four years. On current projections, the state will not return to surplus before 2015-16 and will not recover its AAA credit rating before then.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095818"></A>
Let us not forget Treasurer Andrew Fraser’s dishonest claims that debt is down. Rather than paying off debt, over the past 12 months the government has added another $9 billion in debt to our bill. Debt will rise from $42.6 billion in 2008-09 to $51.6 billion in 2009-10 and is forecast to reach $83.5 billion by 2013-14 and the interest bill on that debt will top $22 billion. The interest alone will be $3.7 billion in 2010-11. So we are seeing $6.5 billion of budget deficits and $84 billion of debt. That is over $18,000 for every Queensland man, woman and child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095819"></A>
Public sector spending continues to grow to unsustainable levels. Just in wages, costs are forecast to rise by $4 billion, outpacing inflation with a 24 per cent rise over the next four years, to hit $19 billion in 2013-14. Controlling the growth in spending is a way to cut the debt and achieve a return of the AAA credit rating, not just relying on tax increases and the fire sale of state assets.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095855"></A>
Under an LNP government we would adopt a state debt repayment strategy separate from the budget so that Queenslanders, business and financial markets could see how the economic recovery was progressing. This is an essential tool for regaining the confidence of the financial markets and regaining the confidence of the credit rating agencies, a confidence that Labor lost. What a disgrace this Labor government has been.</Hansard-Body>

That money could be used for nurses, teachers, hospitals, schools and police. Labor has squandered the wealth of this state and lost our AAA credit rating. In conclusion, this has been a typical Bligh government budget: Labor debt, Labor deficit, Labor deceit. It makes Queenslanders pay for Labor’s mistakes. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr FOLEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maryborough--Ind) (6.00 pm): I rise to participate in the cognate budget debate. Let me say from the outset that I am absolutely delighted about the amount of funding that Maryborough has received in this budget. I believe that we should give credit where credit is due. We can talk about the big picture of the state tonight, but I particularly want to focus on my electorate. Nobody likes deficit budgets. We always end up finding ourselves with too much month left at the end of the money. But deficit budgets are not all bad because if we worked on the adage that we should not go out and borrow anything we might not ever buy a house. We sometimes need to borrow to fund infrastructure. Of course, when that borrowing blows out to alarming levels that is when people get pretty uncomfortable. There is an old political adage ‘don’t expect social reform from a conservative government and don’t give a Labor government a chequebook’. Frankly, I see such a merging of styles of both Labor and the conservatives that I do not think it is easy to draw those straight lines and make those large, sweeping statements anymore. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095864"></A>
I have spent a few days now combing through the budget documents. A few people have assisted me in doing that. The direct expenditure for my electorate in this budget is $429,775,650. I am delighted to receive that expenditure for my electorate. In terms of shared funding, there is a further $138,509,000 which we will receive a part of. One comment I would make to the Treasurer is that it would be very helpful for members of parliament where there is shared funding for it to be made easier to identify what part of that was for their electorate. For instance, if something is put into No. 15 for Wide Bay-Burnett but it is not shown where that break-up is, it makes it very difficult to disseminate the figures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095865"></A>
In terms of education and innovation, one project in relation to which I had negotiated significantly with the minister was the new trade training centre adjoining Maryborough State High School. That was a $4.264 million project which was a blend of state and Commonwealth funding. I do not care where the dollars come from as long as they spend them in Maryborough! In relation to community infrastructure, in terms of social housing we have had a great spend of $6.9 million. A number of ministers have visited my electorate and I have made very clear to them the priorities and needs of our electorate. That has been forthcoming in terms of funding. There has been a $5.8 million spend on economic development, particularly reinforcing electricity supply throughout our region because Maryborough is quite a hub. Most people would not be aware that Ergon Energy is headquartered in Maryborough. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095866"></A>
In relation to transport and roads, there has been $67,378,000 spent on roads in my electorate. That has been a very necessary spend. Sections of the Maryborough-Hervey Bay Road are still very dangerous. In fact, we had a tragic fatality there on Monday. One of our Fraser Coast regional councillors was involved in that head-on accident. She has been flown to the Royal Brisbane Hospital. We wish Anne very well in her recovery. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095868"></A>
Moving to Community Safety, a spend of $600,000; for Q150, a spend of $999,000; for Health, an amount of $3,500,000. There is a big distribution warehouse being built on the campus of the Maryborough Hospital which will help our region. There are minor facilities grants for sport in the amount of $97,000. I am very fortunate to have in my electorate the best train-building facility in Australia bar none, and in relation to rail contracts there is a major spend of $342 million. I urge the state government to consider the workers in Maryborough. I think Maryborough is right at a tipping point at the moment and we really want to see that EDI rail contract come off. I know that the member for Hervey Bay joins me in that as well because many people in his electorate live in Hervey Bay but work at EDI Rail at Maryborough. There has also been a significant spend with DEEDI, water infrastructure and Communities. I will not bore everybody with how much and what has gone on there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095869"></A>
To make a few more general statements, I am reminded of the plight of the ordinary Queenslander. We have seen shameful price rises in electricity. It was not that many years ago that Peter Beattie stood in this House and said that we needed to privatise power because that was the only way we were going to drive the prices down. But, of course, what has happened is that it has driven the prices up. The cost of running a car in Queensland is absolutely scandalous compared to other states. There is also the Health payroll mess. My wife works for Queensland Health and every fortnight she gets paid the pay slip is wrong. The Deputy Premier should go to the hairdresser and get his hair dyed grey now because by the time this mess is sorted out I think there will be a few grey strands hanging down and that will save time in the transition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095870"></A>
I started this contribution by saying that we have done very well in our electorate. The people of Maryborough will be very pleased with this outcome. My only disappointment is that I would have liked to have seen some of that spend put into the Maryborough Hospital. We have been working very hard in recent times to secure dialysis services. The member for Hervey Bay is part of a focus task force that I am on and it looks as if we have perhaps got some renal dialysis chairs for Maryborough Hospital, but we really need a high-functioning accident and emergency department in both Maryborough and Hervey Bay.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095871"></A>
Because of Maryborough’s proximity to the highway, the last thing in the world Hervey Bay Hospital needs is for us to be filling its accident and emergency department and hospital wards with Maryborough people and travellers going up the highway who may get injured or sick. So we need that significant spend, particularly on an accident and emergency department in Maryborough. There are so many services needed like that. We have a big need for melanoma support in our region. Queensland has the unenviable reputation of being the skin cancer capital of Australia and, by heck, we do not have a cancer specialist. We need at least a weekly melanoma clinic for our area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095872"></A>
Significant work is being undertaken on beautifying the city of Maryborough. Anyone who has served with me in the last seven years in this parliament knows how much I love Maryborough and think it is one of the most beautiful places in Queensland. A couple of weeks ago the ABC commissioned a young lady called Leanne Wild who has a company that specialises in regionalisation in Queensland. She is really fantastic. She was given a challenge to find the ultimate place to move to in Queensland for a tree change if you wanted to leave the capital cities. Her parameters were that housing should be about $350,000 and there should be access at least to the ocean and beachside. I am very, very proud to say that she came straight out, after doing the research, and said that the place to move to is Maryborough. I echo that. With the state government spend in Maryborough, may it long continue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095873"></A>
As I say, there are probably a couple of holes in the budget. The hospital needs a lot more expenditure and the rail contracts need to be given to a reliable, proven Queensland company, not shot off overseas. The Premier cannot stand in this House and say we are about jobs, jobs, jobs and let contracts go overseas. With those reservations I commend the bills to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms van LITSENBURG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Redcliffe--ALP) (6.09 pm): I rise to support the appropriations bills 2010. The 2010 budget is a strong, solid Labor budget that delivers lower deficits, lower debt, stronger growth and, most importantly, delivers stronger jobs growth. It reinforces the Bligh government’s commitment to keeping Queenslanders working to ensure that we have strong, healthy families as the foundation of an engaged community that has the tools to make a strong contribution in the community and to meet their own goals for what they want to achieve. That is what I want to see for the people of Redcliffe.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100771"></A>
This budget continues to deliver the infrastructure that will mark Queensland as a state that has the public amenities expected in a robust economy that is leading the nation. The Bligh government’s $17 billion Capital Works Program is supporting more than 100,000 jobs. This budget is the springboard that will take Queensland into a positive future with the prosperity and surpluses Queenslanders expect from this Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100772"></A>
Five years after I first asked this Labor government for increased traffic capacity on the Houghton Highway, a new three-lane, 2.7-kilometre bridge was delivered and it will open next month--not only a bridge but a deluxe model, with a bikeway and a fabulous fishing platform that epitomises the Redcliffe lifestyle. The final costs are in this budget to complete the resealing of the Houghton Highway and the fishing platform into the northern fishing channel. This bridge is Redcliffe’s key transport link with Brisbane and it ensures that there will be fewer traffic snarls in the future. The whole of Redcliffe is excited and will party at the opening of the Ted Smout Bridge next month. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100773"></A>
The delivery of the Ted Smout Bridge is only the beginning of a good transport story for Redcliffe. The amount of $197 million has also been allocated to the continuing development of the Northern Busway, which is another important link that will deliver speedy public transport to the Redcliffe peninsula. This budget also sees the third link in this new public transport network for Redcliffe, beginning by delivering the first $300,000 for the upgrades to the Peninsula Fair bus interchange. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

These three elements are a great outcome for Redcliffe and prove that the Bligh government is serious about delivering more effective public transport for Redcliffians. Fast, efficient bus services are the most effective and responsive public transport solutions for Redcliffe in the future. They will help in delivering a better lifestyle for Redcliffians and will increase property values and boost our economy as the distance between Redcliffe and the city effectively decreases.

This Budget continues infrastructure programs including; further Gateway upgrades, the Eastern Busway, the railway to Springfield in the Brisbane metropolitan area but similar key infrastructure is being replicated right across the state so that the whole Queensland community and economy will continue to benefit from this nation building. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100794"></A>

Travel subsidies for patients who need access to specialist medical care will all continue.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100804"></A>
Our schools have also had funding from this budget to support their learning including; $8,600 to Kippa Ring State School for maintenance, $17,232 of $318,081 for renewal of the general learning area and $157,818 of $656,358 for renewal of the library at Clontarf Beach State High School, $171,195 of $716,195 to replace an amenities block at Humpy Bong State School, $381,751 of $424,108 for a general learning area renewal at Redcliffe Special School, $489,050 of $565,477 for renewal of a general learning area and $607,210 of $696,747 for the science laboratory renewal at Redcliffe High School and finally $467,368 of $848,216 for renewal of a general learning area at Scarborough State School. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100805"></A>
This budget has delivered a comprehensive suite of items across the state but I have mentioned only those that directly affect Redcliffe. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100806"></A>
Queensland has put in place the fundamentals that will not only produce a strong economy and world leading infrastructure but our budget will be in surplus earlier than forecast last year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100807"></A>
Six years of deficit is a small price to pay to keep Queensland out of recession, without developing the associated social issues that accompany recession and high unemployment including; increased alcoholism and drug use, depression, family violence and family breakdown.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100808"></A>
These things take generations to fix and are very much more costly in people’s lives, expertise and money than six years with a red spot on the balance sheet.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100809"></A>
I congratulate the Treasurer for his balanced and sensible budget that did not forget the average person on the street.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100810"></A>
At these times when many people are feeling the squeeze of the cost of living, this budget offers measured support that will encourage the general trend to developing and strengthening our economy, ensuring there is a better future for Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr WENDT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich West--ALP) (6.13 pm): Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Powell, and I congratulate you on your rise to that very important position up there. I rise tonight to provide my support for the third Bligh-Fraser budget and, in accordance with the previous speakers, I will keep my comments brief. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100814"></A>
As everyone in the world knows, the past few years have seen how difficult it has been for governments to budget after the effects of the global financial crisis. It is when we take this into consideration that I believe the Queensland Treasurer deserves special congratulations. I say this because, while most other economies around the world are suffering high unemployment, stagnant growth rates, falling business investment, declining capital works programs, as well as a multitude of other ailments, the Queensland economy continues to outperform most and lead from the front.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100815"></A>
I am pleased to advise that, although this budget is again predicting a deficit, it has been framed around a number of strategies to return the budget to surplus in as quick a time as possible. Last year in my budget reply speech I was keen to provide my support because it had all the fundamentals of a strong Labor budget, and this year I feel exactly the same. That is, we now see we have huge spending increases for health, with its record $1.6 billion building program for new hospitals and redevelopments, as well as increases to budgets including education, police, roads et cetera. In addition, growth was also expected to continue, business confidence is expected to increase and the ever important unemployment rates look to be well under control.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100816"></A>
Before I go on, I think I should comment on a few of the best things to come out of the budget which I believe have been largely overlooked. I refer, of course, to the fact that this government will be extending its support to first home builders and buyers across Queensland by announcing that they will receive an extra $4,000 bonus on top of the existing $7,000 grant if their move was to regional Queensland. From those I have spoken to, this is a significant announcement, and I am aware that it has been welcomed by a number of regional councils and communities as a way to attract the workers and families of tomorrow outside the south-east corner.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100817"></A>
In addition, the government was also able to provide modest increases to the electricity rebate for our older citizens, which amounted to $12.6 million, and at the same time reduce the compulsory third party rates by $24. Closer to home, there are a couple of announcements that I also wanted to touch on. These specifically relate to local projects which I consider will have significant positive effects for years to come in Ipswich West generally but specifically across the western corridor.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100818"></A>
The first of these is the key announcement of the bringing forward of the Springfield rail line project, which will see $646 million provided by the Queensland government to create a massive infrastructure boost that will create jobs, and at the same time help build a community for thousands of families flocking to the region. I feel it is only fair to thank the Premier and the Treasurer for their vision in this regard but also to acknowledge the work of the Minister for Transport in this announcement, who I know has a long-held passion to see population growth in the south-east corner serviced by first-class, 21st century transport systems. I seek leave for the remainder of my speech to be incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
. I have already sought support from the Speaker.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100819"></A>
Leave granted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100820"></A>
And I should say that for anyone in this House who is not aware of the work going on in the western corridor or the Springfield and Ripley areas I would encourage them to take a short drive and see what a master planned community of tomorrow looks like. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100821"></A>
And of course the recent announcement by the Premier that the UDLA will be taking over planning responsibility for the Ripley Valley has also helped cement this area as a huge asset for Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100822"></A>
The other initiative I wanted to raise today concerned the announcement of further funding of $14.6M for the western Ipswich bypass. This being one of many road infrastructure projects which will receive funding from the State Budget as part of the Bligh Government’s massive building program.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100823"></A>
However, this piece of road is specifically significant to Ipswich and the surrounding area because it fits one more piece of the puzzle into the committed Amberley Aerospace precinct. This precinct which is progressing well, will see an additional $7.6M spent from this years budget for the purchase and development of further land. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100824"></A>
I can report that the Development Application which is currently being assessed by the Ipswich City Council should be cleared soon and it is hoped that construction work will begin shortly. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100825"></A>
I don’t think that it is widely enough known that the jobs created by this precinct and the relationships it will develop with the adjacent air force base will create many new jobs for the area, and more importantly I can advise that they will be highly skilled jobs for the future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100826"></A>
I would now like to comment on the budget announcement of a new $3M fire station which will be constructed in my electorate at Brassall. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100827"></A>
This station will replace the existing old fire station located in the centre of Ipswich city, and will team up with a new station also located at the new Ripley Valley area. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100828"></A>
It was considered that after expert analysis the existing central city station could no longer cope effectively with the growth that Ipswich has experienced in recent years. As such it is proposed that the new Brassall station will be able to service the west of the city, with the newly announced Ripley Valley station to service the south of the city, and the existing Bundamba and Karana Downs stations continuing to service the east and northern parts of the city.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100829"></A>
I would now like to move on to another cost saving initiative for small business which although it was announced in last year’s budget, has been continued in the current budget. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100830"></A>
Specifically I refer to the announcement that the government will continue its support for those businesses which employ apprentices and trainees right across Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100831"></A>
What this means is that apprentices and trainee wages will continue to be excluded from an employer’s total wages bill when calculating their payroll tax debt. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100832"></A>
Further, to make this a really attractive solution for business to maintain their apprentice and trainee numbers, the Treasurer has again extended the offer of an additional 25% rebate of the total apprentice and trainee wages bill, which will also be deducted from the employer’s total wages figure. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100833"></A>
Mr Deputy Speaker, when you add this initiative to the fact that Queensland businesses already face the highest threshold for the introduction of the payroll tax, and the lowest tax rate in Australia, you can understand why business is so happy to support this government, as opposed to other states.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100834"></A>
In addition to this, $36M will be invested statewide to assist low skilled workers, those disadvantaged in the labour market and to support the Queensland Green Army strategy.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100835"></A>
Mr Deputy Speaker, in the short time I have left I should also touch on a couple of other issues which I consider will have a huge impact on the State’s future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100836"></A>
Specifically the announcement of 1,200 more doctors, nurses and health professionals, 316 more teachers and teacher aides, 203 more police, and 75 more ambulance officers this year is an outstanding achievement considering the difficult economic times.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100837"></A>
Mr Deputy Speaker, you should also rest assured that our schools have not been overlooked, with more than $1.4M being spent on refurbishments and upgrades to science and computer labs and other learning areas at the Ipswich, Lowood and Rosewood State High Schools. I can advise that the school teachers and students involved are extremely happy with these announcements, as it will make their work and study commitments much easier. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100838"></A>
In addition I want to thank the Treasurer for also providing much needed additional funding for social housing in my area. I am aware that some members in this House do not share my, or this Government’s passion for social housing, but I believe that one of the most fundamental principles of any government is to look after its most disadvantaged. And with that in mind I am extremely happy to advise the House that Ipswich West will see a number of new housing projects being constructed across the electorate including about $1.6M on seven, two bedroom apartments at Brassall, and a further $2M to construct 12, one bedroom apartments at North Ipswich. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100839"></A>
I can report that these social housing assets will be very well received in my electorate </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100840"></A>
I have a significant number of announcements concerning my state road network, and of course more good news for my local schools in maintenance funding. However I will leave that for another time.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100841"></A>
Before I conclude today I wanted once again to take the time to personally thank the Treasurer and the Premier for delivering on their promise to plan for Queensland’s future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100842"></A>
I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (6.16 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Bligh government’s budget for 2010-11. I will make some comments about initiatives specific to my electorate later in this speech. But first I will focus on initiatives related to my current portfolio responsibilities of Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100846"></A>
This budget demonstrates that the government has a plan for Queensland, and that we are sticking to it. Our plan is for a safe and secure Queensland. That is why this budget includes a record $1.8 billion funding allocation for the Queensland Police Service and $1.67 billion for the Department of Community Safety.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100847"></A>
As demonstrated by the opposition leader’s speech this morning, the LNP has no plan and no policies to take Queensland forward. They are all talk and no action when it comes to things like law and order, and they continually undermine public confidence in the life-saving efforts of our emergency services personnel and volunteers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100848"></A>
The LNP has this week claimed that the government has not delivered on its record Police and Community Safety budgets in 2009-10. Nothing could be further from the truth. In the past 12 months, we have seen the development of 18 police facilities, 10 ambulance facilities, seven fire and rescue facilities, the new combined emergency services academy at Whyte Island and a new Corrective Services office. We have also continued the rollout of GPS devices into front-line ambulance vehicles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100850"></A>
These initiatives would never have been delivered under the LNP because they went to the last election with a policy to slash departmental budgets by three per cent and cut 12,000 jobs a year from the Public Service. Only the Bligh government is committed to delivering capital funding for our police and emergency services agencies for new, refurbished and renovated facilities from which these agencies can protect and serve the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100851"></A>
The opposition leader has also criticised the police to population and ambulance officer to population ratios in Queensland. Let us look at the facts. When the National Party was last in government, the police to population ratio was one officer for every 507 people. Under Labor, the ratio is currently around one officer for every 430 people--a massive improvement. Queensland’s ambulance officer per 100,000 residents ratio, as measured in the report on government services, is the best in the country. Queensland has 55.9 ambulance officers per 100,000 people; Victoria has 43.4 officers per 100,000; New South Wales has 42.1 per 100,000; and the national average is 43.2 per 100,000.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100852"></A>
What would an LNP government deliver? We do not know. Once again, the opposition leader, and his police and emergency services spokesmen, have not told the people of Queensland what their policies are for the police, fire and ambulance services. What we do know is the policy they took to the election--to cut three per cent out of departmental budget and slash 12,000 Public Service positions a year--and that policy still stands. That policy is bad news for our Police Service, bad news for our ambulance service and bad news for our fire service. I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>

<A ID="pgfId-1100853"></A>
Leave granted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100854"></A>
This year’s $1.8 billion allocation for the Police Service--an increase of $110 million on last year’s budget--will put more police officers on the beat and provide the modern facilities and technology police need to help keep the community safe.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100855"></A>
In line with our election commitment to fund an additional 600 police officer positions during this term of government, the 2010-11 Budget includes funding for an additional 203 positions.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100856"></A>

Mrs SULLIVAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Pumicestone--ALP) (6.20 pm): It has been a difficult year, with the global financial crisis wiping substantial money from the budget and Queensland copping its fair share of major disasters, including floods, fires, cyclones and the oil spill. Despite some improvements to the state finances, we still have a long way to go. As the Treasurer stated, we have had to make some tough choices about what is in the best interests of Queensland now and into the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100981"></A>
Our strategy is simple. It involves applying a strong fiscal discipline while lending a helping hand to those who need it most. While global markets continue to shudder, our decisions have protected the lifestyles and, above all, the livelihoods of many families. Jobs are the major focus of this budget. Because of our massive $18 billion building program, including new schools and hospitals, this government has delivered jobs growth for this financial year, where previously job losses were forecast. This is in complete contrast to the LNP, which wants to cut the building program and cause job losses and a lot of pain for Queensland families. This budget will provide a 125 per cent payroll tax rebate for apprentices and trainees and establish a new Skills Commission to tackle skills shortages. New jobs will be created locally through the construction of infrastructure and the delivery of extra services and supports.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100982"></A>
I have successfully lobbied for a new ambulance station in the Pumicestone electorate. It will be located at Ningi, which is halfway between Bribie Island and Caboolture. This will cater for the expanding and ageing population. We spend more than $18 million a day on health in this state, providing a world-class, free public health system. It is a system that is sometimes stretched because there are not enough doctors. This is purely because the previous Liberal federal government capped the doctor placement numbers through the universities when it was in power in 1996. This decision was shameful and the worst decision the Liberals could make as the population soared. State-wide investment includes a record $1.6 billion building program for new hospitals and redevelopments, a boost to the number of doctors, nurses and allied health workers by 1,200, a boost for cochlear hearing implants funding for deaf children, $31 million extra to medical research and $194 million for new regional cancer treatment services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100983"></A>
Another initiative for those who suffer with chronic pain is that four more persistent pain clinics are planned to be built throughout the state. The emergency department of the Caboolture Hospital will also undergo an expansion. Pensioners will continue to get free ambulance services throughout Australia.

This group provide real and practical support to some of the most vulnerable and marginalised people in the Caboolture Region. Two nights each week, the wonderful volunteers from this group provide meals for homeless people at Centenary Lakes.

Mr KNUTH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Dalrymple--LNP) (6.23 pm): This is another bankcard budget. That is how every Queenslander would describe the 2010-11 state budget. This is the fourth year in a row that the funding for Queensland will be paid for by credit, with a surging $84 billion deficit by 2014 which equates to $18,772 for every man, woman and child. We have also lost our AAA credit rating. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101012"></A>
It all started with Wayne Goss. He campaigned against the Wolffdene Dam, which was going to provide a million megalitres of water for the south-east corner. Goss campaigned against this, and so did Peter Beattie and so did Kevin Rudd. When Goss was in power, he developed the no new dams policy, and then when Beattie came to power he continued the no new dams policy. Then what happened? South-East Queensland ran out of water. So to save his own political hide, Peter Beattie flew over the Traveston Crossing and said, ‘I will build my dam there because I want to provide water to the residents of the south-east corner.’ This resulted in a $600 million deficit and a water grid which has not produced a drop of water. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1101015"></A>
Now the government is selling off our profitable assets. We will see the sale of the coal component of Queensland Rail, which produces $1 billion in gross revenue to Queenslanders, while Citytrain, a passenger service, runs at a loss of a billion dollars. Once the coal component of Queensland Rail is sold, who is going to pay for the billion dollar loss in the Citytrain passenger service? The answer is the taxpayers of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101018"></A>
It is a shame because Labor Party members have turned their backs on their fundamental principles and what they stand for. They are selling off Queensland Rail, the Port of Brisbane Corporation, Abbot Point and Forestry Plantations Queensland. It is disappointing that the government is now spending $56 million on the acquisition of more national parks. The government is selling off Forestry Plantations Queensland and purchasing more national parks that have become a breeding ground for feral animals and noxious weeds, but the government does not have the money to manage the ones it has right now. The government is converting the state forests into national parks, which gives it the authority to kick the horse riders and motorcycle riders out of national parks. Where will the horse riders go if they are kicked out of the state forests? Are they going to ride on the streets? What a great idea! What a great innovation! </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1208643"></A>
I note the budget has $25 million for dental clinic teaching facilities at the James Cook University campuses in Townsville and Cairns. Dentists need to be a priority for rural Queensland. Many people are forced to travel a 500 or 600-kilometre round trip just to get a tooth fixed. I understand that after years without a full-time public dentist a locum dentist is currently available under contract at the Charters Towers Hospital and is providing public patient dental care. That dentist will be there until September but will then be gone. However, there is still no permanent dentist. Patients are burdened because they have to travel to Townsville to receive dental care. However, the 1300 number that Townsville residents use to arrange dental appointments is not accessible to out-of-town patients. The two phones listed in the Telstra phone book are a 1300 number and also 47899900 and they are not for appointments. The out-of-town patients are at their wit’s end, wondering how to successfully arrange a dental appointment at the Townsville clinic.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101020"></A>
One of my constituents reported embarking on a three-hour round trip to Townsville to be able to access the 1300 number so she could secure a dental appointment. Other constituents have reported that they have tried phoning the ‘not appointments’ number in an attempt to get through to someone who can direct their call to the right area, but they have had great difficulty getting through on this fixed phone. The result is costly, long distance charges for extended waiting periods on the phone. Dental patients who use the public system are often pensioners or on a low income, so this is very disturbing. I am asking the minister to investigate extending the use of the 1300 number to include rural areas for patients who must travel to Townsville for dental services and who need to arrange for a dental appointment.</Hansard-Body>

There was no extra funding provided for roads in my electorate, even though the Tablelands produces up to a billion dollars a year in gross revenue. Last year I tabled a petition with 1,129 signatures from residents of Ravenshoe who called on the minister to direct funds to upgrade a stretch of the Kennedy Highway from the East Evelyn Road to the intersection of the Kennedy Highway and Tumoulin Road. Permits have been issued to some transport companies for B-doubles to transport goods around the township of Ravenshoe. However, this decision has ignored the most practical and safest route, which is the section the residents are asking to be upgraded and delegated as a B-double route.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101025"></A>
The result has been increased traffic through the centre of the town. Not only is this unsafe for residents but also makes it difficult for transporters to satisfy fatigue management requirements. The result is an increased cost for farmers. It is also proving damaging to the existing road network in and around the town. Fruit and vegetables from the area are transported to the southern markets, including Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. By upgrading this intersection and the adjacent road section, the road will be safe for all users and it will provide a suitable permanent B-double route away from the centre of town, which is safer for all residents and satisfactory for farmers and truck drivers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101026"></A>
Another disappointment in the budget was that there was no extra funding for the Herberton to Irvinebank road. I have personally travelled over this road and have experienced its shocking state. The fact that the sealing of this route was not prioritised years ago is astonishing. Shocking accidents and dreadful injuries have occurred along the road, including the rollover of a minibus. Road users risk life and limb every time they use the road and they also risk inevitable shocking damage to their vehicles. The local bus driver who transports schoolchildren has broken down five times and the children are forced to wait in stinking hot conditions. Both Herberton and Irvinebank are towns of immense historical importance. Consequently, they are attractive to domestic and overseas tourists and historians alike. We should hang our heads in shame at the condition of the Herberton to Irvinebank road. It is a deathtrap and the government must stop pussyfooting around and seal the road once and for all. </Hansard-Body>

I would also like to mention the Millaa Millaa Malanda Road, which is a deathtrap. There have been a lot of accidents and quite a number of deaths over the years. It is also a B-double route. It has a lot of weaving bends, corners and curves. I believe this needs to be prioritised as well. </Hansard-Body>

Mr KNUTH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I wish to add to what I was saying in relation to the roads in the Tablelands, and I had mentioned quite a few of those. It is very important to mention that in the Tablelands there have been a number of deaths involving public bike riders. The member for Cook has also brought this to the attention of the parliament. While we want to encourage people to indulge in physical activity by riding to work, on the Tablelands there are only very limited bicycle lanes and signage is also a problem. This is something that we will be tabling in the parliament. I bring that to the minister’s attention, to make him aware that we need more funding and support to provide more bicycle lanes and signage. </Hansard-Body>

This budget does not really give me anything to boast about in relation to extra funding for the seat of Dalrymple, even though the electorate produced about $6 billion in gross revenue. However, it is very important to note that there is no rail freight service between Townsville and Mount Isa, so all transportation is now by road and not by rail. That has created quite a lot of congestion on the roads, with an increase in the number of B-doubles and quadruples using the roads. Therefore, it is very important that we have more passing lanes between Townsville and Mount Isa. I have brought this up in parliament before and I have brought it to the minister’s attention. There is only one passing lane between Townsville and Charters Towers, whereas there are eight passing lanes between Townsville and Burdekin. An increase in the number of passing lanes would be much appreciated by all in the area, because the roads are becoming very dangerous. There are no areas to pass and there are a lot of B-doubles on the roads. As I said, we do not have a rail freight service as it was closed down. We do not have a Q-Link service, because that has been closed down. Everything is transported by road. Therefore, just to sweeten us after closing down all the Q-Link depots, the least they can do is give us some passing lanes between Townsville and Mount Isa. </Hansard-Body>

I was disappointed that there was no increase in the Patient Travel Subsidy Scheme. As members would be aware, with the removal or downsizing of local hospitals there is very limited access to specialist treatment. Patients in rural and regional Queensland have to travel further and further. They have to go through so much red tape to try to access the Patient Travel Subsidy Scheme, but the return they get is a pittance. The subsidy is only 15c a kilometre for petrol and $30 a night for a motel room. If someone is travelling 300 or 400 kilometres and has to stay in a motel, 15c a kilometre and $30 a night is not much. In the run-up to the last election the opposition was quite clear that we would increase the subsidy to 30c a kilometre for petrol and $90 a night for motel accommodation. </Hansard-Body>

One thing that was welcomed was the extra funding for research into a vaccination for the Hendra virus. That is very welcome because it is a very serious issue. Flying foxes carry a lethal virus that is passed through horses to humans. It is not a nice thing to see people dying as a result of contracting this serious virus. That is welcome funding. However, it is very important that we look at the cause of the virus. We must look at where it is coming from, which is the flying foxes. We really cannot afford to have flying foxes living amongst people. They carry a lethal virus, they are vermin, they are a pest, they screech, they carry ticks and they excrete over people’s homes, their children and the schools. I believe this is a great step forward, but the first thing we must do is look at the cause of the virus. </Hansard-Body>

Because flying foxes carry a lethal virus that can kill people, we cannot afford to have them roosting and living amongst people. It does not matter how many people are sympathetic to the flying fox cause; the fact is that they carry a lethal virus that can kill people. When flying foxes flap in and roost amongst people, we must have strategies in place to ensure that the flying foxes are immediately removed. I very much appreciate the fact that more money will go into researching a vaccination for the Hendra virus. At the same time, common sense tells us that if we have something living amongst us that has the potential to kill people--and flying foxes have that potential--it has to be removed immediately. We must work together to find and implement strategies to have the flying foxes removed from residential areas at all costs.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Glass House--LNP) (7.36 pm): This evening I rise to contribute to the cognate debate on the appropriation and revenue amendment bills. For the people of Glass House, there are mixed emotions upon reading the bills. For most of the many communities and townships in the electorate there is something to be thankful for. Equally, there is disappointment at some glaring local omissions, and as we look beyond the local and explore the broader budget implications things get downright depressing. So for the people of Glass House this budget is an example of the good, the bad and the ugly. For the sake of beginning on a positive note, I would like to unpack the good news for Glass House in a bit more detail. </Hansard-Body>

For the residents of Caboolture and Elimbah, there is a bit to crow about. The Caboolture Hospital’s emergency department will continue its upgrade. Apparently, although I have not been able to source this myself and I have to take it on good advice from a government member, $500,000 will be put towards planning the Caboolture health hub as well. The state makes another $1.09 million contribution to the $11 million State Equestrian Centre just north of the Caboolture showgrounds. Just a little further up the road, the state is chipping in $34,375 from its Environmental Infrastructure Program as part of the $550,000 landfill gas extraction project at Alex Barr Oval. I know the countless volunteers at the adjacent Caboolture Historical Village are watching that project with interest. A little further north there is $100,000 in Safer Roads Sooner funding for shoulder widening and sealing of Beerburrum Road south of Spoonbill Drive. </Hansard-Body>

Whilst applauded by some, others in the area will scratch their heads in wonderment at the share of $15.5 million being invested locally as part of the koala response strategy. On that note, while I support moves to identify, protect and rehabilitate koala habitat in the area, I would call on the relevant departments to get out from behind their computer screens and satellite photographs and go and check things out on the ground. I am no koala expert but I am pretty certain koalas are not really fussed on either the leaves or the nuts of macadamia trees and yet macadamia farms continue to be mapped as prime koala habitat. </Hansard-Body>

If we move west to Wamuran, D’Aguilar, Delaneys Creek, Woodford and Mount Mee, to the best of my knowledge, and from a detailed study of the budget papers and websites, these communities miss out altogether. But, sorry, I was trying to be positive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Moving north to the townships of Beerburrum, Glass House Mountains, Beerwah and Peachester, it is happier news. The 2010-11 financial year will see $1.5 million going towards the Johnston Road-Bruce Highway interchange. That is welcome, but locals do have questions about why, especially when just up the highway the Roys Road intersection is far more dangerous and in need of far more urgent attention. The Beerburrum State School gets a well-deserved $48,500 through the TIDS program to improve its set-down area and parking. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112116"></A>
If we continue north to the Blackall Range and the communities of Maleny, Montville, Flaxton and Conondale there is a bit more to cheer about again. The previously announced $403,000 for the Maleny State School upgrades is welcome, as is the $225,000 under the Safer Roads Sooner program to make improvements on the Maleny-Stanley River Road at Postman’s Track. There is $98,000 to finalise the planning study on the Maleny-Kenilworth Road north of Conondale, $75,000 to begin the replacement of two walking bridges at Kondalilla Falls and $15,000 towards bus shelters at Conondale State School. </Hansard-Body>

Finally, for the towns of the Sunshine Valley--Palmwoods, Chevallum and Eudlo--parents of school-age children can rejoice. There is $1.9 million to construct a new administration building and convert the old administration building to classrooms, $565,000 to commence stage 1 of classroom upgrades and $71,000 to commence stage 2 of classroom upgrades--all at Palmwoods State School. </Hansard-Body>

More broadly, whilst the details are very light on, I do hope the electorate will benefit from increased investments in existing national park infrastructure and in the acquisition of more protected land. As I have said before, the Glass House electorate strategically connects the D’Aguilar National Park, the Glass House Mountains National Park and the national parks of the Blackall Range. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112131"></A>
Deliberate investment and acquisitions in this area could deliver an uninterrupted nature corridor stretching from Brisbane’s northern suburbs to the Noosa hinterland. As I mentioned in passing to the Acting Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability yesterday, following the travesty that was the sale of Forestry Plantations Queensland--a sale that included land adjacent to those national parks I just mentioned and land perfectly suited for acquisition--such purchases would demonstrate a commitment by this government to maintain the green corridor that lies between Caboolture and Caloundra. But then I guess it would only go again to demonstrate how incompetent this government is because it would probably wind up purchasing the land back from Hancocks for far more than it sold it to Hancocks for in the first place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112133"></A>
I also hope in response to my representations in this House that we will see a local increase in police numbers as part of the investment in more than 200 new police officers across the state. I understand two positions at Maleny were advertised just last week. That is truly great news for hinterland locals, but, more importantly, for the hardworking officers already stationed at Maleny. But I would suggest again that Palmwoods and Woodford also need additional staffing. I eagerly await announcements that these services will be boosted in the very near future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112134"></A>
The people in the north of the electorate may take some solace--although admittedly not much--from the increased investment in Nambour and Caloundra hospitals to take up the slack of the ongoing delays around constructing the public component of the new Sunshine Coast University Hospital. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112136"></A>
As I said, this budget is about the good, the bad and the ugly. So let us look at the bad. The bad refers to the omission of some seriously significant community priorities--commitments like the D’Aguilar Highway, the Caboolture health hub, the Beerburrum to Nambour rail duplication, the Maleny-Kenilworth Road and, less costly but equally important, an Elimbah State School crossing supervisor and operational funding for the Maleny Neighbourhood Centre. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112138"></A>
Let us start with the D’Aguilar Highway. It is clear that with no allocation of funding for 2010-11 the state is hanging its hopes on the black spot funding application currently sitting with the federal government. I and the local community must clearly peg our hopes for any immediate improvements to this killer highway on that same funding. As the state MP responsible for this state controlled road, I do wonder whether this government has conveniently abdicated its responsibility to upgrade this highway to its Commonwealth colleagues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112139"></A>
I will ask, therefore, in light of no additional funding for the highway, that the minister show jolly common sense and overrule the manual of uniform traffic control devices--the MUTCD--and move some speed limit signage. I think particularly of the 80 kilometres per hour sign that currently sits outside the Wamuran veterinarian practice. If there are no upgrades to the highway, this speed limit sign must be moved to the other side of County Drive and Turnbull Road. It will not even cost the government a cent. Please, minister, do not let it take a fatality to intervene in this lunacy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112141"></A>
Then there is the Caboolture health hub. I did mention I have heard rumours that $500,000 has been allocated towards planning the hub. But planning is not bricks and mortar. We first heard about the Caboolture health hub back in the 2006-07 budget. But back then it was referred to as the Caboolture Ambulatory and Community Health Centre--a supposed $20 million project designed to integrate acute health care, primary care and other non-government services. In that budget, $1.58 million was set aside to purchase land for the centre. But we have not heard boo since. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112144"></A>
‘So what,’ you well may say. We have this year seen the consequences--the very human consequences--of this failed project. The Children’s Therapy Service, currently based on the ground floor of the Caboolture Hospital, was one of those primary care services slated to move into the health hub. With the unexplained delay to the development of the hub, the CTS has had to source a new location, and North Lakes has been selected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112148"></A>
Let me tell people what that means for Kirsty Melton of Elimbah and her kids, Lachlan, aged four, and Rachael, aged 22 months, both of whom use the CTS for speech therapy services. I refer to an article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Caboolture News</Hansard-Italic>
 dated Wednesday, 19 May. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1112153"></A>
Kirsty Melton--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1112154"></A>
will need to travel for an epic four hours on public transport within school times to take Rachael to half-hour long appointments at the new centre. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1112155"></A>
“I do not drive much and would need to take public transport so if I take the 9.20 am to Caboolture station, then a bus to Rothwell and then swap to get to Westfield North Lakes, I then have a 250-metre walk up a hill to the North Lakes health hub with two kids,” Kirsty said. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1112156"></A>
“This is not only a costly exercise for families, but the main issue they will face is after the travelling to get to the new location, their special little ones are going to either be weary from travel, grumpy or asleep. This would then make the therapy session useless. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112157"></A>
I have visited the Caboolture CTS and will shortly be shown around the new North Lakes facilities. I have no doubt that, by the time it opens, there may well be a superior service offered at the new North Lakes site. But none of that will make it easier for parents like Kirsty or kids like Lachlan and Rachael, who must now commute a four-hour round trip from Caboolture. The most frustrating thing is that all of this could have been avoided had the hub progressed at pace, allowing the CTS to move into a new Caboolture space. Instead we have heard deafening silence on the matter since 2006. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112158"></A>
Another omission is the Beerburrum to Nambour rail duplication. For towns like Palmwoods and Eudlo that are relying on this project proceeding sooner rather than later so they can get about redesigning town centres and addressing critical traffic concerns, the ongoing neglect of this project is devastating. While Springfield gets its rail infrastructure two years early, our main northern rail corridor remains in limbo. I do not want to deny the residents of Springfield their much needed public transport infrastructure, but surely upgrading a significant passenger and freight route should share similar priority. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112159"></A>
We could say the same of the Maleny-Kenilworth Road. I mentioned $98,000 to finish the planning study. Seriously, enough with the planning. This is a major thoroughfare for residents around Maleny and in the northern Mary Valley, not to mention a gazetted tourist route. I call again on the Minister for Main Roads to address this, particularly the goat track north of Conondale and Witta Hill, in his next RIP. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112196"></A>
Finally, to summarise the bad in this budget, let me mention just two more omissions. I can see no mention of the $15,000 sought by the Elimbah State School P&amp;C to install a crossing supervisor on Beerburrum Road, but I will address this in more detail later this evening, and nor can I see any operational funding for the Maleny Neighbourhood Centre. Who in their right mind builds a $2 million community facility then neglects to provide even a minimal amount for its management and overheads? Sheer madness!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112202"></A>
Throughout my analysis of where this government has neglected the constituents of Glass House we may have heard members opposite ask how we will fund it. Quite simply through canning the absurd Northern Pipeline Interconnector stage 2, or NPI2. This government has already wasted $200 million on this pipeline to nowhere now that Traveston Dam has been confined to the rubbish bin where it belongs, taking with it another $225 million of taxpayers’ money. This coming year this government is going to waste another $200 million on this pipeline. As an interesting but related aside, I was reading an article in today’s Melbourne <Hansard-Italic>

Which brings me to the ugly. All members on this side of the House have addressed the broader budget implications, beginning with the Leader of the Opposition’s budget reply this morning. All have spoken about debt, mismanagement, dishonesty and the spiralling cost of living. Let me briefly touch on an issue dear to my heart, an issue that demonstrates that dishonesty. Prior to the last election the opposition put forward a cost-saving policy of public sector efficiency dividends. But thanks to an unrelenting spin campaign by the Bligh government, ‘efficiency dividend’ magically became ‘slashing 12,000 front-line jobs’--a complete and utter fabrication. The truth is the government was proposing an efficiency dividend of its own, and the Treasurer confirmed it in his budget speech earlier this week when he said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1112224"></A>
Last year an efficiency dividend was introduced across government and harvested upfront. This has required agencies to look at expenditure and make savings in their operations.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1112226"></A>
As reported in an article in yesterday’s <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 titled ‘Public wage bill heads for blowout’--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1112228"></A>
The cost of paying wages, holiday pay and long-service leave to the public service is soaring despite a decree that the bureaucracy squeeze $337 million in ‘efficiency savings’ during this financial year--cost-cutting that will grow to $451m by the 2012-13 financial year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1112229"></A>
The Bligh government has also ordered that any growth in the public-sector workforce be limited to ‘front-line service delivery’ and ‘targeted policy commitments’.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112231"></A>
Fascinating! Apparently as the opposition originally proposed, it is possible to implement an efficiency dividend within the public sector that can deliver tangible savings whilst not impacting on front-line service delivery or targeted policy commitments. Queenslanders should take note of this. Queensland’s public servants should take note of this. As a former public servant, I can confirm savings can be made--efficiencies can be made--within the public sector without impacting on front-line service delivery, which is why the Leader of the Opposition gave the commitment this morning that where savings are made from reducing overlapping bureaucracy in the EPA and offices of Clean Energy and Climate Change the funds will be used to directly employ additional on-the-ground staff in areas such as our national parks. It is possible to deliver efficiency dividends whilst protecting, even enhancing, front-line service delivery.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112238"></A>
As I conclude let me use someone else’s words to confirm the opposition is accurately reflecting the concerns of broader Queensland. I refer to an article in yesterday’s <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>

<A ID="pgfId-1112243"></A>
But politically, there is a risk the Premier and Treasurer are so focused on the finish line that they can no longer tell whether the crowd is still cheering or whether the election race has already been lost.

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The structural reforms kicked off last year with the abolition of a fuel subsidy, and another round of vehicle registration increases.

Mrs MENKENS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burdekin--LNP) (7.56 pm): The 2010-11 state budget that we are debating this evening can be described as a typical Labor disappointment. After Labor’s track record of lies and excuses, Queensland people do have a right to be very sceptical about this budget. This budget is a typical Labor disappointment with ongoing deficit, increased debt and a new environmental waste tax on business. There is no debt repayment strategy in this budget, and we see that state debt will rise from $43 billion in 2008-09 to $51 billion this year and is forecast to reach nearly $84 billion. This debt figure of $84 billion equates to a debt of $18,000 for every man, woman and child in Queensland. What it means, in simple terms, is that this government is spending far more than it earns--a simple housekeeping rule that every family understands.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112256"></A>
The question I am asked by so many people is where has all the money gone? Queenslanders expect a government that can demonstrate economic management, which the Bligh government is simply not doing. Government wastage is apparent in just so many departments. An LNP government promises the Queensland people responsible economic management and policies. An LNP government will deliver honestly and fairly to the Queensland people. It is the Bligh government that has lost Queensland our AAA credit rating and this budget provides for no process of repayment of this huge debt, and an ability to repay debt is one of the major criteria towards regaining our AAA credit rating.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112258"></A>
An LNP government will have a plan in place to reduce debt. In comparison with other states, Queensland debt is far higher than any other state, which is appalling given our resource base. These are the resources that have given this government an unprecedented income from royalties and GST. It is also obvious that the Bligh Labor government has taken no notice of the community’s outrage and is still going ahead with its plans for privatisation. It simply will not listen to the Queenslanders who oppose the sale of our assets--the assets that are amongst the major wealth producers of this state. An LNP government will not sell these state assets. At a time when our community is struggling to deal with increases in the costs of electricity, fuel, public transport, water and other costs of living courtesy of this government, it is disappointing that our community also gets nothing back in this budget.</Hansard-Body>

At the same time, our community organisations are trying to fill the gaps, providing services to more and more people, averting crises and mopping up when crises arise. These organisations are dealing with skyrocketing costs themselves. This budget has very little for them also. There is no assistance to help these organisations help others and there is no assistance to help them deal with increased wages. We should remember that government is about people and families. </Hansard-Body>

The award wage decision preceding last year’s budget is still having a wide effect on community organisations but is all but forgotten by this government. There is no relief for organisations that missed out on last year’s funds. There is no help for organisations reliant on volunteers and fundraising to improve the quality of life for those in need, on the streets, or in crisis. </Hansard-Body>

One amount of funding that has been touted by this government is an allocation of $1.6 million for domestic violence services. Although it is creditable that domestic violence rates are mentioned, this funding leaves a somewhat bitter taste in the mouth. At a time when we see the Bayside Domestic Violence Initiative facing closure this month because the government cut its funding, this government is more than happy to pat itself enthusiastically on the back for funding domestic violence services. In its actions, this Labor government is abandoning the victims of domestic crime by forcing into closure the community organisations that help them through times of trauma and desperation. </Hansard-Body>

On the other hand, from a government that is all too happy to take the LNP’s policy and reproduce it in inferior forms, there are echoes of the LNP’s policy in one initiative in this budget. Unfortunately, the government is like a cheating child who cannot quite read properly and their transposed ideas miss the essence and the effectiveness of the original, be it about carers, grandparents or new parents. The Helping Out Families initiative bears very close resemblance to the LNP’s social inclusion policy of the last election, particularly the ECHO program, which was announced in March 2009. Under this program, outlined 18 months ago by the LNP, early childhood help officers would be available to all new parents to offer information, support and guidance. It involved community nurses providing a friendly, approachable service that is dedicated to helping parents through the first few years of their child’s life, starting from the birth of the child through to the age of three years. Now, we have the government talking about its program to ensure that every mother with a newborn child will receive up to six visits from a registered nurse within the first three years of the child’s life. It is good to see that the government is finally mentioning families, a notable absence from any policies that it has produced in the past several years. But again, we are getting a second-rate rip-off. Families are central to communities and it is families who are bearing the brunt of skyrocketing costs. </Hansard-Body>

At least families receive a line item in this budget. Unfortunately, seniors miss out yet again. With the condescending line of implementing the new Seniors Strategy Action Plan, that is the end of the story for our seniors. There is still no office for seniors, there is still no recognition of their continuing contributions, there is still no action to tackle the issues that are important to them--just more platitudes and plans. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117733"></A>
I note the 7.5 per cent decrease in the number of businesses participating in the seniors discount scheme. I would ask the minister, who is present in the chamber this evening, what she is going to do to encourage businesses to participate again in this program and to stem this exodus. I also note that the rate of seniors using the card has remained static. Under an LNP plan to ease the cost of living pressure on Queenslanders, the LNP commitment is to increase the electricity rebate by 30 per cent for seniors and concession card holders, and vehicle registration fees will be frozen for three years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117735"></A>
I contrast the treatment of seniors in this budget to another year of extraordinary expenditure for the Office for Women. Not only is there an official office but also there is an enormous budget spent on running the office. Ninety per cent of the budget for the office is spent on running the office, with notable examples such as a series of seminars held by the office in 2008-09 on budgeting and the smart use of money. This is the office that was trying to teach other people about smart budgeting. This office paid an average of $1,636 per participant in these seminars. </Hansard-Body>

In the youth justice section of the portfolio, another year brings another set of capital underspends. The Cleveland Youth Detention Centre is a prominent example this year. In 2009-10 the centre was budgeted to receive $70.2 million for its expansion. Just $31.6 million was spent. That is missing the target by $38.5 million, or a 55 per cent underspend. This minister, who would see valuable community organisations close because she refuses to fund amounts as small as $10,000, cannot even acquit $38 million for her own department’s projects. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117739"></A>
Another concerning development in the expenditure over the past year is that housing is having more money than ever thrown at it, yet there is a rapidly escalating number of people waiting long term on the list. In just a year there has been a 40 per cent blow-out--from 20,000 people, a terribly concerning number in its own right, to 28,300. Even worse is the forecast for the next 12 months. The minister’s own target is now a massive 30,000 people. I would have to say that that is not a target; it is a disaster. This blow-out follows a year of controversy caused by the minister’s refusal to consult with communities before forcing social housing developments into clearly inappropriate areas that are not suited to their new communities or their new tenants, that are 20-plus kilometres away from health services, that are not equipped with air conditioning or lifts and that are creating angst and anger. At the same time, the long-term waiting list for public housing is blowing out. There has also been a decrease in the number of new households assisted in social rental housing--down from 6,510 to 6,466. </Hansard-Body>

So what is in the budget for the Burdekin electorate? I welcome the ongoing commitment to the significant developments in the Abbot Point area, with $5.5 million allocated to acquire land for the Abbot Point state development area and very significant funds towards the completion of the X50 expansion as well as planning funds for the X110 and X230 expansions. The GAP project, which is the Goonyella-Abbot Point expansion project, has at least seemingly been given the go-ahead, with significant funds of $502 million towards the estimated $84 million. I welcome the ongoing commitment to these projects, as they are vital to not only the Bowen area but also North Queensland as a whole. However, I do not forget the number of small businesses and contractors who suffered financially, and many even approached bankruptcy, as a result of this government’s dumping of the earlier northern missing link project in 2008. </Hansard-Body>

It is of concern that the proposed Chalco project at Abbot Point appears doubtful. Media articles this week have suggested that the federal government’s proposed resource super profits tax has further undermined the economics of this potential Queensland project. To have a development already facing problems with overseas alumina prices then being confronted with a super profits tax at the eleventh hour is not reassuring. Chalco would be one of the major developments at Abbot Point and would no doubt be a major catalyst for the development of additional industries. This major refinery would also see improved infrastructure develop in that area. There is no doubt that the proposed resource super profits tax will have a major impact on jobs. Xstrata has already signalled its intentions to suspend growth initiatives at its Ernest Henry and Wandoan mine projects. The concerns that are being expressed about this tax by so many people across Queensland and so many people who are working in the mining industry are certainly justified. The LNP does not support this super tax. </Hansard-Body>

We still see ongoing huge gaps in the delivery of services by this government. There is absolutely no end in sight in relation to the health pay crisis. The government must hang its head in shame over this debacle. Every day we are seeing new situations with the wages of health professionals similar to those of the nurse who recently brought her pay slips to me. For the previous three fortnights this particular nurse had been wrongly paid and underpaid. Her hourly rate was different on each pay slip. To add insult to this she received a bill to say that she had been overpaid nearly $900 since 2004 in supposedly incorrect allowances. Not only that, there was a rude command that if she did not pay that back before 30 June she would be liable to fringe benefits tax. How dare they! This particular nurse said, ‘I have worked in this department honestly and full time for over 25 years. Any other employer would have given me a gold watch, but the health department has just given me a bill.’ </Hansard-Body>

I see no further assistance in this budget for country people in relation to health delivery. Dental health delivery is in a parlous state. I regularly hear from people who are desperate for dental assistance. I hear regularly that there is no dentist in Bowen, no dentist in Ayr, no dentist in Proserpine and up to a five-year wait in Townsville to fix a toothache. </Hansard-Body>

There are major concerns being raised by residents in the Bowen area about the state of their water and the sewage system. If the state government had maintained the 40 per cent water and sewage capital works subsidies for council instead of cutting them in this budget, the Whitsunday Regional Council would no doubt have availed itself of this. With the estimated cost for a Bowen water treatment plant being in the order of $28 million, this 40 per cent subsidy scheme would have seen significant savings to Whitsunday Regional Council ratepayers. This cost will now no doubt have to be borne by the already overstressed ratepayers. </Hansard-Body>

The full impact of the flawed Great Barrier Reef Protection Bill is being felt by cane farmers and graziers, two vital industries that have been named in this legislation as an environmentally relevant activity. These farmers and graziers are struggling under the impact of the huge increase that they are facing in paperwork and bureaucracy. That is not improving the health of the Barrier Reef one iota. Skilled farmers, who are being told to change their optimum farming programs, are totally frustrated watching their productivity diminish. This government still has not acknowledged that growers can manage their own land without totally unnecessary regulations and imposts that have not been scientifically proven being thrust on them. </Hansard-Body>

It is disappointing that the Premier’s rhetoric about Townsville as the ‘vice-capital’ of Queensland has not been matched with infrastructure funding. The most we are hearing is a call for the Townsville City Council to provide $30 million towards a long-awaited cruise ship terminal. This would be a major asset to Townsville but it is a state government responsibility to deliver this and should not be expected to be paid for by Townsville’s already stressed ratepayers. However, it is interesting to note in today’s <Hansard-Italic>

 It is 5.6 per cent of total capital works to 5.1 per cent of the population. But he goes on to say that although our capital allocation is 5.6 per cent it does not match our annual economic contribution which is 6.8 per cent. As a growing region with major infrastructure and social needs, he would have liked the government to do more. This need for more infrastructure is reflected right across North Queensland, which is the economic powerhouse of this state. This is a very disappointing budget that future generations of Queenslanders will spend a long time trying to repay. </Hansard-Body>

(8.15 pm): Our government is determined to create more jobs to give people the security and dignity that comes with a job and a pay cheque. We have the largest building program this state has ever seen: $17 billion to build new hospitals, houses, roads, schools and other essential facilities all across Brisbane, Logan and the entire state. We are also determined to enable everyone to have a decent quality of life. People have been digging deep to cope with the financial and emotional pressure of tough economic times. That is why we remain so focused on kick-starting the economy, building jobs and providing financial relief through increased electricity rebates for seniors and pensioners. This rebate is now worth $216 per household per year. That is why we are absolutely determined to better manage population growth in South-East Queensland. We want to support new residential communities that are planned well and include facilities, services and public transport to support residents.</Hansard-Body>

The local area that I represent is growing extremely fast. When I was a kid living at Acacia Ridge, a drive out along Beaudesert Road and Mount Lindesay Highway was like a trip through the country: miles of rural properties, not the thousands of rooftops we see today. It is my job as a member of parliament to make sure my local area gets its fair share of community facilities such as the state-of-the-art community health centre at Browns Plains and new school buildings at Algester and Pallara and other schools and kindies. It is my job to make sure we ease the congestion on our major roads and improve public transport. State budget highlights for my local area include: passenger set-down upgrades for Algester and Boronia Heights state schools and new buildings at Pallara and Algester state schools; two new kindergartens, one in Forest Lake and one at Park Ridge; upgrades to electricity substations at Heathwood and Parkinson to support population growth; employment of a youth worker at Forest Lake Salvation Army; and $31,000 extra for Logan West Meals on Wheels. The team of volunteers there do a great job. </Hansard-Body>

As the Minister for Community Services and Housing and Minister for Women, it is my job to make sure families and individuals who need help have a place to call home that is affordable and support when times are tough. This year my Department of Communities will spend $900-plus million on housing for 2010-11; $55 million on a new Helping Out Families program in Logan, Beenleigh and the Gold Coast; and $12.6 million to increase the electricity concessions for seniors and pensioners. Overall this budget provides $1.3 billion worth of concessions to Queenslanders in need. In this budget we urge Queenslanders to ‘do the bright thing’. A new Solar Hot Water Scheme is now available that provides a subsidy of up to $1,000 to help households cut their power bill and help our environment. The single biggest allocation in this budget is health services. This year we will employ another 1,200 doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. We will have a new pain clinic at the Princess Alexandra Hospital and significant upgrades to the Logan, Princess Alexandra and QEII hospitals.</Hansard-Body>

(8.19 pm): It is my pleasure to rise this evening to speak to the appropriation bills and the state budget and its effect on members of the Pine Rivers community. This state budget will deliver a better education to the next generation of Pine Rivers residents and create jobs through improved local infrastructure as part of the Bligh government’s massive building program.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1123598"></A>
We will deliver on our promise to create more jobs, to lay the foundations for a strong economic recovery, deliver on better traffic and public transport outcomes and better local infrastructure as well as supporting local jobs through the Safer Roads Sooner program. It is our job to make tough decisions about how we facilitate the state’s economic recovery and how we best provide for the long-term interests of all Queenslanders. We are determined to deliver 100,000 jobs by the end of this term--and that means our infrastructure program must be maintained.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129115"></A>
In fact it is interesting to note the release of the jobs figures today. Queensland is again the powerhouse for jobs generation for the 10th month in a row--8,800 new jobs, the most of any state, and 8,200 of them are full-time jobs. Importantly, our jobs target today stands at 50,700. We are more than halfway towards our commitment of 100,000 new jobs.</Hansard-Body>

Talking about infrastructure, specifically in Pine Rivers, almost $1 million will be spent this year on the upgrade of Strathpine train station. This upgrade is something I have campaigned hard for and is a real coup for our local community. The station will receive new electronic screens, better seating, improved signage, toilet upgrades, fresh painting and industrial cleaning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129119"></A>
Following on from last year’s budget commitment to provide additional parking spaces at Bray Park station, the Bligh Labor government is showing its commitment to public transport upgrades and encouraging local residents to use them. Across the network, the government is spending over $174 million to continue building 64 new three-car passenger trains to deliver service enhancements across the Citytrain network, and I look forward to Pine Rivers receiving its share.</Hansard-Body>

The Bligh government’s Safer Roads Sooner program will see the completion of a $482,000 upgrade to the traffic signals on South Pine Road at the Kremzow Road intersection, Brendale, and $1.47 million allocated this financial year to build a new guardrail on Brisbane-Woodford Road at Mount Mee. These are all important projects that the community asked for. This is a huge win for us and it means more jobs and a boost to the local economy.

The Queensland Government is committed to helping ease cost of living pressures on working families, pensioners and Queenslanders doing it tough. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1129156"></A>
We are changing CTP insurance to save motorists money. By preventing motor dealers from receiving commissions and removing the HIH levy, we will reduce costs by around $24. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

There is an increase to the South East Queensland Pensioner Water Subsidy Scheme--up to $100 cash back for eligible pensioners from July this year. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1129158"></A>
To help reduce power bills the government is providing a Solar Hot Water Rebate of either $600 or $1000 when residents install a new system or heat pump. The Solar Bonus Scheme continues to provide 44 cents per kilowatt-hour for all surplus electricity fed back into the Queensland grid from roof-top solar PV panels grid. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1129159"></A>
There is more cash back for pensioners’ power bills--the government has already increased the rebate available to $190 per year, and from 1 July this year it will increase to around $216. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1129160"></A>
This Budget provides a new Medical Cooling and Heating Electricity Commission Scheme which will provide a rebate to assist with the electricity costs for eligible concession card holders with a medical condition who have a dependence on air-conditioning to regulate body temperature. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1129161"></A>
We will continue our ClimateSmart Home Service which allows residents to speak to the experts to explain what steps people can take to save on power bills. Participants can save up to $325 annually on power bills. I must say, I have had this done at my place and the results are astounding. The monitor also serves as a reminder when you have left appliances running like the water booster. I highly recommend that people take advantage of this service.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1129162"></A>
This government continues to provide half price travel for pensioners and students using buses, trains and ferries, half price car registration fees for pensioners, discount taxi travel for people with a disability, and public transport users can save up to 30 per cent on public transport just by buying and using a go card. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1129163"></A>
We continue to fund a rebate of up to $180 for pensioners each year on their council rates. The Queensland Government’s Pensioner Rate Subsidy Scheme provides a subsidy equal to 20 per cent (up to a maximum of $180 each year) of the gross rates and charges levied by a local government. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mrs SCOTT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Woodridge--ALP) (8.21 pm): As we look back on the year that has gone since we were last in this place for the budget sitting, while families, individuals, businesses and services have felt the strain of the global economic downturn, nonetheless, as we look around the world, there is no other place that I would rather be but in Queensland, Australia. In my own electorate of Woodridge, the stresses have been obvious. More people have sought housing assistance and financial counselling, queued for food handouts, attended our emergency relief agencies, browsed our preloved clothing and second-hand shops and reduced their spending wherever possible. However, most people are resilient and often reach out to help each other. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129169"></A>
You will find in Logan City that help is available and is given in a caring, non-judgemental way. We have always hastened to assure those who have needed help for the first time that there is no shame. It matters little if you are a company director or business owner or a simple worker. Anyone, through circumstances of their own making or through illness, domestic violence, loss of employment--anyone--can be reduced to needing assistance at any time of life. I want to pay tribute to my very caring staff Sandy and Kerri, who are able to calm the sometimes troubled souls who come seeking help, and the wonderful workers and volunteers who serve this community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129170"></A>
Many throughout our entire state will be glad of the increased assistance to cover costs of electricity. Pensioners and seniors will now receive $216.21 per annum, as well as those who require cooling and heating for a medical condition. The amount of $294.85 is available per annum for those using home kidney dialysis machines and $440.30 for those needing life support oxygen concentrators. For someone who experiences a crisis or serious emergency, the Home Energy Emergency Assistance Scheme will assist up to $760. ClimateSmart Home Service will give residents advice on easy steps they can take to save on power bills. For those who are interested in solar energy, rebates are available. People using reticulated natural gas will be eligible for a $61.21 rebate. As happens now, pensioners receive a 50 per cent discount for vehicle registration as well as half-price fares on all TransLink services. The Queensland government rate subsidy scheme also provides up to $180 per annum discount. An additional benefit will be provided by banning commissions on CTP insurance and removing the HIH surcharge, thus reducing CTP insurance for all motorists by $24.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129172"></A>
Perhaps for me the greatest potential for positive change in my electorate of Woodridge is the support and practical assistance for mothers of newborn babies. This government has a huge commitment to families and, in particular, to ensure that our mothers and their newborns have the best possible start and whatever support is needed to be able to offer that. I want to thank our Minister for Community Services, the Hon. Karen Struthers, and the Minister for Child Safety, the Hon. Phil Reeves, as well as his predecessor, Margaret Keech, and their staff who have worked long and hard to be able to roll this program out in the Logan, Beenleigh and Gold Coast areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129173"></A>
Following the birth of a baby, a mother will have up to six home visits by a registered nurse over a possible period of three years. However, for more vulnerable mums, this may increase to 15 visits in the first year. Practical, in-home support may be offered such as breast feeding, bonding, parenting, home management, budgeting, meal preparation, life management skills, individual and family counselling, and specialist services. Families will also be referred to youth and mental health services, as well as drug and alcohol counselling if required. The amount of $55 million has been set aside for this program over the next four years, and this has the potential to actually take us to a more proactive position rather than reacting when problems arise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129174"></A>
A number of our non-government services will partner with Child Safety and Health in delivering this program, and the results will have the potential to effect change in a generational way, thus ensuring that families will grow up together nurtured and supported without the heartbreak of separation and child safety intervention. Similarly, there will be intensive support for Aboriginal and Islander families. I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1129176"></A>
Mr Speaker: We are blessed with many exceptional services in the Woodridge electorate and these organisations are strongly supported in this budget, whether they be offering support for the elderly, those with disabilities, Meals on Wheels, domestic and family violence, diversionary services from drug and alcohol, accommodation, counselling services, specialised transport or support for young mothers continuing their education. Funding is also there for family support services for unaccompanied Humanitarian Refugee Minors, Foster and Kinship Care, family intervention services, Court support for children and so much more.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1129177"></A>
Mr Speaker: This budget continues the strong support in jobs growth that has underpinned our escape from the worst of the Global Downturn. Our government’s investment of $17.1 billion in infrastructure protects the jobs of 106,000 Queenslanders, delivering vital infrastructure like roads, schools and hospitals ahead of time. A number of local training initiatives will continue to receive strong support and funding, such as Skilling Queenslanders for Work, Get Set for Work for school leavers, Participate in Prosperity and the innovative Green Army jobs. One new initiative designed to decrease landfill is the environmental levy which will be applied to businesses to improve waste disposal. The funds collected will encourage businesses to invest in recycling technologies. Funding will also go to local councils to improve their waste management and facilities, and any excess funding will help in the acquisition of national parks. General waste for businesses will be charged at $35 per tonne, low-hazard waste at $50 and high-hazard at $150 per tonne. This initiative will provide additional jobs in recycling and other innovative projects. Mr Speaker: While keeping people in jobs and growing our economy is absolutely vital, the heart of our community and the real hope for the future is seen in our schools. And it is here that we have seen through a magnificent partnership between the Federal and State Governments wonderful new facilities such as libraries and resource centres, halls, science and language labs, media rooms and lecture theatres as well as additional new and renovated class rooms. Much has been undertaken through the Federal Government’s Building the Education Revolution for the Future scheme as well as the State Schools of Tomorrow funded through our State Government which has seen the renewal of many areas within our schools including class rooms. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1129178"></A>
Mr Speaker: The pride and joy within my schools is so apparent--our teachers and staff, parents and most of all our students feel valued and have a renewed focus on learning. Through the National Partnership Scheme, additional funds have also been provided to improve numeracy and literacy skills and an increased love for learning. The flexibility in this funding has enabled each school to employ additional staff and fashion their programs to meet the needs of their own student body. We are grateful to the Federal Government for such a significant boost in funding and understand that these projects have kept many breadwinners in employment while the private sector recovers from the Global Economic Downturn. Within our State Budget, many of our local schools will receive additional funding as well as funding for two new kindergartens. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr Speaker: In excess of 316 additional teachers and teacher aides will be employed throughout the state. By 2012, this government will have opened an additional 108 kindergartens, demonstrating a huge commitment to the importance of giving our young children the best start in life. In our primary schools, a state-wide program is underway to place extra emphasis on literacy and numeracy and already positive results are being seen. Every time I visit a primary or high school in the Woodridge electorate, I sense a new focus on learning and I believe the partnership between the Federal and State Governments in setting the direction of education for the future will be of huge benefit to our students. However, while governments may set the direction, nothing happens without the leadership of our principals, and the dedicated teams of teachers, teacher aides, librarians and the many staff who make our education system effective. A three year program of professional development for science teachers is now in its second year and this will see a massive increase in students undertaking various courses in science. This in turn will result in more and more of our students taking up science and engineering courses in our universities which will, in turn, benefit our industry, research and so many fields of endeavour leading to a more prosperous economy and a better standard of living for all. There is a real desire to see so many more young people from the Logan area go on to University to help fill the ranks of our professions. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1129196"></A>
Mr Speaker: The Logan Hospital continues to be upgraded, with the expansion of the Emergency Department as well as additional beds in the Mental Health facility. Those who visit the hospital on a regular basis will be glad to know work will soon commence to reconfigure the car park to increase capacity. Additional funds will be provided for the South East Primary Health Care Network for health promotion, to our Centre Against Sexual Violence as well as funds to Murrigunyah for counselling and support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. Importantly, on a statewide basis, we will see the addition of 1,200 doctors, nurses and allied health workers in this coming year. For those who suffer from chronic pain, there will be an investment of $39.1m for a Persistent Pain Health Service Strategy with 4 pilot sites in Townsville, Nambour, PA and Gold Coast Hospitals. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1129197"></A>
Mr Speaker: The safety of our community is paramount and I wish to commend the exceptional leadership of our senior Police in Logan and the hard-working Police Officers, as well as the many volunteers in our community who assist to keep our community on watch and safe. The operational budget for our Police Service this year will be $1.8b up by $110m and there will be an additional 203 operational Police Officers. $50m will continue the development of the new Police Academy at Wacol, as well as $50m for information and communication technology. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1129198"></A>
Mr Speaker: As the ongoing work continues along the M1, there has been an issue with the development of an industrial site at Pagewood St and Wembley Road beside the Logan Motorway. The intersections of Wembley Rd at Illaweena St and Pagewood St will see improvements costing $2.9m with an agreed contribution of $2m from the developer. Wembley Rd will also have guard rails installed between Illaweena St and Bardon Road at a cost of $1.75m. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1129199"></A>
Mr Speaker: While this budget has been crafted in a time of extreme financial stress right around the world, I am proud of this Labor Government’s focus on the basic needs within our communities. No-one could have escaped news of public servants in Spain having their salaries and wages decreased by 5%, or the harsh measures taken by the Greek Government, or teachers in some of the American states having a reduction of working hours to 4 days per week, with various parts of the USA with unemployment levels in the 40% zone. With so much of the world in financial turmoil, other parts experiencing war and deprivation, some being governed by dictators feathering their own nests, we in Australia are indeed blessed. Yes, we are in a time when we do see many in our communities doing it tough, but help is available. We are a caring society. When we fall ill or have an accident, our hospitals and health professionals are there to give us the best of treatment regardless of our income. There is always more to be done, but I sometimes fear parts of our community have lost perspective in their rush to criticise all levels of government. We have avoided the worst of the economic downturn because of the swift actions taken by both the Federal and State Governments, and when confronted with the options of laying down more rail track and building more locomotives and coal wagons for the mining companies or ensuring we have hospitals, schools, roads and public transport to meet the needs of our growing population, the sale of the assets pales into insignificance. We need to get our priorities right, and while some assets may pass out of government ownership, the huge infrastructure program means our state’s assets are growing all the time. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1129200"></A>
Mr Speaker: I am proud to represent the good people of Woodridge. While many in our community are self-sufficient and many help out in our organisations as volunteers, we do acknowledge the more vulnerable members in our community. Our government has always looked after the more vulnerable in society and our services are staffed by amazing, dedicated workers and volunteers. Woodridge celebrates the diversity of our community, welcomes our refugees, reaches out a helping hand when tragedy strikes and has a community spirit which is the envy of many. This budget, framed in hard times, delivers for the people of Woodridge and I congratulate our Treasurer, Premier and all those who had a hand in fashioning the priorities in this year’s budget. I commend the Bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PJ LAWLOR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southport--ALP) (Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading) (8.27 pm): I am pleased to announce that this year’s state budget will deliver on key health, transport and road projects for the electorate of Southport. There will be $516 million toward the construction of the new Gold Coast University Hospital on the Griffith University site at Parklands--this project will deliver 750 beds; $219 million has been allocated for the Gold Coast Rapid Transit project; $2.63 million for new courtrooms at the Southport Courthouse; $300,000 for intersection upgrades on Southport-Burleigh Road; and more than $200,000 for targeted maintenance and upgrade projects at Southport State High School, Southport Special School, Keebra Park State High School and Musgrave Hill State School.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129209"></A>
This is a responsible budget that builds on the foundations for a strong economic recovery, a strong Queensland and a strong Southport community. It is not only a budget that will create more jobs sooner but a budget that will also provide community infrastructure for Southport including: $3.6 million for the construction of 33 units in Southport at a total cost of $10.8 million and $23,160 for Home and Community Care funding to Multicultural Communities Council Gold Coast Inc.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129211"></A>
My ministerial portfolio is close to my heart. More than 222,000 Queenslanders owe their living to tourism, which is worth $9.2 billion to the Queensland economy and is the state’s third highest export earner. The actual spend on tourism is $19.4 billion. Last year set a high-water mark for tourism. It was the highest figure we had seen for 20 years. This year is the second highest tourism spend we have seen in 20 years, with a total budget of $63.7 million for 2010-11. Last year the Bligh government committed an additional $36 million over three years to steer the tourism industry through the global financial crisis. This budget is about continuing that commitment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135286"></A>
The Bligh government has a plan for tourism. This plan includes not only direct funding to Tourism Queensland of $63.7 million but also funding for a number of initiatives which are managed and sourced from the Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation to the tune of $8 million. While the Tourism Queensland budget of $63.7 million for 2010-11 has moved compared to the previous year of $78.8 million, it must be remembered that the previous year set a high-water mark that had never been seen before.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135289"></A>
This year’s TQ budget movement is due to a range of factors, including $3.5 million in projects which ran over several years which are being finalised, $3 million in a one-off grant in 2009-10 from the proceeds of the sale of Sunlover Holidays, $1.9 million in funding for the convention and incentive bureau grants which has shifted to another department--that is, Queensland Events--and a $2.4 million decrease in cooperative investment income. Some projects are ending, some were one-offs and some have shifted to other departments. If the Leader of the Opposition read the budget correctly and understood the funding of tourism, he would know this. I was amazed at the ignorance and lack of tourism knowledge shown by the opposition leader and the shadow minister, considering they are from Surfers Paradise and Mermaid Beach respectively.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135290"></A>
The Leader of the Opposition continued to make unfounded statements, in particular about flight development. In 2009-10, Queensland secured several domestic flight routes. For example, the Tiger Airways route from Sydney to the Gold Coast added 1,260 weekly seats. I thought the member for Surfers Paradise would at least know about that one. Tiger Airways has also expanded its services on the Melbourne-Sunshine Coast route. Jetstar has increased capacity on its routes from the Gold Coast to Melbourne, Brisbane to Launceston and Melbourne to the Sunshine Coast, Townsville and Brisbane, and flights into Cairns giving tropical North Queensland an additional 3,000 seats per week. This is great news for the people of Cairns. The Bligh government is not only providing direct marketing but also working with airlines to get airlines directly to Cairns. This is worth much more than pure marketing dollars. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135291"></A>
Qantas has increased the number of services on its Brisbane to Sydney and Townsville routes and has increased capacity on its Brisbane to Melbourne and Cairns routes. QantasLink has increased capacity on its Brisbane to Mackay route, providing over 300 seats per week. That is just the domestic flight increases. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135292"></A>
In 2009-10, Queensland has been very fortunate to benefit from a number of international aviation developments. AirAsia X has additional weekly services between Kuala Lumpur and the Gold Coast, providing the region with over 2,600 weekly seats. Again, I thought the member for Surfers Paradise would at least know that one. Malaysia Airlines reinstated two direct services between Kuala Lumpur and Brisbane. Jetstar reinstated the Osaka to Cairns service, with four flights adding over 1,200 seats per week to the region. Pacific Blue commenced a twice-weekly service between Auckland and Cairns. V Australia commenced two weekly services between Phuket and Brisbane. Agreement was also reached with China Southern for three direct flights from Guangzhou to Brisbane later in the year. None of this would have been possible without the Bligh government’s commitment to attracting new flights and new airlines to Queensland and our ongoing support for the tourism industry and protecting tourism jobs.

Mr Speaker, the “Where Else But Queensland” brand has served the industry and this great State well for over a decade. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135303"></A>
But as the world and the tourism industry evolve, it is time for a change in the way we present Queensland to potential visitors, domestically and internationally.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135304"></A>
Over the past 12 months Tourism Queensland has undertaken extensive consultation with key stakeholders and conducted extensive research to understand our consumer segments.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135305"></A>
The result of this will be a new brand that will cement Queensland’s position on the world tourism stage. This new brand will be rolled out globally later this year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135306"></A>
When it’s launched it will be sure to set the bar high in tourism marketing.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135307"></A>
Mr Speaker, the Bligh Government has a plan for the tourism industry--one that is innovative, aggressive and one that will set new standards for the marketing of tourism now and into the future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135308"></A>
It’s a plan that will protect one of the State’s most valuable industries and protect tourism jobs.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135309"></A>
Early in 2011 Tourism Queensland will also announce an exciting new global campaign in a similar vein to the Best Job in the World campaign.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135310"></A>
Planning and details of this global campaign event are underway and will focus on the highly-competitive, high-spending visitor market. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135311"></A>
Mr Speaker, the Bligh Government has a plan for growth and job creation in the tourism sector, “so watch this space”. Our next global campaign has the potential to mirror the Best Job in the World campaign which brought more than $400 million in global publicity for Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135312"></A>
Mr Speaker, in 2010-2011 Tourism Queensland will continue its focus on digital communication.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135313"></A>
In a world where instant global communication is the norm, it’s essential for Tourism Queensland to adapt its marketing strategies to appeal to new audiences. This includes the use of social networking sites like Facebook, and online tourism writers. This approach is at the cutting edge of tourism marketing.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135314"></A>
As part of this funding, Tourism Queensland will allocate funds for the second year of a three-year partnership with Queensland Events to promote tourism activities around major business, sporting and cultural events. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135315"></A>
These activities will leverage off events in a variety of destinations across the state--such as the Gold Coast Airport Marathon which brings in thousands of runners and their families and friends to Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135316"></A>
Mr Speaker, this year’s Budget will be used for interstate and intrastate marketing activities including a range of hard-hitting campaigns aimed at driving holiday bookings to Queensland from interstate travellers, and encouraging Queenslanders to holiday at home.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135317"></A>
Additionally, Tourism Queensland will undertake a range of initiatives aimed at increasing Australians’ knowledge of Queensland experiences and their desire to choose Queensland for their next holiday.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135318"></A>
Mr Speaker, we are planning for international marketing activity which includes an increased focus on attracting overseas visitors from Queensland’s “Big Five” international markets--New Zealand, the UK, Japan, the USA and China.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135319"></A>
The signs are positive for a recovery in global travel in the coming year, Mr Speaker. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135320"></A>
To ensure Queensland is at the forefront of this recovery, we will broaden our investment in our major international markets through a range of activities including: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1135321"></A>
•	cooperative marketing campaigns and publicity</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1135322"></A>
•	working with travel trade; including trade missions to help operators break into international markets</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1135323"></A>
•	working with airlines to encourage new routes and increased capacity into Queensland; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1135324"></A>
•	The cruise market which is one of the fastest growing in the world.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135325"></A>
It’s worth noting that in August this year Brisbane will host Cruise Down Under, a leading conference which will bring delegates from across the Pacific to Brisbane.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135326"></A>
Mr Speaker our plan to strengthen tourism in Queensland is working. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135327"></A>
This can be seen by the commencement later this year of the first direct flights between China and Queensland in more than a decade.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135328"></A>
This will bring up to 3600 Chinese visitors per month into Queensland thanks to a deal brokered by China Southern Airlines, Tourism Queensland, the State Government and Brisbane Airport Corporation.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135329"></A>
The Bligh Government will also continue to leverage off the success of the Best Job in the World campaign, as Ben Southall continues his Queensland Tourism Ambassador role across the globe, sharing his experiences as Caretaker of the Islands of the Great Barrier Reef and inviting the world to visit Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135330"></A>
In addition to the great work that Tourism Queensland will do over the next year, the Tourism Division of the Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation will also undertake a range of activities to support and develop Queensland’s tourism industry.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135331"></A>
These include:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1135332"></A>
•	The Queensland Investment Incentives Scheme (QIIS)--which will support airline route development to maintain current levels of capacity and generate new and improved air access into Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1135333"></A>
•	Airline incentives are a critical part of attracting new airline services to Queensland. Success of this initiative can be seen in the recently announced China Southern flights direct to Brisbane. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1135334"></A>
•	The highly-successful Minor Tourism Infrastructure Grants Program will continue to deliver much-needed roadside infrastructure for the drive tourism market. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1135335"></A>
•	Tourism Projects Pre-feasibility Grants Scheme to help develop priority regional tourism projects identified in the Tourism Opportunity Plans by providing financial assistance to stimulate or accelerate tourism projects.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1135336"></A>
•	And Ecotourism Places Development Grants to support low-impact ecotourism infrastructure on, or adjacent to, protected areas. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135337"></A>
Mr Speaker, under this new environmentally sensitive ecotourism plan, Queensland’s best environmental assets will be put on show to the world and boost visitor numbers to our State’s protected areas.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135338"></A>
Mr Speaker, the fair trading agency within the Department provides some very important functions for consumers and businesses within Queensland--namely consumer protection, reform, compliance and licensing.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135339"></A>
The Bligh Government is committed to protecting Queensland consumers while also reducing red-tape for businesses. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135340"></A>
Over the past two years the Office of Fair Trading has worked with the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) and our interstate counterparts to develop a one-stop-shop fair trading system and a new set of rules to make it easier for businesses and therefore safer for consumers. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135341"></A>
In 2010/11 the Office of Fair Trading will continue to work toward creating a streamlined system and set of rules to help enhance consumer protection at a State and Federal level.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135342"></A>
For example, from 1 July 2010 issues such as consumer credit laws will be handed over to the Commonwealth to ensure a single framework.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135343"></A>
However, importantly, the Bligh Government will continue to monitor the 48 per cent interest cap, protecting the interests of the Queensland community. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135344"></A>
The Office of Fair Trading will continue to work on the new Australian Consumer Law (ACL), which will encompass standards around the safety of products on our shelves, which was previously handled by each of the States under separate pieces of legislation.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135345"></A>
This 2010-2011 budget will continue to support and develop reforms that will make the marketplace fair for consumers and assist business to reduce red tape. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135346"></A>
Mr Speaker, security providers play an important role in ensuring safety and security in the community; which is why anyone working in Queensland’s industry must obtain a licence through the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to ensure they are suitable to do the job and are appropriately trained and qualified.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135347"></A>
I am pleased to announce that funding in this year’s Budget will move to strengthen the licence requirements for Queensland’s 27,000 licensed security providers, as well as new applicants entering the industry.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135348"></A>
The Bligh Government is committed to ensuring only the right people are undertaking this type of work.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135349"></A>
Mr Speaker, 2009-10 has been a busy year for the compliance teams at the Office of Fair Trading, and 2010-11 will be no different.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135350"></A>
Ongoing compliance is all about keeping the marketplace fair and ensuring consumers get what they paid for. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135351"></A>
In 2009-10 nearly 13,000 complaints have been finalised and more than $5.06m has been achieved in redress for consumers.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135352"></A>
Mr Speaker, this is a great outcome for Queenslanders and in this year’s Budget the Bligh Government will continue to fund this important role.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135353"></A>
The Office of Fair Trading will continue to provide licensing, registration and accreditation services throughout Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135354"></A>
The Bligh Government will continue to make sure that consumers have a fair marketplace in Queensland and will make sure we continue to monitor the market place to make sure people comply with the regulations in place.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135355"></A>
Mr Speaker, the Office of Liquor, Gaming and Racing (OLGR) play a key regulatory function for Queenslanders. The Bligh Government is committed to community benefit and protection of these operations for all Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135356"></A>
In 2010-11 the Department will undertake a significant program of work, called the Service Delivery Improvement Program, to improve the way we do business with the liquor and gaming industry and the general community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135357"></A>
In 2010-11 the service delivery improvement program includes:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1135358"></A>
•	the expansion of electronic business initiatives providing greater online access to services across the State. However we will continue to ensure that people who do not have access to online services can still access the traditional paper-based system for a period of time</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1135359"></A>
•	re-engineer internal business processes to reduce duplication of effort and reduce red tape for businesses across the state</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1135360"></A>
•	And continue to re-develop and enhance internal databases.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135361"></A>
2010-11 will see the continuation and expansion of the pilot trial of providing an online service to clients--the community liquor permits for the greater Brisbane area. This initiative will reduce paperwork required for organisers of low risk events such as festivals, fetes and sporting events making the process easier for community organisers.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135362"></A>
Mr Speaker, the Bligh Government has a range of proactive and reactive strategies in assessing compliance in the liquor industry. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135363"></A>
A new OLGR database will allow for the upload and analysis of data being provided centrally by the Queensland Police. Such data includes incidents of:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1135364"></A>
•	violence and glassings in and around licensed premises</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1135365"></A>
•	liquor offences and public order offences that can be related back to a licensed premises.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135366"></A>
This information will be used by OLGR to target strategies to the areas of most risk.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135367"></A>
The Bligh Government will continue to work with licensees and local communities enhancing and extending voluntary participation in the development and management of liquor accords.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135368"></A>
The Bligh Government will continue to fund, monitor and develop policies and initiatives targeting harm minimisation in relation to alcohol and gambling. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135369"></A>
Last year the Bligh Government launched a Parliamentary inquiry into alcohol-fuelled violence. These findings and policy plans for the future will be delivered in 2010/11. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135370"></A>
Mr Speaker, the Bligh Government not only has a plan for hard infrastructure growth and jobs but also a plan for social infrastructure. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135371"></A>
Mr Speaker, it was disappointing today that the Leader of the Opposition did not outline any policies they have in the area of fair trade and social infrastructure. They continue to be void of policy. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135372"></A>
In gaming we are delivering more than $46 million to the community through our community benefit schemes. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135373"></A>
Across the state, these funds pay for sun shades, wheelchair ramps and solar panels on the roof so sporting and community groups can save on their electricity bills.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135374"></A>
Mr Speaker, the Bligh Government is spending around $11 million on initiatives to reduce gambling harm, such as $5.6 million on Gambling Help Services, and $3.3 million on social marketing campaigns.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135375"></A>
In this budget, the Bligh Government will establish the Racing Industry Capital Development Scheme to assist the racing industry with the provision of priority capital works with funding in excess of $80 million over four years.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135376"></A>
The Racing Industry Capital Development Scheme will be funded by a racing industry levy of 50 per cent of the net tax collected from wagering taxation over the four years to 2013-14.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135377"></A>
It is expected that $20 million will be available from the Racing Industry Capital Development Scheme to fund these projects in 2010-11. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135378"></A>
As part of this funding, $300,000 a year for three years will be made available specifically for country race clubs for upgrading their facilities to assist them to meet workplace health and safety requirements. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135379"></A>
This funding stream is targeted to assist small country race clubs that have limited financial options.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135380"></A>
Mr Speaker, the Bligh Government is committed to the future of racing across the State--in the city and in the country. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135381"></A>
The Bligh Government has a plan for the sustainability of racing in this great State now and into the future. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135382"></A>
This is why the Premier and I this week announced the commitment of $15.7 million to secure the “Magic Millions” until 2017. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135383"></A>
In conclusion Mr Speaker, 2010-2011 is shaping up to be a challenging year for the state’s tourism industry as we continue to recover from the effects of the global financial crisis. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135384"></A>
The signs are positive for a brighter 2010-2011. Tourism Queensland and the Bligh Government will continue to be at the forefront of activities to ensure we drive more visitors to Queensland, more dollars into tourism operators’ pockets, and more tourism jobs for Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135385"></A>
The Bligh Government will continue to work to increase consumer confidence and business integrity through the Office of Fair Trading to make sure consumers are warned and protected against those dodgy scammers who deliberately set out to rip people off.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135386"></A>
The Bligh Government will also work to develop the liquor, gaming and racing industries in a socially responsible way to ensure the community benefits from them.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135387"></A>
Mr Speaker, the Bligh Government has a plan for economic recovery and growing jobs for all Queenslanders. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Everton--ALP) (8.33 pm): I wish to speak in support of these bills which contain this year’s state budget. This budget comes at a difficult time for both our state’s economy and many families in the Everton electorate. This year, I have had an increasing number of local residents and businesspeople tell me they are finding it hard to make ends meet. The effects of the global economic downturn are still being felt in Everton, with family budgets being that much tighter this year. I wore out my welcome badgering the Premier about the need to use the budget to help average Queenslanders to make ends meet, but it was worth it. I was very pleased to see the Treasurer announce some important measures to help the hip pockets of Everton residents whose household budgets are getting tight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135390"></A>
The $24 reduction in compulsory third party premiums on the registration of a car will definitely make a difference to these families. This has been scoffed at by some, but there are many in Everton who will not scoff at this saving to their family budgets. I am also pleased the government has acknowledged the financial difficulty of pensioners by increasing the electricity rebate for pensioners and seniors from $190 per year to $216. This comes on top of a range of other rebates for pensioners, including on water charges, car registration and council rates.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135391"></A>
At the same time as helping Queenslanders who are feeling the pinch, this budget advances the government’s plan to help our economy recover from the damage caused by the global financial crisis. We have taken some difficult decisions in the last 12 months, but all Queenslanders are starting to see the benefits of these decisions. Our deficit and debt levels have been massively reduced, and we are on track to return the budget to surplus. By borrowing to build new schools, hospitals, roads and public transport, we are not only providing the infrastructure our growing population needs; we are also keeping Queenslanders in jobs, and there is nothing more important than that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135392"></A>
I am of course also pleased to see the government provide funding for a number of important initiatives in the electorate of Everton. The best local announcement in this budget for Everton residents is the commitment of funding for the new children’s emergency service at the Prince Charles Hospital at Chermside. Construction on this project, which was opposed by the LNP at the last state election, will commence this year. This service, to be completed in 2012, will be fantastic for local families, with world-class emergency care available closer to home. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135393"></A>
There is also good news for several schools in Everton. Overall, the government will spend nearly $1.8 million on various projects at schools in Everton, with classrooms to be modernised at Albany Creek State School, Albany Creek State High School, Everton Park State School, Everton Park State High School and McDowall State School. There are a number of other local announcements--particularly for transport and housing--which I would like to detail further, but I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135398"></A>
The Budget will also provide another $3.4 million to complete the broader upgrade to The Prince Charles Hospital.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135399"></A>
These are both major projects that will deliver even better health services to local families and support local jobs during construction.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

One of this Government’s greatest achievements is the introduction of the prep year of school. For decades, Queensland children were the only ones in the country without a prep year. It was undoubtedly contributing to the poor literacy and numeracy skills of Queensland students. The Government took action to correct this gap and now almost all Queensland children attend a prep year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135408"></A>
The next area for Government action is in pre-prep services. Currently only 30% of Queensland children have access to early childhood education delivered by a qualified teacher, while in other states the figure is 85-90%. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135409"></A>
The Bligh Government has identified this as the next major area for funding in our education system, and has committed that by 2020 all Queensland children will have access to a quality early childhood education.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

This commitment is being backed up by funding in Everton, by funding being allocated for the construction of a new kindergarten at Prince of Peace Lutheran College at Everton Hills. It will open in 2011 and I know the Prince of Peace community is very excited about this new expansion of their offerings.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (8.36 pm): I rise tonight in this chamber to contribute to the debate on the government’s Appropriation Bill 2010. Once again, the people of Queensland and my electorate of Mudgeeraba have been handed yet more proof of this government’s incompetence and inability to manage this great state’s finances, as we are pushed further into debt by the Bligh government. This government has burdened the state with a record $84 billion in debt, which is a debt of $18,000 for every man, woman and child in Queensland. This budget fails to deliver a debt repayment strategy, making it harder for Queensland to regain its once cherished AAA credit rating. What it does reveal is that the Bligh Labor government has added another $9 billion to our debt in just the last 12 months, with no debt repayment strategy, and has delivered four budget deficits in a row.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135436"></A>
There is no reference to the 100,000 new jobs that the Premier promised leading into the last election. The Premier and the Treasurer’s untruths and deceit have continued from where they left off before the last election--hiding the true state of the books and embarking on an asset sale which no one wants. It does not matter what they say now: Queenslanders do not believe a word from this Bligh Labor government, with 69 per cent of Queenslanders dissatisfied, disillusioned and disgusted at the perpetration of this crime imposed on this once great state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135437"></A>
The Treasurer’s claim that debt is going down is stretching the truth. Debt will rise from $42.6 billion in 2008-09 to $51.6 billion in 2009-10 and it is forecast to reach $83.5 billion by 2013-14. Queenslanders today find themselves in an ever increasingly difficult financial position. When we fill up our cars, it costs an extra 9.1c per litre thanks to Bligh’s new tax, car registration continues to rise and toll fees go up, but spending on much needed road infrastructure is postponed, reannounced or rehashed and will continue to not only not meet the needs of South-East Queensland but also ensure that every project which has been postponed will blow out.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135438"></A>
This, unfortunately for Queenslanders, is only the tip of the iceberg. The government’s decision to increase water and electricity prices is now locked in. Every time Queenslanders fill up their cars, turn on the taps and flick on the lights, they are paying more thanks to the incompetence of Bligh and Labor. Since the privatisation of Energex and Ergon Energy by this government, electricity charges have increased by a massive 54 per cent. These are having a direct effect on residents, particularly the elderly in my electorate. I would like to quote from a handwritten letter I received earlier this month from a couple in Worongary aged in their 70s. They said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1135439"></A>
Can you make a complaint to the Premier? Aged and single pensioners are having a struggle! We moved up to QLD for warmer all round weather which is kinder to our bodies. So electricity is way expensive now. Rego! Drivers License! How do we keep on paying our bills and live? Unleaded petrol keeps on rising. Our Ford is a good car but 12 years old! We can not put E10 in our car so we must buy unleaded now!</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135517"></A>
This government is simply drunk on its own power and, instead of making the hard decisions to pay off our record debt, it actually locks in debt increases for every single year. There is no debt repayment strategy at all and the government continues to rely on its federal Labor counterparts, whose idea of economic conservatism means putting a big fat tax on everything that moves. Labor’s super tax on mining will cost jobs and stymie the economic recovery of this state. This Bligh government continues to ignore the will of Queensland residents. Bligh and Labor are still pushing ahead with privatisation to fast track the government’s secret plan to sell off $15 billion in assets as part of the government’s fire sale privatisation agenda. Even though the vast majority of Queenslanders are totally against the fire sale of Queensland assets, this government plans to sell them in a much shorter time frame. You simply cannot trust Labor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135521"></A>
The once proud history of Queensland as the low-tax, lifestyle capital of Australia is now becoming a distant memory. This budget is the result of 12 years of economic decline under Labor government rule. The state government has had 12 years in office to put away money in the good times and protect us from the bad times. This is a government without a plan to pay off our ever-increasing debt and without any future plan. This is a government whose record is one of mismanagement, failure and squandered opportunity. Instead of planning to pay off debt, in the past 12 months this Labor government has increased debt by $9 billion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135522"></A>
Today the Liberal National Party gave the commitment that we would restore Queensland’s AAA credit rating, which will be the No. 1 priority of a LNP government. The LNP will introduce a requirement for an annual state debt repayment strategy to be prepared and updated on a yearly basis. The LNP will ensure that there are new levels of transparency in government to ensure taxpayers are getting real value for money. Every government contract over $500,000 will be published and publicly available for scrutiny. </Hansard-Body>

From a local perspective, residents of Mudgeeraba have once again missed out in this budget as Labor pushes funding to its marginal electorates. The section of the M1 between Nerang and Reedy Creek, which runs through the heart of my electorate and is arguably my most complained about issue, yet again is overlooked for additional funding from both federal and state Labor governments. Gone are the excuses of blaming the Howard coalition government. With wall-to-wall Labor, Bligh is relying on Rudd to fund her infrastructure bill. But only last month we saw that both Rudd and Albanese ignored the Bligh Labor government in the federal budget and took a leaf out of each other’s books in reannouncing the same funding from three years ago. Local Mudgeeraba residents are sick and tired of the spin. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135526"></A>
Residents have been stuck in the Mudgeeraba car park for the past 10 years. Recent traffic figures have been spun yet again by the Bligh government to imply that road traffic has decreased on the M1, when all that has occurred is rat-running on local council roads. What local residents do know is that this government is a dismal failure when planning appropriately for our future. This is a government that is reactive, not proactive. Motorists are paying more to travel on our roads while less is being spent on our roads. While each Queensland motorist is paying $200 more a year, this government has slashed its road spending by one-quarter of one billion dollars in the past 12 months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135527"></A>
That brings me to the most neglected part of my electorate, which is the political football that this government has made of the much awaited, much longed for piece of infrastructure--yes, you all know it--the upgrade of the M1 from Nerang to Worongary. I am well known on the Gold Coast as a fierce campaigner for the upgrade of the M1 and its relevant interchanges, because this is the single biggest complaint I have heard in the electorate of Mudgeeraba and, indeed, much of the Gold Coast. This Labor government has played politics with the M1 for far too long. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135531"></A>
In 2007 I stood on the Gooding Drive roundabout at exit 77, along with my federal colleagues Steven Ciobo and Margaret May, when the federal Minister for Transport, Mark Vaile, announced $455 million of federal funding for the eight-lane upgrade of the M1 from Nerang to Tugun. For years this state government bleated that it could not even start an interchange until it got matching federal funding. To hear the former member state the Rudd federal government was honouring this election commitment is an absolute outright fallacy. Those of us who did lobby Canberra for the funding know it was already allocated in the AusLink mark 2 funding, and it was not an election promise but a budgeted promise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135541"></A>
Even then we had to wait until 2008 before the upgrade of the much-awaited Nielsens Road interchange began, albeit seven years too late and with a budget blow-out of $7 million. We have seen the same $455 million rehashed, rebadged, reinvented and we still have not seen the M1 upgraded. Residents are sick and tired of a government that keeps bleating about spend, spend, spend on infrastructure, whilst I have been lobbying on the side of the road since 2005 for change to this traffic gridlock. The final announcement in December 2008 of $158 million to fast-track the widening of the M1 between Nerang South and Worongary has all been heard before and it signalled the early election in 2009. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135543"></A>
Whilst the Bligh government continues to send out press releases on road funding at a fast pace and seemingly plucking monetary figures out of the air, unfortunately Gold Coast residents are getting used to seeing car accidents on this stretch of the M1. Only recently we had the spectacle of Labor federal and state members turning the sod for the upgrade of the M1 and then a flying visit by the Minister for Main Roads to reannounce the commencement of the construction between Nerang and Worongary. He did not even have the courtesy or the intestinal fortitude to notify the residents of Mudgeeraba and myself that he was sneaking into the area, in order for them to have the opportunity to vent their frustrations personally. Unfortunately, there was not much progress to be seen, even after Main Roads sent notification the week before that contractors would begin changing line markings and placing safety barriers near Nielsens Road from 23 May. Every day I drive the M1 from Carrara to Mudgeeraba and all I see are two 80-kilometre signs covered in black plastic. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135544"></A>
In March 2004 the previous main roads minister, Paul Lucas, first announced funding to widen the motorway to six lanes between Nerang and the Stewart Road intersection. Not surprisingly, this funding was rehashed, rebadged and then reannounced in 2005, twice in 2006, once more in 2007 for good measure, and then again in December 2008 when $158 million was announced by Premier Bligh to fast track the widening of the M1 between Nerang and Worongary. I was not surprised to see that yet again the same amount of money was reannounced in this year’s budget for both the state and federal labor governments. According to the Main Roads website, a builder was appointed in March 2010 for this widening project, 15 months after the announcement of funding to fast track the project. As a result of the delay in commencing this project, how much has the cost of this construction already blown out and will it blow out further over the next two years? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135546"></A>
As I said, the project was first announced in 2004. Now we are only getting a quarter of the funding, a quarter of the distance of road constructed and two fewer lanes, and it will not be finished until 2012. This clearly demonstrates how inept the Bligh Labor government is in its failure to build for our current and future infrastructure needs. Local residents think the Minister for Main Roads and his department need to get out of their air-conditioned offices, travel to the Gold Coast and witness for themselves the traffic chaos west of the M1 every morning and afternoon during peak hour. The department claims the master plan for the upgrade of the Pacific Motorway between Nerang and Tugun is based on traffic forecasts until 2026. One only has to witness what happens in Reedy Creek every morning to know that that is clearly not the case. It is inconceivable that duplicating the overpass bridge was not even incorporated into the plan. We have the new Varsity Lakes rail station on one side, which is tagged as a future transport hub, and then all traffic is reduced to a single lane bridge over the M1 for the next 20 years. Residents from the Kingsmore Estate and The Observatory have no option but to travel north on Old Coach Road and go through the exit 85 interchange to access the M1. If they want to go southbound, they will have to travel across a single lane overpass bridge and through five sets of traffic lights before getting on the M1. If Main Roads were to extend Old Coach Road further south so it joins with Oyster Creek Drive, this would allow Reedy Creek residents another option to access the M1 and significantly reduce the traffic using the exit 85 interchange. This extension is less than 300 metres of bitumen and could possibly take up to 2,000 cars a day off Old Coach Road and Gemvale Road. It is not rocket science. Residents want to see that this upgrade is done properly and is not outdated before it is even finished.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135551"></A>
Today I stand here almost 12 months to the date when my friend Wendy Flett’s daughter, Krista, was tragically killed on the M1 between Nielsens Road and the Elysium Road overpass. Following a constant barrage of continuous pressure from myself, concerned locals and the family, the minister was forced into fast-tracking temporary safety barriers on a small section of the M1 that runs through the electorate. Not only was the minister forced into putting these barriers in, he also had to apologise here in the House to the family for sending a demand for payment letter for damaged guardrails to dead people.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1135553"></A>
Other major roads in the area of Mudgeeraba electorate missed out on vital upgrade funding in this year’s budget. Springbrook Road has had some upgrades following a landslip early in 2009, which forced the closure of the road for some eight weeks. Thankfully Main Roads took the opportunity to bring forward funding in the Road Implementation Plan for shoulder works and resurfacing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142209"></A>
There is additional works on Springbrook Road which include a small upgrade at Old School Road and a more major upgrade relating to the Hinze Dam stage 3 project on the Gold Coast-Springbrook Road. However, these were already funded in last year’s budget. Local residents and the Springbrook school are currently working with me to ensure that we get an upgrade of the road outside the school with enough room for footpaths so that children can walk or ride their bikes safely to school. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142215"></A>
This brings me to RACQ’s worst state road of 2008, the infamous Beechmont Road. Many members would be aware that there have been 17 separate vehicle accidents on Beechmont Road since December 2008, with the latest being a fatality in May 2009. Prior to the election, $2.5 million was announced by the state government to upgrade this road. I am happy to report that this funding will be delivered as part of the Roads Implementation Program. Whilst this amount is well short of the amount needed to undertake proper upgrading, it is an example of how people power can have a positive influence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142218"></A>
I have met with Main Roads and the Better Roads for Beechmont group and the three important sections to be included as part of this upgrade have now been identified. The section of road between Mirani Street and Elimbah Court has now been resurfaced. The promised $2.5 million upgrade from Tarlington Road to Rosins Point was to commence early this year and was already budgeted last year. I am sure that if DERM keep holding up the geotechnical reports it may well be reannounced in next year’s budget as well. Other funding avenues are being sought through the federal government’s Black Spot Program but, unfortunately, the application for this black spot funding has not been successful to date. </Hansard-Body>

Yet again residents living on the notorious Worongary Road will be disgusted to learn that the $1 million Safer Roads Sooner funding which was allocated in 2009-10 and again in 2010-11 for works on the Advancetown-Mudgeeraba Road, known locally as Worongary Road, including shoulder sealing and lighting work, was reannounced again in this year’s budget and is yet to commence. In response to a question on notice the minister appeared open to the suggestion to demain this road and hand it over to the Gold Coast City Council to construct. It stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1142227"></A>
However, the department remains willing to consider an application from council to negotiate taking over responsibility for this road as a local road.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142228"></A>
Obviously this would require a swap of assets and given that the Premier is selling off Queensland’s assets in a fire sale one would have thought that the Labor government would have jumped at the opportunity. I have twice written to the minister requesting Main Roads recommence negotiations with the Gold Coast City Council to demain Worongary Road and have yet to receive a reply. With the traffic increasing by 1,400 cars per day over the past four years, one would hope that the minister is not waiting for yet another tragedy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142229"></A>
It is also not surprising to note that again there is no mention of secondary education for Mudgeeraba in this budget. I have tirelessly campaigned for funding for a feasibility study into the need for a state high school on the western side of the M1. Statistics show that 36 per cent of students living on the western side of the M1 make the trip to the eastern side of the M1 to attend school every day. This view is in stark contrast to the former member’s view who went from highlighting the need for a new state high school in 2001 to categorically stating eight years later that we would not need one for another 20 years. She stated in <Hansard-Italic>

 on 21 June 2001--</Hansard-Body>

Even new high schools, such as the one at Robina, are bursting at the seams. A hinterland seat of 26,000 residents has no state high school. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142232"></A>
Robina State High School has the capacity to cater for up to 941 students and is close to capacity. There are eight feeder primary schools in the district with a total current enrolment of 4,331. I again ask: which high school are these children expected to attend? I call on the Bligh Labor government to commit to a feasibility study for a new high school west of the M1 and provide the documentation which justifies to the residents, the parents and the students that planning for new facilities in a growth corridor such as Mudgeeraba is not required for 20 years. </Hansard-Body>

Local Merrimac and Carrara residents earlier this year were also relieved to find that the government had done yet another backflip on the infamous Gooding Drive roundabout. The failure of drivers to properly navigate the Gooding Drive roundabout was a major issue in the electorate. Having had near misses myself, I was well aware of the problem. It was one of the first issues I raised with the Department of Main Roads. Following this consultation, the Department of Main Roads undertook a traffic count for traffic modelling of possible improvements to the Gooding Drive roundabout. As a result, $400,000 was allocated under the Safer Roads Sooner program in 2009-10. Red and amber lights are currently being installed to operate during peak hours on the southern approach to the intersection on Nerang-Broadbeach Road. Antiskid measures are also being installed.</Hansard-Body>

In the dying days of the 2009 election the Labor state government finally succumbed to people power and matched the LNP’s commitment to underground 800 metres of 110 kilovolt overhead powerlines in Reedy Creek. I recently held a community forum at Reedy Creek where over 250 locals attended to voice their concerns on a number of issues including the powerline option. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142236"></A>
Energex has advised that two options are now going to be available for the residents of Reedy Creek, the first one being the original election commitment of 800 metres underground. A second option is overhead powerlines on the eastern side of the M1, at least 120 metres away from homes. At a recent community reference group meeting on this issue it was overwhelming that residents preferred option 2, which will now save the government money--money which I hope it redirects to the areas at Old Burleigh Town and continues the powerlines on the eastern side of the motorway which their own local member has yet to support.</Hansard-Body>

It was encouraging to see that a number of organisations within the Mudgeeraba electorate will receive funds from the Gambling Community Benefit Fund this year. These widely varied organisations do a tremendous job for the community in providing a number of different facilities and services. All of this funding is vital to the ongoing work that these organisations take part in. I congratulate them on their hard work and will continue to work with them to help get as much funding as available allocated to them for the great community facilities and services they provide to the residents of Mudgeeraba and the wider Gold Coast community.</Hansard-Body>

Yet again, after 12 years of Labor the residents have been ignored by the Bligh government. For eight years as a marginal Labor seat the electorate of Mudgeeraba was neglected. The deceit perpetrated on the citizens of Queensland by successive Beattie-Bligh governments will now cost this great state a burden of debt. But, unfortunately, it is not a burden that the government alone has to carry, it has extended this burden to every single Queensland mother, father and child.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr CRANDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Coomera--LNP) (8.55 pm): The 2010 Bligh Labor budget has given very little that is new to the state seat of Coomera apart from talking about planning for a new ambulance station. If the six years it took to build the new Nerang Fire Station in the Gaven electorate is anything to go by, we might see the Coomera Ambulance Station opened sometime in 2016. The old story of reannouncing things that are already underway is there. The TAFE college and the primary school are testament to that as are the funds allocated for Ormeau Woods State High School. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142243"></A>
All of those projects are absolutely essential for a region that is growing at the pace the Coomera area in particular is. What is needed though is a serious commitment from this government to big building projects in the area, not just for the growth in the region but for another very important reason. The building industry on the Gold Coast is in dire straits. We need certainty regarding investments on the northern Gold Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142244"></A>
I am talking now about the Coomera town centre. This is a development that could employ many hundreds if not thousands of Gold Coast workers in the construction phase which would be for around two years. We need a commitment from this government to ensure this development goes forward. We need funding commitments for exit 54 to give the developers certainty that their investment is viable. This budget provides nothing to give that certainty. This government talks about infrastructure investment and says supporting jobs is a top priority. It appears that is not the case for the northern Gold Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142245"></A>
Here is an opportunity for this government to give the building industry a boost in the northern Gold Coast region, but it is an opportunity lost. If this government committed its share of the funds to duplicate the overpass at exit 54 and the other works that need to be done, it would give the developers of the Coomera town centre commercial and retail precinct far more certainty, resulting in a boost for the building industry at a time when it is desperately needed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142246"></A>
When we talk about the Coomera town centre we are not just talking about retail shops. Of course there are shops a plenty. I am told a principal tenant is Myer as well as large supermarkets and other department stores. This is the centrepiece of a town that will incorporate a large commercial precinct as well as community facilities being planned by the Gold Coast City Council. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142247"></A>
As well we have areas set aside for high-density living and traditional residential development. I am told the total area is twice the size of the Brisbane CBD. It is the equivalent of Robina town centre or if members are not familiar with Robina perhaps they know Southport. This is the third and last of the areas on the Gold Coast regarded as the principal business areas. This one is in the heart of the Coomera electorate--the most northerly electorate on the Gold Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142249"></A>
This budget delivers additional funding to fast-track the rail line to Springfield and deliver the rail line two years early. This is to provide a rail link for 18,000 residents. It is a commendable thought to provide this rail link. Some $646 million has been allocated to deliver this rail link. That is on top of $400 million already committed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142285"></A>
Let me put this in perspective. This government is spending $646 million to build a 10-kilometre extension to service 18,000 residents in addition to $400 million already spent. The Treasurer must know the northern Gold Coast area will have an additional 18,000 residents in the next 18 months--that is, an additional 18,000 residents by December 2011. What is this government doing about increasing trains on the Gold Coast line to accommodate these additional residents? Absolutely nothing! We have the ‘Bombay Express’ that is just going to get worse. So the government plans to build the 10-kilometre rail link to Springfield for $646 million more announced by the Premier in 2013 to accommodate 18,000 residents, although it is interesting to note the Premier only says ‘could’ be opened in 2013. There are no guarantees there. On the other hand, the transport minister in her press release says that the line ‘would’ be open by 2013. This is an example of the Premier and the minister being out of step yet again--a bit like that little matter last year about Queensland Rail not being for sale and then we heard, ‘Oh, okay, it’s for sale.’ Whatever the case, by 2013 we will have something like 30,000 new residents who will not be properly catered for by public transport in the northern Gold Coast region. When will we have some respite? At the very earliest 2017--that is, if all the ducks line up and we get a new under Brisbane River rail link, and by then we will have something like an additional 48,000 new residents in the Coomera area.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142293"></A>
I turn now to the issue of bus transport. There are other transport imperatives in the Coomera electorate. Our bus service is in dire need of an upgrade. Route 10 is too long for one bus route and does not achieve desired outcomes. The planning for the northern area needs to be fast-tracked to provide a better service for this fast growing region. I have spoken to TransLink on numerous occasions but with no positive outcomes at this point. I am told budget constraints mean there is nothing on the horizon for a revamp of services--a revamp that is desperately needed. If the Gold Coast gets the Commonwealth Games in 2018 and the tunnel is delayed, we will be up the creek without a paddle. The Gold Coast rail line, as well as the bus services, simply will not cope.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142300"></A>
I mentioned earlier that the Premier and the Minister for Transport were out of step with their press releases--the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. The same could be said for the Premier and the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning. The canelands area in the northern part of my electorate is a case in point where the government is just throwing out comments about things with no substance. The Premier recently put out a press release about ‘green wedges’. She then referred to them again in another way in this place on Tuesday of this week. On the other hand, the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning does not know anything about it as evidenced by comments from an ABC Radio commentator and <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 journalist who cannot get any comments out of the minister which have not already been espoused by the Premier. He has nothing to say because he knows nothing more than the Premier has announced. This is a major area in my electorate. There has been a press release put out by this Premier and there is nothing to be added by the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning. It is the same old story: it does not matter what they say now; they are not even singing from the same song sheet. We cannot believe a word from Bligh and Labor given their track record of untruths and excuses.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142306"></A>
I have been in this role for just a short while, but in that time I have gotten a very real sense of the frustration out there in the community. In the electorate of Coomera there are so many diverse needs--some big issues and some not so big, but very few of them are being resolved by this inept government that has plunged this great state into huge debt through inappropriate spending. Where is the debt repayment strategy? The Treasurer’s claims that debt is going down are just plain wrong. Debt will rise year on year from $42.6 billion to $51.6 billion and is forecast to reach $83.5 billion by 2013-14.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142308"></A>
Queenslanders are facing ever-increasing cost of living expenses--rego and petrol costs, electricity, water, tolls. Every time Queenslanders turn around, they are paying more thanks to Bligh and Labor. The untruths are compounded by the suppression of reports. Evidence is the transport minister’s suppression of the Q1 passenger load survey due out weeks and weeks ago. In past years the Q1 survey has been out religiously in the early part of May, and here we are in the middle of June and no Q1 passenger load survey. What is the minister hiding? Where is the current TransLink Tracker? Again, that is weeks overdue. Bligh and Labor are still going ahead with privatisation. They still will not listen to Queenslanders who oppose these asset sales. As the Leader of the Opposition said in his speech--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1142314"></A>
Queenslanders have a choice between the LNP, which has a plan to reduce the cost of living; or Premier Bligh and Labor, who believe in higher fuel prices, higher electricity prices, higher water charges, higher council rates and Labor’s higher road charges.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1142315"></A>
And all of the spin that goes along with it. The right choice is obvious. The LNP in government is the only way this great state of Queensland will ever be brought back to prosperity. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (9.05 pm): I rise to speak to the 2010-11 budget. I have the privilege of representing a very dynamic electorate consisting of people who only expect to be treated fairly. I am very fortunate to have three ladies who work in my electorate office--Trish, Wendy and Floss--who also join with me in the privilege of working with my community. On behalf of the people of Gladstone I welcome a small number of initiatives in the budget.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142319"></A>
The Police and Emergency Services portfolio has allocated $1 million of approximately $3 million for a new Calliope Police Station. With the growth in my electorate, that is very necessary and very welcome. The current small station, whilst not old, does not allow itself to be extended and the vacant block of land beside the current police station lends itself very well to a new stand-alone police station, allowing for growth, off-street parking and safety. Additionally in this budget there is a very small planning amount--some $300,000 of $2.4 million--for a new Gladstone Ambulance Station. Again, that is an incredibly important piece of infrastructure. We also need in that same portfolio a home for the Gladstone Water Police. The growth in port traffic now and in the future requires that it has a base from which to work.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142322"></A>
In Education an investment has been announced in the Toolooa State High School of $640,000 and completion of the Clinton State School early learning and care site with an embedded kindergarten and also a preschool at Kin Kora. I always feel that Education plans reasonably well because it has a good growth strategy, and it will need that in my electorate. There has certainly been a lot of concern about a high school at Calliope. However, I am confident that the minister is keeping abreast of that growth. Having said that, it has always been my intention to be as measured in my comments in this place as is possible. But this budget gives rise to my sense of frustration and I believe particularly the Premier and several other ministers’ hypocrisy. They have misled my electorate in that they have come up and talked about jobs growth, they have talked about LNG and they have talked about the need for infrastructure and how that infrastructure will be provided and yet it is not in the budget.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148981"></A>
The stuff that is necessary for an expanding community, other than those things that I have talked about, are just not there and the frustration in my community is palpable. There have been interjections on other speakers about, ‘You object to debt, but you want money for infrastructure.’ That is not an unfair comment. However, the people in my electorate--and this has come back to me on numerous occasions through the media, through comments to me in letters and verbally--know that they contribute significantly to state and federal coffers and they want a fair share back. They want the infrastructure that is necessary. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148982"></A>
The one area that is most commented on in my electorate is health. There appears to be zero in the budget for growth at the Gladstone Hospital. There is money for the finalisation of the co-location of oral health, mental health and community health. That allocation has been in at least four budgets and I know that the oral health building is being constructed as we speak. But there appears to be nothing allocated to grow services. Gladstone Hospital needs a birthing centre. Gladstone has a significant number of births. It is a young community. There is an influx of people of child-rearing age who come with the industry that is coming to Gladstone. There needs to be better birthing facilities. The Mater Hospital and the Gladstone Hospital provide a wonderful service, but so many mums have to go to Rockhampton or Brisbane and it is not fair. It is dislocating, especially if the birth appears to be a reasonably normal birth.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148985"></A>
We still have people having to travel for renal dialysis. I get told that Gladstone cannot have renal dialysis because there are no specialists. But members will get up in this chamber and say, ‘A new renal facility for such and such a hospital.’ Gladstone wants a renal facility. Gladstone also needs oncology services so that patients who are getting treatment do not have to travel. Gladstone’s bulk-billing eye specialist has just ceased operating and there is a need for another public eye specialist. Many times in this place I hear, ‘There’s a shortage of specialists.’ But other hospitals manage to get them. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mrs Sullivan:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Because that’s where the doctors have to be.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148987"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will get to that point in just a moment. Recently, I had constituents in my office who have been diagnosed as needing certain operations. They have asked the treating physician whether the operation can be done in Gladstone. They have been told yes, but that the politics of the situation means that they have to be referred to Rockhampton or Brisbane. If we have doctors in the hospital with the skill set and they are not allowed to use those skills, they will leave. Then I will have the health minister or someone else stand here, as the member who interjected has said, and say, ‘The doctors go where they want to go.’ They go where they can use their skills and if they are in our hospital and artificially they are not allowed to use those skills they will go.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148988"></A>
We will not have the specialists, we will not have the doctors--whether they be surgeons, anaesthetists or anything else--because the decision makers of Queensland Health in Rockhampton, and perhaps in Brisbane, are artificially reducing those doctors’ ability to exercise their skills so that they go elsewhere. That will bring about a reduction in services artificially. The same thing was done with Gladstone’s WorkCover office. A number of major projects had their WorkCover claims sent to Rockhampton or Brisbane. Only a few months later it was stated that there was insufficient work in the office to keep the office open. It was set up to fail. That is what is happening at the Gladstone Hospital. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148989"></A>
My community and the health workers who are there deserve better. I would like to commend Shauna Taylor. She is the medical superintendent replacement for Ian Mottarelly. Ian was there for over 20 years. Shauna has taken his place. She is a wonderful person who has shown a commitment to Gladstone. But I fear for how long she will stay. I have not spoken to her, but she appears to be frustrated in her attempts to get additional facilities in Gladstone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148992"></A>
Gladstone needs mental health facilities. We have families who are torn apart. They want services for their young people but, because Gladstone does not have secure mental health facilities, those people are sent either to Rockhampton--if there is room--or elsewhere, or they are treated in the community. Those people suffer, as do their families. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148993"></A>
I know some of the budget votes are done by statistical division and it is very difficult to tease out where the money is allocated. I make that caveat to these statements. But there appears to be no line item in the budget for the Gladstone TAFE. The Minister for Infrastructure and Planning came to Gladstone--and I thank him for the meeting that we had at the university--as did the member for Yeerongpilly. The minister and the parliamentary secretary heard about the training needs. I remember at the meeting mentioning that there had been an announcement that teaching positions at the TAFE in my district were being reduced. The minister was rightly surprised by that announcement. There is no money in this budget for TAFE that I can see as a line item.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148995"></A>
Given the level of skills that are needed, the skills shortage that has been heightened, the people in the region who will need training--or should get training--the need for apprentices and the need for traineeships, there should have been a significant allocation for training in the Gladstone electorate. I put on the public record that Central Queensland University has indicated a desire to discuss the amalgamation of the university and the TAFE college. If that will result in better training outcomes, all power to them. But fundamentally there is insufficient expenditure in the electorate with the amount of industry and industrial development that is proposed for the region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148997"></A>
As I said, the Premier and several ministers trot through the electorate regularly talking up jobs, talking up development and talking up the importance of LNG. If the government is going to have all of that, it has to have the support services. There is $64.9 million for vocational education and training but, again, it is not broken down into which parts of that statistical division will receive the money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148998"></A>
I commend the Minister for Disability Services. I have spoken with her on a number of occasions in relation to the need for services in my electorate, including independent living facilities. I know that she sees that need and understands that need. But it is something that is required urgently. I also commend the Minister for Child Safety, who appears to have a genuine heart for his portfolio. My electorate has a lot of young people who work shiftwork and there is some job insecurity. That places a huge stress on families, and when you are under stress often the people who you take it out on are the people you love the most. So my electorate needs those family support services--not necessarily post the problem arising but early intervention support to ensure that families can survive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148999"></A>
Affordable housing is a big issue. I know that the member for Burdekin made a comment about housing that was not required in a location in her electorate. Can I say to the minister that I will have it. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Bring it in. Like many electorates, my electorate has a mix of tenants. Whether they are Aboriginal people, whether they are European-born people or whether they are Asian-born people, overwhelmingly they are excellent tenants. Every now and again you will get someone who is the tenant or the neighbour from hell, but I have been to housing commission gardening awards, which is a great initiative. They are wonderful. The tenants are proud. They look after their facilities. They do credit to the area that they live in. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155388"></A>
We desperately need more affordable housing. In the last released information, we are the region in Queensland that has had the highest increase in housing prices. When the next wave of residents comes to the region for the LNG industry, or whatever industry develops first, it is the people who can least afford it who are affected the most. It is that end of the market on fixed or low incomes or single-income families who struggle because everything goes up. The cost of renting privately goes up. It is very difficult to sit in the office or go out into the community and have families who have invested in our community for 10 years come up and say, ‘I have come to say goodbye, Liz.’ When I ask why they are going they tell me that they are moving because they cannot afford to stay. It is wrong. So bring on the affordable housing because we will have as much as the government can give us. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155391"></A>
Spending on roads infrastructure is a great mix of funding by local, state and federal governments. The federal government’s spending on the Bruce Highway is lamentable. The Bruce Highway that goes through my electorate is in dire need of an upgrade. The Roads Implementation Program is well named--RIP--because it appears that there is little funding for the roads in my electorate in the forward estimates. As far as roads are concerned, the one road that is complained about the most is the Kin Kora roundabout, the intersection between Philip Street and the Dawson Highway. There needs to be a significant upgrade there. It will be expensive but it is necessary, not only for commuter safety but also for the free flow of traffic and to release the bottleneck that is there every morning and every afternoon. I note that there is money in the budget for the Calliope Range deviation. That is an ongoing project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155392"></A>
I was asked to put on the public record the disappointment of the Gladstone Regional Council and the Gladstone Airport Board that in this year’s budget there were funds of some millions of dollars for regional airports--not the remote airports but regional ones--but when that council asked for assistance with the upgrade of the Gladstone Airport due to a number of factors--the pavement had deteriorated over time; there was an increase in traffic and a projected significant increase in traffic with the industrial development; and there was a need to improve passenger safety and screening--the response from this government was to sell the airport. That was not the response of the current transport minister; it was a former transport minister. They certainly are smarting, as are many, that some electorates can get help with airports and some cannot. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155393"></A>
Again I put on the record the overwhelming objection in my electorate to the sale of Queensland coal rail freight. Again we will hear the interjections about asking for infrastructure dollars but not wanting to sell the infrastructure. Overwhelmingly the people say that it is not necessary. We generate a lot of income in my electorate. My constituents want a fair share back. Many people are struggling with the cost of living. Members on the non-government side have raised issues like licence fee increases, electricity increases and the like. All of those bite people on fixed or low incomes, single-income families and pensioners--those people who can ill afford it. It is important that rises are kept to a minimum and that any rises can be justified in a clear way and to the understanding of those involved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155394"></A>
I represent a wonderful electorate of people who just want a fair go. Some of them are struggling. I have some documents here that one of my constituents has asked me to table.

I again put on the record my community’s thanks to those ministers who have seen the need in the electorate and addressed that need. Overwhelmingly there is a huge amount of disappointment in the budget because it has not addressed the cost and impact of the development that will occur in the area, particularly with LNG, and has not allocated funds to prepare infrastructure as growth occurs. We do not want to play catch-up. We want to be ready for the increase in population. My community deserves no less. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms JOHNSTONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Townsville--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.23 pm): I am pleased to participate in the debate on the Appropriation Bill 2010. This is a budget that will keep people working and will build the infrastructure that will drive our economy into the future. It is a budget that delivers on the Bligh government’s promise to create more jobs sooner. This is also a budget that provides relief for those who need it the most. I agree with the former speaker, the member for Gladstone, about the need for more affordable housing. This budget delivers on that and it also provides recurrent moneys to community organisations that work tirelessly in our communities supporting people who are doing it tough. This budget delivers for those people, too, because it is enabling those agencies to provide quality care to the people who need it the most. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155399"></A>
Townsville is currently a construction zone largely thanks to the state government. This budget provides the funding for several major announcements made during my first year in office and also contains the funding for several new initiatives. This financial year our massive infrastructure building program will continue to provide thousands of locals with work so that they can maintain their family’s living standards. Major funding for projects such as the $110 million Townsville Marine Precinct will create local jobs and support the economic recovery. The marine precinct alone will protect 500 current marine industry jobs and create 400 jobs during the construction phase. This project also offers an important opportunity to reshape the upstream use of the Ross River with a focus on new boating and recreational facilities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155400"></A>
There has been a long-standing argument in Townsville--and I have spoken about this many times in this place--about the need for recreational boating facilities. One of the problems has been that the geography and the topography of Townsville means that there are only a couple of spots where we could build new infrastructure for boat ramps and car parks. One of them was on very valuable port land. With the marine precinct announcement, with the upstream users being moved into the new facility at the port, that land has been made available. It is a very valuable piece of land. The Bligh government is committing funding to recreational services that will maintain our lifestyle. It is putting quality land on the table not for high-rise development, not for units, but for boats and trailers so that people in Townsville can go about their day, having a good career, having a good quality of life and still be able to get out on the water on the weekend with their families which is what we in the north love to do. The new boating facilities will be good for boaties but they will also be good for the Townsville economy because better boating facilities means more boats and that means more jobs in the boating equipment, fishing tackle and bait supply industries. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1155401"></A>
This budget provides large capital funding for projects such as $35 million for the Townsville City Council to upgrade wastewater facilities--again, another example of how this government is supporting our local councils to put the infrastructure in so that the growth can happen at a sustainable rate in places like Townsville. The existing Flinders Street redevelopment receives $13.23 million in this budget. This is a project that will revitalise the city heart and increase Townsville’s ability to attract and retain the visitors, workers and professionals that are vital to maintaining growth in our city. Townsville will also benefit from $53.5 million that Queensland Rail is spending on the fabrication of 37 new coal wagons. One hundred of these wagons are being built by UGL in Townsville. Investments like this add strength to our manufacturing sector and provide very important jobs for the manufacturing workers in these engineering workshops. </Hansard-Body>

$1.91 million has been budgeted for General Learning Area Renewal across six schools in the Townsville Electorate and some $41,000 will be spent on targeted maintenance at Bwgcolman Community School, Pimlico State High School and Railway Estate State School. Additionally, $1.7 million has been made available to fund the pre-prep facility at Bwgcolman Community School on Palm Island.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Strong local communities require good sport and recreation facilities and I was happy to see the budget include a significant commitment to the Townsville Sports Reserve which includes $850,000 to replace the athletics track, $505,000 to complete the construction of new change rooms and $100,000 to commence the grandstand replacement.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The region would also receive funding for $8.46 million towards the restoration of damage cause by Queensland monsoonal flooding and tropical cyclones Charlotte and Ellie in 2009. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1155410"></A>
These weather events do a great deal of damage to roads and other infrastructure, but precious little to the spirit and resilience of the Queensland people.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1155411"></A>
This funding will provide very welcome grants and subsidise loans to small businesses and primary producers who were affected by these catastrophic events.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1155412"></A>
This budget is also a caring budget with funding for many important services and organisations in the Townsville community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1155413"></A>
There is $4.66 million in 2010-11 to provide additional funding for the Office of the Adult Guardian to address increased demand for restrictive practice and guardianship services. The funding will increase the capacity of services provided to vulnerable adults with impaired decision making capacity. This funding will be spent across the state including expanding the Townsville office of the Adult Guardian.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1155414"></A>
The budget contains $1.29 million to manage and operate the Reverend Charles Diversionary Centre which provides a safe alternative to police custody for intoxicated individuals.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1155415"></A>
This Government provides ongoing funding for those vital organisations in the community that deal with issues such as homelessness, domestic violence and family support and I am particularly pleased to see in the budget $452,000 to provide residential accommodation as part of the Younger People in Residential Aged Care initiative.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The Bligh Government aims to provide relief to assist Townsville people with their day to day living expenses. New and increased electricity concessions will provide some financial relief for families and individuals who may be currently doing it tough.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1155418"></A>
I was particularly pleased about the new announcement for “Medical Cooling and Heating Electricity Concession” which will help low income Queenslanders with medical conditions who will be eligible to apply for $216.21 per annum to assist with their electricity bills.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I would like to use this opportunity to remind my constituents of the Home Energy Emergency Assistance Scheme. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1155421"></A>
This scheme provides up to $720 in assistance for customers experiencing a crisis or unforeseen emergency. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1155422"></A>
This scheme is not widely known about but people should be made aware of it as it could really make all the difference in the event that illness or tragedy strikes. People who may feel that they could be eligible for this assistance should contact their energy provider or alternatively they can contact my office for help.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Townsville has a strong involvement in the QIADP program which is aimed at reducing alcohol abuse and associated crime by addressing the addictions that often cause criminal or repeated anti-social behaviour.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1155424"></A>
The Townsville community is grappling with a serious public intoxication problem and if this can be addressed with younger people, then over time this will reduce the number of older adults whose lives are destroyed through alcohol addiction and abuse.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1155425"></A>
That is why I was very pleased to see the $800,000 in the 2010-11 budget for the continuation of the Queensland Indigenous Alcohol Diversion Program, which is a court-based treatment program for Indigenous defendants who are alcohol dependent, with a total State Government contribution of $3.72 million. The aim of the program is to reduce alcohol abuse and associated crime by addressing the addictions causing the offending behaviour.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1155426"></A>
This budget will support the government commitment to employment and protecting and creating jobs. The ongoing infrastructure building programs in Townsville are keeping many Townsville workers in jobs and protecting the standard of living of many Townsville families.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1155427"></A>
Jobs figures released just today show Queensland again generated jobs this month--for the tenth month in a row. 8800 new jobs--the most of any state. 8200 of them full time jobs.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1155428"></A>
Some of these workers will be young people wanting to purchase their first home and this budget contains good news for them. We have introduced a $4,000 First Home Owners Boost for new homes, on top of the $7,000 grant already provided by the State Government--that means $11,000 for first home buyers in Townsville. This compares very favourably to the $7,000 for new home buyers in South East Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1155429"></A>
What a great way to encourage decentralisation and to encourage the many southerners pouring over the Queensland border to continue on past Brisbane and the Gold Coast and to establish themselves in the regions.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1155430"></A>
Mr Speaker, health is a fundamental issue for families and I welcome the huge $9.99 billion expenditure on the health budget. This includes $5.5 million this financial year for the cochlear ear program. It is hard to imagine a more life changing health initiative than giving hearing to the profoundly deaf and children suffering from severe hearing loss.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1155431"></A>
The budget also contains a strong funding injection for the Townsville Hospital. The commitment to provide 100 additional beds as well as to expand the neo-natal intensive care unit to provide 50 cots to care for sick babies will, I am sure, be welcomed right across North Queensland.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1155432"></A>
There are also the always welcome and needed funds for improving our roads in Townsville. Of particular mention is the $404,000 for the installation of traffic signals at the Dalrymple Road and O’Keefe Court intersection.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1155433"></A>
The $150,000 for the provision of passenger set-down facilities at Hermit Park State School is particularly welcome. I know that Clayton and the school community at Hermit Park have been campaigning for a long time for this initiative.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1155434"></A>
Mr Speaker, this is a fiscally responsible budget. As I have said already, this is a budget that will keep people in jobs, provide the infrastructure that a growing city like Townsville needs to keep up with growth, and it is a budget which continues to support and provide relief for those in difficult times. Mr Speaker, I commend the budget and I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. SJ HINCHLIFFE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Infrastructure and Planning) (9.28 pm): It is with great pleasure that I rise to support the appropriation bills and the Revenue Legislation Amendment Bill before the House. Firstly, I would like to congratulate the Treasurer on his third state budget. Last year we promised Queenslanders a strong economic plan for the future and this year’s budget delivers on that promise with lower deficits, lower debt, high growth and more jobs. But importantly we have also ensured that it provides more services, core Labor services, in areas such as education, health and disability services. I am confident, and Queenslanders should be confident, about the strength this budget will give our great state and the job security it will provide. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162115"></A>
The Australian Labor Party has a proven track record of keeping this great state strong in adverse economic times. During the 1930s, beset by challenging economic conditions, the then Premier, William Forgan Smith, led a Labor government which made Queensland the envy of a struggling nation. Seventy-five years ago he commissioned the Story Bridge, Somerset Dam and Mackay’s artificial harbour and also announced that the state government would build a new University of Queensland campus at St Lucia. Of his infrastructure building program, Forgan Smith said, ‘In addition to creating assets of value to the community, the utilisation of funds for these purposes relieves unemployment in a most effective manner.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162117"></A>
Like the Forgan Smith government, the Bligh government understands that planning for growth and jobs needs a commitment to a strong capital works program. Our plan was to again hand down the nation’s biggest building program, and we stuck to that plan--with a $17.1 billion infrastructure spend to protect 106,000 Queensland jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162118"></A>
Speaking of jobs, I should note for the benefit of the House that, as of last month, the Coordinator-General had been charged with assessing 37 projects with a potential total capital investment of more than $110.9 billion and more than 72,000 jobs--an important role the Leader of the Opposition apparently cannot understand. During his budget reply, the Leader of the Opposition stated that the Coordinator-General was limited in his capacities because of his position with the Department of Infrastructure and Planning.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162119"></A>
In the last financial year alone, the Coordinator-General declared nine more projects of state significance. These developments have the capacity to generate more than $26 billion in capital expenditure and 18,500 jobs. When the facts are made clear, the member for Surfers Paradise’s ramblings simply emphasise his lack of leadership and understanding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162120"></A>
I would like to dissect the LNP’s alternative budget and policies now, but sadly the opposition have not provided any clear direction on how they intend to manage the state. They have no policies--except for harking back to the last election, when they promised to slash our building program and make 12,000 Queenslanders ‘de-necessary’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162121"></A>
One alarming aspect of the opposition leader’s speech that sent shivers down my spine was the suggestion that under a Liberal-National government the role of the Coordinator-General would be changed to ‘report’--I emphasise the word ‘report’--to the Premier. The Coordinator-General position is established as an independent statutory role. Do the LNP want to destroy this independence? Do they want to manipulate and mutate that important role so the dysfunctional party opposite can then use the Coordinator-General as their ‘play thing’?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162122"></A>
I would prefer to focus on the positive aspects of the Bligh government’s plan. Across Queensland, this budget represents a boost to front-line personnel, delivering an additional 1,200 clinical health staff, 75 ambos, 203 police officers, 24 firefighters, 316 teachers and teacher aides and 35 child safety officers. I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>

For the people of the electorate of Stafford, we will invest millions of dollars improving community infrastructure, community safety, public transport, roads, health, education, and energy and water delivery.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162125"></A>
Specifically, we have allocated:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162126"></A>
$115.13 million will continue to make our contribution to the delivery of the next stage of construction on the Airport Link project--at $4.8 billion it’s Australia’s largest infrastructure project and will create up to 10,000 jobs.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162127"></A>
As much as possible we’re using local contractors and suppliers to support local jobs.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162128"></A>
Our investment in transport and roads will continue with $11 million dedicated to the concept stage of the Northern Busway--Kedron to Chermside project, at a total estimated cost of $20 million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162129"></A>
Local emergency services will benefit from a $2.2 million refurbishment of the Chermside ambulance station--the busiest ambulance station in the whole state, with a great crew and an enthusiastic LAC. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162130"></A>
We’re committed to making our great local schools even better with more than $700,000 for General Learning Area Renewal at Stafford State School. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162131"></A>
$1.2 million will be spent to complete construction of twelve, one-bedroom apartments in Stafford at a total project cost of $2.16 million--again a great boost to local employment. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162132"></A>
$780,000 will go towards accommodation and support services for women and children escaping domestic and family violence. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Labor has stared down the global recession by putting in place an economic plan and having the courage to implement it--without losing sight of the issues that matter most to Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162135"></A>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162136"></A>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162137"></A>
And we’re still going green: slashing power bills by up to one third through the solar rebate program, to ease the squeeze on Queensland families.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mrs ATTWOOD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Ommaney--ALP) (9.33 pm): After hearing the honourable the Treasurer deliver his budget in the House this week, I can only emphasise the importance of having a Labor government in power during these tough times--a government that understands that when times are tough every dollar counts. All Queenslanders are still feeling the effects of the global financial crisis in one way or another. So it is appropriate that the government acts to lighten the load on families and pensioners through a number of measures in the budget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162141"></A>
The electricity rebate for pensioners and seniors will be increased to $216.21 per annum. The Electricity Life Support Concession Scheme will be increased to $440.30 per annum for consumers using oxygen concentrators and $294.85 per annum for consumers using home kidney dialysis machines. The Home Energy Emergency Assistance Scheme will be increased up to $720 in assistance for customers experiencing a crisis or unforeseen emergency. The reticulated natural gas rebate will increase to $61.21 and the new concession will be for people whose medical condition means they need more electricity. The medical cooling and heating electricity concession will be increased to $216.21. There will be solar hot water rebates for installing a new system or heat pump, a rebate of 44c per kilowatt hour for all surplus electricity fed back into the grid, continuation of the ClimateSmart Home Service to help people save on their power bills and reductions in compulsory third party insurance, CTP. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162144"></A>
While the state government is putting money back into the pockets of families and pensioners, the Brisbane City Council slogs homeowners with another 5.04 per cent rate rise. It is sad to note that the LNP councillor for Jamboree’s first priority is to get the council to fund the relocation of his ward office to the Mount Ommaney shopping centre over the community’s need for a community centre at Mount Ommaney--which his administration promised over six years ago. The council administration is also spending thousands of dollars to refit and reorganise the council chamber to ensure that the former LNP councillor for Tennyson will not be seated near their group. I hope this unnecessary spending is not going to mean that the community centre’s promised funding will again be compromised.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162145"></A>
Council also claims full credit for funding bus shelters at Centenary State High School when $40,000 will be provided by the state government--just as their local councillor claimed full credit for the Jindalee bikeway bridge when the state government funded over half of the cost. Regardless of this, a further $1.4 million has been earmarked in the state budget to assist council with intersection improvements at the Seventeen Mile Rocks Road and Oldfield Road intersection to push it along. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162148"></A>
The amount of $30.24 million will provide assistance to low-skilled workers, those disadvantaged in the labour market, and to support the Queensland Green Army strategy for a total cost of $126.08 million. This budget will provide increased front-line services including 316 more teachers and teacher aides; 203 more police; 1,200 more doctors, nurses and health practitioners; and another 75 ambulance officers. Community services, rail and school infrastructure will receive a massive funding boost for the Mount Ommaney electorate as detailed in the following pages.

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162175"></A>
As the Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs, I have learned much about the ever-increasing funding needs of people with a disability and am pleased that this budget includes $1.054 billion for Disability Services, $528.7 million for Home and Community Care and $28.6 million for Community Mental Health Services. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162176"></A>
We will be releasing a new Multicultural Policy later this year and $3.4 million will deliver events and programs that recognise Queensland’s cultural diversity. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1162177"></A>
I will take this opportunity with my budget speech to précis the many initiatives for which I have successfully lobbied as the State Member for the Mt Ommaney electorate. It has been my responsibility to ensure that there have been substantial improvements to amenities in my local suburbs and that this electorate gets our fair share of State government funding. Some of the major initiatives have included:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162178"></A>
<Hansard-Bold>
Local Schools</Hansard-Bold>

Major sports facilities and performing arts centres at local high schools (Corinda, Centenary and St Aidan’s); removal of asbestos projects, resource centre upgrades, outside school hours care facilities, arts centres, preschool buildings and kindergartens, library extensions, community facilities, tuckshop upgrades, new classrooms, refurbishment of buildings, additional maintenance and new amenities, pick up and set down facilities, new and improved science blocks and environment projects, new preparatory year facilities at primary schools.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162180"></A>
In last year’s budget $181,243 was provided to complete additional amenities at Corinda State High School at a total cost of $521,850; $143,100 was allocated for maintenance work at Corinda State High School; $52,400 was allocated for maintenance work at Oxley State School; $3200 was allocated for maintenance work at Middle Park State School; $2700 was allocated for maintenance work at Centenary State High School.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

A major upgrade to drainage works and noise barriers along the Centenary Highway; a bikeway from Sumners Road to Toowong; the Jindalee Bikeway and Bridge; fast tracking another exit from Sumners Road Industrial estate (Wolston Road) and building a temporary ramp for Bullockhead Street; consultation on the Sumners Road bridge (over the Centenary Highway) duplication project.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162185"></A>
Upgrades to Oxley and Corinda and currently Darra railway stations with lifts and extra car parks, new platforms and a third track to be constructed between Corinda and Darra for the extension of a railway corridor to Springfield. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162186"></A>
Last year $11.1 million was provided to continue the planning study for upgrading the Ipswich Motorway between Rocklea and Darra, at a total cost of $14.6 million and $2 million set aside to provide variable speed limits on various sections of Western Arterial Road from Jindalee at a total cost of $5.2 million. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162187"></A>
<Hansard-Bold>
Community Infrastructure</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

An extension to the Corinda Bowls Club, the relocation of the Wests Centenary Junior Rugby League Club’s football fields and subsequent field makeovers; parkland near Wolston and Oxley Creeks; an environment centre at Oxley Common; the preservation of a vast amount of green space at Wacol; capital and recurrent funding for the YoungCare facility at Sinnamon Village.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162189"></A>
In the last budget $3.74 million was allocated towards the purchase of book stock for public libraries in the Brisbane region and $526,000 was allocated to complete construction of 2 public housing dwellings in the Mount Ommaney electorate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Bold>
Energy</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162191"></A>
A high voltage feeder line out of a new Sumner Power sub-station and the rebuilding and upgrading the electrical switchyard at the West Darra sub-station at the end of Sumners Road.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162192"></A>
In the last budget, $1.87 million at Oxley to upgrade the current electricity transformer with a new unit, with a total project cost of $2.19 million.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Transport and Roads</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162194"></A>
Main Roads has upgraded the Centenary Motorway from Ipswich Road to Sumners Road and has added another lane to the Sumners Road off-ramp (inbound). This is part of the $700 million Wacol to Darra upgrade and included major improvements to the Centenary/Ipswich Motorway interchange which is working extremely well.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162195"></A>
The SEQ infrastructure plan allocates $310 million to construct a future transit lane along the Centenary Highway. This is one of the proposals put forward by the recent Western Brisbane Transport Network Investigation (WBTNI) study to reduce traffic congestion into the future. However, the Toowong roundabout and Milton Road has always created a bottleneck and a flow-on effect increasing congestion on the Motorway. Recently I have been advised that the Northern Link tunnel at Toowong will commence next year providing some relief at that end. Now we are able to look at detailed planning for the Centenary Motorway upgrade to complement the Northern Link.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162196"></A>
It is indeed an honour to serve all of the residents in my electorate area. Last year my office was forced to relocate from the Middle Park Shopping Centre due to unsatisfactory tenancy conditions. We are now located above the National Bank at Mt Ommaney Centre.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162197"></A>
There is always more to be done and I continue to work hard to obtain improved services and facilities for the area.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1162198"></A>
Mr Speaker, it is appropriate to take this opportunity to applaud the many volunteers who make our community a better place to live. One of the most fulfilling responsibilities as the local MP is to work with many of these extraordinary people and I see every day what a difference they make. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr CHOI</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Capalaba--ALP) (9.37 pm): There is a Chinese proverb that says that a long journey begins with a single step. The hardest part of that journey is often the very first step. Last year, as a government, we chose not to shy away from a long and hard journey. As a government faced with the global economic crisis, we have moved to safeguard Queensland’s future. The choices we have made have not been easy. No detours have been taken on political easy street. This government has shown true leadership. I would like to congratulate the Premier and our Treasurer for standing firm. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162239"></A>
This is a disciplined budget. It hones our commitment to protect our building program and to protect Queensland jobs. Last year, facing what economists predicted would be the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, we made a choice--a choice to protect our record building program and the jobs it supports. This has paid off--our job creation initiatives are having the desired effect. The unemployment rate, predicted to reach 7 per cent last year, is now forecast to peak at 5 per cent in 2009-10, dropping back to five per cent in 2012-13. The unemployment growth forecast returned to 3 per cent in 2011-12. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1169409"></A>
As the Treasurer said this week, we want to give Queenslanders the chance of the dignity of work. Jobs are supported by economic recovery. Queensland is now on its way to growing faster than the national economy, which is predicted to grow at two per cent this year and 3 per cent next year. The growing economic activity of our major trading partners, like Asia, is also good news. Forecasts show these partners, including Japan, Korea and China, will grow at 4 per cent this year and 3 per cent next year. That means demand for Queensland’s products--and we are open for business.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1169412"></A>
It also means jobs. Queensland has a reputation for its competitive tax regime to support business and support jobs. Our taxation per person will still be over $400 less than the national average. We boast the lowest payroll tax rate in the nation of 4.75 per cent and the highest threshold of the mainland states of $1 million. We have kept our commitment to skilling up tomorrow’s workforce by extending our 125 per cent payroll tax rebate for apprentices and trainees. We will continue to work towards creating more jobs for young Queenslanders. While the budget will remain in deficit over the forward estimates, Queensland is on its way to recovery and our plan will see the budget return to surplus sooner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1169413"></A>
Importantly, this is also a budget that recognises that people are doing it tough, and it finds some ways to help Queenslanders where we can. We understand that every single dollar counts. That is why a review in the CTP scheme began in March this year. It has been completed and these reforms mean Queensland motorists will save more than $20 a year on their compulsory third party insurance. To help those most in need, the government has introduced the new Medical Cooling and Heating Electricity Concession Scheme. This will provide more than $216 million per annum. This will help low-income Queenslanders with medical conditions such as MS. We recognise that in some cases people have no choice but to run air conditioners or heaters. For MS sufferers, it helps to regulate their body temperature for medical reasons.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1169414"></A>
The budget also increases the electricity rebate for pensioners and seniors from $190 to $216 per household, at a cost of $50.4 million over the next four years. As a society we are using more energy--for some, this is an absolute necessity--and that is why we have worked to deliver rebates for Queenslanders who need them most. We also provide a range of other concessions including a 50 per cent motor vehicle registration discount for pensioners and TransLink discounts for seniors.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1169415"></A>
In my maiden speech some eight or nine years ago, I informed the House that shortly after arriving in Australia my father enrolled me in a local state school. It was a beautiful school with clean classrooms and stunning playing fields. I refused to go because I thought it would be too expensive. When I hurt myself in a football game, I refused also to go to hospital. I was not going to have my dad have to work two jobs just to pay for a football injury. But, again, my father told me that the hospital was also free. I found myself asking the question, ‘What kind of a country is this that education is free and medical care is also free?’ One day I was learning to participate in one of Australia’s favourite pastimes--lawnmowing--when a couple of old folks in the neighbourhood stopped to have a chat with me. When I asked them about the schools and the hospitals, they said, ‘Son, this is the legacy of Labor policies, believing that education and health are a right for all and not the privilege of a few.’ I gave my heart to the Labor Party then.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1169416"></A>
We could raise taxes. We could slash jobs. I am sure that is what the opposition would like us to do. We could even cut our building program. But we will not do these things because we are a proud Labor government, we believe in protecting jobs and we believe in delivering fundamental services. We do not believe in the privilege of a few. So I am committed to staying the course on this difficult journey. This is a budget that makes the right choices, the hard choices, and it will deliver for the people of Queensland. I am very proud to be a member of this side of politics. I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech in <Hansard-Italic>

The 2010-11 budget demonstrates that commitment by investing in better health services and employing more frontline staff to treat Queensland patients.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169428"></A>
$9.99 billion will be poured into providing services to meet the health care needs of our growing and ageing population.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169429"></A>
Our massive $7.33 billion health infrastructure program--the largest ever undertaken in the nation’s history will build and expand health across the state and secure Queensland jobs.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169430"></A>
On top of this building program Queensland Health took on 556 medical interns this year with funding in the budget to increase this to 644 next year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169431"></A>
The government has set a target to recruit an extra 1,200 doctors, nurses and allied health staff this year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The budget will boost funding for cancer services in regional Queensland and provide new or upgrade cancer centres.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169433"></A>
This means 26 extra chemotherapy chairs.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169434"></A>
There will be more beds and day treatment spaces for cancer patients across the state at Rockhampton, Bundaberg, Hervey Bay and Toowoomba and outreach services will be provided by Brisbane hospitals.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

We want to ensure people with cancer and their families have access to high-quality care.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169436"></A>
We have also committed $8.5 million over four years for a mental health social marketing campaign. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

This years’ budget includes funds an extra 203 police positions this year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169443"></A>
We are determined to keep the community safe and our police officers are doing a great job.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169444"></A>
The overall rate of crime is down by 26 per cent between 2000-01 and 2008-09.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169445"></A>
This government is determined to keep that trend going and the best way do to that is to get more officers on the beat proactively working to reduce and investigate crime.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169446"></A>
It goes without saying that our emergency services also make a great contribution to community safety and this budget delivers more frontline officers.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

This is up from $1.4 billion last financial year.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169460"></A>
That’s a 15.2 per cent increase, and it will help reach more people requiring services.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169461"></A>
This funding will do things like support young people with a disability leaving school; support people with spinal cord injuries and provide for early intervention and support services for the families of children with a disability and it will help create new autism early intervention centres.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mrs MILLER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bundamba--ALP) (9.44 pm): Our Labor government’s commitment to the Bundamba electorate is outstanding, and it is backed by well over a billion dollars this year in funding in our suburbs. Everywhere we look, our government is building, building, building and, where we can, we are rebuilding and refurbishing. This is the beginning of a new era in our electorate--where we are building for growth and keeping our heritage close in our hearts and minds, and where we demand our cut of the action.</Hansard-Body>

Ripley has already been earmarked for a new fire and rescue station to replace the existing Ipswich Fire Station. The Ripley Valley Rural Fire Brigade continues to serve the local community with the support of our Labor government.</Hansard-Body>

The new performing arts centre and new cluster leadership centre are currently under construction with an internal fit-out underway. The new special education unit is nearing completion and includes a lifestyle learning specialist centre and outdoor learning areas. The administration offices and teacher’s specialist areas are complete and in use by the school and surrounding community. External painting is nearing completion. The science labs are currently being upgraded with all works to be completed by late August this year. I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech in <Hansard-Italic>

The Ipswich Turf Club has also received a budget allocation. The Labour Day race meeting continues to be an outstanding success. QTIS prize money of $150,000 for the CFMEU Mining and Energy two year old Plate contributes to total prize money of $265,000 plus trophies. Over 4,000 people attended the family day, the card drew a massive 207 nominations, however only 134 horses could be accommodated across eight races. It is the second biggest race day in Ipswich each year and is proudly sponsored by the union movement and myself as State MP.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

St Augustine’s Catholic College is a Prep to Year 12 Catholic College in the electorate mainly catering for students in the Springfield to Redbank Plains areas.

It will be in operation, taking passengers to Brisbane city in late 2013.

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

It will mean better access, cheaper travel, less congestion and fewer delays. Importantly, as a mother, I know it will mean more time for workers, especially mums, to spend with their children.

All these infrastructure projects in the newer suburbs are being delivered well ahead of time. Our government is ahead of the game, out in front, leading the way.

However, as I predicted this time last year, there has been a very real effect on family budgets. Families in the electorate are hurting--whether they be pensioners, single parent families or extended families reliant on help from grandparents. They are hurting worse than last year and many families do not see any end in sight. It’s the Clayton’s recession, many say, as it feels like a recession, where there is no excess money, no money even for basics like winter clothing, heating, or cooling, yet no government dare put a label on exactly what is happening. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169602"></A>
It’s a weird, eerie feeling in the community where governments don’t talk about recessions or the like. But the people want honesty, they want to know what is happening: a couple of years ago they were told it was the global financial crisis, then we were told that we avoided the worst of it due to government stimulus spending. Good. Then we were told we may have a recession, and later on we were told that we missed that as well. Good. So what is really happening? Is it a downturn, is it a slump? Is it government led recovery by expenditure on infrastructure and if so, then why are the people hurting so much, and when will the economy improve?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169603"></A>
The people deserve an economic diagnosis and prognosis and if that is too difficult, then for heavens sake just fess up and tell the people that no one really knows! The people know that the government is pouring money into infrastructure and are very grateful, but if it is an infrastructure led recovery of some description, when will it pass through to them? When will their daily lives improve? Will they ever be able to move out of struggle street?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169604"></A>
 The people know by their own circumstances that the economy is not as it once was, they are working less hours, some are not working at all, those who are working cannot make ends meet, some cannot even afford the weekly bus fare to get their kids to school based sports competitions. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169605"></A>
We now have working families with both parents working like dogs, who are now the working poor, and in some cases, the working impoverished. With housing costs, purchasing and renting, rising out of control, many families believe that they may have to move out of Ipswich into cheaper areas. Ipswich has always been proud of its working class roots and it is shameful that some workers feel that they have been priced out of living here.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169607"></A>
Whilst there is unprecedented growth in our area, I want our Labor Government, in administering all contracts for construction, to consider:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1169608"></A>
a) 	employing as many local people as possible </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1169609"></A>
b) 	training some local people in new skills, to upgrade their skill set so that long term they can become employable once again.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1169610"></A>
c) 	employing local school-based trainees and apprentices for the life of the projects and work experience students as well. This particularly refers to the Ipswich Motorway and Springfield rail projects.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1169611"></A>
d) 	showcasing workers’ rights in the form of pay and conditions, workplace health and safety.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1169612"></A>
e) 	community development strategies so that the whole community increases its capacity to benefit from projects in a variety of ways in art works, landscaping, and heritage projects.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169613"></A>
I do not want a situation where construction companies come into our electorate, build the infrastructure and then move out again, with no longstanding educational, skills and training benefits to the community. If it is a government funded infrastructure recovery program, then we locals demand our fair share of it. There has to be employment and training outcomes, there has to be mentoring in our schools, there has to be more trainees and apprentices and there has to be partnerships in community development especially our heritage projects.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1169614"></A>
This is the way forward for everyone locally, where we all benefit, where partnership is real, not rhetoric. All levels of government should demand the same as to do anything less is to sell out the potential of our local people, miss the opportunities for educational and skills advancement, and the belief in the potential of every family, and every single person, in our community. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (9.47 pm): Everything old is new again. Labor has made a dreadful mess of our state and its finances. This has been at a time of historic levels of growth, national prosperity and record royalty and revenues. We have rivers of gold, coal and money. If this is both Labor’s plan and report card, Queensland has just hit the wall. We have had billions wasted on nothingness. Labor lost more than $31 billion in just over 10 years, and arguably the debt is greater allowing for the higher borrowings of the GOC due to excessive efficiency dividend payments. The $51 billion gross debt figure announced last week, as I said, does not include that debt, but it is up 14 per cent on the $44 billion gross state debt in last year’s budget. </Hansard-Body>

The Treasurer is stating nonsense this week that ‘the debt has not gone down’. No, Treasurer, it has risen by $9 billion. Debt estimated projections from last year’s budget mean nothing. Labor was running a rubbish line that we in Queensland were in recession when he clearly knew that was untrue. Labor currently shouts and screams about the relevance of the GFC on its budget bottom line. All this hot air is extinguished by fact. The Queensland state revenue increased by two per cent, but there was also a six per cent rise in expenditure that rendered Labor’s budget result catastrophic. Debt is a self-induced problem when Labor is in government; in Queensland, it is now a chronic obsession. The evidence is there for all to see in the balance sheet. </Hansard-Body>

The Access Economics report of 2010 stated that there was no recession. Yet, as economic Neanderthals, the Bligh Labor government continues to run massive state budget deficits in parallel with the federal Labor one-term failures. If the Treasurer has not noticed, every other state is producing surpluses while the federal government runs such large deficits. States producing surpluses when the federal government produces deficits is the normal process when there are economic adverse issues. I do not believe the Treasurer and Premier have been advised by Treasury of the danger in taking the course they have. To go further and potentially run up the forecast quantum deficit of $6.1 billion over the next four years is to prove that they are economic illiterates. </Hansard-Body>

Like last year’s budget, the 2010-11 budget proves that state Labor cannot grow its revenue faster than expenditure and, worse still, the shortfall will be roughly rising at 30 per cent compound uplift, with the deficit of 2013-14 projected at $2.5 billion, when net debt hits $83.5 billion. Expenditure is rising at three times the current rate of income growth. At the last election Queenslanders were not told that electing a Labor government would include a plan for a great asset strip sale. Additionally, Queensland Labor admitted nothing about a job delivered being defined as being employed for just one hour a week. What they were told was that Premier Bligh was promising 100,000 new jobs and a Green Army. Queensland Labor told us heaps about solar schemes while doubling electricity charges. After selling off the electricity retailers the Premier stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1177789"></A>
It does not matter where you live, nobody--not one Queenslander--will be worse off under the government’s proposal. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177790"></A>
Labor could not even get its solar scheme working. We are currently on the third go at it. It even embarrasses natural resources Minister Robertson to talk about it. But--hey, presto!--in this budget we even have solar kindies. Who is writing these scripts? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177791"></A>
Competition would resolve everything, so Labor said, yet look at what happened: water charges up, electricity charges up, government charges up and massive increases in the cost of living. The public is angry at Labor, and so it should be. Labor has failed every imaginable test of business administration skill. Where there was no competition, such as WorkCover, the system collapsed and it needed a massive cash injection from the state in response. Labor significantly put up the fees to employers. </Hansard-Body>

Extraordinarily, in the House two days ago, in an amazing statement, the member for Toowoomba North had the gall to explain away the role of ambulance-chasing solicitors in this sham. He claimed that they were the saviours of the workers. Labor lawyers, in a feeding frenzy, largely caused the recent near collapse of WorkCover. To try to rewrite history to excuse their own disgraceful behaviour by claiming they were defending the workers’ common law rights is offensive. This is why the public is fed up with Labor: its members are hypocrites. This pattern is occurring within every department of government. It puts the interest of bureaucracy ahead of the public interest, and there are far too many on the gravy train. </Hansard-Body>

As has been mentioned already tonight, in Gaven the widening of the M1 from Nerang to Worongary announced in the budget was announced by the main roads minister at least three times previously: firstly on 18 September 2009, then on 4 March 2010 and then on 24 May 2010. Labor has started the widening from Nerang to Worongary, but it will take over two years to increase two lanes to six lanes for a two-kilometre stretch of road by 2012-13, and only if Labor avoids the disgraceful project mismanagement that it showed with the 10-year-long Tugun bypass project. In the end we will have merely three lanes either side for a stretch that equates to less than four per cent of the total motorway.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177794"></A>
In addition, why would the Treasurer state there is federal funding for the M1 widening project when there is no federal funding? Five years ago the Howard government originally committed $455 million for the section below Worongary, but it was spent by the Labor government at Daisy Hill. Traffic counts from 2008 show that this section of the M1 is already squeezing in 97,000 vehicles each peak hour, each day--that is, 859 vehicles squeezing into a two-lane merge. By 2012, with the Gold Coast’s continuing population growth and Labor’s continuing trend to make everything old new again, we will find ourselves with the obsolete three lanes squeezing proportionally just as many cars as now and we will need four lanes at that stage. We need to be planning four lanes from Nerang to Tugun as a matter of urgency for Australia’s sixth largest city to have a credible road link for commuters from the Gold Coast to Brisbane and for the tourists that come from the south, the west and the north. In a low year, nine million tourists a year come to the Gold Coast, which is currently earning the state $5 billion in income. </Hansard-Body>

I find it amusing to see the Nerang Fire Station listed as the first search result on the Premier’s Building Queensland website budget 2010-11 project list for Nerang, when the emergency services minister had already announced the fire station was open last Friday, 4 June, four days before the budget. Is the Nerang Fire Station project underway, as the Premier announced on her website, or is the Nerang Fire Station, as her minister announced, open and operational? Did the minister tell the Premier that he had announced the Nerang Fire Station was open or was it, as Peter Cameron said in the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin, </Hansard-Italic>
that the minister was not making any fuss over the project as it had taken five years of local residents’ lobbying and over three years since Labor’s initial election promise to build the station that year?</Hansard-Body>

When comparing the Premier’s Building Queensland project list for Gaven to the state budget’s capital statement, irregularities pop up consistently. I do understand that sometimes the printing occurs ahead of the release of other details, but this is quite interesting. On the Building Queensland website, Nerang State High School is allocated $555,589 for its new library, but the capital statement states that the allocation is $440,000. The school thought it was receiving $653,000 for the library. Similarly, Park Lake State School is hoping to get its full $3.765 million because it needs the second half of its school built with that allocation and the builder is ready to start.</Hansard-Body>

The AFL Carrara stadium is another recycling project in my electorate of Gaven. This is not a new project at all and all Gold Coasters know that. The Building Queensland website states that the stadium’s budget allocation is $126 million and the capital statement states that the allocation is $100 million. It is not new infrastructure; it is building onto an existing facility. The Treasurer has announced that hundreds of bucks have been saved on the Carrara stadium project, but this means that Gold Coast families, men and women will have their ticket prices hiked up at the gate just so they can get into this so-called new facility. I think Labor ministers have been listening to Peter Allen’s famous song--</Hansard-Body>

The best example is the government’s recycled announcements, over and over again, of the rapid transit rail project. Every recycled announcement on the light rail track is a kick in the guts for Gaven constituents, who completely miss out in this transport so-called solution. The residents of Gaven, Pacific Pines, Nerang and Maudsland will only be able to travel by irregular buses to Griffith University before getting on the light rail from Parklands to get to Surfers or Broadbeach. </Hansard-Body>

Labor has given up. This budget is proposing a future capital spend decline, the lowest in modern state history, over the next three years. The projected capital spend this year is $17.1 billion, which is just down on last year’s $18.5 billion. This $17.1 billion is to be achieved with mirrors, since only 75 per cent of last year’s capital allocation was spent. This is after allowing for a $1 billion capital underspend and the $3 billion Commonwealth grant, reducing real state capital expenditure to $14.6 billion. </Hansard-Body>

I say this to the Treasurer: Queensland Labor did nothing for 10 years, and when it suddenly realised it had been asleep and spending like a drunken sailor it woke up and burned what little money it had left. If the Treasurer had not noticed, Queensland Labor in government has racked up $51 billion of gross debt whilst New South Wales gross debt is declining from $22 billion, with debt reduction via surpluses of $3.15 billion over the next four years. New South Wales debt has been static since the aftermath of the Olympics and its surplus this year is $100 million, with an operating budget only one-third larger than Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177813"></A>
As people would know, New South Wales is offering stamp duty reductions on the sale of homes up to $650,000. By 2014 its net debt will be $55 billion, which is 10 per cent of gross state product, as opposed to ours of $83.5 billion. I will compare that with the Victorian debt situation and its current budget. Victoria announced a surplus of $872 million and it is actually projecting a population decline over the next four years to 1.7 million people. Victoria has a surplus forecast on average of $1.2 billion and it has revenue currently of $45.8 billion, with expenditure of $44.9 billion. It has $13 billion of net debt and its proportion of GSP is six per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177814"></A>
Next year Queensland’s projected capital spend will decline again; the capital spend will be only 77 per cent of allocation. That is how it is done. Everything old is new again. I must agree with the Treasurer’s statement that the government is to introduce a new waste reform strategy to reduce waste and improve recycling levels, because the government is recycling projects and money, and for those projects the Treasurer is calling it new money. It is actually from last year or the year before or even the year before that. As I say, the real stand-out example is the rapid transit system. $219 million has been allocated this year, but it is the same money from last year, minus that which was spent on 80 staff and resumptions, and there are plenty of those examples throughout the budget. </Hansard-Body>

The 2010-11 budget tells everyone exactly what this state Labor government knew last year. Labor claimed there was a totally different set of numbers based on crazy internal gut feelings. The Treasurer asked us to trust him. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177853"></A>
The state income revenue uplift has remained steady at two per cent. The government remains stuck on its own inability to stop the rampant growth of the numbers of staff and remuneration of the Public Service. Total staff numbers in 2010-11 will hit 198,405. This is 5,078 more than last year’s budget allocation and $395 million over budget. Labor’s numbers will rise by 2.6 per cent next year and the wages bill by eight per cent to $16.2 billion by 2013. This increase will be 23.8 per cent--the highest percentage increase in the nation--and an extra $3.6 billion off the bottom line. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177854"></A>
The Premier has announced the employment of 1,818 new front-line police, nurses and doctors, but this pales into insignificance when compared to the backroom staff, the bureaucracy. No wonder nothing can be done. The public sector now exists to service itself, and we are struggling to carry the cost of it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177855"></A>
Together with nearly $15 billion lost in wasted water infrastructure spending and ad hoc expenditure without any tangible net revenue gain to the state’s budget bottom line, Labor’s own expenditure excess in a time of adversity leads to this year’s deficit of the current proportion. The cost of the interest bill to finance the debt is compounding the bottom line headache. The Treasurer, on behalf of Queensland Labor, has responded by maintaining its current $19 billion infrastructure spend but to reduce the state’s burgeoning debt by rapid reduction in infrastructure spending over the next four years and a program of asset sales. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Well, Treasurer, it is crunch time. Every economist and industry group says that the plan is disastrous for this state. For those who are unaware, this is neo-Keynesian theory taken to an extreme end. The idea of the progressive withdrawing of state capital outflows in real dollar terms, in the next two to four years, before the proven inflow of private capital into the state, especially with the current impact of the crazy mining super tax of a failed federal Labor administration, is not just unwise, it is downright dangerous. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177858"></A>
The Treasurer is proudly announcing that he has not taken the super mining tax into account and he has ignored the advice and lack of evidence to support Labor’s selection of assets for auction. He has not taken true Keynesian theory into account and significantly reduced public sector expense in parallel with the progressive withdrawal of state capital expenditure. He cannot cherry pick the parts of economic theory that he likes and avoid doing those that he does not like if he is to achieve a return to a balanced budget and debt reduction.</Hansard-Body>

If anyone cared to notice, there are really two economies going on out there--one that the government wants to claim and the other it hopes will just go away. For many in business or privately employed, it is very tough out in the real world. Not only are margins slim or absent, growth is dismal and credit is very tight. Some are saying it is as though the true impact of the GFC has just hit when last year the Rudd cash giveaways artificially raised everyone’s expectations of a quick recovery. An Access Economics report states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1177862"></A>
Unless the state continues to invest heavily in infrastructure, particularly in South East Queensland, the South East Queensland economy will face the same capacity constraints and congestions that have been impacting increasingly in productivity of the region in recent years.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177863"></A>
Treasurer, the Commonwealth Grants Commission says the same. So does every leading commentator. Far from Labor learning, trying or even wishing to deliver, they must deliver projects on time, on budget and in good working order. I think it is a big call for the Treasurer to state that we will complete the $315 million Ted Smout Bridge to Redcliffe and the $190 million Port Access Road in Townsville this year, as well as the very slow $148 million Forgan Smith Bridge project in Mackay, in the same breath. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177865"></A>
Rapid and prompt delivery of anything have not been features of Labor’s term in government. Who can possibly believe the pattern will change? All excuses are being doled out with the exception of ‘it is all the LNP’s fault’. Without an upper house, Labor can only blame itself for all its dreadful mistakes, mismanagement and waste. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177866"></A>
The Treasurer said, ‘Tough choices’ and ‘We must prepare for the future, we must keep our shoulder to the wheel.’ With fuel up, rego up and few options, I presume the Treasurer has taken to pushing the chauffeur and the Holden Statesman to Parliament House himself. The market is staring the Treasurer down. In anyone’s reasonable assessment, Labor has restated only that which it stated last year with very few additions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177867"></A>
There is no real new money because Labor is not a wealth creator; it is a wealth destroyer. Generally Labor governments revert to type and become wealth redistributors, especially left leaning ones, as Bligh Labor is. But there is no wealth to redistribute now with a projected net debt position of $83.5 billion in 2013. The Treasurer said in his second reading speech that projected growth will be three per cent. But what he has not said is that this is conditional on four major factors. They are the return to near normal levels of production and shipping of commodity based exports; new home starts to a 40 per cent level above that of now; a return to near normal of retail expenditure; and a return to pre-2008 taxation state revenues.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177868"></A>
The disconnect between recent growth at 2.3 per cent and expenditure growth at six per cent consigns Queensland state budgets to deficits forever. This is structural debt, as the shadow Treasurer has stated. It is very wishful thinking for a government needing to protect state revenue and jobs, knowing federally Labor is not prepared to execute itself prior to the imminent federal election and jettison the mining super tax. Premier Bligh, the unions and Labor support the tax and that puts massive pressure on the budget. The double whammy of the new mining super tax then effectively torpedoes any hope the incumbent government has of delivering a new resource based income for the state at a time when we need to diversify and increase our income tax revenue streams. For Queensland this is largely the coal seam gas industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177869"></A>
The key plank of this budget’s internal core strategy is to achieve a market re-rating by using the asset sales to facilitate its debt reduction strategy to achieve the 110 per cent threshold of gross debt over revenue. Not only is the assets program wrong in principle; the wrong assets are for sale. The forestry assets sale price is clue No. 1. The QR sale and the ongoing negotiation over the inclusion or exclusion of below-rail assets together with above-rail assets for sale and a demand by buyers for the 100 per cent purchase of assets is clue No. 2.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177870"></A>
Far from achieving growth of 3.75 per cent by 2011-12, this implies that Queensland’s economy will stall between 2012 and 2014. This will be at a time when even New South Wales and Victoria may be experiencing mini recoveries. I believe this is the reason housing finance approvals in Queensland are at historic low levels and the market is re-rating us. Rising inflation due to continuing federal borrowing and deficits will compound this. Treasurer, there is no alternative but to grow the revenue base, maintain sensible and pragmatic public infrastructure asset spending, reduce the growth of public sector expenditure to the stated 2.5 per cent and stop the sale of our Queensland assets. </Hansard-Body>

Mr EMERSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Indooroopilly--LNP) (10.07 pm): Since even before I was elected to the seat of Indooroopilly more than a year ago I was fighting alongside community leaders and local residents to stop the sale for development by the Rudd government of an irreplaceable seven hectares of riverside land at Long Pocket. This land is currently occupied by the CSIRO which is due to vacate the site later this year. This land provides a rare opportunity to help create a world-class park and preserve green space to offset the plans by the state Labor government for high density in nearby Indooroopilly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177884"></A>
The land is also environmentally important. As highly respected local conservationist Jutta Godwin said, the CSIRO site is rich with birds. It also contains some of the world’s only 285 known examples of the endangered angle-stemmed myrtle tree. She said it must be kept as an inner-city green zone park. If sold, any high-density development on the site risks even further worsening the morning gridlock in the Long Pocket-Indooroopilly area. I have repeatedly written to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to stop the sale of this land. Locals and environmentalists have pleaded with the Prime Minister to stop the sale. But one voice has been silent throughout this campaign, and that is the ALP candidate for Ryan, Steven Miles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177921"></A>
Mr Miles claims that he is committed to community, but his silence on this important issue of preserving green space in the electorate of Ryan has been deafening. Perhaps it is because he only moved into the electorate after he was preselected and it is not his community that is under threat. In fact, when I checked Mr Miles’s website earlier today, Long Pocket and Indooroopilly were not even mentioned, let alone the sale of the CSIRO site. Last month I challenged Mr Miles to stand up and fight for the environment and the Long Pocket and Indooroopilly communities and stop this sale. Sadly, Mr Miles has maintained his silence. The Prime Minister has now written to me saying that he expects to complete the sale of this land soon. It is not too late to stop this sale. It is not too late for Mr Miles to show that he can stand up and fight for this community, because if Mr Miles cannot fight for this community now, how can anyone believe he will fight for it if he does get to Canberra? <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. A PALASZCZUK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Inala--ALP) (Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs) (10.10 pm): I want to raise in the House an issue that I have been dealing with in my electorate in relation to the suburb of Carole Park. I spoke in the House a couple of years ago about this situation and back then I said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1177932"></A>
The residents of Carole Park have a problem that needs to be fixed now. The residents of Carole Park, which is located in the City of Brisbane, have an Ipswich postcode--4300. As a consequence, mail can take up to three days to arrive. Residents who attend medical appointments in nearby Inala are told that they are to go to Goodna because Goodna is in the City of Ipswich.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177934"></A>
I finally have good news for the House, and the good news is that Carole Park has now got a Brisbane post code and the new area is called Ellen Grove. This is a fantastic win for the local area, and I want to pay special tribute to local community worker Les Mullins. Les Mullins was out there raising this issue for years and years. He was knocking on everyone’s doors such as Australia Post. He was talking to federal members. He was talking to councillors. He was talking to everybody. He organised community consultations. He was desperate for Carole Park to have a Brisbane post code, and finally his efforts have been recognised.</Hansard-Body>

The other issue I want to raise in the House is the Queensland Day Community Awards, which were held last Saturday as part of Queensland Week at the Hotel Richlands in my electorate and which was attended by over 140 people. On the day over 20 local people were honoured for their contribution to the local community. Increasing volunteering rates is one of our top priorities, and it was great to see so many local people who do so much good in the local community being recognised by receiving a certificate signed personally by the Premier and a medallion to recognise their services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177943"></A>
This is a fantastic initiative. I would encourage other members to recognise volunteers in their communities as part of Queensland Week activities. It is a great way to say, ‘Thank you. On behalf of the Queensland government, thank you for the work that you do in our local community. We want to give you a small token of appreciation for your efforts.’ With those few words, I seek leave to have incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (10.13 pm): Tonight I rise to speak about the Beattie-Bligh Labor government’s $40 million Springbrook Mountain buy-up and rescue plan. Earlier today I tabled in the House a non-conforming petition containing 47 signatures which was hand delivered to my office on 2 June 2010. The petition requests that the views of these petitioners be taken into account and that they do not support the current media and political campaign that Springbrook is dying. They ask that their views be acknowledged and respected with a balanced representation of the issue. Furthermore, they go on to acknowledge that the future of Springbrook is centered on ecotourism, national park rehabilitation projects and the rural lifestyle and, as such, support the ongoing protection of the natural environment of Springbook. In acknowledgement of their wishes, I have today tabled their petition in order to demonstrate to the 16 residents who signed the petition who actually live in Springbrook that I as their local member welcome input from all of my constituents and will always endeavour to represent their views on any issue affecting the Mudgeeraba electorate. My door is always open and I am more than happy to meet with members of the community to discuss their varying views.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177973"></A>
I again want to stress that there have been numerous requests from my office to address the Wunburra Progress Association, the Friends of Springbrook and indeed to meet with the President of the Australian Rainforest Conservation Society so that they can present their views to me personally. To date I have not received any confirmation to meet or address the concerns of the constituents who reside in Springbrook and who are members of any of these groups. It is very interesting to note that, of the 47 people who signed the petition, only 16 are locals who are on the electoral roll in the Springbrook area. There are a number of signatures from as far away as the UK, Japan and Germany. How those living so far outside the area have any idea what long-term and ongoing effects the buy-up has had on the mountain’s local business and families is beyond me.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177975"></A>
I again wish to set the record straight. I am not--and I repeat I am not--against the rehabilitation of the heritage listed national park in Springbrook. Recently, as I have stated before in this place, I have been contacted by a number of residents, both long-term and recent arrivals, who have expressed some issues that they have with this government’s transparency on what is really happening in Springbrook. They have asked on numerous occasions for some indication as to what is the long-term time line for the rehabilitation taking place. As the elected member for Mudgeeraba it is my job to raise these questions and concerns in this House and look to gain answers for these residents. From the start of the project they have not been consulted regularly and would like to be kept up to date with progress. I am still awaiting confirmation of a visit to Springbrook by the Acting Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability and I look forward to residents being given the opportunity to ask questions directly of the minister. I will continue to represent the views of the constituents of the Mudgeeraba electorate who actually reside in Springbrook, but I do however draw the line on consulting with visitors to the mountain who do not reside there attempting to be representative of the locals. I again suggest to these constituents who do not live on the mountain and who are on the electoral roll in another electorate to address their issues through their own local Liberal National Party member. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PG REEVES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mansfield--ALP) (Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport) (10.16 pm): On the night of Sunday, 23 May this year tragedy hit a small but very close-knit community in my local electorate of Mansfield. For no known reason arsonists started a fire in one of the classrooms at Mansfield State School. With no-one there to immediately raise the alarm, the fire spread rapidly, destroying many of the 10 classrooms and the school tuckshop housed in the structure. Thankfully help was not far away. The brave men and women from our police and emergency services departments were quickly on the scene and, through their skill and responsiveness, were able to restrict and contain the blaze to a single structure, ensuring that it would not spread to the rest of the school. As these brave men and women worked tirelessly through the night, another plan was being put into place to ensure that the children of Mansfield State School would be able to attend school the very next morning--no doubt much to their disappointment--and return to their classroom activities as soon as possible.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177980"></A>
Having received updates on the extent of the damage while at the Gold Coast community cabinet the following morning, I arrived at Mansfield State School soon after lunch, expecting to see chaos. Whilst it angered me to see such pointless destruction, I could not help but feel pride at the sight of what lay before me. Local community groups including churches, businesses, other schools and parents gathered with volunteers to put on a sausage sizzle and activities for the kids and give donations to the school. At the same time, the great workers from QBuild were busily delivering relocatable classrooms within nearly 14 hours of the event occurring. In fact, by the afternoon of the following day, Mansfield State School had eight relocatable classrooms established on the oval with students working in them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177982"></A>
By Friday, 28 May--just five days later--the Department of Education and Training had delivered book packs for every student who had lost valuable resources in the fire. Department of education and QBuild staff also delivered and established two special education classrooms and Education Queensland has supplied furniture for all 10 classrooms. The remains of the burnt building were removed on the weekend of 29 and 30 May--within seven days. All the footings and cement areas of the burnt building were removed on the weekend of 5 and 6 June and the final clean-up is virtually finished. This is an amazing achievement. The story that should be told is how community spirit and a government that cares for its people can work together to achieve great things. I want to thank all of those hardworking staff, particularly those from the school, such as the principal and all of the other staff and the volunteers and the QBuild workers and contractors who did such a sensational job. This just goes to show the incredible work that can be done when the department of education and QBuild work together. I particularly want to thank the volunteers of the local parents, the local churches and everyone who got behind the school during this moment of crisis. It gave a great sense of community spirit, and I congratulate all of those involved. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Elimbah State School, Pedestrian Crossing</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (10.19 pm): I have been staggered and appalled by some ludicrous decisions in my lifetime, but just last week I participated in a meeting that takes the cake. I will give members the background first. On the afternoon of Friday, 28 May a student of Elimbah State School was struck by a vehicle as she used the pedestrian crossing on Beerburrum Road. Year 1 student Grace Giampino was crossing the road with her brother to get to her grandmother, who was parked on the other side. Due to a vehicle protruding from the adjacent School Road, the car travelling north failed to see Grace until it was too late. Grace was hit and thrown some distance, suffering abrasions to her elbow and hip, lacerations to her legs and, on presentation to the Caboolture Hospital accident and emergency department, blood in her urine. The Elimbah community and I are just grateful that Grace suffered no internal damage and that she is alive.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186941"></A>
Unfortunately, Grace is not alone. This crossing is notorious for many near misses and at least three pedestrian-vehicle collisions in the past 10 years. That is why the school principal, Mr Gary Austen, and the Elimbah State School P&amp;C Association have been fighting for the past decade to have a crossing supervisor appointed to this dodgy pedestrian crossing. In fact, in February this year the P&amp;C association, through president Sharon Webb, asked me to again make representations to the transport minister. The minister’s response gave us some hope but indicated that, despite the crossing being identified as a risk, there was insufficient funding to appoint a crossing supervisor. How much funding are we talking about? Fifteen thousand dollars. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186944"></A>
That brings me to the meeting last week. Let me acknowledge and thank the representatives of the Department of Transport and Main Roads who attended that meeting. We all appreciated their speedy response. I also acknowledge that what resulted was not a reflection on the individuals but more on the system in which they operate--a system of siloed, inflexible funding programs and technical based design and reporting. Instead of agreeing to the $15,000 that was needed for a school crossing supervisor, the representatives put on the table a $300,000 TIDS solution, which would see additional parking installed on the school side of Beerburrum Road. How farcical! Let us spend $300,000 to save $15,000! What is more, this proposed solution would take at least two years to materialise as it requires partnership funding from the local Moreton Bay Regional Council and extensive preplanning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186948"></A>
I understand that the representatives are trying to put a stop to all pedestrian movements across Beerburrum Road but, even if we stopped parents parking across the road, local kids who live on Coronation Street or down Rose Creek Road will continue to cross at this crossing. This is not a solution; it is an abomination. What if the car that had struck Grace had been one of the many semitrailers that use Beerburrum Road? How long is this government prepared to leave the pedestrian crossing as it is? How many more kids need to be hit while crossing Beerburrum Road? How many must die? Must one die? What price a kid’s life? In my eyes they are worth far more than $15,000 and they are worth a decision now. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. DM WELLS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Murrumba--ALP) (10.22 pm): The Freshwater National Park may be one of the smallest national parks in Queensland, but it is one of the most biodiverse. In its small compass you will find more kinds of vegetation species than in almost any other place in Queensland and it is probably exceeded only by the tropical rainforest of the far north. Therefore, it was good news when the environment minister, Kate Jones, secured the result that the vacant land around the police station on the other side of Deception Bay Road was incorporated into the national park. Thus on 31 July last year, Freshwater National Park increased in size from 93.5 hectares to 165 hectares. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WELLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the acting minister for environment for her support for this national park and for the initiative of the minister, whom she represents. That additional land is equally biodiverse and it represents similar natural values. But it needed work and here another initiative of this government should be noted. I thank the Minister for Employment and Economic Development, Andrew Fraser, for providing $140,000 from the Skilling Queenslanders for Work program to make that initiative occur. Ten Aboriginal trainees were recruited for a 15-week program. They revegetated degraded spot areas, built or repaired fences and walkways, established interpretative walks and established firebreaks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186959"></A>
In the language of the Aborigines who lived in the area, which has been for countless centuries known as Murrumba, the project was called Mindle Goolgun Wunbee, which means clever pathways to learning. The Murriajabree Aboriginal Corporation worked with the department and the rangers to identify the project and to supply the trainees. It is extraordinarily fitting that the descendants of the people who have been the custodians of the land for 40 millennia should begin their working lives on a project that involved restoring that land to the condition that it was in when their ancestors knew it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186963"></A>
A separate initiative is the declaration last year of the Deception Bay Conservation Park. That 130-hectare stand of mangrove wetlands means that the suburb of Deception Bay is now bounded both east and west by a halo of national treasures. I look forward to the day when these unique parts of our national estate become magnets for human interest and are discovered by the people of our region as places to frequent as a regular and valued part of their lives. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Coomera--LNP) (10.25 pm): ‘Minister hits back on trains’. That was the headline that greeted people when they turned to page 14 of the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Sun</Hansard-Italic>
 yesterday. Imagine my excitement when I saw that headline. I was convinced that I had missed something in the budget papers. I was convinced that the <Hansard-Italic>
Sun</Hansard-Italic>
 had an exclusive that was going to reveal that the Gold Coast was getting more peak-hour rail services. But, no, I had not missed anything at all. The story revolved around the Minister for Transport telling the people of Coomera that it was ‘too bad, so sad’. They were not going to get any more trains anytime soon. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186969"></A>
I have been calling on the minister to open up her mind to the possibilities and to find a way to ease the pain for northern Gold Coast commuters--people living in the Coomera, Albert, Gaven and Broadwater electorates--who are forced to stand for an hour every day just to get to work. For many, it is the same story coming home every afternoon.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186970"></A>
The minister talks about the past. She talks about 2005. The Gold Coast line was the ‘Bombay Express’ then and all the then transport minister was doing was playing catch-up for the lack of planning from the previous five years. We have moved on and it is time this minister caught up, too. This is 2010. The problem is that the minister does not have a solution until 2017 at the earliest. That is too far away. By then we will have another 30,000 or 40,000 people in the region and the ‘Bombay Express’ is not going to do the job.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186971"></A>
The fact is that the minister has not been down to see the train for herself. She has even taken to hiding the quarterly reports that confirm that that area has the most overcrowded line on the network. The TransLink Tracker is overdue by months. The last one that was released is for October-December 2009. Where is the TransLink Tracker for January-March 2010? Where is the Quarter 1 2010 Queensland Rail Passenger Load Survey, which was due out weeks, if not months, ago? How long is the minister going to hide the reports? How long is the minister going to ignore this issue? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186975"></A>
The minister and her predecessors lacked planning, and that has got us into this mess. She is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on 18,000 people. Over the past five years the Coomera region has grown by 25,000 people. And guess what? The next five years is going to see at least another 30,000. Hundreds of millions of dollars has been spent to service 18,000 people and zero has been spent to service the people of the northern Gold Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186976"></A>
The people in my area have a 4.34 am train that leaves the Varsity station. I say to the minister that it is a train that goes to the airport; it is not a train that goes to Central station. The minister knows that. If this minister were serious she would admit that that train is not a commuter train and that it was never intended to be. My area needs another two ‘peak peak’ services to accommodate the people of the northern Gold Coast for now and into the future. The people in my area need these services to tide them over until 2017 as an absolute minimum. There has to be a solution. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Springwood--ALP) (10.28 pm): A Rochedale State High School student is among the high-achieving individuals, employers and training organisations who were honoured recently at the Manufacturing Skills Queensland Industry Training Awards. Alissa Young, a year 12 student from Rochedale State High School, won the manufacturing school based apprentice of the year award. This award was given for Alissa’s outstanding achievement whilst undertaking a school based engineering course, which includes working with Stoddard’s Engineering two days a week. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186984"></A>
Last week I went to Rochedale State High School to meet Alissa. I was very impressed by her. Alissa is a wonderful young woman who clearly loves what she is doing. Alissa specialises in sheet metal work and has worked on projects for kitchen fabrication and also on metal parts for the Gateway Bridge project. So the member for Mansfield would be very happy about both of those things. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1186985"></A>
Although Alissa enjoys doing the hands-on work, she also wants to be a trainer once she qualifies in her trade. When I asked Alissa if she liked going to work she replied, ‘I wouldn’t be getting up at 4 am to go to work if I didn’t love it so much.’ That clearly demonstrates Alissa’s commitment and love for the job. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1194987"></A>
I congratulate Alissa and the other winners for their outstanding achievement and commitment to shaping the future of the sector. Their contribution towards skills development will bring not just career and business rewards but also foster innovation across the industry. I also thank Stoddard’s Engineering. Alissa told me about the training facilities it is installing to assist and train young tradespeople. Alissa has been nominated for the Queensland Apprentice of the Year award and if enthusiasm is the top criteria then she has already won. Good Luck. Logan is cheering for you, Alissa.</Hansard-Body>

I want to also take this opportunity to thank all those individuals and organisations that organised an event in the month of May for the Cancer Council’s Biggest Morning Tea. I acknowledge the hard work of McLaughlin &amp; Associates Lawyers. John McLaughlin and staff once again held a very successful morning tea that brought Springwood businesses and community leaders together, raising $2,558.20. I could not attend all the electorate morning teas held in May for this great cause but I know they would have all been successful as the Springwood electorate is very generous. </Hansard-Body>

 We like a cup of tea and a piece of cake. I look forward to attending as many as I can next year. Last week I, along with Springwood State High School, hosted a morning tea with the Minister for Education. Principals from Springwood’s state schools, Catholic schools and independent schools, along with representatives of P&amp;Cs and P&amp;Fs attended. The morning gave an opportunity for Springwood education leaders to chat with and question the minister. The hospitality students who came to the school at 4 am because they had four functions on that day did a wonderful job, and I thank them very much. The minister and myself were taken to the newly $1.5 million refurbished science block to witness a rat dissection, which reminded me of my own school days where I just ran out of the room. We also visited the aviation studies students where the minister was asked to launch one of their own rockets, which was extremely successful. To Springwood State High I say thank you very much for an informative and enjoyable morning. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.30 pm): On Saturday, 29 May I attended the youth activities day at Coppabella called the Coal Train Games. It was organised by Paul Scott, a coal train operator and all-round good guy. He and a couple of mates, Trent Deverell and Evan Hartley who owns the Jolly Roger Hotel Motel in Moranbah and a couple of service stations, and a few other blokes put up some tents and organised the games. Paul is a well-known Coppabella community worker who works with youth in the community through his association with a Nebo based youth group, Oben Wide. The games incorporated gymnastics, face painting, rides and all sorts of games. It was a great day. We had quite a number of touch football games and also a 50-metre timed foot race with $1,000 in prize money which was sponsored. We had four-year-olds to 50-year-olds running the race. Unfortunately I did not participate in the race. It had great support from the CFMEU and the Maritime Credit Union. I take my hat off to them for donating all the food and quite a considerable amount of money back into the community. Community spirit is alive and well in Coppabella. I did spend some time cooking steaks in the CFMEU tent which went down well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1194997"></A>
There is great concern for youth in the area, particularly in those small mining communities. There was a round table meeting at Nebo recently with the Isaac Regional Council to raise community initiatives. Oben Wide coordinator, Fiona Donnellan, was there, as well as many other community people including Paul. They put forward concerns about the youth of Coppabella and the best way to help them accomplish what the youth in the Nebo area had. The question was asked of council if they would supply a vehicle and fuel card so that Nebo’s success could be replicated in other mining communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1194998"></A>
Fortuitously Peter Shadforth of Shadforth Civil Contractors and his son from Nebo were at the meeting. They put up their hand to help. They have donated a new vehicle, a fuel card and a telephone to enable the coordinators to get around. It is both humbling and heartening to see people like Peter Shadforth, firstly, taking time out of their busy schedule to attend a community meeting and, secondly, to show their faith in the community and the program by making such a generous donation. It is not a small thing by anybody’s standards. Thanks to Peter and his company and thanks to Paul and Fiona who have put faith in our youth and work tirelessly to improve the quality of life within our mining communities. It truly is a good news story.<Hansard-Speech-End>

(10.33 pm): Last weekend it was showtime in the suburbs as one of the great community festivals celebrated its 36th year. The Crackerjack festival kicked off last Thursday night with 530 people attending the Class on the Grass Crackerjack Ball. The crowd had a great night participating in heads and tails, raffles, auctions and silent auctions whilst being entertained by Buster’s Duelling Pianos. This ball is a major event in the Chatsworth electorate and is the precursor to a weekend of celebration. This year saw 33,000 local residents have a fun-filled day at the Clem Jones sports fields at Carina. Takings were up 10 per cent and, given the tough economic times, this is a real tribute to the exceptional work done by Steve Heald, Roly Cowan, Terry Mackenroth, Wade Core and their band of workers and supporters. </Hansard-Body>

The food for the ball was sponsored by Brady’s Butchery at Gumdale, Royal Foods and Shangri-La Gardens at Wynnum. I must pay particular tribute to Valmae Richardson. Valmae is the recipient of the Clem Jones Memorial Supporters Award 2010 and the manager of Shangri-La Gardens at Wynnum. Valmae has been in the catering and hospitality industry since 1969 when she was employed by the Brisbane Cricket Club.</Hansard-Body>

Her association with Clem Jones started in 1971 when she became secretary of the Brisbane Cricket Ground Trust. Valmae left the trust to follow a career in hospitality and moved to the Shangri-La Gardens. Over the years she has played an important role in fundraising activities, from organising the Easter bonnet parade and since 1988, when the Crackerjack Ball became a feature of the carnival, she has applied her catering and hospitality skills to serve magnificent meals under very trying circumstances and to artfully convert a drab tent into a glamorous ballroom. This year we even had chandeliers in the tent to set the mood. Valmae is a very thoughtful, caring person and always willing to lend a hand. She is also heavily involved with the Clem Jones Home and other community projects. I congratulate Valmae on her ongoing commitment to the local community.</Hansard-Body>

It is a testament to the community spirit in the Chatsworth electorate that this year the Crackerjack festival raised $113,000, money which will be used to support the many sporting and community groups that call the Clem Jones Centre home. These include All Gauge Model Railway Club, Balmoral Little Athletics, Carina Bowls Club, Carina Leagues Club, Clem Jones Centre Sports Club, East Carina Juniors Rugby League, Carina Redsocks Baseball, Carina Leagues CJ Swim Club, Carina Leagues Triathlon Club, Eastern Suburbs Hockey Club, Mater Hill Cricket, Carina Juniors Cricket Club, Mayfield Netball Club, Southern Districts Basketball, Warriors Water Polo Club, as well as the Thompson Estate Little Athletics. I congratulate everyone involved in the organisation of the Crackerjack festival and I invite all members to get in early and book a table for next year’s Crackerjack Ball. <Hansard-Speech-End>
