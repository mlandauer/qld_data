 Honourable members, I wish to acknowledge the numerous messages of condolence and support from our colleagues and friends from the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and individual parliaments across Australia and the Commonwealth who contacted the Queensland parliament during our recent floods.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, the Queensland parliament yesterday achieved a new milestone in openness and accountability with the launch of the broadcast on demand service, which will allow people to watch parliament on replay online. Broadcast on demand is an archive of the parliament’s live video broadcast that will allow anyone with internet access to watch parliamentary proceedings at a later point in time--at a time of their choosing. From yesterday, the broadcast of the proceedings will be stored and available to view on replay on the parliament’s website. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000944"></A>
The online record of proceedings will feature a camera icon at various points throughout the document--for example, in the left margin alongside the start of each member’s speech or statement and at the commencement of question time. By clicking on this icon people will be able to watch online a video replay of the proceedings of the parliament from that point onwards. The on-demand broadcast footage will become available at the time the <Hansard-Italic>
Record of Proceedings</Hansard-Italic>
 is published throughout a sitting day, which is at 2 pm, 4 pm and within two hours of the House rising.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000947"></A>
Broadcast on demand is the third and final stage of the broadcast of parliament initiative that started with the live audio broadcast of proceedings in 2003 and which was followed by the live audiovisual broadcast in 2007. The live broadcasts over the internet will continue, with the new broadcast on demand capability to operate in addition to those. Technical aspects of the new service and user feedback will be monitored during a six-month introductory phase, so I encourage members to provide any feedback.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<A ID="pgfId-1000998"></A>
Robert William Scott--better known to us as Bob--was born in Gordonvale on 28 September 1931. I acknowledge today the presence of his wife, Jenny Scott, son Keith and other family members, who I think are about to join us in the gallery. I also acknowledge the presence of a long-serving colleague of Bob Scott, Manfred Cross, a former member for Brisbane Central, and his wife, Barbara, and another former member for the seat of Cook--the seat held by Bob Scott--the Hon. Steve Bredhauer, who has joined us.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001000"></A>
Bob Scott was educated at the Gordonvale state schools to subsenior level before qualifying as an electrician in 1952 and later completing an Associate Diploma of Electrical Engineering at the Queensland Institute of Technology in 1970. Bob worked as an electrical engineer for many years for the North Queensland Electricity Board and was later the assistant district engineer for the Far North Queensland Electricity Board in Cairns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001144"></A>
Bob Scott was a true Labor man and a member of the Electrical Trades Union. He was also a member of the Association of Professional Engineers and the Institute of Engineers. Bob Scott joined the Australian Labor Party in 1960 and went on to hold various positions at the local executive level and was also the foundation president of the Cairns branch of the Young Labor Association.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001159"></A>
At the state election of December 1974 Edwin Wallis-Smith retired as the member for Cook and Bob Scott was selected to contest the seat as the ALP candidate. However, Mr Scott was narrowly defeated at the poll by the National Party candidate, Eric Deeral. Not to be deterred, Mr Scott again contested the seat of Cook at the state election of November 1977, this time turning the tables on Mr Deeral in what was another close electoral contest. From that point Bob was to ably represent the vast electorate of Cook until his retirement from this place at the state election of December 1989.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001008"></A>
Bob’s highest priority while representing the people of Cook was to advocate and act for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of not only his own electorate but for all Indigenous Queenslanders. Bob served as opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal and Islander affairs from January to November 1983 and opposition spokesperson on northern development and Aboriginal and Islander affairs from November 1983 to November 1986. Serving in these positions maximised his opportunity to pursue this heartfelt policy area. Bob was very highly regarded by his Indigenous constituents and this respect was born out of his hard work and strong desire to understand their aspirations, to advocate on their behalf and to improve their lot in life.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001182"></A>
Bob Scott was also a very passionate North Queenslander--someone who lived all of his life in that area and who understood many of the issues facing people who lived so far away from the capital city and the issues facing people in the north and the far north of our state and he passionately advocated for them in this chamber. I acknowledged Jenny Scott’s imminent arrival and I am pleased to acknowledge that Jenny Scott has now joined us. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001513"></A>
In 1984 Bob was a member of a parliamentary delegation to Japan and Korea. Lawn bowls was among one of his great loves. He was a member of the Queensland Parliamentary Bowls Club and represented Queensland at a number of the annual interstate parliamentary bowling carnivals during the 1980s. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001011"></A>
It is perhaps poignant that we are marking the passing of Bob Scott today at the same time that our thoughts are with the people of his beloved Far North Queensland who have suffered so greatly at the hands of Cyclone Yasi. Bob, of course, saw many cyclones in his representative years and he worked tirelessly to assist his communities to recover from their impact. Among Bob’s many qualities he was most of all a caring and compassionate man with a huge amount of energy and a determination to represent his sprawling diverse electorate to the very best of his ability. He was well known as a workaholic with enormous energy. He was also well known to many in this chamber and respected across the political divide as a very decent man with strong values who worked hard for the people he represented. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002649"></A>
Since his retirement from this chamber I had the opportunity to run into and meet up with Bob and Jenny on many occasions, and that is because they continued to be so active in their community. I have run into them at community events, at local festivals and at ALP functions. They were people who continued to work and be connected with their community. Whenever I would meet up with Bob he was always cheerful, always enthusiastic about whatever he was doing, always generous with his political advice about what he thought I should be doing, but always delivered with a great deal of care and compassion for the people that he cared so much about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002650"></A>
I know that the people of the electorate of Cook and members of this House will mourn his passing. I know that his passing brings a great loss to his family. He was dearly loved and a great family man. On behalf of the government I take this opportunity to extend my sympathy and that of this House to Mr Scott’s family and to his many friends. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(9.40 am): I rise to speak to the condolence motion on the passing of Robert William Scott, a long serving member of this House, who died on 19 January aged 80. I think it is fair to say that Bob Scott was an old style Labor man. By that I mean he was not a political careerist who knew all of politics but little of life. He had worked, he had got his hands dirty, he had raised a family and he had bettered himself before entering politics. Through ongoing education he rose to the rank of electrical engineer with the North Queensland Electricity Board and at age 46 he won the seat of Cook and represented the electorate for 12 years between November 1977 and December 1989, when he retired. </Hansard-Body>

Bob Scott was born in Gordonvale in 1931. Like Ben Chifley his father was an engine driver. Educated at Gordonvale State School, after subsenior he took up an electrical apprenticeship and qualified as an electrician in 1952. But he did not stop there. He took on further study and qualified as an electrical engineer by first completing an associate diploma in electrical engineering in 1970 aged 39 and then an MIE Australia to become a member of the Association of Professional Engineers and the Institute of Engineers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002659"></A>
Bob Scott was a staunch member of the Electoral Trades Union, the ETU, and it was through this involvement that he joined the Australian Labor Party in 1960. I know that he was a staunch supporter of the ETU. Bob Scott was active in the Labor Party and was nominated to run for the seat of Cook, which he won at the 1977 state election and held for 12 years. His parliamentary career included serving as opposition spokesman on northern development and Aboriginal and Islander affairs and he served on party committees for culture, national parks, mines, energy and police. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002660"></A>
As mentioned, Bob Scott was certainly no political careerist. He qualified as an electrician. He married in 1954 and with wife Jenny raised four children. During those years he studied to become an electrical engineer. He knew a fair bit about life and work and raising a family before he came here. He was a member who represented his electorate faithfully for 12 years. I know that all LNP members join me in noting the passing of Bob Scott and in offering our condolences to Mr Scott’s family, his wife Jenny and their friends. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(9.43 am): For me, Bob Scott was everything a man should be: hardworking, intellectual, caring and kind. He epitomised not just the way a member of parliament should conduct themselves but all men who wish to gain the respect and acceptance of the communities in which they live. Bob was a passionate advocate for change. He represented the most undeveloped electorate in this parliament for what were amongst the darkest days for the Labor Party and, many would argue--especially Bob--the darkest days for this great state. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002667"></A>
When Bob first contested Cook in 1974 Gough Whitlam was PM and Perc Tucker was the leader of the Queensland ALP. In the electoral annihilation of the state ALP that year Bob narrowly lost the seat to Eric Deeral when the National Party ran two candidates only to see their least preferred candidate succeed. I will talk about that on another day. It was ironic that Bob was beaten by Queensland’s only and first Indigenous MP, as few people in the history of this parliament, even to this day, would have done more at a grassroots level to support Indigenous people. He campaigned continuously for a further three years and was elected the member for Cook at his second attempt in 1977. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002668"></A>
Bob by his nature was a non-judgmental man. He was inclined to take you at face value and did not mind what race, gender, colour, culture or sexuality you were as long as you were genuine. He did not mind if you were religious, although he was a dedicated and life-long atheist. He did not have a very high regard for those who professed to be devout but who did not live their lives by very Christian principles. He had firsthand experience of the terrible things some people did in the name of religion to Aboriginal people, especially on the missions. Having said this, Bob did not suffer fools. On one occasion when Steve Bredhauer was the member and minister for main roads he happened to mention to Bob that someone had suggested naming a bridge near Cooktown after a former prominent local National Party identity that neither had a very high regard for. Bob said, ‘At least if you name a bridge after him the next I drive to Cooktown I can say I ran over the bugger.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002669"></A>
Although he was generally tolerant of people’s choices, he did not much like tories, probably for good reason. For one, the National Party government of the day refused to spend any money on infrastructure in the vast seat making it incredibly difficult to get around. Members in those days did not have anywhere near the resources we have today, meaning that people like Bob had to use their own car and hitch plane rides with their federal counterparts just to be able to see their constituents and get a handle on the issues. It was made difficult by the then director of native affairs who, after the demise of the missions, virtually controlled every aspect of the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Bob alluded to him in his maiden speech without naming him and I will do the same here today. He was essentially the last protector of Aborigines in Australia and with political ambitions of his own he later contested the seat for the National Party. He obstructed and denied Bob at every opportunity. But of course the people are not stupid and they kept putting their faith in Bob in greater numbers at each subsequent election that he contested. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002670"></A>
Bob was a Labor man to his boot straps and would proudly fly the Labor flag everywhere he went and in some pretty hostile territory. Around Cook in many rural and remote parts of Queensland he was well-known for his hard work and his integrity. He was a true man of the people, be they farmers, council workers, miners or housewives and there was no doubt he was held in the highest regard by thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who knew him as a friend and a champion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002671"></A>
He once famously kept this parliament going through an all-night sitting as he railed against the injustices and inadequacies of the then Community Services Act. He did not have much time for factional politics or the machinery of the Labor Party, preferring to work his electorate to working the numbers here in Brisbane, and was perceived as a bit of an oddity by his peers; perhaps a bit of a loner. He was an avid reader and knowledgeable on just about any topic and always wanted to test his knowledge and expand it by discussing just about anything with anybody any time. He read almost constantly, even in the car on long drives across his electorate, if Jenny was driving, or on a charter flight by the dim cabin lights or a special book light he always carried. He taught himself to speak and read Italian at quite a competent level. Dimbulah was part of the Cook electorate in those days. There was a lot of Italian migrants there and Bob used to interpret letters and things like that for people. He did that well into his later years as well. Even in the old Joh days, if the Labor Party wanted to filibuster they would just wind Bob up and he could talk for hours about anything, or pretty much nothing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002672"></A>
Family was everything to Bob. He loved Jenny more than anything in the world even though at times they seemed to have their differences. Bob loved his family: his daughters, Janice, Shirley and Desley, and his son Keith and, in spite of a very strict upbringing, they all loved him. Bob also loved his grandkids and would do anything for them. Many of us here in this chamber have spouses or partners and families to support us in our political lives. Some of our families tolerate it and, frankly, some of our families do not much care for the sacrifices we ask of them. In Jenny, Bob had his political soul mate as well as his life partner. They did just about everything together and spent countless hours driving or flying hundreds or thousands of kilometres across the length and breadth of the Cook electorate. They were at every school sports day, country race meeting, rodeo, fete, ball, camp draft or horse sports, wedding or funeral, and mostly they went together. If Bob had a commitment in parliament or elsewhere, Jenny would go ahead into the electorate and meet Bob there or stand in his place. They were a team and a partnership unlike anything else seen in this parliament by members present or past. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003697"></A>
As the member for Cook, Bob increased his margin at successive elections until his retirement in 1989, but sometimes we felt if we could have had both names on the ballot paper we would have scored a few more votes. Bob never surrendered his passion for politics. I remember the day I was sworn into this place, 15 years after Bob retired. He had managed to corner the then Premier, Peter Beattie, on the Speaker’s Green and was giving him the full benefit of his opinion on whatever the issue of the day may have been. Plenty of people were queuing up to see the Premier, but they had to wait until Bob had had his say. Even today, over 20 years since Bob retired, not a week goes by without someone in the electorate asking me how he is going, such was the impact he had on people’s lives. </Hansard-Body>

There are many people who would like to be standing in my place here today, paying their respects to Bob. His successor and my predecessor, Steve Bredhauer, and I both owe much of our political careers to the work put in by Bob. If we were to look around the room and count the number of seats Labor has held continuously since 1977, I doubt we would reach double figures. John Philips is another who would like to pay his respects, as is Senator Jan McLucas, Bob’s longstanding electorate officer Catherine Dunne, John Adams, the Benke family of Cooktown and Daniel Mosby from Masig Island, to name a very few. </Hansard-Body>

Bob spent his entire time in this place in opposition, but he left with a reputation for trying his best and achieving results. Most of all, though, he left with unquestioning integrity. Today we mark the passing of a member of a near extinct breed--one of nature’s true gentlemen. If only more people were like Bob. Goodbye, old friend.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Morayfield--ALP) (9.50 am): I rise to support the condolence motion before the House, which honours the service of Robert William Scott to the people of Queensland. Bob Scott was a good and devoted husband to Jenny and father to Janice, Keith, Shirley and Desley. He often spoke with me about his love for and pride in his family. Following his retirement from parliament, Bob and Jenny moved to Upper Caboolture, which is part of the Morayfield state electorate, and joined the mighty Burpengary branch of the Australian Labor Party. There is no question about Bob’s commitment to the Australian Labor Party. He was a proud member. He was a true believer. He was a supportive comrade. He was a mentor to Labor candidates and Labor members of parliament. Most importantly to me, he was my friend--he was my good friend. </Hansard-Body>

Those who knew Bob would know that words were important to Bob. Bob knew words could educate, inspire and motivate. He knew that words could break down cultural barriers and bring people together. Bob made sure every word counted, that every word had meaning and that he meant every word he spoke. He knew that words were powerful. And, as we have heard from previous speakers today, we know that he had lots of words to offer anyone who would listen. Bob made that clear during his maiden speech in this place in 1978. In that speech, he said rather cheekily, but nonetheless insightfully--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1003718"></A>
I listened with amazement to the utter and absolute piffle that the honourable member for Caboolture went on with in his speech in the Address-in-Reply motion. These speeches are read by the electors and I cannot imagine what they would think of a person who would waste the time of this House by speaking on such trivial matters. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

As we have heard, Bob taught himself the Italian language because many of the Italian migrants in his electorate of Cook had very limited English. Interestingly, when Ken Hayward, the former member for Kallangur, joined this parliament in 1986, he sat next to Bob in this chamber. One day, Ken noticed that Bob was reading something that was not written in English. Ken said, ‘Bob, mate, what are you reading? Is that some foreign language or something?’ Bob responded, ‘Yes, Ken, it’s a foreign language. It’s Italian.’ By learning Italian, Bob did more than just open another channel of communication with people living in the electorate of Cook. By learning Italian, Bob showed that he was a true representative of his community and that he was committed to truly engaging his community in our democracy. Even when it came to Italian, words were important to Bob. </Hansard-Body>

I understand that when Bob retired from this parliament at the 1989 election, he did not give a valedictory speech. When asked why he did not give a valedictory speech, Bob simply answered, ‘If I could not say it during my 12 years in this parliament, what good comes from saying it now?’ Words were important to Bob. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1003722"></A>
Heartbreakingly, for the last few years Bob had the burden of battling the terrible disease of dementia. I would regularly visit Bob at the hospital or at the nursing home, and I was always overwhelmed by Bob’s honesty, and his tireless and continued advocacy for the Australian Labor Party. Even on my last visits to see him at the nursing home, he introduced me to the staff and other residents of the home as their local member. When Jason visited as well, Bob was very excited that two local members were there. Words were important to Bob. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003723"></A>
I saw Bob in the Caboolture Hospital a few days before he passed away. We spoke about his life, about his time as the member for Cook, about his love for his wife and his family, and the Australian Labor Party, and that terrible disease dementia. He wanted me to say something on his behalf in this condolence motion. He wanted me to call on this parliament to support greater research into finding a cure for dementia. It is a terrible disease, as many members would know. Bob wanted this parliament to know that more needs to be done to find a cure. Words were important to Bob. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003724"></A>
Bob was my friend. He taught me many valuable lessons about modesty, humility, integrity, honesty and hard work. He was a great man, and a good and loyal servant of the Australian Labor Party and the people of Queensland, especially the people of the Cook electorate, the people he loved. I hope my words provide honourable members with a small insight into how important he was to the people of Queensland; how important he was to me. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (9.56 am): You would be battling to deliver a better speech than the two previous ones. Certainly I do not intend to try to outshine either of those contributions; they were marvellous. I simply want to say that I knew Bob Scott and I knew him to be the great Labor bloke he was. He was prepared to stand up for the battling classes in this state. He was never frightened to put an opinion forward or to have a good argument if the need arose. He devoted his life to the Labor movement and to the Labor Party. Unselfishly, he gave up his seat before we came to government in 1989. He told me once that the reason for that was that he had had his run and he thought it was time for younger blood to come in. He knew that we were going to win government. There is no doubt that he would have been a minister. He had the capacity and the intelligence to be a minister.</Hansard-Body>

Throughout his long life as a scholar, Bob proved that he understood the need to continue to learn, but he also knew about the business of government. He said that after working for 12 years with Jenny--and it is great to see you up there, Jenny, and the rest of the family--he thought that he did not have another three years in him as the member for Cook, because of the tireless and energetic way he went about the business. He was man enough and unselfish enough to recognise that, and hand it on to Steve Bredhauer. I think it is a rare quality in anybody, let alone a politician, to be unselfish enough to know yourself to that extent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003732"></A>
I do not want to add anymore except to say that Bob Scott was one of nature’s great gentlemen. He was a true soldier of the Labor Party and the working classes of this state. He and his other half, Jenny, were inseparable, both in their efforts in the Labor Party and in their duties as family people. It must be a terrible loss to you, Jenny, as it is to the Labor Party. When he retired, one thing that Bob did was to indulge his passion for the environment. I hope that up at Kuranda those butterflies are still flying beautifully on this occasion. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Pumicestone--ALP) (9.59 am): My husband Jon and I first met Bob and Jenny Scott in Cairns in the early 1980s. Of course, Bob was the state member for Cook then and a very prominent man in the ALP. Both he and Jenny often organised fundraisers with guest speakers for the ALP and it was at these functions that Bob introduced us to John Gayler, who later became the Labor federal member for Leichhardt. He introduced us to Keith De Lacy, the then member for Cairns, and Mr Ed Casey, the former member for Mackay. </Hansard-Body>

During the years--I have been a member of the Labor Party since 1980--our paths have crossed many times. I remember Bob’s selfless support for Labor candidates, especially John Gayler. He helped him to victory in the 1983 federal election. It was always good to have someone like Bob who you could rely on in your corner during an election campaign, and Bob was very reliable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004957"></A>
Not only were Jon and I fortunate to know Bob through the ALP but we were also fortunate to live next door to his niece in Edmonton just south of Cairns. Trish always spoke highly of Bob and Jenny and she visited her uncle and aunty twice while he lived in Morayfield. Trish recalls Bob sending her books from his extensive library on topics she was interested in. As we have already heard from other speakers today, he was an avid reader. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004958"></A>
Imagine our delight when Bob and Jenny Scott turned up in my electorate of Pumicestone in their retirement and those old acquaintances were renewed and strengthened. Of course, Bob was genuinely interested in helping me in my role as the local state member and he always made himself available to hand out how-to-vote cards on election day. His advice was often sought and it was always practical advice. The only election Bob missed was the federal election last year when he was far too ill to assist. </Hansard-Body>

Bob was an avid birdwatcher. When he and Jenny would feel the need for relief from the pressures of parliamentary life they would hook up their camper trailer and follow their long-term love of birdwatching. With their close friends Barbara and Manfred Cross, they covered most of the well-known bird sites in Queensland. With his other good mate Pat Comben by his side, he would go to great lengths looking for a bird that Pat had heard about in a particular location. He would study birds for hours but rarely photographed them. Bob was the first of his birdwatching group to purchase from Germany a Leica spotting scope so he could study at close quarters the wader birds that visited Australia annually from Alaska and Siberia. He would graciously loan his scope to his friends to try who would, in turn, purchase one for themselves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1223761"></A>
Despite the fact that Bob had not been in great health for some time, it was distressing to watch his deterioration over the past couple of years. The last time I visited Bob in the nursing home he said to me, ‘You’re too tall to be Carryn.’ With his passing we have lost a great servant for Queensland, in particular Far North Queensland, and a great servant of the ALP; a thorough gentleman. I offer my sincere condolences to Bob’s wife, Jenny, his children, Janice, Keith, Shirley and Desley, their grandchildren and his friends. My thoughts and prayers are with you all. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The period between 1986 and 1989 was a robust time in this House. Bob was more than at home in those robust circumstances. He brought to that robust time and to the robust style of debate that occurred at that time a certain finesse, the mark of a gentleman. In those days, we used to keep the conversation going until the quite early hours of the morning--and sometimes the quite late hours of the morning. I remember on one occasion that it was sometime after one o’clock and Bob was addressing the House on the question of northern development. At that time there was a little bit of heckling, a little bit of interjection and a little bit of a murmur in the House. The Speaker said--and we have all heard Speakers say this often since then--‘There is too much audible conversation in the House.’ I have always wondered what would be exactly the right amount. But at that time Bob had a response. He said, ‘Thank you, Mr Speaker. I do understand, though, that they’re all very interested in the Cook electorate. I just wish that they could express their interest silently.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1223769"></A>
Bob was always a gentleman. As the honourable member for Morayfield said, Bob liked words and he used them with delicacy and with panache. Bob had extraordinary energy. I remember those late-night sittings and on one occasion I said to Bob, ‘You’ve got a really big electorate. What are you doing?’ He said, ‘Tomorrow I’m going to be in the Torres Strait islands.’ I think it was three o’clock in the morning or something like that. There were no limits to the extent of Bob’s willingness to represent his constituents. I said, ‘This must really take it out of you.’ He said, ‘No, not at all. It’s just that I have this problem. Sometimes I can’t be in two places at the one time. For example, on Labor Day I cannot be in Weipa and I think it is your destiny to go to Weipa and represent me.’ He was meticulous; he never left a stone unturned. Yes, I went to represent Bob at Weipa. It was a great honour to do so and I discovered that he was as much loved there as he was in other parts of his electorate. </Hansard-Body>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110216_101210" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (10.12 am): When severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi ploughed into the Queensland coast, it brought fear, devastation and misery. This destructive cyclone, as we all know, left homes and schools and roads and community halls in ruins, but we will rebuild and emerge from this tragedy stronger. </A></Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005029"></A>
But what we cannot rebuild are those crops--those crucial fields of bananas and sugar cane--that now lie flat and ruined, crippling the livelihoods of our far northern farmers. It is estimated that Yasi has left our northern primary producers with a damage bill in excess of $1 billion, affecting up to 75 per cent of the nation’s banana crop and devastating many sugarcane farmers. And the circumstances of these primary producers, along with other businesses in the north, are unique. This region will face significant economic challenges because of its reliance on a few key industries, such as sugar and bananas, and because it is a long way away from other major centres in terms of competing for recruitment and employment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005030"></A>
That is why this morning, along with the federal Treasurer, Queensland has announced a new package of measures to help local economies rebuild and to help businesses keep their doors open. This package has been developed in consultation with some of the affected communities and some of the major stakeholders and is jointly funded by the Commonwealth and Queensland governments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005031"></A>
The package includes the activation of category C assistance, which entitles small businesses and primary producers to grants of up to $25,000. It also includes the activation of category D natural disaster assistance and other new measures, which will include special concessional loans of up to $650,000 for eligible businesses, primary producers and not-for-profit organisations suffering extreme damage, with a grant component of up to $50,000. It includes wage assistance for employers, including primary producers, equivalent to Newstart for up to 13 weeks to help maintain businesses. This period may be extended to 26 weeks. Finally, it includes a $20 million Rural Resilience Fund, jointly funded--$10 million each--by the federal and Queensland governments, to help fund business and community support activities, such as farm clean-ups, counselling and social support measures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005033"></A>
Many of these assistance measures are modelled on those that were developed for the first time after Cyclone Larry. The member for Hinchinbrook will know that in the case of Cyclone Larry these measures were not activated for some period of time because basically they had to be invented. We have learnt from Cyclone Larry. We are taking that lesson and putting these measures on the ground much, much sooner than happened in the case of Larry. I am very, very pleased that these categories of assistance will be made available to eligible small businesses and primary producers in the local government areas of Burdekin, Cairns, Cassowary Coast, Hinchinbrook, Palm Island, Tablelands, Townsville and Yarrabah. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005039"></A>
While it is too early to estimate the cost of rebuilding infrastructure, the measures announced today, together with funds under the Australian government disaster recovery payments, are expected to deliver in the order of $400 million of assistance to cyclone affected communities in our northern areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005040"></A>
This package is designed to keep business doors open and to keep farm workers in communities. Our government is determined to get all of those who have suffered through the nightmare of Yasi back on their feet and to keep them strong into the future. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110216_101600" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (10.16 am): It is not only primary producers in the north of our state who are suffering as a result of our recent disasters. A number of Queensland’s key industries have been severely impacted over the last two months. Our government is doing everything it can to provide the necessary assistance to get Queensland back in business as soon as possible. Every industry has been affected in different ways, faces different challenges and requires different kinds of work with government. </A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1005044"></A>
The tourism industry has faced a number of challenging years. The global financial crisis brought its own worries, as did the changes to the Australian dollar. But it faces further challenges now in overcoming the incorrect perception that we are closed due to cyclones and floods. The $9.2 billion tourism industry is essential to Queensland’s recovery, as well as the more than 200,000 Queenslanders whose livelihoods rely on it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005045"></A>
Under a joint state and federal government initiative, the tourism industry will receive a $10 million injection to work to overcome some of those perceptions. The tourism industry support package is a vital boost to that recovery effort. The focus of this package will be a major marketing campaign, particularly into New South Wales and Victoria, to inform potential tourists that the best thing they can do to support Queensland right now is to take a holiday where Australia shines. Last week I reinforced this message while addressing national tourism leaders and media representatives in Sydney, assuring them and their clients that Queensland tourism is very much open for business. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005046"></A>
It is not just tourism that needs assistance. Small business, primary producers and the mining industry have all been directly impacted. In the midyear review brought down by the Treasurer shortly before Cyclone Yasi hit, the estimated impact on the coal sector from the December-January floods was $2.5 billion and a further $1 billion impact to our rural sector. My ministers have been working with all levels of industry in these areas, and I have personally spoken directly to key stakeholders, such as the Queensland Farmers Federation, AgForce, Canegrowers, banana farmers and the mining companies about the sort of assistance they need to recover. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005048"></A>
For stakeholders in the mining sector, we need to do everything in our power to fast-track approval processes that will allow them to get their mines operating again. We have now acted fast to approve a number of temporary environmental permits that allow immediate mine dewatering where it is safe and appropriate to do so. Today, over 90 per cent of coalmines in the Bowen, Surat and Clarence-West Moreton basins are operational and producing more coal every day as they work towards a return to full production. I am advised that seven mines, or 13 per cent of the industry, are already producing coal at or near full capacity, while 44 mines, or 82 per cent, are in recovery mode, with production levels varying from 20 to 80 per cent of normal output. Only three coalmines, or five per cent of the industry, have not yet resumed any production. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007750"></A>
Those who had the opportunity to fly over some of these mines during the recent flooding and saw those pits completely full of water would know that that is a remarkable recovery in a short period of time. Obviously, full recovery is some way away for all of them. To see so many of them now operating is important to those local regions and important to the economy of the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007752"></A>
Many small businesses have seen DEEDI’s mobile small business vans travelling into disaster affected parts of the state to offer advice about the range of tools and assistance available to help small business recover. These include increases to the Jobs Assist program to help firms in trouble and advice about Centrelink’s Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy to assist employees who have had a loss of income as a direct result of the flooding or Cyclone Yasi. All industries in Queensland have been affected in some way by these natural disasters and we are committed to continuing to work with peak organisations to get every one of them back on their feet and making the great contribution that they are capable of for the Queensland and national economy. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Cultural Centre, Reopening</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (10.20 am): It was not only industry that felt the impacts of some of our disasters. The arts heart of Queensland, the Cultural Centre at South Bank, has been devastated by these floods. I am very pleased to advise the House that it has reopened today after being closed for a number of weeks. </Hansard-Body>
<DIV>
<IMAGE xml:link="simple" href="2011_02_16_WEEKLY-14.gif" show="embed" actuate="auto"/>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007761"></A>
Since floodwaters inundated the lower-lying facilities of the Queensland Performing Arts Centre, the Queensland Museum South Bank, the Queensland Art Gallery, the State Library of Queensland and the Gallery of Modern Art, a team of contractors and staff have been working round-the-clock to get the centre reopened. I am pleased to advise that the collections were all kept safe. We have not seen any damage to any of the precious collections in any of those institutions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007762"></A>
All of the five buildings sustained damage, particularly to the crucial and complex electrical and mechanical systems. With more than 3.9 million visits recorded across the precinct annually, we wanted to make sure that these buildings and their popular exhibitions were safe and accessible as soon as possible. The centre will be open today so Queenslanders can return to cultural activities and enjoy the exhibitions, the children’s activities, the performances and the services that have made the precinct one of Queensland’s most-loved icons.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007763"></A>
This weekend the precinct will celebrate its reopening with two days of free, fun-filled family activities and, of course, that great Queensland cultural phenomenon, the sausage sizzle. Children and their parents should look out for Jurassic Joe at the Queensland Museum South Bank and the new Megawatt exhibition at the Sciencentre. Children will also love the special story-telling and songs in The Corner at the State Library, not to mention all the amazing art activities at the Art Gallery and GoMA. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007764"></A>
The reopening of the Cultural Centre is also an important signal to visitors from interstate and overseas that the capital city of our state is open for business. It is a great place to visit, to bring your family and to enjoy some of our world-class attractions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007765"></A>
I can also report to the House that while workers were busy returning Brisbane’s Gallery of Modern Art to order, GoMA’s smallest inhabitants have also been hard at work. Many who have seen the current exhibition will have seen the musical artwork by French artist Céleste Boursier-Mougenot called ‘From here to ear’. Céleste’s entrancing sound installation has been one of the most popular artworks in the major exhibition ‘21st Century: Art in the First Decade’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007766"></A>
Filling an entire gallery on level 3 of GoMA, the sound installation is an unconventional musical instrument made entirely of coathangers that is played by small finches, but it is also a fully functional habitat for the finches. In fact, the finches have been so comfortable that a new generation of birds has hatched. I can advise that 40 finch hatchlings were in their custom made nests while the gallery has been closed for the clean-up. It is great to see new life in these disastrous circumstances. The Australian Finch Society has been monitoring food, water and conditions in the gallery to ensure a happy and healthy environment for the birds and their babies.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007767"></A>
I encourage Queenslanders to visit this exhibition. It celebrates the art of the first 10 years of this century. I know that the public will waste no time in visiting our landmark arts facilities.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110216_102357" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (10.23 am): This week Queensland has the pleasure of playing host to an inspirational Canadian visitor. Rick Hansen is a celebrated athlete, a catalyst for change in society’s attitudes and a man dedicated to making a difference. At the age of 15, Rick Hansen sustained a spinal cord injury in a car crash. He was paralysed from the waist down and was forced to slowly come to terms with how to deal with his new life. </A></Hansard-Body>
<DIV>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033682"></A>
After months of rehabilitation, he returned to his first passion, sport. Fuelled by his mantra ‘anything is possible’, he went on to win 19 international wheelchair marathons, including six medals as a Paralympian. Some members will remember Rick Hansen from his legendary Man in Motion World Tour which began in 1985. This was a world tour that he undertook in his wheelchair--wheeling more than 40,000 kilometres through 34 countries to raise awareness about the plight of people with a spinal injury, to challenge prejudices and to raise money for research to find a cure. Through that Man in Motion World Tour he raised $26 million which, in the mid-1980s, was a very considerable amount of money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007772"></A>
This is the 25th anniversary of that Man in Motion World Tour. As I noted at the reception I held for him last night, Rick Hansen did not choose the soft options when he visited Queensland. In fact, he took his wheelchair into Birdsville as part of that journey. He has visited parts of our state that many others have yet to visit. He sought and he achieved a collective shift in consciousness in the belief of the potential of people with disabilities when barriers are removed. He is visiting Queensland, as I said, as part of the 25-year celebrations of his remarkable world tour. In the 25 years since his tour, he has established a foundation that has been instrumental in promoting spinal cord research, rehabilitation and accessibility around the world. The foundation has also raised or leveraged a further $200 million for this research. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007773"></A>
I had the pleasure of meeting Mr Hansen during a recent trade mission to the Americas and took the opportunity then to invite him back to Queensland. At the reception I hosted in his honour last night we celebrated some local heroes who are making a difference in the field of disability. Mr Hansen announced the Rick Hansen Foundation’s Difference Maker Awards. I would like to pay tribute to the two Queensland winners of those awards: firstly, Mr Ian Chill, who will be well known to people in Cairns. He is a paraplegic and has done remarkable work in this field. The second winner is Dr Vernon Hill of the PA. He is a very long-term researcher and one of the founders of the spinal injuries unit at the PA Hospital. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007774"></A>
I would like to take the opportunity to also congratulate the Spinal Injuries Association’s Inclusive Community Champion Award winners. For North Queensland, Decision Easy from Cairns walked away with the award. In Central Queensland the winner was the Hinkler Hall of Aviation and café in Bundaberg. It was well deserved. The south coast Queensland winner was the Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve. The Queensland winner overall was the Portside Wharf and Cruise Terminal in Brisbane. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007775"></A>
The Queensland government has entered into a research alliance with the Rick Hansen Foundation in Canada with a $1 million grant. That is a joint initiative of the Queensland University of Technology, the PA Hospital, the Rick Hansen Institute, the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research in Canada, the Queensland Clinical Trial Network and Griffith University. The project includes the implementation of the Rick Hansen Spinal Cord Injury Registry in Queensland. This is a leading-edge, one-of-a-kind spinal cord injury observational database that will enable researchers to collect information on people with spinal cord injury, link clinical trials information and ultimately improve treatment. This will be the first Rick Hansen registry outside of Canada. I hope it is the beginning of many around Australia and around the world.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007777"></A>
Queensland is lucky to have world-class researchers in this field. It was a great honour for us to have our name associated with a prestigious research institute like the Rick Hansen Foundation. It was also a great honour and a great inspiration to many people who came to the reception last night who are living with a spinal cord injury, who are caring for someone with a spinal cord injury or those who love or have a family member with a spinal cord injury. Those people need inspiration in their lives and Rick Hansen is a burning symbol of what can be achieved. <Hansard-Speech-End>

So many have experienced unimaginable tragedy, having been subjected to devastating weather events on a scale unlike anything ever seen before. First there were the floods, unprecedented in their spread and reach, and then almost immediately after this we saw the fury of Cyclone Yasi and the destruction it left in its path. </A></Hansard-Body>

It is true to say that in recent weeks Queenslanders have been knocked down time and time again, yet they have continued to pull together, to get up and to rebuild. They have done this with great courage, but we must also remember that, for all of the tough times had already, there are still many tough times to come. A lot of people will have the support of family and friends to help get them through, but many will also try to pick up the pieces and carry the load alone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007823"></A>
For all of our strength and our Queensland spirit, we must remember that no-one is immune to the impacts of the events of recent weeks. In times like this, it is important to look after our mental health and the mental health and wellbeing of our family, friends and neighbours. We must put our pride to one side and ask for help when we need it--whether it is a shoulder to lean on or someone to talk to. Stoicism is admirable but only to a point. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007824"></A>
We want everyone to know that if you need extra support it is here for you. That is why Queensland Health has been out on the front line in those areas affected by the events of recent weeks--in neighbourhoods, in evacuation centres, in recovery centres and visiting door to door where it is needed. We have deployed mental health outreach teams to flood affected communities throughout the state--from Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley to Theodore, Rockhampton and Emerald. This included a deployment of 104 psychological first aid trained emergency, community and mental health staff in some of the hardest hit regions of the Lockyer Valley--lending support as communities attempt to come to terms with the terrible events that have changed their lives forever. These teams have been led by mental health staff from the Ipswich and West Moreton Mental Health Service. The Lockyer Valley region has been further supported by teams of mental health professionals from New South Wales. A Victorian team has also supported communities in Theodore and Emerald. We also welcomed the assistance of world-leading experts in this field--former Australian of the Year, Professor Patrick McGorry, and Professor Beverley Raphael, both of whom I met--who helped to share their experience with our mental health teams in the field. </Hansard-Body>

After Cyclone Yasi, our Queensland Health staff were again out on the front line. In Townsville, an extra eight mental health nurses were on hand to provide additional support and to relieve those staff affected by the cyclone themselves. A team of seven medical staff and mental health nurses accompanied and remained with in-patients transferred from Cairns Base Hospital during the evacuation to Brisbane. A team of six Brisbane based mental health nurses supported the Cairns team in the return of these patients to Cairns. A further team of five psychological first aid trained staff continue to support the Cairns mental health services. These staff include nurses, social workers and Indigenous health workers who are operating from Cairns to provide support to the worst affected areas of Tully and Mission Beach. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007828"></A>
These teams, like our teams in the floods, are visiting recovery centres as well as going door to door where it is needed. People can also speak to their GP, phone 13HEALTH or speak to their local community mental health service. We have continued to work closely with organisations, including Lifeline and the Red Cross, in this recovery effort. I want to make the point personally that problems may not manifest immediately for all people, so if they do appear in a little while’s time we would ask that people seek help at that time as well. If honourable members detect this in their constituents, I would implore them to suggest this to their constituents as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007829"></A>
I also want to take this opportunity to thank our Queensland Health staff who are out there every day doing this important work, and many of them have had their own families or homes directly affected. Their contribution is helping to make a difference for so many, and they will play an integral role in the recovery and rebuilding of these communities, not just in the immediate weeks of the aftermath but for a long time to come. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007830"></A>
As Queenslanders, I know we will come through this, but it will be a long and difficult road for many and it is something we cannot do alone. However, it can be made easier when we reach out for help in the times we need it most, and we are making sure our mental health professionals and Queensland Health staff are there every step of the way. On a personal note, I also thank both the Minister for Local Government, who is a clinical psychologist herself, and the member for Gaven, who is a general practitioner. They are both good sounding boards and can be used as a source for their perspectives on these issues throughout this crisis. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (10.33 am): While the emotional and personal cost of the summer’s natural disasters can probably never be truly measured, the full economic and fiscal impact will emerge over time. Late last month, the government released the midyear fiscal and economic review, which took into account the devastating effects of the floods which hit almost three-quarters of the state. The review revised down economic growth from 3 per cent in last June’s budget to 1 per cent for this financial year. It also estimated a damage bill of around $5 billion--25 per cent, or $1.25 billion, of this to be borne by the state.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007839"></A>
It is clear that the January floods took the long handle to our economy and to the Queensland budget. However, as Queensland braced itself for a second natural disaster of an almost unprecedented scale, so too did our economy. I can advise the House that Treasury has completed its preliminary estimates of the fiscal and economic damage bill from Cyclone Yasi. It is expected that the restoration and reconstruction effort following Yasi will total approximately $800 million--our share will be $200 million. This outstrips the combined Cyclones Larry and Monica bill of $480 million. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007840"></A>
As we have previously said, the government was very aware in putting together the midyear budget update that the threat of natural disasters had not passed at that stage. Today, the Yasi cost brings our exposure to around $1.45 billion, within the expected $1.5 billion we have set aside from the expected proceeds of the Abbot Point long-term lease transaction.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007841"></A>
As with the floods and most natural disasters, it was the road and transport infrastructure that sustained the most damage and which is the largest part of the Yasi bill. There will also be a further hit to our economic growth, with a loss of production that will cut our projected growth rate further for this year down to around one per cent. This will be realised through losses in the tourism industry and additional delays or losses to coal exports but, most significantly, Yasi has hammered the Far North rural sector. Hits to the sugar and banana industries are the most significant, with the losses in sugar likely to be recorded next financial year also. As I said when delivering the midyear review, this is by no means the final bill. These are preliminary estimates--this year’s budget will still be calculating the massive effort required this year, next year and beyond.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007842"></A>
With regard to the costs to be borne from disasters, there has been a broader debate about the state’s insurance arrangements. It is important that this debate be conducted from a factual basis. Firstly, the Queensland government does have extensive insurance coverage. In fact, it is a matter of record that the Queensland Government Insurance Fund was instigated under this government. It holds funds of $900 million. Agencies across government pay an annual premium into the fund, determined by the State Actuary. The fund meets the costs for a range of events--damage, theft, vandalism and other incidents that can occur on government property or through government agencies. The state’s insurance fund is not reinsured. In lay terms, this means it is not doubly insured. That is, a premium is not paid to a private reinsurance company to further underwrite claims. The fund is judged to be sufficient of itself. This policy position was considered at length, through a two-year process, which concluded in 2004 to not pay a reinsurance premium for the fund. This was last re-assessed formally by the Insurance Commissioner in 2009, and the original policy decision was affirmed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007843"></A>
The second major aspect to this debate is the nature of natural disaster insurance maintained for the infrastructure assets of the state. I am still unaware of any government in Australia that has natural disaster insurance which would have covered the losses from the event in Queensland. Of those states which do pay a premium to a private insurance company, it is the norm that, firstly, council owned infrastructure is not insured and not included and, secondly, roads are excluded from the policy. This is an important point. The damage bill from the floods had been estimated at $5 billion, as I said. Of this, $2 billion was for local government infrastructure and $2.5 billion was for the road network. That equates to $4.5 billion worth of costs that would not be covered under the insurance coverage some other states hold. This is an important point, and most of those who have entered this debate have set aside that point for their own convenience.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007844"></A>
Queensland is a signatory to the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, as is every other state and territory. These are the same arrangements that have been in place for decades. This includes the cost split of 75-25 for major natural disasters--the same split applies in each state and territory. There is no special arrangement for Queensland. It has been this government’s policy position that the NDRRA mechanism should have the primary role in funding disaster recovery. This position has been shared by previous governments of both political persuasions. It is also the position of the Commonwealth--a policy in fact implemented by the Howard government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007845"></A>
I have noted with interest recent comments from unnamed industry sources that natural disaster insurance for Queensland is readily available. Previous market soundings have indicated that an insurance premium would likely be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. It would also involve a complex, lengthy and costly due diligence process. This is not just a matter of ringing different companies to get a better quote on your home and contents insurance. Acknowledging the facts in this debate makes this easier to digest. Unfortunately, as so many know only too well, Queensland is far more prone to natural disasters than other states. We have a state and local government road network in excess of 170,000 kilometres and we are decentralised, with a broad range of infrastructure assets spread across vast regions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007846"></A>
There are no off-the-shelf products that provide comprehensive coverage for a state like ours. I must point out that the state does maintain insurance arrangements outside the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. Economic infrastructure like the Gateway and Logan motorways, Suncorp Stadium and other major sport facilities are all covered. Our port, electricity and rail corporations have their own insurance and other infrastructure not covered under the NDRRA, such as the car park at South Bank to use but one example, falls under the Queensland Government Insurance Fund. Queensland will continue to access the longstanding Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements; so will every other state and territory, as has been done for generations. The state’s insurance and disaster relief arrangements are long standing. They are neither negligent nor unusual. Of course, the events of the last week invite these issues to be revisited. The government is open to this debate, but we are keen for it to be conducted on the basis of the facts.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (10.40 am): Queenslanders have done an extraordinary job looking after Queenslanders in the last two months when Mother Nature has thrown nearly everything she has got to throw at us. We are not people prepared to abandon our friends and our mates and our neighbours if they are in difficulty. Instead the mud army of volunteers, Emergency Services staff, the Army and organisations such as QBuild were all there in our darkest hours. I will speak at greater length later when I have an opportunity about QBuild, but suffice it to say that QBuild has been able to respond to 600 government buildings throughout the state with the 1,200 day labour people that we have and the army of subcontractors that are tied to them. During the flood crisis the Sales and Distribution Service of the Department of Public Works provided more than 215,000 essential items to flood affected communities. These included water, food packs, air mattresses, bed pumps, high-pressure water cleaners, insect repellent, baby bottles, baby formula, baby wipes, gum boots and disinfectant.</Hansard-Body>

In response to Cyclone Yasi, QFleet made 119 vehicles available for recovery work. The current stock available in Cairns is now 18 vehicles, with this figure likely to increase as additional vehicles are trucked in from Brisbane, Rockhampton and Townsville and with some new purchases in Cairns. In Toowoomba four 4x4 vehicles were needed to get into flood affected areas. Goprint worked around the clock during the flood crisis in close collaboration with the Department of Communities to print daily newsletters providing important information to residents in flood affected areas. Project Services has carried out nearly 500 structural assessments and condition assessments on much of the state’s vital built infrastructure, including Queensland’s iconic buildings. The Shared Service Agency and CorpTech ensured pays were processed on time despite some of the significant challenges, such as the basement of the Neville Bonner Building data centre being flooded.

Finally, from Christmas eve to 10 February Smart Service Queensland responded to more than 145,000 calls through the SES community recovery and the Premier’s disaster relief lines. Further, it had almost two million hits to the flood website and 41,000 hits to the cyclone website and took more than $39 million in donations to the Premier’s disaster relief fund. The Department of Public Works has a proud history of building Queensland. It has an even prouder one now of supporting Queenslanders.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (10.43 am): Since Christmas eve, as we all know, three cyclones--Tasha, Anthony and supercyclone Yasi--have swept into Queensland. Adding to the misery, massive floods devastated Brisbane and central and southern Queensland. This was a disaster on an unprecedented scale, but the response from emergency services workers was outstanding. As Minister for Energy I want to take this opportunity to recognise and thank the dedicated Ergon and Energex crews responsible for restoring power to hundreds of thousands of properties impacted by these natural disasters. More than 2,000 staff have been involved in rebuilding and reconnecting the state’s power networks. It is the largest deployment of electricity field staff in Australia’s history.</Hansard-Body>

Around 200,000 customers from Mackay to Cairns lost power during Tropical Cyclone Yasi as power poles were snapped and wires were whipped away by the wild winds. Despite dreadful conditions, the hard work and expertise of the Ergon crews backed up by their Energex and interstate colleagues saw all but 20,000 of the 200,000 properties blacked out restored within a week--a remarkable effort. To put this into perspective, when Cyclone Larry hit in 2006 approximately 90,000 premises lost power and 15,000 were still without electricity a week later. Unfortunately, problems in areas hardest hit by Cyclone Yasi are not over yet. Safety, however, is the prime concern. Some properties are so extensively damaged it could take weeks, if not months, before electricity can be safely restored.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131792"></A>
Ergon is supporting essential infrastructure and facilities in these locations with large mobile generation units while the repair and restoration effort continues. To give members an idea of the scale of the destruction, two high-voltage towers at Cardwell were toppled, more than 22,000 power poles were damaged between Babinda and Cardwell and more than 2,500 kilometres of powerlines were dragged down by the storm. This was an around-the-clock repair job on a massive scale coming only weeks after record floods decimated other parts of the state. I know from meeting many Ergon and Energex staff that they have a deep commitment to restoring power as soon as possible to those impacted by natural disasters, and they perform this work often in the most challenging of circumstances. On behalf of all Queenslanders, I say thankyou to these exceptional Queenslanders. You have yet again proudly served your state.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (10.45 am): The Bligh government is reaching out to students and teachers affected by the devastating floods and Cyclone Yasi. We recognise the importance of supporting Queenslanders emotionally and financially in the days, weeks and months after the disasters. For students who lost clothing, the Bligh government is providing them with two free sets of uniforms which are being supplied through school P&amp;Cs.

Following our request to the federal government, 15 additional chaplains will be sent to schools across the state to provide extra support for students. Child trauma expert Associate Professor Brett McDermott has been engaged to run a series of online forums for teachers to help re-engage students. Experienced and well-respected psychologists Dr Rob Gordon, who works closely with the Australian Red Cross, and Dr Michael Carr-Gregg are also providing advice on how to support affected teachers, students and school staff.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012524"></A>
Special leave arrangements are in place for teachers and students adversely affected by the disasters. Teachers who lost personal teaching resources when their schools were flooded or hit by the cyclone can apply for up to $2,000 to replace it. This joint state and federal government scheme has been increased from $500 to ensure teachers have the tools they need to continue teaching our kids. Schools can also access a range of experts, including guidance officers, youth support coordinators, nurses and other health workers.</Hansard-Body>

More than $2 million worth of goods donated by the community has been collected and distributed to disaster-affected schools, students and families by OneSteel Pty Ltd from its Acacia Ridge warehouse, and I want to acknowledge Tony Schreiber and the extraordinary role that he is playing in that regard. These goods, donated by generous individuals, businesses and organisations, include more than $1 million worth of computer software, 60,000 pairs of shoes, tens of thousands of books and 2,000 backpacks. At last count, more than about 10,000 packages of these supplies had been sent out to schools.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012530"></A>
Tomorrow is the SchoolAid Floods Relief Appeal to raise funds for affected Queenslanders. I encourage all Queensland schools to get involved--indeed, I encourage all Australian schools to get involved--by observing a minute’s silence, lowering flags to half-mast and making a gold coin donation. While returning to school was a big step in the right direction for students and teachers affected by the disasters, we recognise it will, for many, be a long time before life returns to normal. The Bligh government will continue to support them in every way possible to ensure they can continue their important learning and teaching journey.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Before proceeding further, it is worthwhile recapping on the genesis of this review. Soon after the federal election, held on 21 August 2010, a spokesman from the Australian Electoral Commission raised public concerns about the level of unintended informal voting that occurred in Queensland. The concern articulated at the time was that the level of unintended informal voting may be attributed to differences between the voting systems in play at state and federal levels. At the state level, Queensland adopted optional preferential voting in the early 1990s while full preferential voting is used for federal elections.</A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1015760"></A>
The Queensland government has now had an opportunity to complete its assessment of a number of issues arising out of the 2010 federal election, including informal voting, and this week’s sitting provides the first opportunity to update the House on the government’s deliberations. The government’s view of the assessment is that the evidence is equivocal and insufficient to support a change to the voting system at this time. The evidence is inconclusive in relation to the issue of concern for the government and others in the community--that voters were potentially being disenfranchised because of the different systems in use at state and federal elections. This issue was of significant concern to the government and prompted our action to conduct this assessment following public comments made by the Australian Electoral Commission. This is because the Australian Labor Party is, as it always has been, committed to ensuring that all citizens can participate in the democratic process to the maximum possible extent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015761"></A>
While the assessment shows that the rate of informal voting in Queensland increased slightly at the 2010 federal election to 5.45 per cent, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the differences in electoral systems were responsible. There may be other factors at play, including an increased number of blank ballot papers. The Australian Electoral Commission is conducting its own review of voting patterns in the 2010 election. However, given that our own assessment shows that the reasons behind the rate of informal voting are inconclusive, the government has decided that certainty is required and that it is unnecessary to delay a decision on this matter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018998"></A>
Obviously, this is an area that will be subject to ongoing analysis, scrutiny and review by the Australian Electoral Commission and others to determine whether voting patterns and trends vary. The government has given a considered and measured response to this issue, rather than rushing out into the public arena with a knee-jerk reaction. The end result is that optional preferential voting will be used at the next Queensland election, which is due in March 2012. The review will be available on the website of the Department of Justice and Attorney-General later today.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Road crews and contractors have been working hard since Christmas to help reconnect communities and get vital supplies into the worst hit areas. Around 1,200 roadworkers swung into immediate action. They are very much a part of each local community that has been deeply affected by the tragedy upon tragedy that marked the start of this year. Many had their own flood and cyclone battles on the home front, but they put their community’s needs ahead of their own. Through their efforts, they have helped save lives and made life just that little bit easier for the rest of us, opening up the highways so that fresh food supplies can once again line the supermarket shelves.</Hansard-Body>

Whilst the full extent of the damage to our state controlled road network will not be known for many months, our people are still out there fixing. We are talking about an unprecedented long-term repair job brought about by one of the worst natural disasters in our state’s history. It is the biggest workforce deployment in our history. And mark my words: Main Roads crews are moving heaven and earth to get those roads fixed as swiftly as they can. We have engineers, geotechnical experts, surveyors, bridge and transport inspectors, road builders and pavement testers working hard to repair those flood damaged roads as swiftly as possible. We are on the road to recovery, due in no small part to the efforts of the men and women who work on our road network.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(11.00 am): My first question without notice is to the Premier. On 18 October 2010 state cabinet received a briefing from the head of the Bureau of Meteorology on the severity of the pending natural disaster season. I ask: in relation to this brief will the Premier today release all documents provided to state cabinet, along with the minutes of the meeting, so that Queenslanders can have access to this important information? </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1019141"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for his question. If I understand it rightly, he is asking for documents in relation to the briefing provided by the Bureau of Meteorology. The presentation made was a PowerPoint presentation. I do not see any problem with that being made public. It was material that was on the bureau’s website, or some interpretation of that data. The material was then subsequently put into the public arena by myself at a press conference and, if my memory serves me correctly, Jim Davidson from the bureau attended that press conference. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019142"></A>
I do think it is a great credit to the bureau that it identified the likelihood of an extreme summer wet season and brought it to the attention of government and the public. What it meant was that councils across the state were then in a position to make appropriate arrangements and that state government agencies were in a position to make arrangements so that we made sure that key personnel were not on leave at the time when this might be a critical issue. Warnings were given to the public, both through local government and through radio ads, that there might be weather that would require them to take certain action and gave advice about what to do in a cyclone et cetera. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019143"></A>
Our emergency services were better prepared as a result of the information provided by the bureau not only to the cabinet, but also to the public and to any councils that sought further detail from them. I think that we can be very grateful that modern forecasting gives us the opportunity to have so much warning. Seeing the damage caused by the category 5 cyclone that crossed the coast predominantly in the electorate of the member for Hinchinbrook, one can only begin to imagine what it must have been like on Christmas Eve in 1974 in Darwin when people had little or no warning, where people were asleep when something of that force and that magnitude hit without any preparation. Again I can only imagine what it was like for people in Innisfail and Mackay in 1918 when similar level cyclones crossed the coast. They had no satellites, no radars, no warning, no ability to protect themselves or their families. I am very grateful for the work that gave us an opportunity to be prepared not only in the days leading up to the event but in the months preceding it. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My second question without notice is to the Attorney-General. While it is acknowledged that some insurance companies have acted responsibly in relation to the floods and cyclones, others have acted with no compassion whatsoever, and I ask: is the government currently providing legal aid assistance to those victims in need of advice who are battling insurance companies?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019148"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for the question. The short answer is yes. We have developed an extraordinarily comprehensive legal response package for Queenslanders affected by floods and cyclones called Flood and Cyclone Legal Help. This is a package of initiatives that the government, in partnership with the legal profession, is rolling out throughout Queensland. I particularly want to acknowledge a number of bodies that have assisted Legal Aid Queensland, which is leading the project, in presenting and developing this package for affected Queenslanders. They include the Queensland Law Society, the Bar Association of Queensland, the Queensland Association of Independent Legal Services. In particular I want to acknowledge the leadership of Scott McDougall who is the coordinator of the Caxton Legal Centre and has been a strong voice for volunteer legal community groups in that process. We are working with other agencies of government, in particular the Department of Communities, to deliver that service initially through recovery centres throughout Queensland and now we are holding a number of public meetings to consult with affected Queenslanders and to provide them with advice and assistance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019151"></A>
Just last night there was a public meeting that was held in the suburb of Oxley. Those of us who went to Oxley and helped clean some of those houses on the Saturday after the flood struck Brisbane know how devastating the flood was to that part of Brisbane. It was one small example of the devastation suffered by many other suburbs throughout Brisbane and other places throughout Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019152"></A>
It is a very positive process. As the Leader of the Opposition will know, the federal government has been very strong in advocating for affected communities and taking the fight right up to insurers, as has the state government. The Assistant Treasurer Bill Shorten, the Commonwealth Treasurer Wayne Swan, the state Treasurer Andrew Fraser, and all members of this side of the House in the condolence motion yesterday--particularly the members for Bundamba and Ipswich West--have all been calling on insurers to do the right thing, calling on insurers to put their hands out to help Queenslanders who have been affected and not hide behind strict formal legalism to get away from or around or over or through what is their obligation to Queenslanders in distress. I do acknowledge the advocacy of all members of this House, including the member for Lockyer and others who have been so terribly affected by the floods. As one, we call on insurers to do the right thing, to support Queenslanders in distress and to put their hands in their pockets to help Queenslanders at this difficult time.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SHINE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Premier. Could the Premier update the House on how the SMS alert system worked during the cyclone and floods and the performance of the State Disaster Management Group during this unprecedented period in our history? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019157"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. I think one of the great things about Australia is that we learn from the experiences that we have and we share those learnings across the country. After the Victorian bushfires, through the Council of Australian Governments and the Ministerial Council for Police and Emergency Management, attended by the Hon. Neil Roberts, there was a great deal of work done about how we could use modern technology better to alert people to imminent danger from natural events. Out of that process the state governments of Australia with the federal government agreed to a nationally uniform emergency alert system using SMS and landline telephones. That system had probably its biggest and most significant test anywhere in the country during the recent events experienced here in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019158"></A>
In total, across both disasters there were 53 separate warning alerts sent out using the state-wide system to 5.6 million mobile and landline phones. This was an extraordinary effort and what it meant was that, for example, during the flood crisis, 37 separate warnings to 1.2 million phones and during Yasi 16 separate warnings to 4.4 million phones. That is through the state disaster management process. In addition, a number of local councils have their own system with their own constituents. I know, for example, the mayor of Emerald used that very effectively during the flooding event in that town.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019159"></A>
It is something that we are going to see more of. From talking to people in places like Emerald, I know just how useful it was. Not everybody is at home watching TV and not everybody has the radio on. Early on in some of those events, people lost power and, therefore, were cut off from normal media avenues. Mobile phones, while they continue to work, and landlines are a potential source of getting out information. We will continue to refine the system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019160"></A>
No alert is possible or useful unless we have forecast information to tell people. In that regard, I want to recognise the work done by some of our senior people over the past eight weeks. Jim Davidson, known to many as the face of the Bureau of Meteorology, has four decades of experience. He is someone in whom you can have a lot of confidence. He was backed up by expert hydrologists, Peter Baddeley and Jimmy Stuart, who were assisted by an expert in storm surge, Robert Schwartz. Between those people, in most instances we saw an incredible degree of precision. The peaks of rivers were predicted accurately to within half a metre and, in most cases, to within the hour that they arrived. That allowed for necessary planning. Similarly, in relation to the cyclone, I think they picked the crossing spot almost exactly and the time to within the hour. It was a remarkable team and I pay tribute to them. I accept that there are some questions remaining about events, particularly in Toowoomba. Those will be answered following the commission of inquiry. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022549"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Premier. I refer to the Premier’s statement on Friday that she supported local government claims for Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements funding for water, sewerage and transport services. Has the Premier written to the federal government in accordance with section 3.6.3 of the disaster arrangements claiming special circumstances apply to those services and will the Premier publicly release the letter today for the benefit of all Queenslanders? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022553"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I can advise the House that I have done better than write a letter. I have had a personal meeting with the Prime Minister on this issue. As a result of that, there is now a team involving the federal Treasurer, the state Treasurer, Andrew Fraser, and federal and state Treasury officials who will work through some of the complexities in relation to this issue. For the benefit of the House, I point out that the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements do not provide for the payment of funds for certain kinds of infrastructure, particularly those for which a fee for service is charged, particularly where those fees for services provide a profit to the organisation concerned. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022556"></A>
The provision of water and sewerage services differs across the councils of Queensland and differs in other councils in other states such as Victoria, parts of which have also been affected by similar disasters. Some councils are asking the federal government to give consideration to extending those financial arrangements to an area that has never been covered and, to my knowledge, has never been paid for. This is a totally unprecedented area of activity for natural disaster relief payments. That is not surprising, because the event we have experienced was an unprecedented event. It was unprecedented in its scale and its scope. As I have noted before, some of the worst impacts have hit our smallest councils. Councils with the least ability to pay, the smallest rate base and that cover a wide area have seen many of their facilities damaged. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022558"></A>
I understand the importance of this to local councils. I understand the impatience and urgency that some councils feel. Equally, it is important to understand that this is an unprecedented area of Commonwealth-State financial relations. You cannot make a commitment without having at least some idea of what it will cost and how you will fund it. That work is happening right now. I assure members and the public that Canberra and the federal government are sympathetic, but quite reasonably they need to know what it is that they would be making contributions to, not only in Queensland but also in other parts of the nation. We will work carefully through those issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022559"></A>
The way we got through this disaster, across all levels of government, was with a degree of patience, goodwill and cooperation. Those three things are going to be needed every single day of the recovery. It is important to put the politics aside as we put the people first. As we work to make it easier for communities, councils and local areas to recover, trying to score political points will not help. Rather than having a public debate about this, we are getting on with the hard yards, we are sitting down and doing the calculations and we are working out what it is that can be paid for. </Hansard-Body>

When we saw the beginnings of the flooding event that we thought would be devastating to Queensland, I established a Premier’s relief fund to take donations from across the state and the nation from people who wanted to lend a helping hand. When I set up that fund, little did we know just how much call would be made on it and how many contributions would be made. As at the close of business yesterday, we had $213,520,780 in the fund. That is the largest relief fund ever raised in Queensland’s history.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022566"></A>
As I noted in my contribution yesterday, we have received donations from people from around the world, we have received donations from people from across the country and we have received an extraordinary contribution from New Zealand of about $2.3 million. However, I have been particularly heartened and touched by stories of children donating their pocket money. The Leader of the Opposition talked about our experience on the telethon and I am sure he had a similar experience to myself of taking calls from age pensioners who would apologise that they could not give more than $10, but they wanted to contribute. We know what a big proportion of their pension $10 is and how much it meant to them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1022567"></A>
We have done a good job of encouraging those contributions, but I need to be honest and say that we need more. As well as our flood victims, people affected by Cyclone Yasi need help. There are people who are going to need our help simply to get back on their feet. Relief funds such as these help people who fall between all of the other safety nets: those people whose insurance does not cover them, those people who are not eligible for some of the other grants, those people who did not have much to start with, those people who need a helping hand not only from the government but also from the community working through funds like this. This will not be an easy task for the people administering the fund or recommending its distribution. Again I pay tribute to the members for Gregory and Rockhampton and to David Hamill and his team. </Hansard-Body>

 They are meeting regularly and are working through some diabolical questions about how to best get the funds to the people who need them most. I pay tribute to those members who, with their communities, have been fundraising. The member for Bulimba raised $27,000 and the member for Ashgrove raised $10,000 by holding community events such as cake stalls and sausage sizzles. People want to be a part of this and they want to help. I encourage other members to talk to people who have held similar events and, where possible, it would be great to see people continuing to hold such events throughout the year. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Natural Resources. I refer to the comments that the Premier made in the parliament twice this morning, referring to the key climate predictive tools now available. For the benefit of the House, I table a copy of the operational procedures for Wivenhoe Dam with half the pages blacked out. I ask: will the minister indicate where in this document the operators of the Wivenhoe Dam are required to be responsive to the SOI index and the La Nina climate cycle? </Hansard-Body>

Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. Of course, that flood manual was released because it is a document that has been referred to the commission of inquiry, as it should be, for the purposes of detailed analysis. I noted a contribution by the member in this morning’s <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
, in which he made the allegation that this flood manual had its genesis following the building of the Wivenhoe Dam. To that extent he is correct. What he is not correct in saying, and what he is deliberately misleading about, is that it has not changed since then. In fact, it has changed on at least seven or eight occasions as a result of detailed knowledge and experience. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025898"></A>
For example, since 1974 and the subsequent building of the Wivenhoe Dam there have been at least two events of 1974 proportions that the dam managers have dealt with and dealt with very successfully. That is to say, there were flood events in South-East Queensland of 1974 proportions that the new Wivenhoe Dam has coped with on two separate occasions. What they had to deal with on this occasion was a flood event at least twice that of 1974--twice that in terms of the amount of water coming into the catchment. So when we consider the contribution of the member for Callide in this morning’s <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
, as usual we should take it with a significant grain of salt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025900"></A>
Back in October last year, what were the member for Callide, the member for Southern Downs and the LNP calling for? They were calling on this government to reduce the flood buffer in Wivenhoe Dam. I did note that, because the LNP has form in trying to rewrite history. Despite being caught out two days ago for removing the offending media release about which the Leader of the Opposition says he has no idea, as is the case on so many occasions, nevertheless two days later it is still not there. The member has had two days to contact his webmaster and tell him to put it back. I do have a copy of it here. So that there is a permanent record of what the LNP said--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1025906"></A>
Mr Seeney said it was time to review management policy so more of the dam could be used for water storage to reduce chances of another water crisis. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025907"></A>
That is, cut into the flood buffer. The simple fact is this: if the LNP were in charge of our dams, more South-East Queenslanders would have been impacted by the January floods than was the case. They were putting at risk the safety of South-East Queenslanders because of a cheap political stunt. I table that media release. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs MILLER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health. Can the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health please inform the House how Queensland Health is supporting Queenslanders in the aftermath of the recent floods and Cyclone Yasi? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025916"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I have had the great pleasure of being out in the electorate of the honourable member twice since the flood events. I have certainly enjoyed her taking me around, showing me issues of interest. I want to make one specific mention--the honourable member mentioned it yesterday--in relation to the churches. It is fashionable in certain quarters to knock churches and their contribution. Like all of us, churches are not perfect. Some of the work they have done, in particular in the member’s electorate, through this flood and cyclone event has been outstanding. I think we should very frankly acknowledge that and the wonderful work they have done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025917"></A>
Ensuring that Queenslanders continue to receive the health care they need was a top priority throughout the recent flood and cyclone disasters. When one looks at cyclone events such as Yasi, which was a category 5 cyclone--and there is no category more serious than a category 5--in which we lost one life, which is one too many, I think it is important to contrast that with what occurred in another developed nation; that is, the United States with Hurricane Katrina. Some 1,860 or more people were lost as a result of that hurricane. In the wash-up and in the examination of these things, that speaks volumes about how we have done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025918"></A>
Of course, in spite of disasters life goes on. Therefore, we need to make sure we are continuing to deal with the necessary issues as part of providing front-line health services. That means we take steps during disasters to make sure we are still providing facilities. For example, when the river split the town of Emerald in two and there was a likelihood of the hospital being flooded, we took the opportunity to evacuate the hospital and set up a temporary facility on the other side. Some people in Emerald asked, ‘Why did you do that? The hospital was not flooded.’ If in the middle of the flood event suddenly the water did come up and inundated the hospital, we would then have had to call on our emergency services workers to divert from their other tasks in order to evacuate the hospital when they should be in a position to actually provide services to other people. Often we do this as a precaution. It is an important thing to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025920"></A>
In Gracemere, a clinic was established in partnership with local doctors and staffed by local nurses and our staff to provide services when Gracemere was cut off. We had the monumental Cairns evacuation, and I pay great credit and tribute to our staff for the way they did that. Queensland Health takes precautions in relation to these events because it is much better to adopt an overly cautious approach in relation to these matters and evacuate, when in retrospect it was not needed, than to not do it in the first place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025922"></A>
In the aftermath, there are very significant efforts in terms of primary healthcare teams, free tetanus immunisations--a number of us have witnessed that throughout Queensland, particularly in flood areas--and 13HEALTH. I have been around the state visiting our Health staff in all sorts of areas, thanking them for the work they have done. I thanked them in Tully, where the roof of the hospital was lost, amongst very significant devastation. This is what the 80,000 people in Queensland Health do every day of the week, and I thank them for it. </Hansard-Body>

Queensland Government Insurance Fund</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is addressed to the Treasurer. In light of the floods and the cyclone affecting Queensland, the Treasurer has previously referred to the Queensland Government Insurance Fund and its reserves of $700 million. Today he has said it is in fact $900 million. Given that there is no reference to those reserves in the midyear financial and economic review, there is no separate fund reported for it in the Queensland Treasury financial statements and there is no mention of it in the budget papers at all, can the Treasurer tell Queenslanders where these funds are physically held, where they are publicly accounted for and how much will be spent on disaster recovery? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025929"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the shadow Treasurer for the question. The existence of the Queensland Government Insurance Fund is so much a secret that, in fact, there is a dedicated page for it on the Treasury website. The important thing about the Queensland Government Insurance Fund is that it was this government that brought it in. Making provision for the future has been a long-term goal during our time in office. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025933"></A>
Earlier this decade the Queensland government--this state government--put in place the Queensland Government Insurance Fund. It presently does have funds in the order of $900 million--that is determined by the State Actuary through the premiums charged to agencies--to ensure that at all times the reserves and the assets held by that fund are sufficient to cover the liabilities of the fund. The State Actuary determines the premium and, more to the point, it is reviewed annually by the State Actuary as to its efficiency.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025937"></A>
Beyond that, the Auditor-General has full access to all those arrangements and accounts for the holdings of the Queensland Government Insurance Fund in the whole-of-government accounts, which of course were signed off by the Auditor-General this year, as they were in each and every previous year. If there is a matter of substance about which the shadow Treasurer has a concern, he is more than able to raise that with the Auditor-General because it has in fact received the sign-off. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025941"></A>
The reality here is that the Queensland Government Insurance Fund is in place primarily to deal with acts of vandalism and damage to property--in circumstances where a school burns down, for instance. A generation ago, when a school burnt down there was no provision made for the ability to recover that property. These days, when a school burns down the recovery cost is not deducted from the education minister’s budget; the Queensland Government Insurance Fund provides the ability to recover that property. That is an important reform. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025943"></A>
It is also there to provide for the sorts of liabilities that a state may acquire. For instance, if someone trips over at the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art, stunned by the art there, and it is deemed to be an act of negligence on the part of the state, it is the Queensland Government Insurance Fund which underwrites that. This is a very important arrangement about satisfying the long-term liabilities of the state. It is also a hallmark of the last generation of the Queensland government--on both sides, I do acknowledge--to fully fund our superannuation liabilities. This is a fund in that vein. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025946"></A>
It is a very good thing that we have this insurance fund. As I said in my earlier remarks, the primary mechanism for dealing with natural disaster is the longstanding Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, which exist in exactly the same terms for each and every state and territory. Beyond those arrangements, we do have levels of commercial insurance for a range of economic infrastructure. Finally, we ensure that, in the end, the ability to recover is put as the priority. As I have said on a number of occasions, that will be the priority for determining the course of the state’s finances in the state budget I expect both this year and beyond. </Hansard-Body>

Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Ipswich West for his question. He is one of the people, of course, who has been dealing so ably with his community and the breadth of his electorate affected by flood and damaged in many particular ways. I know that he has also been working not only with community groups and residents but with his own local businesses to ensure that they have access to support from the state--the arrangements that have been put in place to assist in particular small business, it being vitally important to keep people in jobs at a time like this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025991"></A>
There were many people at the end of 2010 who were firmly in the camp of ‘bring on 2011’. I was one of them. That was because I always had a great deal of optimism about the trajectory of the Queensland economy in 2011. The September state accounts, which are now available, detail and underscore why that optimism was well placed. We saw in the September accounts business investment growing, growing by 3.2 per cent in the first quarter of the financial year and for the second quarter in a row. What that shows is that business investment was returning to the Queensland economy. That was before the two massive LNG projects, which we drove to approval, were sanctioned by those companies and the spend was yet to kick in. So the evidence is clear that business investment was returning as the economic recovery that we were authoring was gaining momentum. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025992"></A>
There is probably no better example of the underlying strength of the Queensland economy before the natural disasters hit, the recovery that was building, than last week’s data on employment from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It was a remarkable result, if probably somewhat an unbelievable result. For the 18th month in a row the Queensland economy generated jobs--4,600 jobs against a record high participation rate, 18 months in a row of jobs generating growth in the Queensland economy. That means that our jobs delivery stands at 83,600, with 16,400 to go. What that means is that we remain on track to deliver on that key election commitment of 100,000 net new jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025993"></A>
The ABS were at pains to caution that data and I, for one, agree with them. Anecdotally, I expect that a great deal of the effects of the natural disasters will flow into the next month’s release from the ABS, and I think we should all wait with caution to see what those figures are. But this government remains determined to deliver and drive on with generating jobs growth. What we need right now are people out there promoting the cause of the Queensland economy, not attacking the Queensland economy. Let us understand that a recovery was building. It was being put in place to generate jobs to drive growth this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025994"></A>
As we reach across the political divide and across the community in order to support individuals, a key part of that is going to be for all sides of this parliament to support growth in the Queensland economy, to talk up the prospects of industries like tourism and agriculture and to support the Queensland economy. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CRIPPS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Public Works. At the 2006 state election the government promised that within 100 days of being elected a construction timetable would be developed for priority areas so that suitable buildings, including schools and TAFE gymnasiums, multipurpose halls, workshops and community entertainment centres, could be constructed to the standards necessary for a cyclone shelter. Will the minister commit to publicly releasing today that timetable for the information of the people of Queensland? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026002"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for his first question in this parliament. Cyclone shelters are a very relevant issue, but, if the honourable member takes the trouble to examine the history of this, what he will know is that we committed to build these as part of the building program subsequent to that decision being made. We can see evidence of that already occurring, with five of them being rolled out in the north. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026003"></A>
Coming out of Cyclone Yasi, and having been in the honourable member’s electorate last week, I think we need to rethink this whole strategy, quite frankly. I have not had a chance to discuss this with the Premier, but my own view is that every single one of those BER buildings that were built in his electorate have managed to withstand this level of cyclonic activity. It would be foolhardy in my view to go out and spend more money when these buildings are already there and have withstood the cyclone. I know from Project Services that those buildings were in fact overdesigned. I was advised last week in Cairns that they were designed to the highest possible standards in that regard. So they have withstood the venom of that cyclone, and one could easily argue, I think, that it would be quite wise at this stage to appraise that set of circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026004"></A>
I was at Silkwood the other day and I observed that the building that had blown away there was one that was funded by the federal government directly to the school. It was not one that was built by the state government and it was not built under our plans. But every other building that I saw had that capacity. Ironically, the Tully State School--the primary school which the honourable member attended--has a brick building that was built in the 1930s and, in my view, would serve very well as an evacuation centre. My personal opinion of the evacuation centre used in Cairns, the Earlville Shopping Centre, is that it was a very informed decision to make, and I think we ought to be concentrating our efforts down that path as well and looking at whether or not there needs to be some subsidy from the public sector to go into that to create an evacuation centre. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026006"></A>
My quick is answer is that the policy that was announced was revisited. There was a desire then to have it as part of the built environment, the normal construction, as Education Queensland did, as one example. I think we really need now to revisit this whole question in terms of whether we want to squander money on evacuation centres that will ultimately not be required. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026015"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. I have stood in this place now on numerous occasions to explain the benefits of South-East Queensland’s new water grid, not just in terms of ensuring that South-East Queensland is drought proof but also in terms of ensuring that there are additional benefits when it comes to challenging times such as we have seen over the last months with those devastating floods in January. Quite simply, the impact of those floods on particularly the Mount Crosby water treatment works meant that a critical part of South-East Queensland’s water grid--the desalination plant at Tugun on the Gold Coast--came into its own in terms of ensuring quality water supplies to the people of South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026021"></A>
At the height of the floods, some 10 tonnes per second of silt and debris were flowing past the treatment plants at Mount Crosby downstream from Wivenhoe Dam. That meant very challenging times for Seqwater workers at that treatment plant, and I will come back to them in a moment. What it meant was that, at the most critical time, as a result of the desalination plant quality water supplies were able to continue, much to the amazement of interstate water authorities who have since contacted Seqwater to find out how they achieved that. Had we not had that desalination plant, then the whole of Brisbane, Logan, Redcliffe, Redlands, Ipswich, up to the Sunshine Coast and northern parts of the Gold Coast would have been boiling their water for days on end as a result of not being able to maintain water quality. It was as a result of being able to fire up that desalination plant that we were able to maintain water quality and not have the third largest city in Australia having to boil water. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026028"></A>
One of the untold stories of this flood is the magnificent work that those workers at Mount Crosby performed in order to maintain some level of throughput. They had lost power. They were working in vertical tunnels of 40 metres, in pitch dark with torches in their mouths, in order to keep switching on and off pumps to maintain some level of treatment coming out of that Mount Crosby plant. They were being flown in by helicopter to change shifts after 12 hours. And I have to say that they were working in the most hazardous of circumstances. It is a story that will be told in far more detail at an appropriate time, but I take this opportunity to place on record my absolute respect and thanks for those workers at Mount Crosby for their bravery and commitment to their posts. They are some of the unsung heroes to date of what happened during those devastating events. </Hansard-Body>

Mr RICKUSS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Premier. Many constituents in my electorate who have been badly affected by storm damage do not qualify for state grants because of the current means test levels. Will the Premier put the people first and please urgently reconsider the means test levels so that these victims can access this much needed money and get on with rebuilding their lives? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029735"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. The member might have heard in my earlier comments about the Premier’s relief fund an acknowledgement that some people, because of their circumstances, do not qualify for other forms of assistance and that is why these sorts of relief funds are so important. The means test that applies to state government assistance is the same means test that applies in every state of Australia and is indexed every year. Therefore, it is the same one that applied to those people in Mackay who had floods in 2008, to those people in Emerald who had floods in 2009 and to those people who experienced the bushfires in Victoria, for example. I appreciate that sometimes these things are very difficult. I know the difficult circumstances being faced by the constituents of the member for Lockyer. I know of his genuine care and compassion for them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029737"></A>
What I can say to the member for Lockyer is that in the design of the allocation of funds from the Premier’s relief fund it will be people like the people in the Lockyer Valley and their circumstances that will be the foundation on which any decisions about the allocation of funds is made. What I would encourage the member to do is to speak to both the member for Gregory and the member for Rockhampton about how to best craft this. The member knows these people’s personal circumstances. I do not think it is in their interests, and nor would he ever seek to, to put their incomes into the public arena. In terms of how that intersects with asset tests et cetera, I think it would be very useful for the member to meet with those members--I am sure they would agree to such a meeting--to make sure that we craft this in such a way that picks up exactly the people it is designed to pick up, and that is those who need it the most and who might otherwise slip through the crack of safety nets that are designed for people who are in absolutely extreme circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029738"></A>
I recognise that there are a number of opportunities for immediate relief through Centrelink that are not means tested. The first round emergency payment out of the fund is not means tested. However, I do have to say that the Australian Taxation Office rules that apply and have applied for, I think, the entire history of the federation requires funds like this to means test second payments to qualify as charitable funds for the purpose of tax deductibility. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029739"></A>
This issue was raised with the Commonwealth at COAG the other day by both me and Ted Baillieu. There has been an agreement that the tax office will look at some of those issues. But we do not want people to be able to put funds together outside of natural disasters for the purpose of tax evasion. It is a fine line to walk. As we did with Cyclone Larry, any means test that is struck will be considerably more generous than applies to government welfare payments to capture and to assist the very people that the member for Lockyer refers to. </Hansard-Body>

Natural Disasters, Schools</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WETTENHALL:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Education and Training. Can the minister please inform the House about the huge effort by the community to get our schools back on their feet after the flooding and Cyclone Yasi? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029746"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. It is somewhat of an untold story what has been done by the community to get two lots of schools--those in South-East Queensland and Central Queensland affected by the floods and then those in the Far North affected by the cyclone--operating again and in a condition where students could return. It has been an extraordinary effort by the larger community, truly making the point, if we did not already know it, that schools are the heart and soul of our community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029750"></A>
If we think about the flood impact not just in Central Queensland but up in Toowoomba, in the Lockyer and down in Brisbane it is worth noting that within one week of those flooding events taking place all but three of 92 schools were able to be reopened for the first day of school this year. Three were not able to be but those school populations were transferred to nearby schools. Some 89 schools out of 92 schools that were flood damaged--this ranged from minor to quite serious flood damage--were able to reopen. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029752"></A>
Why was that possible? Because Education Queensland personnel, QBuild personnel, principals, staff, P&amp;Cs, parents, community volunteers and many others chipped in and achieved that result. Why did they do that? Because they well understood that getting children back into their normal school routine was one of the biggest contributions they could make to helping the families who were flood affected get back to normality and stability, which is absolutely what they needed to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029754"></A>
Likewise, in the Far North and a little further south to Mackay on the day the cyclone hit, some 346 schools--Catholic, state and independent--were closed. That is nearly 25 per cent or nearly a quarter of all of the schools in Queensland. By the Friday, all but around 170 could have reopened. Then over the following week that number was progressively brought down. Only 11 were still shut on Friday and those 11 opened on Monday. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029755"></A>
Again, the same broad community involvement is what brought that about. Thousands and thousands of students were able to get back to school as quickly as possible not only so they could resume their learning journey but to help them readjust and get back into normal life along with their families. I take my hat off to everyone involved in that extraordinary effort. </Hansard-Body>

Woolooga-Eerwah Vale High-Voltage Electricity Transmission Line</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029758"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WELLINGTON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade. I realise everyone has questions about flooding but my question relates to the Woolooga to West Cooroy powerline which the government has been dealing with for some time. Recently one of my constituents told me how they cannot sell their property because once prospective purchasers find out about the proposed powerline’s proximity to their property all negotiations stop. When does the minister anticipate being able to make a decision on both the need for the proposed powerline and the proposed location either via the National Highway corridor or the current Powerlink proposed location? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029761"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. To meet forecast demand to 2050 joint planning by Powerlink and Energex has identified that a new high-voltage electricity transmission line will be needed by around 2014, connecting Powerlink’s existing Woolooga substation to a proposed new substation site at Eerwah Vale. The reason that this matter is somewhat contentious is that, although 90 per cent of the project is planned to be built on existing easements next to existing infrastructure, there is a section of about 8.6 kilometres of the powerline which will require a new 60-metre wide easement. This is what has attracted some controversy and some criticism from the member’s constituents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029765"></A>
That is why an exhaustive process has been undertaken over the last couple of years in terms of Powerlink’s environmental impact assessment. I think it is fair to say that I would share the member’s concern about the length of time it has taken to finalise this matter. What has occurred is that in the intervening period new planning procedures have been put in place by my colleague the Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability in terms of protecting vegetation for koala habitat. Various assessments have been needed to be undertaken in accordance with those planning policies. That has caused a lengthening of the time for Powerlink’s consideration of these matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029766"></A>
I am informed that that work is now nearing completion. That designation then has to come to me for approval and, of course, it has to be exhaustively assessed. I am told that that work will soon be with me. We expect to finalise this project by the middle of this year. We are only a couple of months away from receiving that application from Powerlink. I can assure the member’s constituents--the residents along the proposed corridor--that the 55 submissions that they have put forward with regard to this matter will be considered carefully by both my department and me. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029768"></A>
Based on the member’s advice this morning, I understand there is a view that the road corridor may be wide enough to accommodate this powerline. If that be the case then that will be taken into consideration to verify it and determine the final route. As I said, member for Nicklin, we are literally now only a couple of months away from finalising that matter so that the uncertainty that he referred to in terms of the impact on the local real estate market can be lifted as soon as possible. </Hansard-Body>

Ms GRACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology. Can the minister inform the House about efforts by QBuild to help parts of Queensland affected by flooding and Cyclone Yasi?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029812"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question in relation to the mighty QBuild. As I mentioned this morning, QBuild throughout the state and throughout this disaster period has worked with its contractors on some 600 buildings. There have been 1,200 staff and contractors thrown at this event, and I think the result that the Minister for Education pointed out a short while ago is just one example of their work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029816"></A>
Whether it is in Theodore and coordinating Channel 7’s Bounce Back program and a number of other projects, or whether it is connecting 250 houses in Queensland, or whether it is working with Ergon to coordinate the reconnection of houses in my electorate, or whether it was cleaning up at Cardwell last week and cutting up all the debris with chainsaws--the mighty QBuild have been there. We are the only state which has a day labour workforce of 1,200 people. One of the great benefits of that is you can bring those people in to work at these sorts of times. We would have struggled to get private contractors of that number. I do not know how we would have got 90 of them into Far North Queensland in the last couple of weeks so we could get every single school opened last Monday. Every single school was opened with a genset, coordinated by QBuild in its nerve centre out of the Cairns office. It was a phenomenal activity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029823"></A>
I thank the principal in Tully--and the honourable member might like to pass this on to her--for providing them with a couple of cartons of beer to take on the bus. QBuild was running a bus service down to Cardwell every day. Unfortunately, there was no lavatory on the bus and when I was driving back I noticed that they had to drive into a cane paddock in the member for Mulgrave’s electorate. I did alert the shadow minister to this matter. I guess what it shows is the gratitude that the teachers had for those young workers--and most of them were young people--who got out there and got their schools back in order. Similarly, at the hospital in Tully, they set up my old mate Spanner from Innisfail. </Hansard-Body>

 I am proud of every one of the QBuild workers. Whether it was the people who came over and waded through the water at the Neville Bonner Building to make sure the police pays were processed or whether it was the people who went to Cardwell or any other part of this state, each one of those QBuild workers did a magnificent job. </Hansard-Body>

Water Fluoridation</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029834"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FOLEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Health. Now that it is compulsory for local governments to fluoridate the public supply of drinking water, will the government provide free fluoride filters for the significant number of Queenslanders who do not wish to drink fluoridated water? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029836"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I have got to say that the initiative for fluoridation of our water was not one that occurred during my time as health minister. I regret that because I think it is one of the most important public health initiatives this government has ever had, and I thank the honourable Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy for that wonderful and outstanding initiative that he had that I wholly endorse.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029838"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Seeney:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 He hasn’t done many other things right.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029839"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Well, he did not issue a media release on filling the dam up and then get caught out taking it down. In relation to fluoride, Queenslanders had the worst teeth in Australia and now under fluoridation in the course of time we will have the best teeth because we will have the most extensive network. In addition to the fluoridation policy, the government also met the capital costs of providing that equipment into significant communities in Queensland and the operational costs that are a part of supplying water.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029840"></A>
The issue of supplying filters has been discussed before. The government does not believe it is appropriate to do that at this time. In fact, the government invested very heavily in a number of different initiatives for people to make different sources of water available to them, but we do not believe it is appropriate that we subsidise the provision of filters. The use of a filter for drinking-water purposes only is a fairly modest thing--and there is certainly no suggestion that it be used in relation to shower water and those sorts of things--and we think it is best undertaken by people individually.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029841"></A>
Some people asked at the time why we did not, for example, supply fluoride tablets. The evidence shows that providing fluoride tablets to people in lieu of fluoridation can be far more hazardous because people do not control their doses and people can forget whether they have taken their tablets and then take more of them than they should, so the ability to provide it in a sensible fashion through a fluoridation process is how it goes. Queensland has the most extensive public dental health system in Australia, and that is a good thing. The Commonwealth government is looking at how it might support that even further still, but some things have been tied up in the Senate with the coalition when it comes to further rolling out teeth improvement treatments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029842"></A>
I thank the honourable member for the question. The answer is no, but I do thank again the previous minister for the wonderful public health initiative he made. It is public health initiatives that, frankly, make the biggest difference. You can individually deal with someone or you can deal with a community, and that is why I think this House ought to be justly proud of our initiative. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1029845"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr PITT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland. Will the minister inform the House of the levels of assistance to small businesses and primary producers in the wake of recent natural disasters? Can he advise how many applications have been processed to date by the Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037574"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MULHERIN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question and I thank him for his ongoing support for small businesses and primary producers who have been affected in the wake of the recent flooding and cyclone events. We are committed to providing every assistance which is available to small businesses and primary producers to assist them in rebuilding, replanning and recovering from the widespread effects of these natural disasters that have affected various parts of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037575"></A>
Under the NDRRA--the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements--there are a number of assistance packages that are available to help primary producers and small businesses to get back on their feet. The Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority administers these programs, and I would like to place on record my support and thanks to Colin Holden and his staff at QRAA for the fantastic job they have done. They have been working around the clock since mid-December. They have processed about 1,500 grants under category C since then, with a total value of $2.6 million. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029853"></A>
There are different forms of assistance. Under category B, there is assistance for small businesses and primary producers through concessional loans, which is $250,000 at four per cent, plus a freight subsidy for primary producers, with a maximum of $5,000. Under category C, which requires the Premier to write to the Prime Minister seeking approval, there is a $25,000 grant program. Tier 1 is $5,000 to assist with immediate recovery and tier 2 is up to $20,000 to help effect the repairs to the damage. The Premier and the Deputy Prime Minister this morning announced an extension of category C to a number of areas that were affected by Cyclone Yasi--that is, Burdekin, Cairns, the Cassowary Coast, Hinchinbrook, Palm Island, the Tablelands, Townsville and Yarrabah. There is also a package under category D that was announced by the Premier and the Deputy Prime Minister which will provide further assistance to small businesses and primary producers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029858"></A>
Category D special assistance has only been activated once before, and that was following Cyclone Larry. However, we have learnt a lot from Cyclone Larry in terms of what assistance will aid in the recovery. It is really about tailoring a scheme to meet the demands. Assistance under categories B and C of NDRRA should be, in the majority, sufficient to help primary producers recover, but under category D--</Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Minister for Primary Industries. I refer to the previous question, which the minister just answered, and to the federal activation of category D natural disaster assistance for communities and businesses hit by Cyclone Yasi, and I ask: will the minister advise the House what actions he has taken and what progress is being made to have Darling Downs farmers who have suffered total devastation from the floods similarly declared as category D for natural disaster relief payments and loan subsidies?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033697"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MULHERIN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. Under category D, the package announced today for the Yasi affected area means that there are concessional loans of up to $650,000 with a $50,000 grant program which is based on a 25 per cent component of that. In relation to the area of Central Queensland, South-West Queensland and southern Queensland, the Premier has written to the Prime Minister around category D assistance for places that have been severely impacted. We will continue to negotiate with the Commonwealth government around that assistance, but the general severity of Cyclone Yasi was recognised by the federal government and it made that announcement this morning. I personally have spoken with Joe Ludwig. The protocol is that the Premier must write to the Prime Minister, so we have followed those protocols. I have been involved in discussions with the Treasurer, and the Treasurer is leading the negotiations for the Queensland government in relation to further assistance.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033734"></A>
This truly has been the summer of sorrow as our state and its people have faced unprecedented natural disasters. Just as most of Queensland was recovering from the flooding that swamped Queensland in December and January, Tropical Cyclone Yasi inflicted a path of damage south of Cairns and north of Townsville. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033735"></A>
These have been immense events. We suffered substantial loss of life and people saw their homes destroyed, their lives, livelihoods, businesses and farms overturned and their communities shaken to their foundation. But the endurance and resilience of Queenslanders is remarkable. Together our state and our people will undertake the massive recovery and rebuilding process. The task before us is greater than any we have faced. To meet that task, the government will establish the Queensland Reconstruction Authority to spearhead the work.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033738"></A>
The Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011 will establish an authority to scope and coordinate the state-wide rebuilding program and to cut through red tape and any other barriers that would stand in the way of swift recovery and rebuilding. The QRA will work in cyclone affected communities in North Queensland as well as the 60-plus flood affected communities across the state. Major General Mick Slater will chair the authority, with former Coordinator-General Graeme Newton as the CEO. An office of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority will be established in North Queensland and will be dedicated to cyclone recovery. It will be headed by Chief Superintendent Mike Keating, who will be seconded from the Queensland Police Service.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033749"></A>
Our message is this: no-one and no part of Queensland will be forgotten. The rebuilding of small rural communities is just as important and just as urgent as the rebuilding of the state’s cities and major regional centres. Under the bill, the authority will prioritise the work needed to rebuild community infrastructure and services in flood and cyclone affected communities; it will coordinate and manage the rebuilding and recovery of affected communities, including the repair and rebuilding of community infrastructure and property; and it will coordinate the distribution of financial assistance for affected communities. The bill vests the QRA with significant powers to ensure proper and expedited planning, preparation, coordination and control of development for rebuilding and recovering affected communities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033750"></A>
Local government will retain primary responsibility for land use and building approvals. The QRA will have powers to be exercised within declared areas or projects to expedite or intervene in regulatory decisions or approval processes or directly undertake planning functions or development. This will include the power to compulsorily acquire property required for reconstruction within reconstruction areas, but only where this is strictly necessary for reconstruction or to manage and mitigate the impacts of natural disasters. We intend that these powers be used only by exception and with the full cooperation of local government where absolutely necessary to facilitate the construction effort.</Hansard-Body>

The QRA will work collaboratively with local government and other regulatory agencies to secure appropriate approvals and expedited reconstruction works in the first instance. But the powers granted by the bill will ensure the QRA is able to cut through and intervene by declaring a reconstruction area or project where necessary to expedite reconstruction, recovery and disaster management efforts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033752"></A>
The powers vested with the authority are adopted from existing powers available under various acts--the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971, the Urban Land Development Authority Act 2007 and the Sustainable Planning Act 2009. This will ensure legislative consistency across our planning and development approval laws while centralising relevant planning, decision-making, acquisition and works powers within the QRA.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033758"></A>
Finally, the bill contains a sunset clause to wrap up the QRA after two years, recognising that the focus of the authority will be to fast-track the rebuilding effort and get Queensland back on to a business-as-usual footing as quickly as possible. The work set down for the Queensland Reconstruction Authority cannot be underestimated. The sooner reconstruction commences and is completed, the sooner Queenslanders’ lives can be restored, the sooner our social fabric can be repaired and the sooner our tourism, small businesses, farms, mines and other industries can get back to normal, the sooner we can get our state and national economic growth back on the rails. As Queensland moves from disaster response to disaster recovery, the government will continue to stand alongside our flood and cyclone affected citizens. The Queensland Reconstruction Authority will greatly assist in concentrating the effort to return to normality and beyond as quickly and as effectively as possible, and I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Clayfield--LNP) (12.08 pm): I join in the motion of condolence moved by the Premier. I can only talk of the aching sorrow that I feel for the friends and families of those who perished in the events that have occurred in Queensland--from north to south--since December 2010. In no way can I, of course, feel the pain that those friends and family feel, but my heart does ache for them and for their loss. Can I also acknowledge the contribution of members here yesterday and later on today from across the partisan divide and from across the state. I join with many members in extending my sympathy, support and admiration to the members for Lockyer and Hinchinbrook--two men I am proud to count among my friends. I also commend the work of Ann Rickuss in helping Ian and the people who were so tragically affected in their community.</Hansard-Body>

I am sure I was not the only member in this place to get a little glassy eyed while listening to the member for Lockyer relate the tales of the wall of water that fell upon the towns and hamlets of his electorate. We also heard yesterday of the passion that the member for Hinchinbrook feels for his electorate. I must say that I marvel at his resilience, his perseverance and his humour in the toughest of times--a true North Queenslander. I have listened with a sense of awe and wonder to the stories that have been told in this place, including those relayed by the honourable the Premier and the honourable the Leader of the Opposition. I extend my sympathies to all of those who suffered, whether from the Central Queensland floods, the flash flooding in Toowoomba and the Lockyer, the floods in Ipswich and Brisbane and, of course, severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi. I also express my thanks and admiration to the members of the Queensland Police Service, the emergency services, and all of those who were called upon to help and assist our communities. In particular, I mention, as others have done, Deputy Commissioner Ian Stewart, who did such a tremendous job in leading the disaster team. Who but the most heartless could remain unaffected by the natural forces that have been visited on our great state and who but the most empty and hollow could not feel a sense pride in the way Queenslanders of every stripe and shade came together to help each other, to support each other, to comfort each other--in fact, to display what Abraham Lincoln described as the better angels of our nature. </Hansard-Body>

The effects of the Brisbane floods on the electorate of Clayfield have not factored in too many news stories. They have not made the headlines. That is as it should be when one looks at the devastation suffered in other parts of Queensland. But the grasping tentacles of the floodwaters did extend to the businesses and a few--thankfully a few--homes in Clayfield. Of course, the Emergency Services headquarters building is, in fact, located in my electorate of Clayfield. Thankfully, it remained high and dry. With Breakfast Creek on one boundary, the sleeping leviathan of the Brisbane River on another and the bay on another, the people of Clayfield are always aware of the possibility of flooding. Indeed, it happens on a fairly frequent basis when the king tides flow in and the rain falls. But the magnitude of the wall of water coming down the Brisbane River did stir people into extra action. As the suburbs of Pinkenba and Albion started to look like they would be experiencing a very damp evening, locals, emergency services and the council swung into action. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037610"></A>
The Pinkenba Community Association, through its president, Ted Slater, started contacting local families to find out who was at home, who was on holidays, who was mobile and who was not--in effect, to start putting together an emergency plan, a disaster plan. Names were taken and lists were compiled and people walked the streets knocking on doors to find out the information that would be necessary in case the floodwaters rose. Alice and David Smith from the Pinkenba Community Association spent hours going around and getting those names. Cars were moved to higher ground at the Airport Link storage facility on Eagle Farm Road. Tinnies were unshackled from trailers and tied up to front stair post rails in preparation for the expected deluge and a couple of motors that had not been turned over in a long time were oiled and fuelled up. Sandbags were deployed and as far as things could be prepared they were. So by Wednesday afternoon it was time to visit the Pinkenba boat ramp and view the spectacle of the Brisbane River--the true Queensland spirit: everything that could be done had been done; it was time to go and see what was coming. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037615"></A>
In Albion, local flooding is a regular event. From the Breakfast Creek Hotel to the home of the mighty Brethren at Crosby Park and the Albion fiveways, businesses and homeowners started the sandbagging of premises and homes. I spent hours with Councillor David McLaughlin and my two sons, Jeremy and Duncan, helping with the sandbagging. It was a sight to see my poor old Ford Territory scraping along on its bump stops fully laden with sandbags on more than one occasion. On that note, can I acknowledge the tremendous work done by the volunteers at the depots handing out sandbags. We had one down at Eagle Farm. There was a sense of community as people came together and worked on that equipment that loaded up the sandbags. We had the managers of local businesses driving forklifts to load up the backs of trailers and trucks. We had people from across the suburbs on the northern side coming together to work on those operations. Meanwhile, back at Albion as we unloaded sandbags and as the waters rose up around our legs, we all mucked in to help. I commend all of those who helped in all of those areas. As other members have said, they are largely unnamed and they did not want to go named. They were people who just saw someone doing something and they decided to drop everything and come and help. So we worked as teams all around that area at the back of Albion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037620"></A>
Then the floodwaters came and for the first time in my entire life Kingsford Smith Drive was eerily silent--even at 11 o’clock at night. The road was closed and all you could see under the yellow lights of the pontoons and wharves was this wall of water coming down the river, dragging bits and pieces of everything from further upstream--rubbish bins from Ipswich, lettuces from Rocklea; the whole lot came flying down the river there. That sleeping giant hit at about 4.30 am. As I said, fortunately the suburbs were not badly inundated. The water came up about a metre and a half through Albion and I got a phone call on Thursday morning from the local residents in Pinkenba saying that it was no worse than a king tide, could they have the power back on and they did not know why they wasted all of their time doing it all. But I think they were happy to have had the security that was provided by those sandbags, by those preparations and by the SES who came and helped them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037621"></A>
I acknowledge the tremendous leadership shown in Brisbane by my friend the Lord Mayor Campbell Newman. I think there was no-one who was watching the news or listening to the radio at that time who did not understand the passion he felt and the drive he gave to having in place a disaster management plan that ensured that the people of Brisbane were as well protected as they could be in the circumstances. If ever there was a man for the moment, Campbell was that man. The Brisbane counterdisaster plan flew into action. People were deployed, council officers were sent out and the clean-up was able to start almost immediately. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037622"></A>
On the afternoon before the flood there were calls going out to line up extra evacuation centres. As the heights changed--and people might recall the different predictions about how high the water would go--there were concerns that more people would need to be looked after in evacuation centres and that the centre at the RNA would not be big enough. So the call went out. I made some calls in my part of the world as well for people on the northside. Can I acknowledge here the Brisbane Airport Corporation, which on the Wednesday night had people turning up in the belief that the airport was an evacuation centre. So the airport had to look after 350 people whilst continuing to run the airport. Unbeknown to them, people just turned up. The word had got out. Harvey Lister and the team at AEG Ogden--the company that runs the Brisbane Entertainment Centre at Boondall--required one phone call to say that, yes, of course they would make their premises available. In fact, it was unnecessary but it was made available and staff would be rostered on or would volunteer to come in and man that centre to provide services should it be needed. In fact, the entertainment centre served as a basis of providing services to the northside in the clean-up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037627"></A>
So businesses and community came together on the northside to provide what was needed in Brisbane. Together with federal member Teresa Gambaro, Councillor McLaughlin and I started visiting on the Saturday morning after the clean-up had really got underway, helping businesses primarily with information about accessing the various grants and loans and services that were made available by the state government, by the federal government and by local authorities. I also visited the Doomben racetrack, which was one of the marshalling yards for the volunteers--the magnificent mud army that came together in Brisbane. It was unbelievable to stand there at 7.15 am on a Saturday morning and see the hordes of people just wanting to help, turning up with boots, with shovels--with all of their paraphernalia--wanting to now know how they could help. It was a tremendous outpouring of the strength and community spirit that abounds in Brisbane and on the northside. Hundreds of people who I thought would never have picked up a shovel turned up to help and I am sure they got a few blisters for their troubles on the way through. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037630"></A>
As I said, fortunately the damage in Clayfield was able to be cleaned up without too much trouble. For those members who know that part of the world around Allan Border Field, it is interesting to note that it flooded. Nailed about halfway up a telegraph post was a ‘Speed limit four knots’ sign and a couple of tinnies made their way from the gates--I think they are the Bill Brown gates at Allan Border Field--down Bogan Street at Albion down to Breakfast Creek. So we were watching the speed limit and also observing the road rules of the river in that part of the world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041379"></A>
The mighty Breakfast Creek Hotel, which has been inundated three times since 1893, was back up and running by Australia Day. In fact, on Australia Day it held a fundraiser for flood victims. I have not brought in the T-shirts that were sold at that fundraising appeal to present to you, Mr Speaker; I am going to auction them off at a local event in the next week or so. There was an enormous amount of money raised at the Breakfast Creek Hotel. I commend Sam Gullo and his team at the Breakfast Creek Hotel for what they have done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041382"></A>
I also acknowledge my friend Father Dimitri Tsakas and the Greek community based at South Brisbane for the magnificent contribution they made to the recovery effort in and around Fairfield. A mate of mine, a fellow called Tony Cassimatis, opened up his house and he and his wife made food and sandwiches and acted as a marshalling point in the Fairfield area. They were only metres away from the flood. Tony, his wife and the Greek community did a fantastic job in that part of the world. We came together at the Greek Orthodox Church on that Saturday night. The help that was extended by that community, as it was by many other communities across Brisbane, was phenomenal. As others have remarked, the assistance provided by the young people in those communities was remarkable, giving us, I think, a greater sense of the value of young people and their willingness to help and assist. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041383"></A>
Many others helped rebuild in and around Albion. Energex were responsive to the needs of my community, resuming power and explaining why they could not resume it in places. I congratulate the teams that were put in place to liaise with local members. I think they did everything that could reasonably be expected of them in terms of providing information and making those connections work. I spoke to many Energex workers who were doing the work on the lines. To an extent they were getting a little frustrated at all the calls for power to come back on but they were working assiduously in turning that power back on. Local electrical contractors in my part of the world volunteered to go out and certify each of the premises to make sure the power could be turned on. I think that saved many people a lot of time and money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041384"></A>
There are still issues to be sorted out for the businesses in my part of the world. Thankfully they are few. One of the businesses is Cuttings Wine, run by a fellow called David Bone. It supplies fine wines to restaurants around Brisbane. They are situated at Albion. As the water was coming up they picked up all the mighty expensive wine and stacked it on top of the less expensive wine and we sandbagged. There were no promises of freebies as a result of doing all that work but, nonetheless, it looked like a pretty good haul that was there. Unfortunately, the water seeped through the sandbags and destroyed all of the cartons holding the cheap wine so that all of the wine above toppled in. It is a business that is very substantially limited in what it can sell. Because it has a wholesale licence it can sell only 2 per cent of its product to the public, although I am sure that if it was able to sell to the public its staff would be knocked out in the rush as people sought to buy survivors of the 2011 Brisbane floods. We are liaising with the minister responsible for liquor licensing in relation to that issue to see if we can find some way around those restrictions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041387"></A>
I acknowledge the work of businesses in and around Brisbane supporting the rebuilding. We have talked of the communities and we have talked of the local organisations, but I also acknowledge a couple of other people who have not been mentioned. I first acknowledge the Billy Connolly concert that was held on Sunday night at the entertainment centre. Over 100 staff volunteered their time for that concert. Billy Connolly volunteered his time for the concert. The total value, I am told, will be somewhere north of $450,000 for that one event, all going to the Premier’s Disaster Relief Appeal. Everyone who worked there that night was a volunteer. We had managers directing traffic and acting as ushers. I acknowledge the gift of the city of Kaohsiung in Taiwan. It made a sister-city donation last Saturday to the Lord Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund of $100,000. I acknowledge the Taiwanese community more generally which had, up to the time that I was there, already raised $30,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041389"></A>
We have talked about some of the efforts of some of the big companies. I want to acknowledge the efforts of the RACQ and the disaster-funding package it made available and the generosity it provided. Also, the Commonwealth Bank made its funds available. When we talk about community we should include the generosity of the very many businesses that do the right thing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041390"></A>
I acknowledge the people in Nundah Village who are fundraising in two Fridays time, on 25 February. The people of Nundah are coming together to hold a fundraiser to support the Premier’s Disaster Relief Appeal. Even people like my own sister, who lives in Sydney, have organised progressive dinners and they have raised something like $10,000 from expatriates by charging exorbitant prices for rum and coke. The community comes together in many different ways and has many different tentacles to support Queenslanders. They show that community spirit is alive in all parts of our society. </Hansard-Body>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110216_122559" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Mount Isa--ALP) (12.26 pm): I am honoured to speak to the Premier’s condolence motion before the House. On behalf of all of the residents of the Mount Isa electorate I offer our sincere condolences and pay our deep respect to the families who have lost loved ones and the families who have endured massive losses during the devastating natural disasters which have gripped our state since December. We know that their lives will never be the same; indeed, nor will the lives of all Queenslanders who have shared their sorrow and pain. </A></Hansard-Body>

It has been said, and will continue to be said, I am sure, that where Mother Nature has been at her most destructive humankind has responded at its very best. There is little doubt that what has happened has changed our state forever. As disaster after disaster has unfolded, we have witnessed from every point in Queensland the horror of the events, the extraordinary bravery of many and then the incredible response to people in need by family, friends and complete strangers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041408"></A>
To my colleagues in this House whose communities were directly affected: you have shown your strength and you have given us your personal insight into the reality of the horror through your eyes and the eyes of the people who have suffered and lost so much. I feel sure that there would not be a person who has not been amazed by the bravery, courage, resilience and generosity of the people of Queensland. What we have also witnessed is the incredible leadership of our Premier, Anna Bligh, who has shown her incredible strength, compassion and a capacity and ability to give so many people the strength to face these terrible times and, most importantly, believe that we would get through them and end up stronger. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041409"></A>
To the Deputy Premier, Paul Lucas: I know that many of the mayors across the state have truly valued the continual support you have given them throughout each event. To Minister Neil Roberts: you have led by example to so many. Your portfolio and people cover all of our front-line workers across the state--servants of the people who went well beyond the call of duty over and over again. Your steady and calm leadership is greatly admired and respected by many. To our Treasurer and government ministers: you have not only been there for our state, but in many cases have worked tirelessly within your own electorates which have been badly affected. I further acknowledge Major Mick Slater and his team, who are leading the recovery effort.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045219"></A>
I thank the members of the committee for the Premier’s relief appeal. We could not have selected wiser heads or bigger hearts than those of the Minister for Public Works and member for Rockhampton, Robert Schwarten, and the member for Gregory, my mate Vaughan Johnson. Who would have thought that in just a few short weeks of the new Disaster Management Act coming into effect on 1 November 2010, it would face its first major test. Indeed, it has been tested ever since. Possibly the most significant changes included putting the Queensland Police Service in command and strengthening the role of local government in disaster preparation. From where I stand, both have been resounding successes. I thank the people who assisted me personally, including staff from the Premier’s office and the ministers’ offices, all the incredibly helpful departmental staff, at the local level Mike Glasson from the Bureau of Meteorology in Mount Isa and, of course, our local ABC and <Hansard-Italic>
North West Star</Hansard-Italic>
. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045225"></A>
From day one the QPS officers involved have performed in an exemplary manner. They stood side by side with the government and local councils as they prepared for disaster and battled to regain control after the events. I acknowledge the leadership of Commissioner Bob Atkinson and Inspector Ian Stewart, our state’s first disaster coordinator. In my part of the world, Ian Stewart has become everyone’s favourite uncle. He worked with Bruce Grady, who was appointed as our first state disaster recovery coordinator. From day one they have shown us how truly lucky we are to have people of the calibre of those three gentlemen working for us all. Over time it has been my great privilege to meet personally many of the mayors and councillors from across the state. Right across the state our councils have been magnificent. As their communities were drowned by unprecedented flood rains and then raging torrents and later the fury of Cyclone Yasi, they stood firm as pillars of their communities, with mayors leading from the front to assure residents that things would be all right. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045227"></A>
Who would have thought that in western Queensland we would be looking down the barrel of a category 1 cyclone? By the time Yasi reached Julia Creek it still had a sting in its tail and Mayor Woodhouse can say that they survived Cyclone Yasi. By the time it reached further west, it was a severe rain depression. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045229"></A>
There is little doubt that great adversity brings out the best in all of us and is was exemplified by the leadership and contribution of our police, our ambulance and fire officers and, in particular, the swift-water crews who worked tirelessly and with great courage to save so many people. I thank our health and defence personnel, EMQ staff and our helicopter crews. As we heard from the Premier, their work was unprecedented in Australian history. I thank the truly selfless men and women of the SES from right across the state. I thank local, state and federal government staff who served and continue to serve our communities. The partnerships and relationships between councils and EMQ staff have now been well and truly cemented. All of those people stood side by side, shoulder to shoulder, at every level of government across every community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045231"></A>
Many lessons will be learnt from the disasters. We will heed those messages. The government, in close partnership with councils and local communities, will continue to plan for the future. There is little doubt that we will ensure that we are even better prepared for the next natural disaster, and we will continue to build resilience in each and every community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045232"></A>
I thank and acknowledge the wonderful generosity of the people of my electorate who have and I know will continue to contribute financially to the Premier’s fund to help those families in need. In conclusion, one thing we can say for sure is that through these extraordinary times we have united our state, closed the divide between the city and the bush, and shared the pain one and all. I hope that the spirit and strength that has come from this summer of sorrow will remain and strengthen us all as we go forward to rebuild our state, not only with bricks and mortar but with the uniqueness of spirit and soul that makes us Queenslanders. I commend the motion to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Inala--ALP) (Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs) (12.34 pm): I rise to speak in support of the condolence motion. The summer of 2010-11 brought to our state devastating floods and cyclones, a collision of natural disasters unprecedented in modern times. The flooding events took the lives of 35 Queenslanders and left their mark on communities, not just physically but also emotionally. Whole communities have now pulled together to support families, friends and neighbours at a time of unimaginable catastrophe. Volunteer armies also sprung up throughout Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

At the outset, I pay my respects to all those Queenslanders who lost their lives. I pay tribute to Van Toan Giang, who lost his life in stormwaters in Durack while checking on his father-in-law’s property during the floods. I know that the Vietnamese community has been deeply affected by this tragic loss. He was a young man, recently married. I extend my deepest sympathies to the family and the local Vietnamese community at this very difficult time. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1045241"></A>
I acknowledge the Premier’s outstanding leadership during the recent natural disasters. She has inspired a state and a nation, leading Queensland through one of its toughest times. I thank Ipswich Mayor Paul Pisasale, Councillor Milton Dick and Councillor David Morrison for their efforts locally on the ground. I also thank my own staff for helping me to clear out entire shelves of Gatorade at the Richlands Woolies on more than one occasion. It was all handed out to thirsty volunteers during those hot summer days. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

In Gailes, entire families lost a lifetime of possessions and stood powerless as their personal effects were destroyed in the floods. When the water receded I visited those normally quiet streets--Dulin Street, Alma Street, Mirrin Street, Killalan Street--and the damage was immense. Wrecked fridges and air conditioners, spoiled bedding, tennis rackets, Scrabble boards and childrens’ toys were piled sky high on the footpaths. I personally witnessed acts of amazing compassion and kindness in this neighbourhood. I saw volunteers helping residents salvage personal possessions from their homes. I saw people lending families generators, trailers and shovels. I saw mothers and children delivering sandwiches, cakes, pikelets and cold drinks to volunteers who were helping with the clean-up. I saw Army and Emergency Services workers and community recovery staff working around the clock to help get families back on their feet. For many, this period was a time of great sorrow and loss, but it was also a time of great community spirit. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045253"></A>
The residents of Gailes Caravan Village lost their homes and possessions, which were swept away in the floods, but they did not lose their spirit. Some found refuge in the community recovery centre that was established at the Shiloh Christian Church at Redbank. With the help of volunteers and staff, they were able to get back on their feet and start rebuilding their lives as alternative accommodation was sought. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045255"></A>
During the flood crisis, one of the most inspiring things I witnessed occurred in the low-lying area of Centenary Village in Darra, where a flooded creek swamped up to 70 family homes. The flood level had reached the roof of one woman’s house. Most of her possessions were ruined or swept away and she had no insurance. However, she had spirit, courage and tenacity, and she was determined to fight on and rebuild her life. Her son was leading the working bee at the house, with neighbours also lending a hand. I asked two men who were pitching in with the clean-up how they knew Isabela. ‘Oh, we don’t know her’, one of the men replied. ‘We are just here to help, like everyone else.’ One the men had come from Murrumba Downs and the other had travelled from Strathpine on the north side. They had given up their time and travelled to help a complete stranger. They are among the true community heroes of the floods. That was repeated across the streets of Brisbane and the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049165"></A>
Also, Cathy Easte established a recovery centre for flood affected residents in the local community hall at Centenary Village. Tireless volunteers made this centre a real community hub for local residents, with state government recovery workers also providing much needed outreach to people who could not travel to the Wacol centre. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049172"></A>
There was one especially inspiring volunteer at this recovery centre. Allan Wade from Innisfail in Far North Queensland stayed for six days to help local residents get back on their feet because he was not able to travel home. Allan was a tower of strength for these residents during a difficult period. He wants to revisit Centenary Village to do more recovery work and raise funds for the flood affected residents on his way to the blues festival at Easter. Well done, Allan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049175"></A>
The Camira-Springfield Community Centre also did an outstanding job during the floods. It served as a one-stop recovery shop, with part of the centre transformed into a giant warehouse with essential items for flood affected residents piled metres high. Non-perishable food, clothing, electrical goods and children’s toys were donated in vast quantities--a lifeline to so many people.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049177"></A>
The nearby Wolston Park Golf Club at Wacol was also hit hard by the floods, with fairways swamped and the clubhouse submerged by floodwaters. This is a real community club and its membership and green fees are amongst the lowest in Brisbane. This is where the workers of Gailes, Goodna and Camira go to play golf. I know that members of the club want to see the course repaired and the clubhouse refurbished. I am confident that Mary Byrne and her committee will ensure the club bounces back. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049180"></A>
Deaf Services Queensland did a great job during the natural disasters keeping deaf and hearing impaired Queenslanders informed. Auslan interpreters featured heavily during the flood and cyclone updates provided by the Premier. I want to pay tribute to their outstanding efforts during this time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049182"></A>
We also kept Queensland’s multicultural communities well informed throughout the floods. Multicultural Affairs Queensland produced disaster relief fact sheets in over 30 languages including Chinese, Filipino, Greek, Japanese, Samoan, Spanish and Vietnamese. Queensland’s multicultural communities are working tirelessly to raise funds for the Premier’s Disaster Relief Appeal. I want to thank them all for their generosity and compassion and for working side by side to help flood affected residents. Our multicultural communities have helped to show above all how much we have in common; that, first and foremost, we are all Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049184"></A>
In conclusion, in the aftermath of the floods, there were people standing side by side, shoulder to shoulder. There were no divides, just people bonded by a will to get things done. This was community in action in our streets, in our suburbs, in our cities, cleaning, carrying, baking, delivering, shovelling, hosing and salvaging. There was an army of volunteers--strangers by name, but not in spirit. This was real mateship. It is what Queenslanders and Australians are renowned for throughout the world. This is what our Australian history has recorded throughout the generations. It is a story told time and time again. We will always be there to help one another in good times and in bad, for better or for worse. We will see things through together. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110216_124252" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Pine Rivers--ALP) (12.43 pm): I rise this afternoon to support the Premier’s motion and to add the voice of the people of the Pine Rivers electorate to the words of sympathy and comfort that have been espoused in this House today and yesterday. In my 44 years I have not seen so many disastrous weather patterns pile one on top of the other for weeks on end. I, along with many others, watched on the television the disastrous events unfolding out west last year and in Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley in early January. The scenes of devastation were unbelievable. </A></Hansard-Body>

Most of the houses and businesses in my electorate were spared the worst of the problems associated with excessive rain and floods. Unfortunately, about a dozen houses around Strathpine and Lawnton were affected and also Dayboro did not escape the inundation. Indeed, the local Dayboro residents say it is the worst flooding that Dayboro has seen since the early 1930s. According to Councillor Bob Millar, Dayboro had over 600 millimetres of rain in several days. This saturated land could hold no more water and it just had to find a way to escape, which it did, through the lower streets, inundating houses, businesses and the bowls club. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049196"></A>
I would like to offer my thanks to Senior Constable Troy Nowitzki and Sergeant Ken Robinson for their magnificent efforts during the floods in Dayboro. Due to logistics, Troy was in town and Ken was on the other side of the creek. Both were working furiously to ensure residents were safe and able to get out of their houses and up to higher ground. Senior Constable Troy particularly should be commended. He was as sick as a dog and had no communication equipment on him but was out there in the pouring rain rallying the people and keeping them safe. From that point on the entire community banded together to work through the floods and to clean up and help. Councillor Millar was telling me that within two days of the flood he was receiving phone calls from local volunteers offering assistance to other people within the region as they had already cleaned up impacted businesses and homes in their own area. Senior Constable Troy organised a community debriefing meeting and over 170 people turned up to share their stories, offer more help and work through what assistance was available to them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049198"></A>
At this point I would like to thank the local, state and federal government public servants who hit the streets of Dayboro in the days after the flood to doorknock businesses and residents to see what assistance they could provide. They also came to our flood debriefing to offer further information. Even though the town and surrounding district looks nice and tidy again, we must remember that some people did suffer significantly as a consequence of what happened in the days before and after the flooding. It will take some of them a long time to recover, both financially and emotionally, and we will be there to support them and help them through their journey. Indeed, this Friday night, Dayboro is running a major fundraiser which is being hosted by Heather Foord. It is the Flood and Fire 2011 Concert and Charity Auction, which will raise funds for local people who have been badly affected by the flooding. That includes the McKavanagh family of Laceys Creek, who lost their home in a fire the week before the floods and whose farm was damaged during the flooding.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049204"></A>
I am so proud of the Dayboro community, the police, the volunteer organisations, the local residents who just pitched in and the six blokes who took it upon themselves to mow the soccer fields with their household lawnmowers because it would have been ripped up by the slasher and they did not want the kids turning their ankles. I think that would have made a great photo.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049207"></A>
Several sporting venues suffered damage during the floods such as the Dayboro Bowls Club, Dayboro Little Athletics, Dayboro soccer, Dayboro tennis and the Pine Rivers Swans AFL. The sports minister, the Hon. Phil Reeves, personally asked to visit some clubs so he could ascertain the level of loss and damage and to offer his personal support. His visit was very much appreciated and we look forward to the assistance that the state can provide through the increased grants and through the help of the peak sporting bodies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049211"></A>
The Pine Rivers community has gotten behind our fundraising efforts by donating money and goods. Senator Mark Furner, Councillor Mick Gillam and I worked closely with Club Pine Rivers to hold a fundraiser. What started out as an idea for a sausage sizzle on a Sunday afternoon soon turned into a sporting and auction extravaganza with sports celebrities from the Broncos and Lions and Olympians Jessica Schipper, Jodie Bowering and Melanie Schlanger. A special thankyou goes to The Veronicas--Lisa and Jess Origliasso--who were going to turn up for an hour and ended up staying for six hours signing autographs, serving sausages and hosting dinner. The community turned out in force and Club Pine Rivers raised $25,600 on the day for the Premier’s flood relief fund and another $5,000 since then, which will go to local sporting clubs to help out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049221"></A>
Putting aside the devastating weather patterns that caused the disastrous flooding, local residents do have questions about the operation of the North Pine Dam, the issues surrounding early warning systems and problems with insurance companies. There will be submissions from people across the Pine Rivers electorate to the commission of inquiry and I will be working with residents to ensure the right questions are asked and that answers are delivered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049222"></A>
Further to this, our road network suffered quite significantly due to the flooding. The AJ Wyllie Bridge at Petrie was totally cut off for almost a week and only the high bridge was re-opened as the low bridge suffered extensive damage. Compounded with this was the closure of the lower part of Strathpine Road along the flats which meant the only way in and out of Strathpine was on a single-lane road. Just to really make a mess of the traffic, Youngs Crossing Road was cut off repeatedly as water was released from the North Pine Dam. It caused huge delays. I would like to thank my community for their absolute patience during the difficult times that we are experiencing at the moment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049225"></A>
The Moreton Bay Regional Council has indicated that it will pursue the option of a high bridge across Youngs Crossing Road so that this important access road can finally be flood proof and our road network will work at all times. I commend it for moving this council initiative forward and I have indicated that I will support it as it asks for state and federal government support to help make this $100 million bridge a reality. I take this opportunity to let the Premier know about this important flood mitigation project for the future for the people of Pine Rivers. I will be speaking about this more often to her and to other levels of government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049227"></A>
Whilst the events of 2011 will be indelibly etched into the minds of those directly affected, it is up to all of us who were not affected to keep supporting them as they recover and rebuild. Businesses need residents to shop locally and support them. I remind everyone that it is not just those businesses that were flooded that have had a downturn in their business; there are those like the Lawnton businesses who were affected by the closure of the AJ Wyllie Bridge. So it is up to all of us to get behind our businesses and support them and support our sporting clubs and residents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049229"></A>
Our community will recover and our thoughts and best wishes will be with our fellow Queenslanders who have suffered through the floods and the cyclones of this dreadful summer of 2010-11. I support the motion before the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr MALONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110216_124923" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Mirani--LNP) (12.49 pm): I rise to speak briefly to the motion of condolence before the House today. Firstly, I indicate that there was very little damage across my electorate. Of the two cyclones, Cyclone Yasi and Cyclone Anthony, Cyclone Anthony probably did the most damage, with several houses being unroofed and some trees being brought down across houses and roads et cetera. But it is important to realise that there were people right across my electorate who were affected, particularly in Rockhampton. In actual fact, the small suburb of Depot Hill is in my electorate. </A></Hansard-Body>
<DIV>
<IMAGE xml:link="simple" href="2011_02_16_WEEKLY-38.gif" show="embed" actuate="auto"/>
</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053217"></A>
I think most people would know--and the member for Rockhampton raised this issue--that the people who live at Depot Hill have a history of putting up with flooding and they find joy in having flooding parties et cetera. They are used to doing that. As Rockhampton is flooded fairly regularly, they take some pride in the way in which they handle the floods. I think it was fairly disappointing that the preparations they made in terms of stockpiling food et cetera were terminated by the switching off of the power. I do not know the full history behind that, but I know that the swampies at Depot Hill were rather disappointed about that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053218"></A>
Overall, we are were all just horrified at the vision that came into our living rooms over two or three weeks in terms of the flooding through Emerald and then further down through Dalby and Condamine. Ultimately, the rain then fell in Toowoomba and we witnessed the absolutely unbelievable force of the water through Toowoomba, then down the escapement into the Lockyer Valley and finally into Brisbane. On top of that, a few days later came the two cyclones in North Queensland. I do not want to be a spoilsport, but I have to point out the old-time theory--it is not theory; it is fact--that the cyclone season does not actually finish until Anzac Day. We have had cyclones in April and we have had quite severe cyclones right up to that time. So our views should be tempered by the fact that there is a real possibility we could get further cyclones on the Queensland coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053221"></A>
The recent events have affected the incomes of a lot of people in my electorate. The sugar industry, the cane industry and the milling industry will face a tremendous downturn not only because of what happened last year, when up to 25 per cent of the crop was left in the paddock--indeed, if we do get a severe cyclone in that area most of that will be destroyed by winds--but also because of the inability of farmers to plant a crop, get a successful strike and grow a decent crop for this coming season. There will be a real impact because we have had rain right throughout North Queensland from about the end of August last year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053224"></A>
So there is an economic impact right across North Queensland. And now the cyclones in North Queensland and the closure of the Babinda mill will have a real impact on the viability of the sugar industry across Queensland. Of course this is true for the horticultural industry as well. We have pineapple farmers in my electorate at Alligator Creek. The proprietor was complaining that, because the highway was closed at Rockhampton, he had difficulties transporting his pineapples to market, and this was at a time when the price of pineapples had peaked. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053227"></A>
I would particularly like to congratulate all the volunteers and the non-government organisations, the police, the SES, the QFRS and the rural fire brigades, and more particularly the people who just rolled up with little notice with mops and buckets and scrubbing materials to help people. It really does make you proud to be part of a community and part of a nation where volunteering is a big aspect of our lives. I think we should pat ourselves on the back. Even though we have in our community people who are not community minded, when the chips are down it is surprising to see the number of people who will actually go out and help other people. On TV I was watching vision of the riots in Egypt. It was really heartening to see that, after they settled down, people volunteered to clean up the square in which they had been protesting. I wonder whether the vision from Queensland had been shown in Egypt and people saw the need to help out in the public interest. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053228"></A>
I am very conscious of the fact that the bill to be debated after this condolence motion gives us the opportunity to talk about infrastructure issues, but I think it is important to understand that the Bruce Highway is really the lifeline of Queensland. Even though there were areas in North Queensland closed because of the cyclone and flooding, the closure of the highway at Rockhampton for more than two weeks had a huge impact on Queensland. It had a huge impact on North Queensland in terms of its ability to move goods to the south, as I have just mentioned. We need to look at that piece of infrastructure as a national network of transportation. Many people were inconvenienced by the closure of that road but they could still drive from Rockhampton to Mackay. So there were a lot of people driving to Mackay to catch planes to travel not only to Brisbane but also all over the world. A lot of those travel plans were of high importance--for funerals, weddings or any number of reasons. I have to say that I was really disappointed to hear that the airlines increased the price of a seat out of Mackay by double, triple or more. I think that is very disappointing. People were travelling because they had to, not for some social reason. They were travelling for something that was really important to them. I was really disappointed about that. I think we need to look at that sort of profiteering as we move forward. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053231"></A>
The other real concern is the number of people who have lost their homes. For instance, in North Queensland 650 homes are totally destroyed and another 2,500 homes are unlivable. There are a lot of people who had no insurance, who were underinsured or for whom the insurance company will not accept liability. There will be some people who have a mortgage on their home. Even when a house is destroyed, the mortgage still has to be paid. There will be other people who are renting and who lost all of their possessions. They also will have some difficulty re-establishing their accommodation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053233"></A>
As we move forward--and there have been some deeply felt and heartening speeches made in the parliament over the last two days--we need to think about those people who are going to be tremendously disadvantaged. There are going to be quite a lot of people in that situation. Let us hope that all of the support we can give them, through government departments and donations et cetera, will go to the people who need it most and that, in terms of accommodation, we are able to look at ways of getting relocatable housing into areas that really need it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053234"></A>
In debating this motion of condolence, I think it is important that for a moment we think about those people who are going to be severely disadvantaged, not just in the next couple of months but possibly for the rest of their lives. Our hearts go out to all of those people. I really do support the motion of condolence. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Notice of Disallowance Motion, Out of Order</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061102"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The member for Condamine this morning gave notice of a motion to disallow ‘subordinate legislation pertaining to this government’s closure of the Queensland snapper fishery’. Section 50 of the Statutory Instruments Act 1992 enables the disallowance of subordinate legislation, including a provision of subordinate legislation. Standing order 59 provides for notices of motion for the disallowance of ‘a statutory instrument or guideline pursuant to an Act’.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061103"></A>
Such motions, which have legal consequences, require precision. The member’s motion lacks particularity sufficient to constitute a disallowance motion, as it fails to identify which instrument is to be disallowed. Such motions should specify the name and number of the instrument or instruments to be disallowed. Reference to the empowering provision of the primary act is insufficient as there may be many instruments made pursuant to a power. I therefore rule that the notice of motion is out of order. </Hansard-Body>

(2.31 pm): I rise to extend condolences on my own behalf and on behalf of every single person living in the electorate of Noosa to those Queenslanders who have lost loved ones as a result of the floods and cyclones which have affected Queensland in this terrible past few weeks. All of us in Noosa, indeed all of us on the Sunshine Coast, simply count our blessings as having been largely spared from the effects of these extreme weather events. Yes, there has been some minor flooding and some wind damage, but it is inconsequential in the scheme of things. We have been fortunate and we know how fortunate we have been and we give thanks for that good fortune. </Hansard-Body>

I am, at the same time, proud of the members of my community who have extended even their widely respected great capacity to give of themselves in the service of others. They have raised tens of thousands of dollars and gifted countless items to replace clothing and household items lost to flood and to wind. They have started, albeit in a small way, the long process of recovery for the victims which will be a long, slow, painful process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061111"></A>
Before I came into this place my career was in commercial radio and wholly in Queensland. It is from this perspective that I have seen over the years on a firsthand basis the impact of floods. While Brisbane was suffering the terrible effects of the floods of 1974, I was based in Mount Isa where it and the rest of the great north-west was being flooded. A couple of years later it was Warwick being flooded. In 1981 it was Dalby. A couple of years after that it was Emerald experiencing, by comparison to these recent events, minor flooding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061113"></A>
For many years I was associated with radio stations in Gympie and Noosa and saw a number of floods come and go in Gympie, particularly the dreadful 1999 event where the Mary River reached 21.95 metres. For most of these events I was on-air reporting and bringing the news to the rest of the community. But in Warwick and Dalby I, with many of my colleagues, were on the ground, part of the community force, cleaning up in the aftermath. The smell, the slime, the broken dreams and the destroyed lives I will never forget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061114"></A>
This very personal reflection is a preamble to the conclusion that I had reached. That conclusion was that genuinely I thought I had seen it all before. Nothing could possibly prepare one for what has affected this state since December 2010. Who could have imagined that a flood of any description could occur in Toowoomba--on top of the Great Dividing Range? We have all seen the TV footage of what took place there. But not even Hollywood could have envisaged, could have created with all the digital technology at its disposal, images which we have watched open-mouthed in horror and in tears. We are probably fortunate that footage is not readily available of the worst events--those in the Lockyer Valley; communities where the lives of decent Queenslanders have been so tragically and prematurely lost. </Hansard-Body>

I had the opportunity to travel to flood affected St George with my leader, John-Paul Langbroek, where, with the member for Warrego, Howard Hobbs, we spoke to a great many locals who were hastily preparing for the river to peak, which it did later that night at 13. 2 metres. As is the case in many areas, a flood is not unusual. But the degree of preparedness which this local council and the community achieved was outstanding. The existing levy system and the temporary levies are outstanding examples of local communities under strong leadership moving to protect themselves from the consequences of the will of Mother Nature. </Hansard-Body>

The flooding in Central Queensland, the south-west, the Darling Downs and the Lockyer Valley and then in Ipswich and in Brisbane was breathtaking in its scope, the destruction of infrastructure and the loss of life. But then monster Cyclone Yasi appeared, which in a different way attacked without mercy that part of our state so far spared from the ravages of flood. </Hansard-Body>

In Far North Queensland, again with the Leader of the Opposition, I travelled extensively within the electorate of Hinchinbrook. My colleague Andrew Cripps, as members know, spoke very movingly yesterday during the condolence motion in this House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061120"></A>
Floods normally leave structures relatively intact. That did not occur on this occasion, as we have seen. The evidence of violence visited upon these little communities was everywhere: stumps where a home once stood, banana crops severed uniformly a metre above the ground, cane fields bowed, mutilated and twisted. Who will ever forget the site of the Hinchinbrook marina with millions of dollars worth of water craft stacked higgledy-piggledy? </Hansard-Body>

Queensland has experienced cyclones Tasha, Anthony and Yasi, floods of Noah proportions across 70 per cent of a vast state and reflooding of many local areas--in the case of Dalby, five times--and storm surges. Toowoomba fell victim to an inland tsunami. In the graphic words of Police Commissioner Atkinson, ‘It seems we have experienced a series of one in 100-year events almost simultaneously.’ Certainly the areas around Cardwell have seen Cyclone Larry in 2006 and Cyclone Yasi only a few years later. Those people must be asking themselves why and how. </Hansard-Body>

How do older residents start again? Small businesses have been devastated. My wife’s parents have a business in Emerald which suffered losses in excess of $100,000 but whose pain would have been so much worse without the selfless generosity of strangers who simply came in and helped them prepare and clean up. Can I say to members in the House that if anyone is looking for a sewing machine, the Peter Taylor Sewing Centre is open for business. </Hansard-Body>

We have been very fortunate to have seen some great leadership on display during this heartbreaking summer to date. It is from strong leadership that those who have been so adversely affected maintain their spirit. We have seen and paid tribute to the Premier and to the Lord Mayor of Brisbane who have been at the forefront. I also want to thank the Leader of the Opposition who has crisscrossed the state, too often unseen, and lent support in a very personal way to so many victims. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061131"></A>
It is visits such as his and those by Governor-General Quentin Bryce and Governor Penelope Wensley and other high-profile community leaders which give comfort to those who have suffered loss. For those victims not to feel forgotten and abandoned it is imperative that these visits to comfort and support do not stop any time soon, and certainly not before the job is done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065187"></A>
I take this opportunity to pay a very special tribute to the member for Lockyer, Ian Rickuss, and his wife, Ann, for their leadership and tireless work within their community, arguably the most adversely affected of all. As the shadow minister for police and emergency services, I offer my heartfelt thanks to police, firefighters and Queensland Ambulance Service personnel who have given so much. The Defence Force personnel and the interstate contingents, both professional and volunteers, including those police who became special constables, have my personal gratitude.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065195"></A>
Queensland could not function without its volunteers, the SES, the rural firefighters and the other support agencies which have done so much for so many. I particularly recall the lift that the Red Cross gave when they arrived in Tully. They were there under the leadership of Greg Goebel and performed an absolutely vital service, while Volunteering Queensland and of course the Salvation Army rose to the occasion as we expect from such fine organisations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065199"></A>
It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the contribution of the Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services, the Hon. Neil Roberts, who went about his duty in a calm, reassuring and professional manner. I also acknowledge David Smith from the minister’s office who ensured that I, as the shadow minister, and local members from affected areas were kept completely up to date. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065202"></A>
We should also acknowledge the preplanning which is not on display in normal times but which becomes so evident in times like we have just witnessed. Clearly, the rapid response by our emergency services indicates that they have been diligent and coordinated in preparing to meet the challenges which this wide brown land of sweeping plains, of drought and flooding rains can present. Members from electorates which have been affected have rightly praised their local heroes. I would just like to add that, for me, Jordan Rice is the epitome of a selfless hero. What a man in a boy’s body.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065203"></A>
While the immediate danger has passed for the time being, the effects of these tragedies will continue for a long time. Those people in the Lockyer who struggle to survive day to day have not had time to grieve. Grieving is an essential human emotion. It is essential that those individuals, families and communities which suffered so much do have time--preferably sooner rather than later--to grieve properly and fully. They will need to know that we support them while they meet that raw need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065206"></A>
Many of those children who heard Yasi coming, experienced the calm of the eye and then heard the coming of the other side of the cyclone will be fearful for many years to come at the sound of modest wind or a coming storm. We can rebuild the houses, the offices, the schools, the roads, the railways, the airports and the marinas. We can reconnect the electricity and resupply fresh water. What we cannot replenish easily is the faith and trust that children have in the safety of their own home. Children should be able to go home and feel safe when they can go nowhere else.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065207"></A>
In coming days we will be learning the lessons from what we have experienced in Queensland. We will be looking at insurance at the state level and at a personal and domestic level. We will be looking at public infrastructure and what we might do, as an example, to floodproof the Bruce Highway. We will be looking at dam management and what more can be done to simultaneously provide drinking water and mitigate against flooding, balancing both aims. We will be looking at planning decisions to protect homes and businesses from flooding. We will be looking at building standards to protect our built environment from destruction. And we will be looking for synergies in public buildings to act as refuges when all else fails. In short, we in this place will be the front line of ensuring that children feel safe in their own homes in the future and that the lessons of these tragedies and this adversity are not lost. That must be our overriding priority. <Hansard-Speech-End>

My heart goes out to everyone who lost everything and have to somehow rebuild their shattered lives. I was deeply distressed by and I will always remember the television footage of entire communities being devastated by the recent floods. I know that everyone will remember this time as a time of extreme sadness. The loss of life, property, infrastructure, businesses, jobs, animals and land will be felt for many, many years to come, and our patience will be tested while this government, with the help of Queenslanders, works to rebuild the 75 per cent of the state that has been affected by floods and more recently by Cyclone Yasi. </A></Hansard-Body>

Some homes in the electorate of Pumicestone were flooded a couple of days before Brisbane was inundated. We sustained minor damage compared to other areas, but these people whose homes were flooded needed assistance to help them recover. I am very proud to say that this help came immediately from the Bligh government’s recovery team and from donations from the community. My sincere thanks go to the volunteers who helped me collect and distribute food, clothing and toiletries. The Seventh-day Adventist Church and the Caboolture and Bribie Island Christian Outreach Centres put in many hours to ensure those who needed goods received them. I appreciated the efforts of Jamie Purcell from the recycling depot for keeping his eye out for items that could help me replace lost property. I thank everyone who helped in any way. I seek leave to table a list of everyone who offered to help. </Hansard-Body>

 I thank everyone who offered to help when I asked for assistance to clean and mow. For example, we received the help of three youngsters from Bribie Island: Nick Freney, Ben Hansell and 16-year-old Josh Walker. I thank those who helped with teaching resources for the Brassall State School, which lost everything. I would like to particularly thank Danielle Hartmann, who was transferred to a school in Burketown and who said to me, ‘Here, have my resources. I can buy more.’ As a retired teacher I can say that I would have been proud to call those resources my own; they were brilliant and they were in excellent condition. There were 92 schools affected and we could help only one.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065220"></A>
I would also like to thank those who provided toiletries for the evacuation centres in Ipswich West and Bundamba. I still have a good-quality, second-hand queen size bed if anyone knows anybody who needs one. The list of helpers is lengthy and does not include all of those in my electorate who donated money to the Premier’s flood appeal. I could not take cash through the office, but I did suggest that anyone who wanted to give money should go to the bank. I recall one lady who did not have a car so I picked her up and took her to the nearest bank. When we arrived back at her house, she emptied her bathroom cupboards to help with the toiletries drive, and she is an age pensioner who is privately renting.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065224"></A>
The Bribie Gleemen, as usual, took it upon themselves to organise a concert, with all the proceeds going to the flood appeal. Their concert, with the assistance of the Bribie Island Big Band and the Uke Dukes, raised $4,000--an incredible individual effort and one that is greatly appreciated. The Gleemen have put on a concert in aid of every natural disaster since 2006, and there have been plenty--seven alone in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065227"></A>
The bill for the devastation is enormous and it is mounting. To put it into perspective, one rescue helicopter costs $1,000 an hour. How can we pay for the loss of 30 years worth of infrastructure, services and facilities? At the same time we are also losing coal royalties, so we as a government are being hit at both ends: we have less money coming in and we have more money going out. It will take years and everybody’s commitment, and our patience will be tested. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065228"></A>
Those areas like mine which suffered very little will feel some pain in the future. Some projects may be delayed while government resources go to those communities which have lost everything. Already we have been told that some existing sport and recreation grant programs will be either cancelled or restarted at a later date to help with the flood and cyclone recovery efforts, which include assisting sport and recreation clubs to re-establish lost facilities. My constituents are very understanding of this unprecedented predicament, and I trust that they will continue to support the measures taken by this government to rebuild Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065230"></A>
I am pleased that I was able to travel to Bundamba after the assistance was given in my own electorate. I find it hard to describe the devastation and the smell, but in one of the streets where all the homes went underwater there was a sign on the very top of a large pile of flood affected belongings which read ‘My life is on my lawn’. </Hansard-Body>

 I take that interjection from the member for Morayfield, who has heard Sinead Burgess at many local events in the community.

She wrote a beautiful song at one o’clock in the morning after seeing the Toowoomba flood footage. Her song is titled <Hansard-Italic>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110216_144954" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (2.49 pm): I rise to speak on this condolence motion to pay my respects to those who lost their lives in the floods that devastated so much of Queensland during the summer of 2010 and 2011. The events that have unfolded in the past two months have emphasised, if any was needed, just why we are bred differently north of the New South Wales border. On one hand we enjoy a climate and lifestyle that at times is reflected perfectly by those well-known tourism slogans that have helped us become so popular beyond our borders. But, on the other hand, we all know that life in Queensland cannot be conveniently captured in a postcard. In a very short space of time nature’s wrath can inflict unimaginable devastation upon our communities, and so it was across our great state in late December 2010, January 2011 and February 2011.</A></Hansard-Body>

In a few short weeks the majesty and privilege of living in the best state in the best country in the world was quickly contrasted with the terror brought on by the extreme weather events that affected so many of our fellow Queenslanders. In particular, the scenes that occurred on Monday, 10 January 2011 in Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley defied belief. Cars were tossed around in floodwaters like toys, houses were swept from their stumps and, worst of all, families were torn apart. None of us will forget the bravery of 13-year-old Jordan Rice, who urged a rescuer to save his brother from rising floodwaters first. Those floodwaters stole Jordan and his mum, Donna, from us and tore a family in two. Unfortunately, these tragic circumstances were repeated throughout the Lockyer Valley as another terrible wave of water, described as an inland tsunami, swept through communities without warning. One minute Queenslanders in these communities were going about their lives and daily routines, as we all were on that fateful day; the next they were grappling with the threat posed by a broiling, surging swell of horror and heartbreak. It is impossible to imagine the terror.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065282"></A>
However, in equal measure Queenslanders have borne witness to extraordinary acts of courage and determination in the aftermath of these terrible natural disasters. From the Lockyer Valley to Lakes Creek in Rockhampton, from Condamine to Cardwell, from Karalee and Rosalie to Theodore and Tully, from Bundaberg and Bundamba and Goodna and Ingham to the southside Brisbane suburbs of Rocklea, Fairfield, Norman Park and Oxley, and to communities such as Fernvale and Lowood, we have seen the true Queensland spirit come to the fore in the wake of these disasters. We have also witnessed courage and compassion from friends, neighbours and complete strangers that make all of us proud to be Queenslanders. This spirit has also been evident among staff of the Department of Justice and Attorney-General, some of whom bore the brunt of the recent natural disasters.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065284"></A>
In difficult times during the past few weeks departmental staff distinguished themselves by continuing to serve the people of Queensland with a level of dedication beyond the call of duty. I had the privilege to speak to the courthouse registrars in many flood affected areas including Gatton, Pittsworth, Dalby, Chinchilla, Warwick, Goondiwindi, Stanthorpe and Taroom. Those registrars and other court staff stayed at their posts and continued to serve the people of Queensland, even as floodwaters threatened their communities. Among them was Mark Koszan, the registrar at the Gatton courthouse. Mark chose to sleep at the courthouse after the terrible flood that affected the Lockyer Valley because, as Mark told me, he just wanted to be able to help anyone in need and answer any queries from members of the public if required. These acts of dedication and commitment in difficult and sometimes traumatic circumstances, which were repeated right across the Public Service and across our state in so many fields of endeavour and in difficult circumstances, are too numerous to mention. But those countless acts of courage and kindness and bravery and endurance, as articulated by so many members in their support for this condolence motion, will inspire citizens of this state for years to come.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065287"></A>
This same spirit was evident in the hordes of volunteers who have put their hands up to help out their fellow Queenslanders in the wake of these disasters. Here in the south-east this spirit was exemplified by the tens of thousands of people who spontaneously reached out to complete strangers and kick-started the flood recovery in so many streets and suburbs. But we should also acknowledge the numerous other volunteers who contributed during these disasters--the orange army of SES teams, the Red Cross volunteers in the evacuation and recovery centres, and the countless community groups that pitched in without question. Volunteering has always been an important part of my life and all Queenslanders can be proud of their achievements in recent weeks. I want to make special mention of the extraordinary response from residents within the electorate of Greenslopes. Fortunately, the electorate of Greenslopes was spared from the worst effects of this extreme weather, but that is not to say the electorate survived the floods unscathed. There were a number of homes in Norman Park in particular that were affected by the rising brown tide of floodwaters. For those people who had to throw out furniture, rip up carpets and get the muddy water out of their homes, the flood had a significant impact. It was depressing to see someone’s life reduced to a pile of rubbish on the footpath, although we all realised that others were much more affected.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065289"></A>
I am pleased to advise the House that many residents in the Greenslopes electorate made the effort to help out their neighbours in response to the floods. Numerous volunteers contacted my office to ask how they could help out. As the floodwaters rose, I joined a band of willing workers to help sandbag homes in Riddings Street in Coorparoo. I also doorknocked parts of Temple, Jellicoe and Burke streets in Coorparoo as local creeks started to rise. After the floodwaters peaked, the volunteers and I headed to Adina Street, Norman Park, where we helped residents take the first steps towards recovery. When our assistance was no longer required, the group and I headed off to other southside suburbs such as Fairfield and Oxley, where there was enormous damage to property. Among the people who helped out were Yvette, Ross and Trent Abberfield; Michael Beckett; Katherine Eames; Andrew Elphinstone; Simon Hammer; Michelle and Rod Massy; James Oliver; Jonathon Ring; Matthew Sellers; Zosia Kilmartin; John Denny; and Joe Kelly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1147599"></A>
This same spirit of cooperation was evident at the evacuation centre that was established at the Queensland Sports and Athletics Centre, better known as the QEII Stadium to many southsiders like me. I spent an evening helping set up camp stretchers to make the place ready for the hundreds of flood refugees who had to take shelter while the floodwaters rose around their homes. It was both humbling and heart warming to see the best of humanity on display during the floods crisis.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065310"></A>
But the generosity of southside residents did not stop there. As the floodwaters receded and the impacts were fully revealed, it became apparent that many schoolchildren were going to start the school year with little in the way of school books and other materials. I put out a call within my electorate for donations of stationery for schoolchildren in flood affected areas, and the response was remarkable. Just four days after issuing the request, my office was like a de facto stationery warehouse. Virtually every available square centimetre of floor space was covered with bags and boxes of books, pens, rulers, rubbers, glue sticks, knapsacks and even lunch boxes and water bottles. In all, the donated stationery was worth about $8,000--a staggering response from residents and community groups from the southside suburbs. One very savvy community group, the MacGregor Lions, whose membership included a former school principal, even went to the trouble of separating its donation in year levels. There was a bag containing materials suitable for year 1 students, a bag of materials for year 2 students, a bag for year 3 students and so on. The principal at the school could not believe the generosity and thoughtfulness of these gifts when we dropped them off. In the end, we needed a convoy of four cars to deliver the stationery to the Bundamba State School in the electorate of Ipswich and Redbank Plains State School in the electorate of Bundamba, and more stationery supplies will be on their way soon to the badly affected electorate of Ipswich West.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065314"></A>
I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the great Greenslopes stationery drive. In particular, I would like to mention some of the community groups that responded to my request. These groups included the Greater Mount Gravatt-Mansfield Lions; MacGregor Lions; Father Dimitri Tsakas from the Greek Orthodox Church at South Brisbane as well as the broader Greek community of South Brisbane even though they were struggling from the impact of floodwaters; southside mums from the Brisbane Family Day Care service; Julie Fox and her brother Chris Fox from the Greenslopes newsagency in the Greenslopes Mall where I did my first ‘Walk a day in my shoes’ stint; Australian Merchandisers; AgriFood Skills Australia; Officeworks’s Canberra warehouse; GHD, the engineering and professional services firm; the Community and Public Sector Union; the Workplace Health and Safety Queensland office at Lutwyche; and Queensland South Native Title Services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065325"></A>
Of course, the generosity of the Greenslopes community did not end with the flood clean-up or the stationery drive. I am pleased to report that almost 200 residents attended the Great Greenslopes Australia Day Sausage Sizzle at Easts Junior Rugby League Club in Holland Park on 26 January 2011. This event managed to raise almost $2,000 to contribute to the Premier’s Disaster Relief Appeal. Special mention must go to Easts Junior Rugby League Club, which hosted the event without charge and also donated the day’s bar takings. I also wish to thank the members of the Lions clubs from Holland Park and Greater Mount Gravatt-Mansfield who cooked hundreds of sausages on the day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1222076"></A>
Along with numerous individuals who generously donated such as Eva Key and the Wynola Girl Guides group from Coorparoo, other supporters of the great Greenslopes sausage sizzle included Greg Purcell from Meat You Here butchery in the Greenslopes Mall; Shantelle McCudden from Baker’s Delight in the Greenslopes Mall; Tony Merlino and Dot Smith from Coles at the Greenslopes Mall; Andrew Nicolau from JJ’s Fruit Shop in the Greenslopes Mall; Clarence Wong from Brumby’s at Mount Gravatt; Dearne Maxwell at Contours gym in Greenslopes; Dan O’Kane from Dan Murphy’s at Holland Park; Sonya Smith at Video Ezy in Greenslopes; Susan Meehan from Objects d’ at the Greenslopes Mall; Renee Dawson at Andrews Light Up at Mount Gravatt; Peter Weiss from LJ Hooker at Coorparoo; Cass Conwell from All About Health and Body; and Paul Windsor from Vintage Cellars at Stones Corner. This is the sort of community spirit that makes the south side such a great place to live. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1147629"></A>
As we begin the long journey to recovery from these devastating natural disasters, I am reminded of the words of the disciple Paul to the Christians of Rome--‘Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, persevere in prayer’. We must all be patient and persevere as we recover from these terrible disasters. But I have faith that the Queensland spirit will prevail. On behalf of myself, my family and the residents of the state electorate of Greenslopes, I express my sincere condolences to those who have suffered, and who continue to struggle, at this difficult time. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (3.00 pm): Whilst my electorate of Stretton was physically untouched by the January floods, that does not mean that my constituents were untouched by the suffering of their fellow Queenslanders. I have often spoken of how proud I am to represent one of Australia’s most multicultural electorates and time and time again over many years these multicultural communities have been among the first to dig deep into their own pockets to help those who have been impacted by natural disasters. Whether that be raising funds for the victims of the Christchurch earthquake last year, the Victorian bushfires of 2009, the terrible floods in Pakistan, Cyclone Larry in 2006, the earthquakes in Taiwan and southern China and, of course, in 2009 the terrible tsunami that struck Samoa and other Pacific islands as well as the earthquake that hit Indonesia, the various ethnic, cultural and religious groups that make up the Stretton electorate have mobilised quickly and efficiently to dispense comfort and aid to the victims of these terrible natural events. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1065393"></A>
Today I want to take the opportunity provided by this condolence motion to pay special recognition to these multicultural groups. Over the years I have marvelled at the generosity of spirit and giving of the Taiwanese community. These new Australians first started to migrate to our country in the late 1980s under the Hawke government’s business migration scheme. Entrepreneurial by nature, successful businesspeople in their country of origin, this community has established itself as a vital and visible component of the outer south side of Brisbane. The variety of community groups they have established separately and together have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in flood aid. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065396"></A>
The Taiwan Friendship Association of Queensland, the Taiwan Women’s League of Queensland, the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce, the Hakka Association of Queensland as well as the Taipei Office of Economic and Cultural Affairs have all gone about the business of fundraising quietly, efficiently and with a compassion that can only be admired. Just as generous have been those constituents from the People’s Republic of China and Chinese communities from other parts of Asia. The fundraising efforts of the Mainland Chinese Society of Queensland, the Cathay Club in combination with the Sunnybank RSL, as well as the work of the Chinese Consulate to support Chinese tourists in Cairns during Cyclone Yasi all deserve mention and our thanks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065404"></A>
Many of my Chinese constituents are practising Buddhists and have established vibrant and popular temples and orders to allow them to practise their faith. The Chung Tian Temple and Buddha’s Light International Association have established a proud tradition of mobilising substantial physical and financial resources whenever a need arises. The Tzu Chi Foundation has worked tirelessly in the Bundamba electorate and in southern Brisbane suburbs ministering aid and assistance to those most vulnerable.</Hansard-Body>

Over the past few years Australia’s business migration program has delivered to my electorate new constituents from other parts of the world--from India, Pakistan, South Africa, Fiji, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Egypt, Lebanon, Bosnia, Saudi Arabia and the Arab Emirates. Predominantly Muslim by religion, this community has also demonstrated a generosity of spirit, a commitment to helping their fellow Queenslanders and a love of their new home. The Islamic Council of Queensland, the Muslim Charitable Foundation, the Islamic College of Brisbane at Karawatha and the various mosques and Crescents of Brisbane have all raised significant funds for the cause and often in cooperation with other non-Muslim organisations such as the Lions Club of Kuraby and I understand that their fundraising efforts have not finished. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065414"></A>
I have deliberately not mentioned individuals as there are too many to list and no doubt I will leave some out. But I will mention one: Mohammed Sayed Dawoodjee, a trustee of the Kuraby Mosque, who one week before the floods hit Brisbane made a significant donation on behalf of the Kuraby Mosque to the Premier and me for the victims of the Central Queensland floods. Then one week later Mohammed’s own business, Rocklea Cold Storage and Distribution, was inundated completely and its future is now in question. When I visited Mohammed at his Rocklea business his concern was not so much for his own future but for the 70 small businesses that rely on his cold stores to store and distribute their products. It is this concern for our fellow man in time of distress and hurt that has typified all of the efforts of my wonderful multicultural electorate of Stretton. I recognise and thank them all, including the many other community organisations and individuals, and simply say that it is an absolute honour to represent such a generous electorate. </Hansard-Body>

Earlier today I mentioned the heroic efforts of the South East Queensland Water Mount Crosby treatment plant team. I want to expand on those comments during the course of my contribution. I again would like to pay tribute to the truly heroic work of these 19 Seqwater staffers and contractors who braved horrific conditions to make sure that our drinking water continued to flow--water we take for granted every time we turn on a tap. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065421"></A>
Much of Brisbane’s drinking water is treated at the Mount Crosby water treatment plants and pumping stations in Brisbane’s western suburbs. This critical infrastructure is spread over two sites: the east bank and the west bank plants. Following the rains and extreme flooding that inundated the Brisbane River catchment and tributaries, the river was awash with debris, silt and other rubbish, making it extremely turbid. The severe raw water conditions, as the experts call them, were so bad that both treatment plants were shut down. On Wednesday, 12 January, rising floodwaters had completely isolated the east bank plant. The pump station and its raw water wells--one of them to the depth of around eight storeys, or more than 40 metres underground--were flooded. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065423"></A>
Up at Mount Crosby Weir the flood level was only about a metre below the 1974 levels and I am sure the House understands the severity of that situation. The next day, Thursday the 13th, maintenance staff were flown by helicopter into the facility in a New South Wales Fire and Rescue chopper at 6 am. Their entry was dramatic and what they found looked like something out of a Hollywood disaster movie. Light circuits were blown and light fittings were filled with water. The dewatering bilge pumps were inundated and all the line shaft and thrust bearings--the machinery fundamental to supplying clean tap-water to the people of Brisbane--were filled completely with mud, silt and water. The plant was in terrible shape and without speedy repairs Brisbane’s access to clean, drinkable water would have been threatened. The maintenance team members toiled in horrendous conditions while filthy water rained down on them. It was pitch black, extremely humid and the floors and ladders were slippery with fetid mud. With torches in their mouths, team members crawled on their chests through mud and filth deep down into the subfloor to access vital dewatering pumps and to overhaul mechanical and electrical equipment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065425"></A>
The east bank plant was built in the 1890s and Seqwater staff were definitely drawing on old school fitter and turner skills to get the plant back up and running. This was a situation that none of the workers had faced before and the textbooks were certainly thrown out the window. Twelve hours later at 6 pm the crew was airlifted out. The wells had been pumped out and that evening provided some crucial drying time for temperature probes and safety sensors. At 6 am the next day, the crews were back at the treatment plants to continue their work. Shortly after 10 am that day they succeeded in bringing two pumps back online to help provide more than 100 megalitres of raw water for treatment and supply to the grid. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065426"></A>
But the work did not end there. The workers’ tireless efforts meant that by Saturday nine raw water pumps were back online, capable of delivering more than 450 megalitres for treatment. At the same time a team of 20 Seqwater staff were hard at work at the isolated Mount Crosby Water Treatment Plant. These were staff who were stranded after rising floodwaters cut roads. Rather than bemoaning their lot or sitting around waiting to be airlifted out, they got stuck in and did the hard work to ensure that the plant was able to continue to deliver treated water into the water grid. Staff were also hard at work repairing the Lowood and Kilcoy water treatment plants. At Kilcoy, it was ordinary rank-and-file community members rolling up their sleeves to help staff bring the plant back online. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065427"></A>
I recently visited the Mount Crosby Water Treatment Plant and I had the opportunity to experience the cramped, claustrophobic conditions firsthand. However, when I visited the lights were on, the humidity manageable and the facility was not awash with foul mud and water. Heroism knows many forms and what we saw at Mount Crosby was true heroism. It was only through the remarkable grit, ingenuity and selflessness of the Seqwater staff that Brisbane’s drinking water supply was able to be secured. In less than a day and a half these 19 workers were able to take the plant from a situation where it was unable to produce any water to where it was able to supply the entire grid. Their efforts saved authorities from having to issue ‘boil water’ alerts across much of South-East Queensland. The loss of drinking water supply would have significantly compounded the havoc of the extreme flood event as well as hampering the early recovery process. These men at Seqwater are, in one sense, ordinary Queenslanders who, in the hour of the state’s greatest need, were called upon to do something truly extraordinary, something few people would be able to do and even less would be willing to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070059"></A>
Many Queenslanders can tell similar tales of jobs that needed to be done and people putting their hands up, willing to help out. We are not out of the woods yet. The recovery is still in its very early days and we still face difficult months ahead. Queensland has never faced a challenge quite like this, but I know that the men and women of this great state are undaunted. Life will go on and we will rebuild. </Hansard-Body>

On a somewhat lighter note, this morning the Premier mentioned the generosity coming from overseas. As members will know, I am a great fan of the round-ball game--the true football. It was with somewhat mixed feelings that I learned about an initiative by the Glasgow Celtic Football Club. I have to say that it is not my club of choice. If I were pushed, I would back the Blues rather than the Hoops. Celtic toured Australia back in 2009 and played a very entertaining match against the Brisbane Roar at Suncorp Stadium. Celtic remembered the warmth of their time here in Brisbane and, as a result of that, decided to put up for auction the signed jerseys of a recent match. The mixed feelings I have are because it just happened to be the match in which they played my home team--my place of birth--Aberdeen. On that occasion Celtic, as they have done on four occasions this season, gave us a towelling. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070063"></A>
I learned yesterday that, as a result of the auction of those signed jerseys, they have raised £5,000 which will go to the Premier’s Disaster Relief Appeal. Again with mixed feelings I have recently discovered that I will be the recipient of one of those jerseys through the generosity of Professor John Fraser, who is one of Australia’s best heart surgeons. John is a Glasgow Celtic fan of many, many years. I am somewhat pleased to say that his choice was a jersey of a former Aberdeen player, so the hurt and embarrassment are not complete. I place on record my thanks for the generosity of Glasgow Celtic in this initiative. It is greatly appreciated. The many Scots who make up Queensland, many of whom would have been impacted by these floods, would certainly appreciate their generosity as well. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.12 pm): I rise today with a heavy heart to join with my parliamentary colleagues in supporting this motion of condolence and acknowledging one of the most devastating periods of natural disaster in Queensland’s history. My electorate of Mermaid Beach was not affected directly by the recent natural disasters. For a change, the Gold Coast miraculously escaped water damage of any great magnitude. However, as shadow minister for tourism and racing I have watched in disbelief the devastating effects of the disastrous floods and cyclones all over Queensland. I express my sincere condolences to all of the families who have suffered the greatest tragedy of all, that being the loss of loved ones--in some cases having them ripped from their arms in the most heartbreaking of circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<DIV>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070070"></A>
To all those who have lost their homes and the possessions they have accumulated over a lifetime I give my sincere, heartfelt sympathies. This period in Queensland’s history will be remembered as its annus horribilis and comprises a series of events combined that I cannot fully comprehend as to its total devastation. To have disaster on top of disaster is inconceivable. But as we all know, we should never underestimate the commanding and unknown powers of the forces of Mother Nature. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070071"></A>
The Premier, to her great credit, advised Queenslanders last year of the impending La Niña pattern and weather conditions forecast for this summer period. She warned of the possibility of cyclones for the summer season. Little did she know how right she was and what the future would hold for the state of Queensland and for her. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070072"></A>
Personally, I would like to acknowledge the dedicated and unwavering support and commitment of our emergency services personnel, including the Queensland Ambulance Service, the SES, the Fire and Rescue Service; our volunteer St John Ambulance officers, who themselves treated 6,500 people across the state; our swift-water rescue teams; the Police Service; our Defence Force personnel; public and private sector employees; the thousands of mud army volunteers; all other volunteer organisations; and the courageous Queensland community, who came out in the time of crisis to help their fellow man. I would also like to make special mention of all of our interstate emergency personnel and volunteers who ventured across borders to help Queenslanders in need when we most needed them. In many cases it was a reciprocation of our emergency services helping other states during bushfires, but it was and is greatly appreciated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070073"></A>
I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition, John-Paul Langbroek, on his steely resolve to remove politics from this devastating misadventure and to concentrate only on making a great personal effort across all affected areas of Queensland with his personal appearance at every catastrophic site. He did not chase the media for self-indulgence at a time when a higher need for empathy with disenfranchised Queenslanders prevailed as his No. 1 priority. The response was overwhelming and exceptional and the generosity of spirit will live with us forever. It has been truly inspiring and has renewed our faith in humanity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070074"></A>
The tourism industry is suffering enormously from the devastating effects of the recent natural disasters. I congratulate the government on the $10 million advertising package promised for the industry to tell the rest of Australia and the world that our tourism industry is open for business. As I looked at the images of a devastated Dunk Island, I reflected on the trip my wife and I took to Dunk to celebrate our wedding anniversary in January just a couple of years ago. We had the most wonderful time any tourist could want from any destination in the world. To see the atomic-bomb flattening of the facilities on Dunk made my heart cry for the poor owner, who has the herculean task of building it up all over again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070075"></A>
Not only will tourism infrastructure and facilities take time to replace; the fractured image of our mighty tourism industry in Australia will take time to repair. Even areas that were unaffected by floodwater damage require immediate investment to restore confidence and their reputation as destinations that are open for business right now. The $10 million is a great start, but I call on the state and federal governments to back industry requests for a $50 million rescue package for the tourism industry. The size of the industry in Queensland and its importance to the Queensland and Australian governments make it imperative to invest in protecting tourism jobs and tourism infrastructure. This financial support will be critical to the rebuilding of the tourism industry, which is worth $9.2 billion to our economy and which directly and indirectly employs 220,000 people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070076"></A>
The tourism areas of Mission Beach and Dunk Island were hardest hit, along with Yeppoon, Airlie Beach and the Whitsundays, with the devastating effects of both cyclones reaching up and down this region of the coast of Queensland. I support the head of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council, Mr Daniel Gschwind, in his comments that the spirit of Queenslanders through these disasters should be the inspiration and centrepiece for the new tourism industry campaign. In his words, ‘it’s not just the never-say-die attitude and the laconic humour but the absolute efficiency in getting stuck in and not just surviving a disaster but building confidence’ that will drive our tourism industry to the forefront of our economic generators when the world realises the cyclone threats have passed. What the tourism industry needs in order to restore businesses is to build confidence. The new slogan ‘Queensland... Ready to welcome you’ says it all. I commend Tourism Queensland for the development of this promotion and for its strict time frame in disseminating this message as soon as possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070106"></A>
The racing industry was also hit hard and the clean-up effort at Callaghan Park racetrack has been significant and very difficult. With the community banding together, we have seen a light at the end of the tunnel and race days will resume from 19 March 2011. I emphasise my unqualified congratulations to the Racing Queensland board on its immediate response of providing a rescue package to industry participants in the Rockhampton area to tide them over until their jobs and the local industry come back online. The racing industry gathered together for a fundraising event for the floods. I was very humbled to be a part of the bipartisan efforts, given so freely, at this and hundreds of other fundraising events across Queensland. Across the state Queenslanders were magnanimous in their giving, with many not only supporting fundraising events but also volunteering to clean up their local turf clubs. The particular event I went to raised $126,000 and I congratulate all involved in the organisation of that event. Other country tracks, such as at Taroom, were completely obliterated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070111"></A>
I commend Racing Queensland for its support of the racing industry in Queensland following the disasters. I implore it to continue in a benevolent frame of mind to ensure country race clubs can continue to provide social interaction and community fabric for isolated areas, long after the flood damaged racecourses have been repaired. We need to continue to band together as the next stage in our recovery is our healing. When our communities have finished the physicality of rebuilding homes and community infrastructure, which we know is going to take a very long time, we need to take positive steps to learn from nature’s cruel and frightening lessons.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070112"></A>
The psychological effects of such devastating events need to be addressed as a community. If it is just phoning a friend or relative who has been affected by the recent events to see how they are going, then please do so. That ongoing support is just as important as the physical clean-up work. You might think it is small, but it gives people the opportunity to talk to someone about the pain that they may be going through. This will help Queenslanders so much in their recovery. Through this, as a state we will become stronger and more resilient than ever before. I wholeheartedly support the condolence motion before the House. I reiterate my deepest sympathies to all those who lost loved ones in this very cruel fashion. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(Redlands--LNP) (3.22 pm): I rise to speak to the motion of condolence to Queensland’s natural disaster victims moved by the Premier and offer my wholehearted sympathies to families suffering loss. Queensland has witnessed flood and cyclone events that are hard to imagine. Those events had the ability to bend us to their will but not to break us, nor will they break the Queensland spirit. We have heard many examples of courage, bravery, dedication, commitment and generosity unequalled in our history. The events of late 2010 and early 2011 will continue to reshape Queensland. Queenslanders will not be daunted or put off their resolve to rebuild their part of Queensland stronger and better than it was. The strength of Queenslanders is drawn from our common love of our state and of our fellow Queenslander and a belief in our own ability and our own capability. Strength comes in many forms. However, it begins when people stand up to be counted. </Hansard-Body>

As the events unfolded around the state, people from my electorate began calling and asking, ‘How can I help?’ Just like the rain, the calls kept coming from more and more volunteers. Redlanders were not affected by the floods, but we were very affected by the images on our TVs of the events of December and January. I want to pay special tribute to a few volunteers who worked tirelessly to help affected communities: Suzie Masters, Stephanie Pearce and Terri Davidson. Suzie Masters is a resident of Victoria Point. She called me one afternoon with a plan. She was most insistent that I make time to see her and I did. We met that night and she said that she needed my help to make her plan a reality. She needed me to open doors for her. On the evening we met, she explained her plan and within 12 hours we had a distribution centre, we had a Facebook page, we had 20 to 30 volunteers all ready to go and God knows how much aid ready to be distributed. I will come back to that detail later in my address. Suzie had a catchphrase. Whenever and wherever we needed people or supplies, she would say, ‘Ask and they will come; ask and it will come.’ How right she was. Suzie was shadowed by her two young adult children, Katie and Nicholas, who are both students at Victoria Point State High School. A little later I will talk more about the youth of the Redlands. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070126"></A>
Stephanie Pearce is involved in the school communities of Victoria Point State High School and Redland Bay State School. She joined our team pretty much from day one. She worked with a team of volunteers, working on logistics, communication and administration. If anything needed doing and you gave it to Stephanie, you could guarantee that it would be done. She worked tirelessly with hundreds of perfect strangers--a new batch of strangers every day. And all I can say is, ‘Thank you, Stephanie, for your contribution.’ Terri Davidson is a nurse. The prerequisites for nursing are caring and responsibility. Terri stepped up to the plate and was largely responsible for managing the receiving and sorting of goods, repacking, loading. You name it, if had to do with logistics Terri would be there to ensure it happened and happened safely. Those three ladies brought professionalism, good humour and energy to this vibrant team. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070128"></A>
Suzie had not only an idea or the seed of an idea. She had seen an empty warehouse with a ‘For lease’ sign in the window. By 10 pm, after that first evening meeting, we had the keys to a warehouse provided by local businessman Brian Oldfield, dealer principal from Oldfield Holden in Capalaba. I take this opportunity to thank him for his generosity. Not only did he provide the warehouse but he also ensured that the power was turned on, he organised for litter to be picked up and the rubbish bins to be emptied through J.J.Richards on an almost daily basis, and he made a generous personal donation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070132"></A>
I acknowledge the support of my neighbouring electorates of Capalaba and Cleveland. Both honourable members, Michael Choi and Mark Robinson, put their shoulders to the wheel. We worked as a team. Alone we could have been effective and we were effective. I know we each did our own individual things. However, together, with the help of thousands of Redlanders and thousands of volunteers, we were able to make a most amazing contribution. Redland City was unscathed, but we were not untouched and we were not unmoved. A network of volunteers came together through service communities, scouts, guides, Lions, Apex, Rotary, life saving clubs; charities such as St Vinnies, Lifeline, Global Care and so many others; businesses such as Oldfield Holden, RSVP Party Hire, Bunnings, Officeworks and many other businesses. They were all there from day one to help us out. Their generosity made the entire thing possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070135"></A>
By far the most indelible image of the Queensland community flood relief was seeing hundreds of young people come forward. So often young people are criticised, as outlined by the Leader of the Opposition, John-Paul Langbroek, in his contribution to the condolence motion. The young people, who are so often criticised, were amazing. Through sites such as Facebook, young people have a network that you would not believe. They showed leadership, they showed commitment and they showed maturity beyond their years. I mention three in particular: Rocky, Michael and Claire. Last year they were school leaders at Victoria Point State High School and Sheldon College in my community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074409"></A>
There were also students from pretty much every school in the Redlands as well as students from schools in the Capalaba and Cleveland electorates. There were teachers from schools in my electorate and those adjoining it. The Facebook page--the social networking--was updated hourly. This actually demonstrated what a powerful tool social media is and it was used in a very positive way. That network brought in those young people in their droves and for that I am eternally grateful. The Facebook page being updated so often brought us not only the volunteers we needed but also the much needed goods. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074414"></A>
I also acknowledge the efforts of our federal member Andrew Laming, the member for Bowman, and his support and involvement in the process. The community of Redlands dispatched goods to affected communities across the state including suburbs in and around Brisbane. I remember going out with the member for Moggill and having a look through the areas of Kenmore and some of those suburbs in his electorate. We pulled up to talk to a group of volunteers with shovels, wheelbarrows and what have you. You could tell they had done a hard day’s work. I wound down the window and I said, ‘G’day.’ One of them said, ‘You’re Peter.’ I said, ‘Yeah, how do you know that?’ He said, ‘We’re all from Redlands.’ There was one from Capalaba, a couple from Thornlands, one from Mount Cotton, one from Redland Bay and one from Victoria Point. That demonstrates the depth of support that came from not only the Redlands but also those other communities that were not affected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074416"></A>
The member for Capalaba, Michael Choi, and I led a convoy of vehicles out to Ipswich. Again, that was so well received and so well appreciated by Councillor Paul Pisasale, Mayor of Ipswich. I acknowledge his contribution on behalf of his people. We helped townships in the Lockyer Valley, Maryborough, across the range into the Darling Downs and beyond. We dispatched food, clothing, furniture, medicines, cleaning goods, utensils, insecticides, batteries, shoes, personal hygiene products, et cetera--you name it. The generosity shown was touching and it touched the hearts of recipients. They realised that they were not alone.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074419"></A>
The Rotary Club in our area got together and held a monster garage sale to raise much needed money. Help from Redlands and our community came in many forms. The warehouse we used was filled and emptied many, many times and I thank not only those who volunteered to pack and distribute its contents but also those who contributed items. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074421"></A>
I have travelled to numerous communities and heard firsthand their stories--stories that tell of hurt, suffering and loss. It brought home to me the importance of counselling. I acknowledge the work done so far and the work that lies ahead for the church and welfare organisations to counsel Queensland families, to help them come to terms with their loss and to rebuild the Queensland spirit. The power of conversation and an embrace cannot be underestimated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074422"></A>
I applaud the many formal and informal supporters working on the ground in those affected communities. If there is one word that springs to mind when wanting to describe Queenslanders, it is resolve. I also add my thanks to the many community leaders who stepped up for their communities: members of this House, federal members, councillors, police, emergency services, Emergency Management Queensland, SES, church leaders and our military. Their dedication is to be commended. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074423"></A>
The Queensland spirit--the ‘don’t let a mate down’, the ‘help your neighbour’--is typified by the man on the land. Farms have been decimated and yet they provide our food and our clothing. I met with a number of people in the community out at Cecil Plains and I would like to acknowledge Jan and Meagan who hosted a meeting on their farm, which was quite badly damaged. They invited transport operators from their community, grain growers, suppliers and businesspeople. They were all affected but they wanted to talk about the issues they were facing. I was pleased to be there. I thank the member for Condamine for facilitating that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074427"></A>
On my travels I met an American couple who had never seen anything like this--this human army willing to help out. They tell me that traditionally Americans are spectators and critics, but guess what? They, too, became volunteers. They, too, had caught the Queensland spirit. It is infectious. I met rail workers from Gladstone who pretty much adopted Theodore. I acknowledge that the member for Callide mentioned them in his address. I joined them at a town barbecue with EMQ, the police, SES, councillors and residents. It was a giant thankyou barbecue in the town. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074428"></A>
I also acknowledge the office staff--the EOs and the AEOs--of the state members who, in large measure, carried some of the day-to-day routine in the office. I thank them for their backing on our behalf. Travelling primarily by road you see the magnitude of the destruction and the magnitude of the job that is waiting for us to step up to. Road, rail, infrastructure, irrigation, mining--they are all industries and assets that have been decimated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074429"></A>
We have heard much about leadership and we tested our authorities. We tested our police, we tested our emergency services, we tested the SES, we tested the local and regional disaster management groups and they all passed their tests with flying colours. For that our communities will be eternally grateful. The test for us, however, will be ongoing. The tragic circumstances will not be forgotten. The loss of lives will not be forgotten, nor should they. The generosity of Queenslanders will not be forgotten. The Queensland spirit will not be forgotten, nor will it be extinguished. We weep for those gone. We pray for those missing. We help those suffering and we hope for the future. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Widespread flooding and the most severe cyclone in living history struck terror in our hearts from the far north to South-East Queensland. When the Premier delivered the bad news at 10.30 pm on Wednesday night just a fortnight ago telling us Cyclone Yasi showed no signs of weakening, those in the safety of our homes in Brisbane felt terror for the people in the far north. Overnight we waited with bated breath. A category 5 cyclone was bad and to make things worse we were already exhausted before Yasi hit our shores. Raging floods across Queensland had already caused the Premier to declare three-quarters of this great state a disaster zone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074441"></A>
We saw how quickly and how intense rain can fall. In Brisbane we were slightly relieved when the Brisbane River peaked just below the 1974 flood level, but we watched in agony as the death toll continued to rise from the flash flood in the Lockyer Valley. These few weeks tested our determination, our resolve and our faith. From these dark clouds we look for that ever elusive silver lining, and on this occasion we did not have to look too far. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

I went to the evacuation centre at Bowen Hills and spent some time there working with the honourable member for Brisbane Central, Grace Grace. A well-mannered young girl came to the counter asking for water while holding firmly to her mother’s hand. ‘Sure. Would you like some food, too?’ I asked. I glanced at her exhausted mother, who held my eyes with a desperate but determined gaze. ‘Only if you have enough for other people,’ her mother said in a quiet and uncompromising tone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078575"></A>
What makes a person, despite their own circumstances, think not of themselves but of others? What went through a young boy’s mind in a raging flood when he asked a rescuer to save his brother first and, in doing so, gave his life as a consequence? What motivates a mother who has lost everything to find the energy, the fortitude and the strength to counsel others in an evacuation centre? Maybe it is the human spirit. Maybe it is what the Premier said: ‘We are the people they breed tough north of the border.’ Maybe it is just that we are Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078578"></A>
People naturally thanked me as I gave them water and food at the evacuation centre. However, it is I who must give thanks for many humbling and inspiring experiences in the last few weeks. Our community, in a sea of consumerism just after Christmas and New Year, has found its roots and its soul. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078579"></A>
My electorate was spared any major natural disaster this summer, but the good people of the Redlands know instinctively that they have to do something to help their fellow Queenslanders--and help they did. In Capalaba, the Queensland community flood relief collection centre was established by Redlanders Suzie Masters and Stephanie Pearce. The centre worked in conjunction with the local disaster management group coordinators to deliver much needed goods to where they were required. People turned up in droves to volunteer their time and to give donations, with many locals offering trailers and even horse floats to help with transportation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078582"></A>
Capalaba and Redland businesses gave generously to help set up the collection centre. Local businesses donated essential stationery and fans to keep volunteers cool, and strangers brought plates of food to keep volunteers going as they formed human chains to pack trucks with donated goods. Just to give this House an idea of the breadth of generosity, within one hour, the combined efforts of businesses in Redland City saw a helicopter filled with donated essential items, some of them medical items, bound for the most isolated flood stricken areas in the Lockyer Valley. In fact, over a two- to three-week period the collection centre has collected, packed and delivered two loads to the RNA Showgrounds, four loads to Maryborough, 24 loads to Ipswich, 10 loads to Bundamba and many loads to the totally devastated areas of Grantham, Murphys Creek and Gatton. Donations from the Redlands were some of the first they received. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078586"></A>
I take this opportunity to thank a few people. First I thank our Premier for her leadership and for her informative and calm persona and determined attitude in the darkest hour of our state. I also thank the whole cabinet for stepping up and spending extra hours and days to comfort our fellow Queenslanders; all the emergency services personnel, who are just wonderful; and, of course, Suzie Masters, Stephanie Pearce and Terri Davidson for starting the community collection centre. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078590"></A>
I also pay tribute to my two parliamentary colleagues the member for Redlands and the member for Cleveland, Peter Dowling and Mark Robinson respectively, for being able to work together in a totally bipartisan way to help our community. I also thank the Rotary Club of the Redlands for organising one of the biggest donations and warehouse sales in the history of our city. Over two weekends they have raised something like $90,000 to help victims of the cyclone and the flood. I would also like to thank Brian Oldfield--who was mentioned earlier by the member for Redlands--from Oldfield Holden for offering his warehouse for us to use. I also thank Mick Corboy from the Golden Circle factory outlet at Capalaba for donating 5,000 mops and 5,000 brooms for the clean-up process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078595"></A>
Flood and cyclones do not discriminate. Whether you are white or black or Hindu or whether you are Muslim, Christian or Buddhist, we all suffered the same way. I think the response from the multicultural community has been amazing. I was in the evacuation centre with the member for Brisbane Central when the multicultural community came in with food and drink. We had Italian food, Greek food and Chinese food. It was like a multicultural banquet. It was actually better food in the evacuation centre than in my home! The Chinese community brought in their normal food, like beef in black-bean sauce and sweet-and-sour pork, which was a treat to a lot of people staying at the centre. But it took me quite some time to explain some of the delicacies that they sent in. One of the delicacies was gluten rice with chicken inside, wrapped in a lotus leaf. I was hoping they did not send in any other delicacies such as chicken feet to the evacuation centre! </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078598"></A>
Over the last three weeks and with Chinese New Year, the Chinese community took the opportunity to raise funds for flood and cyclone victims. Whether they were Chinese from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan or South-East Asia, they took the time and the opportunity to raise a lot of money for the state. I have been taking note of the money they have donated to the Premier’s appeal and other funds, and I am quietly confident that the total amount donated by the Chinese community would have exceeded $1 million. That is not bad for a group of people who not too long ago were referred to by a red-headed politician of distant past as living in ghettoes and not assimilating. </Hansard-Body>

Mr CHOI:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Lastly, I wish to share a story with members in the House. One day a couple in a battered car turned up on the driveway of the collection centre. I knew them from having provided some assistance to them in the past. They are a truly classic Aussie battler family with three kids under five years of age. Between them--and I know this for a fact--they would have less than a few hundred dollars in the bank, if that. They opened the boot of their 20-plus-year-old car and it was full of fresh produce and tinned food they had bought from the supermarket for flood victims. The docket was still inside one of the bags and my attention was drawn to the amount printed on the bottom--$324.24. Not often do I find myself speechless. I felt so small in the presence of giants. As a state, as Queenslanders, together we weep, together we hug, but together we will rebuild our great state. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110216_154640" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Mansfield--ALP) (Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport) (3.46 pm): We will never forget those harrowing days when floodwater invaded parts of Queensland. The torrent of water was as cruel as it was unprecedented, making its way through homes, streets, suburbs and towns without mercy. Mother Nature flexed her considerable muscle, tossing cars around like toys, devastating family homes. It left in its wake a path of destruction on both a physical and an emotional level. We will never forget it. </A></Hansard-Body>

Queenslanders have lost so much. I would like to extend my heartfelt condolences to the Queensland people who have suffered significantly in recent weeks. The lives of loved ones, relatives, friends and neighbours have been lost. We have seen the heartbreaking images of families returning to discover what was left of their homes, treasured possessions scattered or lost in the torrent. I do not think any of us will forget Monday, 10 January. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078624"></A>
I had come home from the Sunshine Coast that day and had left friends of mine who were on their way home to Chinchilla with their five children. I got a text at about 3.30 that afternoon saying that they were stuck on the road just outside Withcott. The road had become a car park and it looked like they were in for a long stay--not that they or I knew what had occurred. Like everyone else, I turned on the TV news at six o’clock that night and I do not think I believed what I was seeing in Toowoomba. Little did we know that it was to have an impact further down the Toowoomba range in the Lockyer region. That family finally got up the range at about midnight and then stayed in Toowoomba until the Thursday, when they eventually got home to Chinchilla. It just goes to show their timing. Thankfully they stopped at DFO on the way home to buy some school clothes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078655"></A>
To me, those pictures were something you would expect to see overseas, not something you would expect to see in Queensland. I think those pictures actually contributed to people making sure they listened to the messages from the emergency services and the Premier about being prepared for the flood that would follow in the next few days in Brisbane and Ipswich and when Cyclone Yasi hit a couple of weeks later. After we saw those pictures of Toowoomba we knew that we could never know what to expect. I think it opened everyone’s eyes and ears. It must be tragic for those who experienced this and those who witnessed this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078657"></A>
The tears, the anguish, the desperation over that time was raw and palpable. You could see the fear in people’s eyes as they made the decision to evacuate and spend the night at evacuation centres. During the time I spent at the Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre, the old QEII stadium, which was being used as one of the major evacuation centres, I witnessed the suffering firsthand. In the makeshift bedding, they could only imagine the waters engulfing their family homes and snatching their treasured belongings. You could see the tears in their eyes as they imagined what tomorrow and the weeks to follow would bring. But they were safe.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078658"></A>
Thanks to the amazing number of volunteers, stranded families had a safe haven, a warm place to sleep and something to eat. It was a small blessing during those tough times. The humanity and true spirit of being a Queenslander was on display with an overwhelming response. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078659"></A>
The volunteers arrived, as did the donations. It was an avalanche of generosity. There were tables overflowing with the essentials--clothes and shoes. I remember a driver of a truck that was full of fruit that pulled up at QSAC. He said that he could not get up the mountain and the fruit was only going to perish so he left the fresh fruit for those at the evacuation centre. The kitchen was fully stocked. The volunteer chefs were going full steam ahead--24/7. We will never forget it. It was great that we had a facility that could be used for that purpose.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078660"></A>
We saw the heartbreaking effects of the floods but we also saw, once again, what Queenslanders are made of. We rallied round our mates and together formed what has been called the mud army. With the member for Yeerongpilly, I saw the aftermath of the floods in Rocklea. Rocklea is only 10 minutes from my home. The electorate of Mansfield was not impacted at all but 10 minutes down the road we saw destruction that was indescribable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078662"></A>
Some people had just finished renovating their dream home, only to find a mud wasteland had replaced their pride and joy. The mud did not discriminate. The foul-smelling brown sludge encased front yards and backyards. We grabbed whatever we could to help--in my case, a shovel and a broom. I did not use them. It was our hands that were needed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078663"></A>
I got to help an elderly couple from Rocklea who had experienced this before. My wife, friends of mine and I assisted as well as people we did not know. The beautiful home they had been living in since 1958 was ruined. The water had reached their roof, soaking the insulation batts and warping the foundations and the floors. At this house we saw a plastic table stuck on the aerial on top of the house. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078664"></A>
It was too much for the mum to bear. She could not come to the clean-up. She had seen it all before and could not bear to see her beloved home once again swamped by mud. The clean-up was an overwhelming process for the dad. He had to find a quiet place to sit down as 53 years worth of belongings were carried out of his home and placed on the footpath for collection. It has to be hard to see your home of 53 years gutted. We had to rip up the carpets and the floorboards and tear down the plasterboard. We did not do this alone. The mud army rallied. That day renewed everyone’s admiration for generation Y. Often they get criticised for wanting it all for little effort, but their spirit and gung-ho attitude was commendable. We will never forget that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078665"></A>
It was terrific that friends of mine, my family and staff members assisted me in helping these people. They also helped at the evacuation centre. A prime example of this is that my wife, who is a teacher, and a teaching colleague of hers came with me on both days that we spent helping over that weekend. The deputy principal of a local school came along as well. My neighbour saw me arrive home after getting my tetanus shot on the first day. It is a pity my sister had to give it to me; she was working for the council. He said, ‘I had to work all day today, but I really want to come and help. What time are you leaving in the morning?’ I said that I was going to leave at 6.30. I opened my garage door at 6.30 on Sunday morning and not only was one neighbour there but also three of his mates. That just typified what this was all about--helping people who needed our help more than ever before. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078666"></A>
For many Queenslanders, once they had secured their homes and businesses their next thought went to their local sporting club. This is the place where community comes together, where mates socialise over a game of sport, where people come to relax. In many cases, these clubs are the glue which binds communities together. The devastation I have seen over the past few weeks cuts you to the core. It is as hard to see your local sports club affected by the floods as it is to see your home or business impacted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078667"></A>
We think that about 500 clubs across the state were flooded. The waters inundated ovals and courts, canteens and equipment sheds. I have been out and about visiting families and clubs asking what they need to do to get their sport back on track. I have had the pleasure and honour of meeting a lot of these people, from Bundaberg to Ipswich. Just recently I was in Maryborough and Gympie. I intend to visit more places. We will rebuild, but we will never forget the experience. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078668"></A>
No sooner had most of Queensland mopped up then Mother Nature revisited our state with another natural disaster in the form of Cyclone Yasi. We could only watch in terror as Yasi bore down on Far North Queensland packing a category 5 punch. I have no doubt that North Queenslanders did not sleep very well that night. I am sure I speak for many members in this House when I say that southern Queenslanders did not sleep very much that night. I had the TV on and the radio close by. I prayed that the north would not be impacted as we feared it would be. As we know, parts of the north were impacted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078671"></A>
We have never seen anything like it--the wind, the rain, the force of that cyclone. It must have been a terrifying experience. Debris was strewn across backyards and streets, with people’s belongings buried underneath broken timber and sheet metal. Once again, the people of Queensland have been battered. But we are a strong bunch. Once again, we will get through this. I would like to pass on my deepest thanks to the emergency services crews and police. Their planning and preventive measures were nothing short of fantastic. I do not think anyone will forget that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078672"></A>
I also take this opportunity to thank the hundreds of sporting clubs that have rallied behind all those affected. At the evacuation centre we had visits from the Broncos. They were not just fleeting visits. I will not forget the sight of big burly Ben Hannant playing playdough with the Samoan children who were there or seeing Ivan Henjak and a few other Broncos lifting large electric beds into QSAC. The men’s and women’s Roar teams came along. The Reds were involved in sandbagging. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083015"></A>
We saw players from rugby league and the AFL help with the clean-up, and we even had an AFL side come all the way from Western Australia to help. We have all heard about the great fundraising efforts by many of the high-profile sporting clubs. Many people are very quick to knock these clubs, but when the chips were down they were there to help and we appreciated it. We will continue to need their help and the local sporting clubs will particularly need their assistance. It was terrific to be at Moorooka State School and Goodna State School when the entire Australian cricket side gave those communities the lift that they deserve. I thank those players for that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083020"></A>
We now look to the future. We have to continue with our efforts to put Queensland back together. Like the people who lost their lives, we are strong, we are tough and, yes, we are Queenslanders. We will never forget. As a person who is a proud Queenslander, a person who from the age of 14 has never missed a State of Origin game in Brisbane and who has never been so proud of Queenslanders--particularly as we have won five--I have got to say that I have never been as proud to be a Queenslander as I was on that Saturday after the floods when I was standing with hundreds and thousands of people ready to help. In fact, there were so many people that trucks could not get into areas of Rocklea to clean up. It was amazing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083022"></A>
At one of the houses I was at, we still heard the cheekiness in the people. The daughter of the couple who owned the house we were cleaning found some dentures that day. Her father was out the front looking at everything and she yelled out, ‘Dad, are these yours or mum’s, and do you want to keep them?’ There was that sort of laughter going on. When we shifted the bed and saw lots of chocolate wrappings, they said, ‘That mum has a sweet tooth, hasn’t she?’ They kept their sense of humour and that just shows what type of people we are.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083023"></A>
It was a harrowing experience. We have always regarded Brisbane as a big country town. We thought we had lost it, but I think over the last few weeks we have proven that we have not lost it. I hope we continue in that vein because it will be many weeks, months and years before people recover from this. They will need all of our assistance for years to come. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Like many other members of this parliament, I felt for the people of Central and Western Queensland as the rain began to fall in December. In January, I watched on with shock and amazement as events unfolded in Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley. Later, I felt helpless as I heard reports of floodwaters heading to Ipswich and later Brisbane. I remember remarking at the time that I felt somewhat guilty that for once it was not the northern part of the state that was on the receiving end of nature’s fury. Little did I know how wrong I would be.</A></Hansard-Body>

 Last weekend, I attended a multifaith church service in Tully to honour those who have suffered. It offered a chance to reflect and to offer prayers for those who have suffered. The congregation was reminded by Commissioner Bob Atkinson that in Queensland our seasons are not as clearly defined as in some other parts of the world, but there is one season we know plenty about and that is the wet season, which gets larger and longer the further north you go. And then there is the cyclone season on top of that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083035"></A>
Like most people from North Queensland, I have been through cyclone seasons many times before. I remember when Cyclone Winifred struck Far North Queensland in 1986. It came across the coast on 1 February--my birthday. I was meant to be having my first ever birthday party, with a cake and all of my friends from school. Needless to say, my party was cancelled and instead of a cake I had a milk arrowroot biscuit smeared with butter and topped with hundreds and thousands. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083036"></A>
Almost 25 years later to the day, it was a case of deja vu, only this time I spent my birthday preparing for Cyclone Yasi--cleaning up my yard, securing loose items and, most importantly, making sure my family, particularly my wife and son, were safe. I also found myself travelling between Cairns and Innisfail to try to be involved in local disaster management group meetings for two regional councils and I was on the phone with a third at Yarrabah. We were well prepared for this event. The Cairns Regional Council had undertaken comprehensive flood mapping to guard against the threat of storm surge. We saw the unprecedented airlift of more than 320 patients from the Cairns Base Hospital and the Cairns Private Hospital, and an additional 500 people from the SES had been sent into the area. The lessons learnt from the Cyclone Larry experience would be invaluable and any complacency that may have crept in over the years disappeared once we all got a look at the monster weather system that was headed our way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083038"></A>
On the night of 2 February and early the following morning, our region was struck by the fiercest cyclone recorded since 1918. As anybody who has been through a few will tell you, with cyclones it is not what you see, it is what you hear. Besides the sound of the ABC Radio coverage, it is the relentless howling. It is also what you feel, like the vibration of your house. The seeing is what you do the next day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083040"></A>
Daybreak revealed plenty of vegetation loss and minor structural damage around my immediate area of Gordonvale. I visited local evacuation centres and for a moment I thought perhaps we had got off lightly. It was only when I heard from my brother-in-law in Kurrimine Beach that the extent of the impact started to become clear. He and his wife and three children were safe, as were their horses--which spent the night inside the house with the family--but their house had been severely flooded and they had lost their shed, their roof and every window in the house. Just today, they found out that their house is not structurally sound and is no longer habitable. Their story has become typical for areas south of Innisfail.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083042"></A>
From everything I have seen, Babinda and the greater Innisfail area have been affected less dramatically than with Cyclone Larry but it has been affected nonetheless. Certainly, the restoration of power has been an ongoing issue, but I know just how flat out Ergon workers have been. I also know that the thoughts of people in these communities have been with their southern cousins, because the people of Babinda and Innisfail have been through this before and want to repay some of the kindness shown to them in the past.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083043"></A>
By Friday, 4 February--just one day after the cyclone--a relief squad of 2,600 people was converging on towns from Townsville to Cairns. Our first priorities were to ensure our people were safe. Food and medical supplies also ranked among those first priorities. We then set about to begin the restoration of essential services like transport, power and water supply. The longer task is rebuilding the houses and the infrastructure that has been damaged or destroyed, and that will run into billions of dollars--148 houses were destroyed, a further 649 are uninhabitable and 2,335 have suffered moderate damage, and that is before we look at the damage to infrastructure.</Hansard-Body>

The Far North has long been a tight-knit community that looks after its own and willingly lends a hand to others in need. This has been demonstrated time and time again in the aftermath of Cyclone Yasi--from residents in affected areas helping friends and neighbours who had been hardest hit, to the tireless workers from emergency services and the police, workers from Telstra and Ergon, Defence Force personnel, workers from government agencies and NGOs and, of course, the hundreds of volunteers. Never have I been more proud to be a Queenslander. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083045"></A>
Locally, there are some who I believe deserve special mention, like district disaster coordinator Inspector David Tucker, who kept cool under pressure in the planning and preparation, and Mayor Bill Shannon--indeed all the councillors and staff at the Cassowary Coast Regional Council--for the way they have rallied the community during this difficult time. Thank you also to the unsung heroes from outside our area, including staff from the Department of Community Safety and the Department of Communities, who were on the ground as quickly as possible after the danger had passed to coordinate the state government’s response. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083047"></A>
I thank the Minister for Emergency Services, Neil Roberts, and staff across all the ministerial offices. Much has been said in the media--indeed in this House--about the leadership of Premier Anna Bligh during this time of crisis, but I contend there is nothing out of the ordinary about her leadership. I say this because over the past month or so I have seen the same determined, strong, decisive, compassionate and articulate leader I have seen many times before. No, the leadership of Anna Bligh has not been extraordinary, but Anna Bligh the person has been. She has been a beacon of hope for all Australians at this time. We have all been lucky enough to have seen her in full flight and have benefited from her guidance. </Hansard-Body>

We were well prepared for Cyclone Yasi, and now the recovery is under way. The Premier has announced she will establish a Queensland Reconstruction Authority to coordinate and oversee recovery, including cyclone reconstruction. Local leaders on the ground were vital in the immediate aftermath of Cyclone Yasi. Having a local chain of command led by the LDMG allowed the people who best know the local areas impacted by Cyclone Yasi to steer the disaster response. The same approach will apply in the long-term reconstruction, with the decision to establish a dedicated North Queensland Office of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. This will be based in Innisfail and will be led by Queensland Police Chief Superintendent Michael Keating. North Queenslanders do need their own voice in the reconstruction effort and Chief Superintendent Keating will be that voice. Over the past two decades, he has served in Cairns, Townsville, Tully and Innisfail and also has experience of the reconstruction effort post Cyclone Larry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087666"></A>
It will be his exclusive job to lead the reconstruction for the people of North Queensland and we will seek, wherever possible, not just to replace infrastructure and facilities but to improve upon what was there. While we recognise the need for recovery to be expedient and prioritised to those areas which need it the most, just as critical are the local economies that have been devastated. In Tully the Building Services Authority has opened an office to provide affected homeowners and contractors with information and advice about rebuilding. I believe that government at all levels, wherever possible, should require local work to be done by locals--the community helping their community. Moral pressure must also be applied to insurance companies to use local contractors, and I urge policyholders to make a point of telling their insurance provider that their preference is that a local contractor be used.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087673"></A>
While I am not the local member for the areas hardest hit, my office has already been fielding and responding to requests. I offer my continued assistance and that of my staff to all of the people in the communities of El Arish, Silkwood, Tully, Tully Heads and Cardwell who have lost their homes and possessions, some their jobs and their sense of security. Their awe-inspiring resilience and stoicism in the face of disaster proves that they will regroup, rebuild and recover. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087675"></A>
I also offer my personal support to the member for Hinchinbrook, Andrew Cripps. I know that he, like me, genuinely cares about the welfare of his constituents. I also know that we share a love of rugby league. We may play for different clubs during the regular season, but when it comes to stepping up to representative football I am only too happy to pack into the scrum with him. I commend him on his speech to the House yesterday and for the statesmanlike manner in which he has approached the clean-up and recovery effort.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087676"></A>
Since Cyclone Yasi struck I have been on the ground many times meeting people in those communities I referred to earlier, including visiting with the Prime Minister and the Premier and other state government ministers to ensure they see firsthand the devastation being experienced. What brought it home for me was a meeting with an 85-year-old woman from Tully Heads named Patricia Butler, a local artist of some renown and, quite frankly, a real character. As members have already heard, her house was completely destroyed by storm surge and all that remained were the concrete stumps. Cruelly, this was the second time that that house on that block had been destroyed. Upon meeting her it was immediately obvious that Mrs Butler is fiercely independent but is now faced with the prospect of moving in with her daughter. She has decided that she will not rebuild on that site. Mrs Butler’s story is but one story of the many people deeply affected, and if one needs any further motivation to support these residents they need not look any further than her example.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087679"></A>
I have been working closely with the local disaster management coordinator and others at the Cassowary Coast Regional Council on a variety of issues, including improving coordination around volunteers, community recovery centres, accommodation issues--both for residents and workers--and reducing red tape for those people with heavy vehicles and earthmoving equipment who wish to contribute to the clean-up and recovery effort. Anybody who is involved in the response post event will admit that it has not been perfect, but I can say, hand on heart, that authorities are doing the best they can. I believe that because I have seen it for myself.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087681"></A>
The damage that has been caused by Cyclone Yasi is not just material; it is also spiritual and emotional. We have to recover from all aspects of the damage inflicted. Just like we were asked to talk to our neighbours before the cyclone to ensure they were prepared and aware of warnings, we need to continue to check on our neighbours to ensure they are doing okay. Not all will be overtly asking for help. And it is not just the immediate damage and disruption that occurred during the tense few hours when the storm hit; it is also the long-term economic and social consequences--the damage to infrastructure and the slow death being experienced by some tourism operators. Not only will the loss of crops such as bananas and sugar have an impact on residents; we have to remember that some farmers have only just got back on track after Cyclone Larry struck five years ago. For some, asking them to start again will be too much.</Hansard-Body>

At the same time that Queensland was being subjected to arguably the worst natural disasters Australia had ever seen, across the Pacific in South America the people of Brazil were dealing with deadly mudslides. Flooding and mudslides are common in Brazil when the summer rains come but, like our recent extreme weather events, this was among the worst in recent memory. The last I heard, the death toll had reached 500 but with many hundreds more missing. Media reports talked about many of the same things we were experiencing--limited access due to road closures, confusion and enormous anxiety by people searching for their loved ones. But there was almost no talk about the damage bill. In many other countries, particularly developing nations, the focus is on building cheaper infrastructure and housing, which, of course, is easier and less costly to rebuild, but almost always there is a significantly higher loss of life if a natural disaster strikes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087683"></A>
I am thankful that we have legislation that ensures stringent building and construction. I am also thankful for the approach we take to disaster management, both proactively and in the response post event. It is no exaggeration to say that we have perhaps the best community safety and disaster management reputation in the world, and it is a reputation that is richly deserved. We can do all of this because we are a wealthy country--in terms of both dollars and our sense of community--but the reason we do all of this is that we place such a strong emphasis on human life. I am sure there will be more we can learn, and we must remember that, while it is many years since a cyclone of Yasi’s force has hit Queensland, there is no guarantee that it will not happen again. So we must reconstruct with that in mind, especially since climate change experts warn that we can expect more violent weather events in the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087684"></A>
Recovery will be a slow process right across the state but, to borrow from Major General Peter Cosgrove following Cyclone Larry, ‘the sight of the sun glinting off the shiny new roofs will be a telltale symbol of progress’. Thankfully, the one thing that does not need rebuilding is community spirit. It is that spirit that stood resolute and undamaged in the face of the worst that nature could throw at us. I know that all of us in Far North Queensland--indeed, all Queenslanders--have the strength, the determination and the will to go forward following these disasters. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1087686"></A>
The events of this summer reminded us all that the force of nature does not discriminate between rich and poor. They reminded us that the things we have in common far outweigh any differences that we may have, and they reminded us that we are part of a community and that, even during times of great disaster, something magical can happen when people come together. I wish all of us well in the weeks, the months and the years ahead.<Hansard-Speech-End>

I think the words the Premier used are very accurate and certainly capture the thoughts that we in this chamber and in our respective communities throughout this great state of Queensland have at this very difficult time. On behalf of my wife and my constituents on the Sunshine Coast, I convey our heartfelt sorrow and condolences and put on the record my total support for the motion the Premier moved yesterday. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087705"></A>
We have seen extreme weather events around the world. As we heard the warnings from the Premier, little did we know what was about to be unleashed in Queensland, be it the cyclones in North Queensland or the floods in Ipswich and Brisbane. We on the Sunshine Coast have been spared. We certainly have not seen the devastation. But it was hard to believe as we looked at the news--we have 24-hour news today--that this was our state, our Australia, and not somewhere overseas.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087743"></A>
As I watched our Premier hour after hour give those many, many interviews, I felt very proud of the way the Premier and our ministers led our great state--our police minister, our Police Service, our volunteers. I think we can all be very proud of our government. I hope that Queensland is able to see this unity and this strength of leadership, because that is what we are certainly looking for at the moment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087744"></A>
When the floodwaters went down and the call for help went out, people from the Maroochy Surf Club were travelling to Brisbane and beyond. When the call went out I thought, ‘I’ve got nothing on. I will rock up.’ As I rocked up with my gumboots and my shovel and bits and pieces Fiona Simpson, my colleague from Maroochydore, was there. Quite frankly, you would not have believed that we were politicians; we were just ordinary Queenslanders lending a hand to help. We went down on the bus and we were originally requested to go to the Goodna Caravan Park. As we were going through to Brisbane and on to Goodna we saw the caravan park and we thought, ‘By crikey, we need heavy lifting equipment, not just people.’ Fortunately, we got the call, ‘Sorry, that’s a job for the Army and the cranes,’ and we were reassigned to a low-lying area in Goodna. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087747"></A>
While we were there a Bunnings team came from the Gold Coast. We left home with our lunch bags and we were thinking that we were going to look after ourselves, but lo and behold we had Bunnings from the Gold Coast helping in downtown Goodna. We were daunted by the task, but what was important was that, as those convoys of Army trucks rolled in, as soon as we could fill them they were off to the dump and they were back again. During that day we saw people of all ages, as other members have indicated, come together to help. One thing that really struck me was one house that was devastated. It was like a war zone, but here was the Australian flag. Quite frankly, all it had on it was ‘Thank you’. On our return that evening back to the surf club we were talking in the bus about how it struck us that there were so many Australian flags and that we felt so proud to be Queenslanders and Australians. I think one thing this disaster has certainly done is that it has brought us together as a state and as a nation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087748"></A>
We have all helped in many different ways. On another occasion I joined the staff from the Sunshine Coast Regional Council and we travelled to Brisbane. This time we were designated to go to Graceville. As we drove down to that area I reflected back on 1974 when I was a young police cadet in the Police Academy at Oxley. In looking at some of that country--the houses, the flooding--I could still recall Oxley, Chelmer and Graceville and here I was in 2011 going back to that very area. On this day in Graceville we were helping clean out a block of units--I think there were over 100 units--and there was no insurance. They were just pulling the gyprock out of the units--the ceiling was falling in--trying to wait for the buildings to dry out. On that day Councillor Vivien Griffin from the Sunshine Coast Regional Council had, like me, just joined the mud army. We all were very concerned about disease and infections. Unfortunately, she fell over and her whole mouth was split. She was rushed off to hospital. She, like all of us, was there just simply trying to play her part and help. I am very proud of the many groups on the Sunshine Coast who have helped and who are still helping--I will only reflect on my electorate because other members will reflect on theirs--be they service clubs, sporting groups, or simply individuals who tried to help in so many different ways. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087751"></A>
There is one group that I would like to mention specifically, though, and it is a group of young teenagers. Sometimes they are very prone to getting into strife. They are teenagers who visit our Shack, which is a drop-in centre in downtown Nambour just near the railway station. Believe it or not, we own it freehold. It used to be a squash court. The previous committee was not able to continue and they came to see me and asked, ‘Peter, what do we do?’ I said, ‘If you fold up it will be sold.’ We were able to restructure and reorganise and, to cut a long story short, that site is now owned by our community freehold and it is now where The Shack operates from as a drop-in centre for some of our young folk who seem to get themselves into lots of mischief.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087754"></A>
But what did we see from these young people who are often doing the wrong thing? These young people are aged from 10 to 17. They went to help with the clean-up in Brisbane. I would like to recognise those young people here on the official parliamentary record. I think they went over and above what was ever expected of them. We as a community feel so proud of these young people because they went out of their way to say, ‘What can we do to help?’ Those people included Imogene Dowler, 10 years of age; Ross McMaster, who is an adult and came along to help; Peter McMaster, 14 years of age; Sam Dudley, 14 years of age; Joel Dowler, 14 years of age; Tanya-Maria Evans, 15 years of age; Jeff Evans, who is an adult and came along as well; Ashleigh McLachlan, 11 years of age; Nigel McLachlan, who is an adult and came along to help supervise; Maryanne McLachlan, who is an adult and came along to help supervise; Dale Dowler, our manager, who is an adult and was there supervising; and Darcy Collier, who is 17 years of age. I just want to put that on the record so that these young people know that we appreciate their efforts. </Hansard-Body>

The member for Lockyer spoke about the devastation in his electorate. I simply say that various groups in my community are doing fundraising to help some of those very families that he mentioned. I will not mention their names during my contribution but simply say that we are all able to play a part, no matter what shape or form that might take. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087768"></A>
I am very pleased that after we finish debating this condolence motion we will then debate a very important bill that the Premier has introduced, the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill. The Queensland Reconstruction Authority will have the task for two years--I think as it is set out in the bill--to manage the reconstruction effort, to try to streamline bureaucracy and to get results. So often we hear complaints that we are bogged down in bureaucracy. I am certainly looking forward to the debate on that bill commencing at the appropriate time. We have also had the launch of the commission of inquiry, which will have the specific role of examining matters, including the preparation and the planning. I am certainly looking forward to the recommendations from that inquiry, which I understand will come back to this House later this year, perhaps around August. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087770"></A>
A number of members have spoken about their views on the insurance companies. When I was at Goodna, at the last house that we worked on before we hopped on the buses an elderly couple were there. They said, ‘We were told not to do anything until the insurance company assessors came round so that they could see that we did not damage it ourselves.’ So while other houses had been cleaned, they were told to leave it so that there could be no challenge. They stayed and they informed us that they were offered $15,000--‘Take it or leave it. That is all anyone in this area will be getting.’ I will not name the company. I believe that it will cost in excess of $50,000 to repair the damage. There is no way in the world they will be able to manage that without a fair and just insurance payment. They have paid their insurance premium every year--on time, the full amount. I certainly hope and I am looking forward to some strong recommendations about how we can improve the laws not just in Queensland but also throughout Australia to really make our insurance companies do the right thing and not hide behind strict legal interpretations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092499"></A>
Earlier I spoke about the extreme weather conditions we witnessed on the news last year and over recent years. I conclude my contribution by urging our government to seriously look at saying that in some areas we are full; there is no room for new communities on flood plain locations which developers want to see developed. Yes, we certainly will rebuild where our existing communities are, but I believe the government and we all as elected members of this parliament need to seriously look at where we are proposing new communities to be built, because often we see councils approving future communities and saying, ‘Yes, we will build on a flood plain.’ The water has to jolly well go somewhere. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092502"></A>
I am looking forward to the debate on the other bills I have touched on. I resume my seat and conclude by saying that it is great to be a member of this parliament and to see all members, be they government, opposition or members of the crossbenches, speaking as one, as all Queenslanders certainly want us to. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(4.30 pm): I rise to speak to this condolence motion to acknowledge the efforts of the Queensland people and others during the recent devastating floods and cyclones and to convey my deepest sympathy to those who lost loved ones, those who lost their home, property, pets, possessions and businesses.

I feel blessed that I have never experienced a serious flood or a cyclone. Despite watching hour upon hour of graphic television coverage, I doubt I can say that I truly understand the magnitude of this series of natural disasters. However, I have witnessed the grief and despair experienced by my colleagues on both sides of the chamber. I particularly want to mention the anguish and the heartache being felt by the honourable members for Lockyer and Hinchinbrook on behalf of their cherished communities. Mother Nature does not discriminate, but these two gentlemen must be questioning why their regions copped such merciless hard hits. Very few, if any, honourable members of this House have been left untouched by the devastating effects of Mother Nature as she wreaked havoc across our great state during what should have been a joyous celebration over the Christmas-New Year period. It tested the strength, bravery and spirit of countless Queenslanders who are first and foremost Australians. </Hansard-Body>

As this horror movie rolled into our living rooms around the clock, day after day and week after week, I was initially overwhelmed with a sense of helplessness which grew into a sense of guilt, a sense of guilt that the Gold Coast was spared while so many other areas suffered. The guilt thankfully gave way to a deep sense of pride in my fellow Queenslanders and fellow Australians. From those who gritted their teeth and soldiered on under immensely tragic circumstances to those who pitched in with hampers, money and physical help to clean up the awful mess. A veritable army of goodwill volunteers appeared from across the state. What struck me and many others was the genuine display of indomitable courage, attachment to local communities and determination displayed by people when faced with such adversity, some of them having lost everything. This, coupled with a community spirit that lifted the heaviest of hearts of people right across Queensland, showed the rest of the world what we are made of--pride and resilience. </Hansard-Body>

May I add my heartfelt praise and admiration to the appreciation expressed by other honourable members for the outstanding efforts of the SES workers, police, our defence force, local council mayors, volunteers, not-for-profit organisations and charities such as Red Cross and Lifeline and the hardworking meteorologists who tracked our weather patterns so concisely. I commend the Premier and the opposition leader John-Paul Langbroek for the leadership and empathy they both displayed. </Hansard-Body>

Currumbin is a close-knit community and, whilst I was moved by the flurry of fundraising activity and offers of help the people in my electorate undertook, like so many others in unaffected areas it did not surprise me greatly. I would like to place on record my sincere thanks to the people of the Currumbin electorate for the numerous acts of kindness and activities they organised and participated in. Many lined up to get a seat on buses that would take them to Ipswich to help clean up as part of the countless mud armies of volunteers. Others headed to Brisbane or regional areas to pitch in. I wish to make mention of a few of them and I apologise to those I have omitted. </Hansard-Body>

Bilinga woman Amy Tessmann started a collection drive out of her own home and has been inundated with goods that have since gone to good needy homes--and I use the word ‘homes’ very, very carefully. LNP women conducted a hamper drive of personal care products which were distributed to Central Queensland communities. On Sunday, 23 January the Tugun Community Flood Relief Fundraiser was held in the park adjacent to the Tugun Surf Club with bands, parades, silent auctions and raffles. Organised in less than a fortnight by Serene Beauty owner Megan Waters, this event raised almost $20,000 including $5,000 from our local Tugun Community Bank. The Heartwave Beach Walk was organised by young Heidi Bartholomew and took place at Elephant Rock, Currumbin last Saturday in support of the flood ravaged community of Grantham in the Lockyer Valley. Several hundred people attended the walk and afterwards they formed the shape of a heart on the sand to be captured from an aerial view and sent as a message of warmth and love to Queenslanders in the Lockyer Valley ravaged by cruel acts of nature. At last count over $5,500 was raised from that event. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092517"></A>
Both of those previously mentioned events were keenly supported by many of our local surfing and football icons. Cooly Rocks On, the newly branded Wintersun Festival, held a mini dance party and collected more than $5,000. The Elanora Uniting Church held a theatre night on Friday, 11 February organised by the church’s Adult Fellowship president, Mary Flynn, raising $2,000. And, of course, our Rotary and Lions clubs were as usual busy helping. Charities that have stretched themselves to the limit must not be forgotten. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092518"></A>
Small businesses are also deserving of assistance from the government. These devastating floods and cyclones across Queensland have belted thousands of small and medium businesses hard. For some it has been a double whammy: their homes and their businesses. For others their home-operated businesses were severely impacted. Sadly, some will not recover and will have to close, leaving sorrow, debt and loss of jobs. When watching endless television footage these past weeks it really hit home how many regional towns rely on small businesses for so many items and services--literally for their daily bread. Tourism and crop production provide lifelines to so many areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1092519"></A>
In the aftermath there is a chance for those wanting to restart to apply for loans, but still there are mountains of red tape to negotiate as they try to rebuild their ravaged businesses and uprooted lives. The struggle even to survive in business is more evident now in businesses that many townsfolk have run for decades. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland has worked intimately with the business sector throughout this devastating period, not only offering exceptional assistance and advice to businesses but also working tirelessly to provide valuable statistics that reveal the severe impact these floods have had on Queensland small- and medium-sized businesses. It found that one in five businesses in Queensland has had to close as a result of the floods due to full or partial water inundation, loss of power or being cut off from their businesses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1222173"></A>
The average number of days that businesses were forced to close was eight. The average number of days before their business returns to normal operation is 31. The loss to property, including plant and equipment, stock, buildings and motor vehicles to those businesses directly affected by the floods was, on average, $589,000. Businesses directly affected by the floods on average expect to lose in total $908,000 or approximately 11 per cent of their annual turnover. Unfortunately most businesses are currently unsure what their insurance covers them for. Many businesses have also been indirectly impacted by the floods through affected customers, affected suppliers, through employee inability to attend work or through the loss of appeal of Queensland as a tourism destination. It is clear that small business urgently needs help to restart and service local communities. </Hansard-Body>

The summer of 2010-11 will be etched in people’s minds for years to come. It will stand as a reminder to those of us who have been spared that we have a lot to be thankful for. The floods claimed 36 lives, with three more people missing, and destroyed not only personal property but also much loved pets, treasured mementos and livelihoods. May we also remember the incredible outpouring of kindness and mateship from not only Queenslanders but also strangers across Australia and tourists holidaying here, too. We must continue to support our fellow Queenslanders through these difficult phases as they embark on the path to recovery and, ultimately, healing. After all, it is the Queensland way, the Australian way. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Everton--ALP) (4.39 pm): At the outset, on behalf of the residents of the Everton electorate, I would like to join with every other speaker on this motion to express my sincere condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the recent floods and cyclones. I also offer my condolences to those who have experienced a very sorrowful loss of property and those who, although they may not have lost their lives or property, have still suffered from this and have lost the certainty and security of what they thought was normal life in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1097032"></A>
I will keep my remarks short in recognition that my electorate largely escaped the physical effects of this recent wild weather. However, I should say that a small number of houses in my electorate suffered from landslides and a number of people did experience some flash flooding. So I do not want to ignore the effects that did fall upon some residents of my electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097033"></A>
Like all Queenslanders, I think the residents of Everton have been touched by recent events. We have experienced the impact of wild weather before. The wild storms that hit parts of Brisbane in late 2008, widely remembered as ‘The Gap storms’, also impacted a number of suburbs in my electorate. So a number of people in my area have been talking about how they felt at that time and have expressed sympathy for the people facing this most recent situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097034"></A>
Of course many locals in my electorate either work or run businesses in areas that have been affected by the floods and there is now some risk to their employment or the future success of their business as a result. They are deeply hurting over that. If nothing else, everyone in my electorate--just like everyone in Queensland--has been deeply touched by the impact upon either friends or family members who do live in the areas that have been affected. Not a day goes by when I do not talk to someone in my area who knows someone who has suffered deeply. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097035"></A>
For someone like me who comes from an area that was not physically affected by the floods--and from here on I will confine my remarks to the floods given that they occurred nearer to home--it was a very surreal feeling. The day before the floods peaked in Brisbane I remember driving over the hill at Newmarket on my way to one of the SES depots to help fill sandbags. I was able to look down and see the CBD and I knew that the waters were rising and would reach a frightening level in only a few hours time. The roads, the parks and the streets that I was driving through were completely untouched and were basically not under threat. It was a very strange feeling to know that you were only a few kilometres from areas that were going to be transformed forever and yet there was going to be no impact on yourself or your own area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097037"></A>
Almost every member who has spoken here today has talked about the work that they did either in preparation for the floods or the cyclones or in the after-effects. I myself did get involved and did some sandbagging work with my friend the member for Stafford. I also got very involved in some of the clean-up, particularly in Fairfield, a suburb where I have previously lived and continue to have a number of friends who suffered serious flooding and major property damage. I also had the great privilege of spending a day in Goodna, one of the most badly affected areas from these floods, assisting a Vietnamese couple tear paint off their walls, which had been completely destroyed. That couple had lived in this particular house for about 14 years. A couple of years ago they moved in with the woman’s parents in order to save money so that they could have a baby. They were now facing the fact that all of the money that they had saved to have a baby was going to have to be spent on restoring their house. That is just one small example of the terrible effects that these floods have had on people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097040"></A>
A number of people here have spoken already about the great community spirit that has been on display throughout these events. If there is a silver lining to be seen it is the community spirit that we have witnessed come through. That has been displayed at a local level within the electorate of Everton. A number of community groups were very directly involved in the flood recovery work. I particularly want to single out the Apex Club of Albany Creek, which went out on a number of occasions to perform clean-up work. I know it has done some work at the Milpera school and in other areas as well. The Nexus Church in Everton Park went out on a number of occasions all around South-East Queensland and I know that it is intending to continue to do that as well. I want to pay tribute to those two particular community groups. There are no doubt a number of others which have really assisted with this work as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097044"></A>
The other thing that has happened locally following the floods is that a number of schools and businesses got behind the stationery appeal which was conducted to support children who had lost everything when it was time to go back to school. Albany Creek State School, Albany Hills State School, Eatons Hill State School and St Williams Catholic School at Grovely all collected stationery from their families. The Albany Creek Centro shopping centre and the Nextra newsagency within that shopping centre also went out of their way to put out buckets and they collected a very large amount of stationery. We were able to drop a very full car load of stationery--it was probably packed to a dangerous level--to OneSteel so they could distribute it amongst the kids who needed it. Again, I want to take the opportunity to thank those people in my area who have really come forward and helped out people whom they had never met and probably will never meet. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097052"></A>
In the long term it is going to be interesting to see the attitude of people in areas like mine who were not directly affected by these floods and the degree to which these people remain generous and are prepared to make sacrifices for the greater good and for those people who have lost everything. So far, as I have been talking to local residents and community groups, I have been incredibly pleased that people do understand that it is one of those times when people in our area have been very fortunate and we have to tighten our belts to assist people who have lost everything. I really plead with people in my area to maintain that attitude as we go forward and continue to contribute to the flood and cyclone recovery effort. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097053"></A>
The last thing I want to reflect on again is the incredible community sentiment which has been displayed. Previously I have said that one of the things that I have enjoyed most since I entered this House only a couple of years ago is seeing how alive community spirit is in Queensland. It has been very fashionable to talk about the loss of community and the fact that people do not know their neighbours anymore and that kind of thing. Ever since I was elected I have been really surprised by the number of people who have been prepared to reach out and get involved in their community. Again, these floods have really demonstrated that. I have talked about some of the local community groups and local residents who have been prepared to get up and put their community first. I think that is something that we really need to hang on to into the future. We need to take every chance to offer people opportunities to contribute to their community in the years ahead. With those few words, I commend the motion to the House and again express my deep condolences to all of those who have been affected by these terrible events. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Yeerongpilly--ALP) (4.47 pm): Today we pause and reflect on the tragedies of the past two months across our state. Three cyclones since December and extensive flooding throughout Queensland have left thousands of people without their homes and belongings but, most tragically, 36 people without their lives. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1097061"></A>
Today I join with my colleagues in feeling great sadness--a sadness arising from the horror of the stories of tragedy and a sadness felt as fellow Queenslanders. The loss of these lives brings with it hundreds of Queenslanders in pain. As we recover from disaster, the pain felt by those who have lost a family member, a friend, a workmate or a neighbour will remain long after the last creek is cleaned up, the last house is rebuilt and the last piece of damaged infrastructure is repaired. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1097062"></A>
As I speak in the House today I do so with the great honour of representing a community that is both resilient and lucky. The electorate of Yeerongpilly, with its riverside suburbs of Fairfield, Yeronga and Yeerongpilly along with the low-lying suburbs of Rocklea and Salisbury, was hit hard as the wall of water from Toowoomba and the massive rainfall in the Bremer and Wivenhoe catchments barrelled down the Brisbane River. More than 150 streets were flooded and some 1,600 houses were inundated, and yet we are lucky. Many of our houses went underwater, many of our belongings were lost and our parks, playgrounds, sporting facilities and clubhouses were devastated. We lost our cars, our TVs, our computers, our phones and our PlayStations. We suffered great anguish and our recovery will be long, yet we were lucky. We lost our livelihoods, but not our lives; our belongings, but not our breath. On behalf of the muddy and flooded homeless folk of Yeerongpilly, I express our sadness and wishes of peace to those communities that have suffered great loss and to those families who have lost loved ones. Our prayers and thoughts are with you. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101620"></A>
I was on holidays when the news of the flooding threat to houses in my community filtered through. I did not know the gravity of the event or what was coming, but making my way home required an early-morning flight, and I woke at 4 am on Wednesday to phone messages from Melinda, the P&amp;C manager at Yeronga State School, frantically seeking bedding for 20 people who were spending the night at the school hall.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101625"></A>
Arriving in Brisbane that morning was surreal. Driving home from the airport, I could see that the river was high but the streets were clear. It was a bit rainy but there was not a gale and the sun was breaking through. There was, however, an impending sense of fear and doom. Something was up. The shops were closed and there were not many people around. People who were moving around seemed to do so with a special purpose. When I reached Melinda at the Yeronga school, the disaster began to unfold. Fairfield Road was already underwater and the river peak was still many hours away. As the day wore on, the news reports came of people being rescued from their roofs in Rocklea. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101626"></A>
I spent that Wednesday in the school hall as people escaping the floods arrived in shock, carrying plastic bags with all the belongings they could save, often with a cat in a shoe box or a dog on a lead and wearing the muddy signs of wading through the floodwaters. There was shock at the speed and the reach of the rising water. The rest of the day has become a bit of a blur, really. The hall was rapidly filling up with donated bedding. People started turning up with food, including baking that they had been doing all day because they could not get to work, and the barbecue was firing up. People were sleeping on the hall floor, while others played chess or watched the unfolding drama on TV--but most were just sitting down, hoping to wait it out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101627"></A>
By afternoon, word had spread of this evacuation centre at Yeronga, and helpers arrived and donations came fast. A couple of fantastic workers from the Multicultural Development Association arrived and found safe and dry housing for some of the families sheltering in the hall. Non-flooded locals began turning up and taking people to their homes to provide them with showers and in several cases to stay with them. The school hall became a haven of safety for the rapidly rising water, as government efforts focused on rescue and evacuation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101630"></A>
Later that day the evacuation centre opened at QEII stadium. When we lost power at dusk, it was clear that we needed to get people to QEII, where they could be better looked after. I will never forget that experience of driving families, with all their worldly belongings in the back of a 24-year-old LandCruiser Troop Carrier, in the dark, with all of the traffic lights out, and using the backstreets, hoping I could get through, with the major roads of Fairfield, Beaudesert, Riawena and Ipswich roads all impassable. The next 48 hours saw the river level peak and the continued devastation of local homes and businesses before the water started to recede on Friday. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101635"></A>
The first indication I had of the extraordinary volunteer effort about to happen was in Rocklea on Friday morning. It was about 7 am and only a few homes were accessible and a few locals were around surveying the damage. A couple of men stopped in a truck to ask me who they could help. They had driven down from Maleny that morning, because they had lived in Rocklea in 1974 and they knew that people would need help. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101636"></A>
There have been many descriptive accounts of our suburbs looking like war zones. On the weekend of 15 and 16 January, the local area felt like another world. The Army controlled the major roads and limited access to local streets, which had become mud tracks. The streets were teeming with muddy strangers and four-wheel drives, and the piles of belongings and livelihoods were building up on nature strips. Early on the Saturday morning, Phil Reeves and I set up a gathering point and barbecue area on a street corner in Rocklea. Phil had gathered volunteers from his area, and his wife, Megan, had spent the night baking, and we set out to support people who were cleaning up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101638"></A>
We set up outside a house on Leeds Street, where there was no-one home when we arrived. But, shortly after, the owners Neil and Karen Smith arrived home. They immediately embraced us, opened up their house for people to use their bathroom, and thus began a two-week occupation of Neil and Karen’s driveway, garage, nature strip and front yard. The Moorooka Lions came along to run the barbecue, and the house on the corner became a place of replenishment and refreshment and a place of solace from the awful task of dragging your belongings onto the nature strip and tearing the walls and ceilings out of your house. Neil and Karen are true local heroes who supported their community at their time of greatest need, and I thank them sincerely. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101641"></A>
Over in Fairfield, Nicki and Anthony Cassimatis set up a similar barbecue and refreshment centre on their footpath to feed the volunteers and provide support to Fairfield residents. There was always a crowd there, and Nicki and Anthony kept it going for two weeks as the clean-up continued. This was incredibly valuable as it provided a great location for information dissemination, and the Queensland Health vaccination van could provide service where people were gathering. Nicki and Anthony and the volunteers who supported them are similarly true local heroes, and I thank them sincerely, too. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101643"></A>
I am fortunate to live in Moorooka, in a house that was not flood affected. I cannot imagine the feeling of the loss of all my belongings in a flood or a cyclone. What I did experience, however, was being the first person to see inside a number of houses after the floodwaters receded. It is an eerie sensation to look at a house untouched and unopened while those around them are in the midst of clean-up. The only thought you can have is, ‘I hope those people are okay,’ and the normal reaction is to knock on the door, to walk around the back and to call out. In a few cases the floodwater left doors open or windows broken out, and peering inside was frightening. No sense can be made of the shambles the water left behind. Nothing can prepare you for the mud, the smell, the chaos and the devastation. In each of the cases of houses eerily untouched, the residents were able to be found and the clean-up was able to begin. I thank the police for their attention to my request for welfare checks and their prompt reporting back to me. It was always a relief to learn that people had been found safe and well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101644"></A>
In Rocklea, the state school is yet to open for 2011, with the school buildings inundated and very little of the teaching resources salvageable. It is a small but proud school community at Rocklea, and I am pleased that we have kept the school community together on the site of Moorooka State School. I hope that the time at Moorooka is more of an adventure than an inconvenience for the children of Rocklea. The suburb of Rocklea was one of the hardest hit in Brisbane, with the low-lying houses surrounded by industrial zones and waterways that flood often. They are a tough lot in Rocklea, though, and the stoicism and determination of the local community is shining through as people rebuild their lives and their homes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101646"></A>
In Yeronga, the state school hall was established as a Department of Communities recovery centre, and the school P&amp;C established a drop-in service to collect donations and provide meals and drinks for people, many of whom are still without power as they gather the resources they need to rebuild. Like the homes of Neil and Karen and Nicki and Anthony, the drop-in service at the Yeronga recovery centre became a place of solace and protection and the heart and soul of our community in recovery. The drop-in centre continues today, with services provided at the school’s preschool building, and I thank the Yeronga State School community for managing with the disruption to the start of the school year and for ensuring the service can continue as school returns to normal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101648"></A>
The team of volunteers at the Yeronga school has been directly responsible for many flooded families being able to cope with their losses and the rebuilding task in front of them. Led by Melinda McInturff--an indefatigable and resilient, never-give-up community champion--the team of Jan Potts, Fiona McLeod, Yvonne Ward, Meg Clarke, Sue Baker, Sue Sinnamon, Catherine Goth, Kath Farley, Midge Dowd, Michelle Henkell, Marion Emery, along with Jill and a host of others, including their children and partners, contributed a tower of work to support our community and people in most need, and they continue to do so.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101660"></A>
There are so many people to thank and so many businesses and organisations to acknowledge for their support. The Electrical Trades Union provided fantastic assistance and worked directly with me to identify people most in need of help to have their power restored. This work supported many people with little capacity to undertake the work themselves and helped provide their first steps in recovery. To the team of teachers from the Gregory Terrace school and the gang from the Australian Services Union: I say a special thankyou. These people assisted me by doorknocking every affected house in 150 streets in two days following the big clean-up weekend. They gathered direct information on continuing needs, enabling my volunteer efforts to be targeted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101664"></A>
I thank the team from the Yeronga Neighbourhood Watch--Laurie Jensen, Carolyn Ross, Catherine Goth, Pauline Rose, Jaqueline Steffan, Paul Ivory and Andrew and Yvonne Ward--along with local ALP branch members, who repeated this doorknocking effort last weekend to gather details of ongoing needs. I thank Jason from the Chalk Hotel who donated refreshments for Australia Day events, and I also thank Michelle Francis for organising a great Australia Day street party in Yeronga. I also acknowledge Farmcraft at Acacia Ridge who helped with my call for donations for the RSPCA. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101672"></A>
There were countless local businesses that supported the Yeronga recovery centre’s needs for meals and sustenance. These include Woolworths Moorooka, Coles at Greenslopes, Liz’s Deli, JJ’s Fruit Market, the Red Lion Hotel, Dollar Dazzlers at Moorooka, the Oriental Taste, Mu’ooz and Ho Choi restaurants, Made in Africa Cafe, Brumby’s Moorooka, Mallan Bulk Meats and Pauls Parmalat in South Brisbane. Yeronga State High School, Wellers Hill State School, Mansfield State High School and Whites Hill State College also provided recovery support. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101723"></A>
Along with the mud army volunteers, all of this support has been part of the biggest community action any of us have experienced in Brisbane’s history. This is a story of mateship, of compassion, of mucking in and helping out. It is a story we can all be proud of. It gives us a remarkable base on which to rebuild not only our houses but also the ongoing bonds central to our neighbourhoods, society and culture. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101724"></A>
I also received great support from my parliamentary colleagues with the members for Mansfield, Albert, Chatsworth, Lytton, Stretton, Waterford, Stafford, Woodridge, Everton and Greenslopes providing support to the local clean-up efforts. The Premier, the Deputy Premier and Ministers Wilson, Reeves and Struthers all visited the local area to provide support and determine government assistance relevant to their portfolios. Councillors Steve Griffiths and Nicole Johnston worked tirelessly to help people in need and to organise the local flood response and ongoing recovery. Federal member for Moreton, Graham Perrett, also worked across the local area with passion and commitment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101728"></A>
The sports minister made an early visit to my sporting clubs and assessed firsthand the damage at St Brendans Rugby League Club, Yeronga AFL, Souths Cricket Club and Olympic Soccer Club fields and facilities. Already equipment assistance grants have been approved for some of these clubs and local sport will be up and running rapidly. Thanks to some great assistance from the AFL, the junior teams at Brothers St Brendans are back training on their fields and the season will start as normal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101731"></A>
Last weekend I assessed the damage at the Croatian Community Centre which is located very close to the Oxley Queensland Urban Utilities water repatriation plant that contaminated Oxley Creek and surrounding areas. A massive effort is needed to return the club’s soccer fields back to a playable state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101732"></A>
There is significant concern in my local community about the practices of insurance companies. Tricky definitions of flood, storm and water inundation, the lack of transparency in decisions to reject claims, secrecy about who they engage to prepare hydrology reports, discouragement of policy holders to submit claims by a simple dismissal, delays in arranging assessors, not meeting their committed time frames to get back to people and not being able to estimate when rebuilding work may commence are all hindering recovery in my community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101733"></A>
Insurance companies must work out new ways to cover people for tragic events or they must face a new regulatory regime. There has been 37 years between flood events for many of the houses in Yeerongpilly and many people have paid 37 years of premiums. It is time for insurance companies to reassess their risk profiles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101734"></A>
I recognise the commitments of Suncorp, RACQ and the Commonwealth Bank to provide some support to people without cover. I call on them to ensure their subsidiary companies do likewise. I was particularly concerned with media reports last Friday of the experience of a Fig Tree Pocket resident with CGU and the many anecdotal reports I am receiving about companies summarily dismissing enquiries, discouraging claims and rejecting claims without detailed reasoning.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101735"></A>
On the whole, insurance companies, despite the way they advertise, do not trade in compassion or trust. You pay them in good faith, rely on their advice and expect them to be there for you in times of tragedy. Instead, their first response is to question how they can avoid paying out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101736"></A>
Tonight I will be launching a local campaign calling on non-affected people to pressure their insurance companies by considering the compassionate response of their insurers when renewing their own policies and requesting a written outline of the company’s actions. This campaign will also include development of a local photo bank to assist policyholders to question decisions to reject their claims. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101737"></A>
The road to full recovery will be a long one for the flooded people and families in my local area. We know that the post-traumatic profile of disaster affected areas means tough times ahead. The volunteering efforts in Fairfield, Yeronga, Yeerongpilly, Salisbury and Rocklea are now focusing on the events, activities and social opportunities we can organise to keep our community together.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101738"></A>
We are dislocated right now with people living with friends and families in other suburbs. We need to keep bringing people back to their neighbourhoods to share their experiences and to support each other. Our current ghost town like streets need to become vibrant, friendly neighbourhoods again and we need to harness our collective strength to reacquaint, rebuild and recover. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101739"></A>
We are a resilient, stoic and lucky community in the Yeerongpilly electorate. We have strong local support networks and a great capacity to help each other. We will rebuild and recover and we will do it together. In true Queensland spirt, we have been knocked down but we are straight back up again. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The Chatsworth electorate was thankfully not directly impacted by the floodwaters. However, many people have friends and families who have been directly impacted by the floods or more recently by the ferocious assault delivered by Cyclone Yasi on the people in Mission Beach, Tully and the surrounding areas in North Queensland. I have family members living in Cairns, Mission Beach and Feluga. My wife and I had a restless night, as did many Queenslanders, waiting to see the fate of our families the night Cyclone Yasi bore down. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101748"></A>
Many Chatsworth residents own or work in businesses that have been impacted by the floods. I know that many people have suffered significant loss, personally and financially. However, Chatsworth residents, like those from all other areas across the state, rose to the challenge and got involved in assisting their fellow Queenslanders by joining in the relief effort. They volunteered as members of the mud army, donated money, organised fundraisers and generally did whatever they could to ease the pain of their neighbours. I know this because I met them. I met them at Norman Park when I was working with the member for Bulimba. I met them in the streets of Milton as they were helping to clean up the mud stained houses in and around that area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101750"></A>
One story I would like to mention is that of Michael James, the butcher at Carina North Meats. He allowed his shop to be used during the night by a flood affected butcher from the Sherwood area. Michael would do his day’s work, clean up his shop, clean his utensils and the other butcher would come in and do the night shift. He would use Michael’s equipment so that he could keep filling his orders and paying his workers. This type of selflessness was on display throughout Queensland. I commend all of the residents of Queensland and, in particular, the Chatsworth residents for their contribution to the relief effort. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101751"></A>
I know there were a number of people who wanted to volunteer but who felt that they could not get access. I turned up at one of the council volunteer centres to be told that they were fully booked in the morning. Some 25,000 people had already enrolled. I think it is a good time to suggest to people that if they want to be sure that they can help next time there is an event--and there will be a next time--that they have some training. When a cyclone is approaching the coast or when the waters are rising is not necessarily the best time to volunteer. The best time is now. They should go down to their local SES and join the local SES or the local volunteer rural fire brigade and get the training they need so that when something like this happens they have the skills and knowledge needed to be an effective volunteer and to help out a bit more professionally. I am not taking away from the mud army and those who turned up on the day. The SES and the rural fire brigades can always do with more people. An event like this might be a good time for people to take that opportunity to go down and get their orange uniform, get some training and get involved in volunteering across Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101752"></A>
I would also like to pass on my thanks to the emergency services workers, the police and the volunteers who performed so magnificently during the floods and the cyclone. However, I would specifically like to acknowledge the great work done by firefighters across this state and, in particular, the professionalism and bravery of the firefighters involved in the Toowoomba flash flood rescues on 10 January. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1101753"></A>
The bravery of these firefighters can only be fully understood by people who have the knowledge and experience of the dangers of fast-moving water. It is an incredibly dangerous environment to work in. I watched on TV, as we all did, my ex-colleagues standing up to their chests in that flowing water. I know the stress that they must have been under. I know that on that day they saved lives. There is no doubt about it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106632"></A>
The events that we have suffered over the last month could shake our confidence and make us feel a little less safe in our day-to-day lives. But I think we can all be reassured by the magnificent work done by our police, firefighters, ambulance workers, SES personnel, EMQ staff and everyone else who has moved in and taken on the task of keeping the people of Queensland safe and rebuilding it after the events we have had. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106635"></A>
Natural disasters tend to bring out the best and the worst in people. It makes some people stronger and it can cause others to falter. It is incumbent upon all of us here to make sure we assist those who falter and keep a close eye on our fellow Queenslanders as the days and weeks pass because sometimes they need assistance weeks later. I know from my experience living in Mission Beach during Cyclone Larry that you can hear the tiredness in people’s voices sometimes two or three weeks later. We need to make sure that we maintain vigilance and look after the people in those areas. </Hansard-Body>

I am very privileged to represent the people of the Chatsworth electorate. However, events such as those we have experienced over the past couple of months remind us that we have an obligation to work together in the best interests of this entire state. To that end, it is important that all members of this House--privileged as we are to represent the people of Queensland--ensure for those people who have lost their lives, homes and livelihoods, for those who have contributed so much and for those who are still to make their contribution that we continue to work together to ensure that Queensland emerges from this stronger, better prepared and more resilient. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Glass House--LNP) (5.10 pm): I too begin by publicly extending my condolences and those of my constituents to my colleagues and their communities. In particular, I extend my heartfelt sympathies to the members for Lockyer, Toowoomba South and Hinchinbrook. Please know that you are in my prayers and those of many from Glass House. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1106646"></A>
The events of December and January and subsequently February of this year have left us all speechless and dismayed but ultimately inspired. The electorate of Glass House was left relatively unscathed from these events. I say ‘relatively’ because, whilst we have been left damaged and scarred, we did not suffer loss of life and we did not witness the extraordinary inundation of property and businesses that places like Condamine, Theodore, Rockhampton, Bundaberg, Gympie, Toowoomba, the Lockyer Valley, Ipswich, Brisbane and now the area around Hinchinbrook experienced. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106649"></A>
It is with a heavy heart that I realise the topography of my electorate has indeed contributed to this loss in many other communities. Not for many, many years have Glass House locals witnessed the deluges of December and January. Maleny, in the Sunshine Coast hinterland, the home of my electorate office, has an average monthly rainfall of 190 millimetres in December and 270 millimetres in January. In the months just past, Maleny received 685 millimetres in December and an extraordinary 890 millimetres in January, including an astonishing 700 millimetres from 9 to 12 January. Down the hill in Peachester, with average monthly falls of 175 and 300 millimetres respectively, we had 530 millimetres and 930 millimetres in December and January--with, again, a shocking 740 millimetres over those disastrous four days in January. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106657"></A>
Even as waterlogged as the Glass House electorate has become, the water runs off very quickly, such is the nature of the topography in the area. But it is where it ran off to that is hardest to accept. Half of that rainfall pounded down the Mary River, swamping Gympie and Maryborough and isolating many communities in its path. The other half stormed down the Stanley River and the Mary Smokes Creek, backed up behind the already swollen Somerset Dam, resulting in excess water being held in the Wivenhoe system and leading to the releases that inundated Ipswich and Brisbane. Whilst we can do a lot as MPs, we have no control over geography or the weather but that does not lessen my frustration that the rain that fell in Glass House contributed to the misery of so many individuals. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106663"></A>
Whilst the water passed quickly through the electorate, it did leave destruction in its path. That same topography that I just spoke of means that in Glass House we have a propensity to landslides, and we do them well. Not a single one of my main roads that includes the name ‘Maleny’ in it has not got at least one if not two or three major landslides shutting at least one lane. The Maleny-Kenilworth, the Maleny-Stanley River, the Maleny-Montville and the Landsborough-Maleny have all been affected in some way. Many properties also have been affected by landslides, like some in the neighbouring electorate of Buderim. In fact, one house in Stony Creek has had to be evacuated as a landslide moves progressively closer and closer to that property. There is concern in places such as Buderim that, again, insurance will not cover these instances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106668"></A>
There was other devastation in Glass House as well. I visited the owner of the Sweethearts Cafe in the sleepy little railway community Eudlo on Wednesday, 12 January. She and her husband and neighbours were mucking out the business for the second time in three days. It went under on the Sunday, they cleaned it out on the Monday, only to see it go under again on the Tuesday. She was heartbroken and discouraged, but she is open for business again and serving her wonderful community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106671"></A>
I spent a lot of time in the Mary River community of Conondale. Locals relate stories of debris backing up on the already damaged Grigor Bridge, causing a bow wave of some five to eight metres to spurt up and over the swamped Maleny-Kenilworth Road. That kind of pressure again damaged the bridge closing it for more than a week, splitting Conondale in two and isolating communities further downstream such as Kenilworth. That same water cut off families and the community of Crystal Waters upstream as well, and it took out vital services such as electricity and telephones, some of which still have not been restored. We are talking about a community, despite being only some 20 kilometres from the coast, that does not have mobile phone coverage. Yet these people too battled on. The operator of the Conondale General Store, Ash, despite watching his business suffer because of no through traffic, ferried people and supplies down to the bridge so they could walk across, collecting vehicles on the other side. The Grigor Bridge needs to be replaced, not repaired. It has served the community of Conondale well but it is time to install a new non-timber, flood-proof structure so this vital route to the communities of the Upper Mary Valley can remain open in all weather events.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106678"></A>
Turning to the community of Woodford on the Stanley River, it is not widely known but it too housed an evacuation centre for the days after 10 January. Several houses were damaged in Woodford and Delaneys Creek, but the majority of those seeking refuge at the Woodford community centre were travellers from communities further west, from Kilcoy, Stony Creek, Villeneuve and further afield who were trapped because of the rising floodwater. My thanks go to Michael Wallis and Michelle Knight for their caring stewardship of the centre and its occupants. Thanks also go to the community recovery teams that were on hand to lend support, to the countless volunteers and to the many who contributed supplies of food and clothing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106685"></A>
At this point, I would also like to acknowledge the work of Sergeant Jason Renwick of the Woodford police. I do not know whether the Minister for Main Roads is aware, but Jason played a pivotal role in ensuring that the D’Aguilar Highway over Mary Smokes Creek could reopen when it did and that it was not further damaged by truckies who were exuberant in their desire to get their rigs on the move sooner than the highway realistically could handle. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106687"></A>
It was while in Woodford that I got to spend some time with the Woodford auxiliary fire service. The crew were ferrying supplies down Neurum Road to the ‘temporary sea’ that was the backed-up Somerset Dam. Where the road slipped below this inland sea, they were loading up a flotilla of volunteer boats to restock the isolated communities of Villeneuve and Glenfern. So to Laura, Tony and the rest of the team--thank you, job well done. I must also highlight the efforts of the federal member for Longman, Wyatt Roy, and division 12 councillor, Adrian Raedel, from the Moreton Bay Regional Council. Both of these guys stepped up to the mark and delivered for their communities. It is a real pleasure to work alongside them both. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1106693"></A>
Then there is Bellthorpe--the small, meandering community nestled on top of the Bellthorpe Range west of Maleny and north of Woodford. There are only three ways into Bellthorpe--up the notorious Bellthorpe Range Road, via Gap Road from Maleny and, when desperate, the four-wheel drive forestry track up from Stony Creek. After the rain in January, two of these routes were destroyed. The council is only now getting in to start the clean-up on Bellthorpe Range Road. Repairs will happen but not for some time. Gap Road is also still closed, but Councillor Raedel and his team are moving mountains, quite literately, to open a side track. So, for now, residents must resort to the dangerous and circuitous four-wheel drive forestry track. In essence, the community of Bellthorpe remains isolated some five weeks after the events of January. So while the recovery and rebuilding commences, I ask members to spare a thought for the people of Bellthorpe. I know they are not alone, but they are frustrated, angry and desperate.</Hansard-Body>

I, too, would like to place on the record my sincerest gratitude for the leadership and the valued contribution of our police and emergency services crews. To do that I must relate a personal story from that fateful Tuesday in January. As 355 millimetres fell in the catchment, my home town of Palmwoods also became cut off, albeit for less than 24 hours. The only way in and out was for our vehicles to be escorted onto a footpath and guided through the floodwaters by the local Palmwoods rural fire brigade. Guys like Malcolm Brown and ‘Digger’ Diggines and the rest of the team stood in torrential rain for the whole day and into the evening directing traffic through the water and into the town. </Hansard-Body>

In one of those quirky and Australian--no, Queensland--traits, the boys received their thanks and reward from the local business community. The manager of the local Eagle Boys dropped down a tonne of pizzas and the newsagent gave them a carton of beer--to be consumed when off duty of course! The selflessness of the rural fire brigade team and the gratefulness of the local business owners epitomise for me the events of January, and all I can do is say thankyou to them all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111572"></A>
Thanks also go to the many groups, individuals and communities as a whole that have banded together to raise funds for the flood and cyclone affected communities. I am very pleased to report to the member for Lockyer that last Saturday the Maleny community, led by Sharon from Easton Lawyers, raised $5,500 through a cent auction, with all proceeds going directly to Grantham Flood Support. That is just one example of fundraising by the communities in Glass House.</Hansard-Body>

This is my first opportunity to speak since my appointment as shadow parliamentary secretary for mental health, drug strategy and health personnel, and it is rather apt. Increasingly we are aware, through research and experience, that the effects of natural disasters of this magnitude remain with individuals--adults and children alike--for not only the couple of weeks that the member for Chatsworth referred to but for many years to come. I refer to an article in <Hansard-Italic>
Family Matters</Hansard-Italic>
 by Catherine Caruana titled ‘Picking up the pieces: family functioning in the aftermath of natural disaster’ which states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1111580"></A>
Loss is central to the experience of disaster--loss of home, loved ones, independence, identity and a sense of the world as a safe place--and it is the way in which this loss is accommodated that will determine how individuals, families and communities rebound. While a certain percentage emerge from adversity with greater personal resources, most will suffer a degree of distress in the short term, and a minority will suffer chronic, enduring psychological impairment. Adolescents and children in the middle primary grades are particularly vulnerable to the effects of trauma and social upheaval, especially if parents or caregivers are similarly affected.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111582"></A>
We can look to our southern cousins for direction when it comes to addressing this matter. The Victorian Department of Human Services has prepared a comprehensive document, the Victorian psychosocial recovery framework, to map out the key steps involved in helping individuals and communities recover mentally. It outlines the actions taken in the immediate aftermath of the bushfires as well as the support planned in the medium and longer term. The same department has recently released an update in which it has identified that successful service responses to date and into the future need to have four factors. First, they need to be outreach oriented. Many people are reluctant to use formal services. They are more likely to talk to people whom they have met and grown to trust or who have an established profile in the community. Second, services need to be informal and flexible. Models of service work best if they can be adapted to the situation and people whose lives and communities are often still in a state of disruption and overload. People with mild to moderate psychosocial problems are often able to benefit from shorter, less frequent and more immediate consultations with professionals, especially if they are local or in the form of visits. Third, services need to be integrated with local community activities. Many people will use professional advice during a conversation after a meeting, over a coffee or at a community gathering. Fourth, they need to include social and group opportunities. Sometimes problems arise from a lack of understanding of what are normal responses. There is a need to talk and share information and problem solving among the affected community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111586"></A>
In conclusion, I encourage the Reconstruction Authority to consider these learnings as it continues to rebuild communities physically and individuals and families mentally. If it does not and if we as leaders do not address the psychosocial after-effects of these natural disasters, then we are leaving the rebuilding job only half done and are potentially condemning many Queenslanders to a life of trauma and illness. <Hansard-Speech-End>

I start by passing on my sincere condolences and those of all residents of Caloundra to all those who lost loved ones in the flood and other disasters. The will and resolve of a people is truly tested when forces that cannot be controlled are hurled against them and they not only withstand the onslaught but, by their will and resolve, show that they will not be beaten. In such a battle, however, some will endure events and witness sights that will be forever close to the surface of their minds. Yesterday and today we have heard many members speak passionately about the violence of the floods and the cyclone in their electorates and in this state--violence that took lives and destroyed property, businesses, crops, roads and many other things.</A></Hansard-Body>

I want to briefly mention another form of violence: violence to the mind--to the minds of the children, adolescents and adults who lived through the terror and the minds of the men and women who have been involved and will be involved in the recovery. We know that natural disasters have a psychological impact on people, but what that impact will be will vary considerably depending upon the nature of the event, the communities themselves and the individual characteristics of the people involved. A psychological impact can include depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, complicated grief and nightmares. Children can suffer depression, separation anxiety--they can re-experience the event in nightmares and re-enact in play--as well as guilt, avoidance behaviour, fear of recurrence and worry for the safety of others.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111596"></A>
There have been a number of disasters looked at in this context. During the floods of 1974 people suffered health issues including headaches, irritability, nervous tension, depression, worrying, fatigue and sleeplessness. These people were dealing with financial difficulties, emotional strain and family problems. My friend the member for Glass House quoted from an article by Catherine Caruana. I also quote from that article as follows--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1111598"></A>
The more a victim’s family can turn to its own members or to extended kin for comfort, a sense of safety and material aid, the more likely it will be that they will rebound from disaster psychologically.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111599"></A>
Queensland has suffered two natural disasters. Both were devastating events. Both have left a trail of destruction--firstly and overtly physical and secondly and perhaps covertly mental stress. The reconstruction of Queensland is underway. Importantly, the mental wellbeing of the victims must be part of this process. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Like many people, I watched the daily news reports as the days of rain and storms delivered to many communities in our state such unprecedented damage, devastation, fear and terror. Images flashed upon the television--raging waters swamping houses, sheds, businesses and covering our vast land for miles and miles. It was not long before the waters, moving with such speed and volume, could be considered to be a living, breathing thing--a monstrous being that had a mind of its own that no-one could stop or tame.

As flooding hit the communities of Queensland, inundating an area greater than that of France and Germany combined, stories of how people had lost their homes, businesses and livestock began to emerge. Watching the footage of raging waters in James Street, Toowoomba left me and my family breathless. I could not believe my eyes nor fathom how this could happen in a city located on a mountain range, nor could we comprehend the news that we all woke up to once the waters had invaded the Lockyer Valley. People going about their daily business suddenly were in the firing line of this monster torrent. The news of the floods’ greatest cost, that being the lives of people in these communities, saddened all Queenslanders. I will never forget watching breaking news reports as the Premier gave two-hourly press conferences informing the public of the rising number of people missing in the aftermath. </Hansard-Body>

Yesterday, this House was united in acknowledging that this heartache is being felt by many of the communities represented by members on both sides of this House. I acknowledge the efforts of my parliamentary colleagues who have worked so hard in their communities facilitating efforts to help people find accommodation, to help people clean out their homes and to help people deal with the tragedy and the devastation. My thoughts are with the member for Lockyer, whose electorate includes the townships of Grantham, Laidley, Murphys Creek and Helidon, and the member for Bundamba, whose electorate includes Riverview, Redbank and Goodna and the great many areas along the river.</Hansard-Body>

Following one of the worst floods in Queensland’s history, our state prepared for Cyclone Yasi to hit North Queensland. The member for Hinchinbrook stood to pay tribute to the people of his electorate who endured a night of terror as Cyclone Yasi hurtled through the towns of Tully and Cardwell. The member for Hinchinbrook spoke so passionately about the towns he represents. I have seen his pride glow when I visited Tully last year to open a new ambulance station and I remember the member telling me about how tight knit the community was and how he had grown up in this area. I say to him that I look forward to returning to Tully and seeing all of those wonderful people again. I am sure they will rebuild and develop that great community spirit again. For many of us, we have been to these towns and it is hard to believe that such pretty, quaint towns with buildings and memorials that tourists and visitors love to see have been torn and ripped apart by Cyclone Yasi or the floods. </Hansard-Body>

I was born in Mount Isa and I am a true Queenslander. I have lived in only one other place in my life and that was overseas. Queensland is my home and I have always been proud. However, after watching the efforts of ordinary Queenslanders helping each other to safety, helping each other to prepare for what the night was going to bring, helping each other with the clean-up after the flood and Cyclone Yasi, I remain in awe of the Queensland spirit, the strength and the generosity of fellow Queenslanders and the bravery of so many people.</Hansard-Body>

 On behalf of my constituency, I would like to pay tribute to those volunteers--the mud army volunteers who came to support and help in whatever way they could, from sweeping out mud to cleaning out their local cafe or small business, people offering practical assistance to get people back on their feet. I know that many people felt disappointed that for whatever reason they could not contribute to the recovery efforts of this nature and they sought to make appropriate donations of clothing, food and toiletries and they even baked for the workers and put on sausage sizzles. All over Queensland community groups and Queenslanders did their bit and continue to do so. The Premier’s disaster appeal currently totals $215 million and many of my local community groups have raised money in some way to contribute to this fund. Last week I was at a handover of an $8,000 cheque from the Paradise Point Bowls Club and attended the closing workshop of the Internet Secrets conference, where I acknowledged the $52,000 contribution from its members. There are many stories like this and many people and many businesses have contributed, and I say simply thankyou. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1111651"></A>
The flooding occurred right before schoolchildren were due to return to their school for the school year and my thoughts are of those communities where children had lost all their back-to-school supplies and gear. Together with the members for Albert and Burleigh, our offices were collection points for people wanting to donate new stationery items to support the kids of the Lockyer Valley and to help them return to school. People on the Gold Coast were extremely generous and many commented that by buying the water bottles or the backpacks or the pens and exercise books for this reason had helped them cope with the frustration of not being able to contribute in any other physical way. It also helped them find strength after seeing such devastating images on the television. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111652"></A>
I acknowledge the great team of SES volunteers from the Gold Coast who volunteered for deployment to the Lockyer Valley, many of whom I know left behind their own young families to help out for not just days but in some cases weeks. The two catastrophic events of this past summer have etched in our memories images that we will never forget. These events have also been experiences from which community spirit, bravery and kindness have been witnessed by all, but in particular by younger generations and people who have never heard of these towns. </Hansard-Body>

I would like to commend Assistant Commissioner Ian Stewart for his outstanding efforts in his role as the State Disaster Coordinator and Bruce Grady and all of his team at the State Disaster Coordination Centre. I acknowledge the bravery, the unbelievable heroism and the efforts of extraordinary strength and skill by the EMQ helicopter pilots and crewmen. I would also like to acknowledge the many fire officers who were involved in some 43 swift-water rescues that were undertaken in the Toowoomba area alone. In very dangerous conditions, these people worked to save so many others from raging floodwaters and I know the experience of this summer will affect them in many ways. I would like to acknowledge the many public servants from all departments for their work, their dedication and in many cases their expertise in helping the affected communities prepare and recover. Many of these people have, through their actions and commitment, inspired a nation and can I simply say thankyou. </Hansard-Body>

So what does one say on behalf of those who did not suffer to those who did? My constituents would not want me to hold the floor for very long. They would want the available time to go to the representatives of those who suffered the most. But they would like me to express their support for their fellow citizens. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111666"></A>
This perhaps is what my constituents would want me to say to the constituents of other honourable members in this chamber. We did not experience your agony, but we share your grief. We were not beside you when you faced the elements, but we have been and will be with you in the aftermath. We will support the measures necessary to help you overcome adversity--knowing, of course, that it will cost us, because we are not strangers. We are the people who rang members of our extended family who happened to live in your suburb to wish them well before the storms. We are the people who filled sandbags and sent them to you. We are the people who drove across town or across country to anonymously clean up your houses. We are the people who supported events such as the fundraising function organised by the Deception Bay Bowls Club, who donated to disaster relief funds and whose taxes will be applied to the reconstruction. </Hansard-Body>

Some people have lost everything. Some people have lost loved ones. Some people feel as though they have even lost hope. Everyone joins those people in saying we are here to help you through these troubling times. We are here to say we will not forget you. As we have heard from other honourable members, the recent rain, flood and cyclone events are the worst natural disasters in a generation and they have affected a lot of people in a lot of communities. Like all Queenslanders, I have been overwhelmed by the enormity of these events. I find it hard to understand how they happened and how people were affected by them. Watching the events unfold around me on the television earlier this year I felt a sense of helplessness, I felt a sense of powerlessness. My heart goes out to all honourable members and the people they represent who have been affected by these disaster events. </Hansard-Body>

Sadly the people of the Morayfield electorate were not spared from the recent rain and flooding events. Local people will forever remember 11 January 2011 as the day that heartbreak struck our community. I understand that hydrologists monitoring the Caboolture River, Burpengary Creek and Sheep Station Creek catchments were concerned that water levels in these watercourses were rising too quickly and posed a threat to people in low-lying areas. Evacuations and some water rescues were required. Emergency Service workers showed great innovation and courage as they went about their work of saving lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111714"></A>
A lot of people do not realise how serious the situation could have been in the Morayfield state electorate. At Narangba in the neighbourhood that I live in and just around the corner from my house we had torrents of water flowing down suburban streets. We had rapids. We had water currents so strong that people would have been swept away if they were not careful. We had Emergency Service workers using boats on suburban streets to rescue people from their homes. We had police in canoes. We had cars stranded on the Bruce Highway as a result of the rising floodwaters. We had many people dealing with the horror of having dirty, muddy and putrid floodwaters through their homes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111715"></A>
This horror was also experienced by people in the Burpengary, Morayfield, Caboolture, Moorina and Rocksberg areas. People in every part of the Morayfield state electorate were affected in some way by this natural disaster. But through this tragedy one of humanity’s most inspiring qualities shone through: courage. I admire courage. It inspires, it motivates, it reassures; yet it is also so human. It is so human in how it can touch individuals, how it allows individuals to reach out to others. There was much courage on display on 11 January 2011 in the Morayfield electorate. I saw it; I felt it. The strength of the human spirit, the strength of the Queensland spirit, was felt in every corner of the Morayfield state electorate on that day and in the days and weeks following that tragic day. We see it in our neighbourhoods where neighbours continue to help neighbours recover from this event; we see it in our streets where complete strangers continue to help complete strangers recover from this event; we see it in our communities where people continue to open their hearts, their wallets and their homes to people in need; we see it right across our great state where Queenslanders continue to provide a helping hand to those who need it; we see it around our nation, where Australians continue to say, ‘We are here. We are here to help’. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1111718"></A>
Interestingly, I heard from my cousins who live in the Indooroopilly area about a recent chance meeting with a young Texan man. This man said he was amazed by the overwhelming community response to the flooding event in South-East Queensland. The young man said that back home in Texas one of three things would happen following a natural disaster: either people would be waiting in their homes for the government to come and help, people would be looting or people would be working out who to sue. The young Texan said that what he was witnessing in Queensland could only be described as humanity heaven. Humanity heaven indeed. Something special happened in our communities and our state in the wake of those heartbreaking tragedies. We proved to each other who we are. We are Queenslanders. We are the ones who look after our mates. We are the ones who pick each other up when we get knocked down. Nonetheless, people have still lost their lives, things have been lost, houses have been lost. These things are people’s things, these houses are people’s homes. We must continually remind ourselves that these people must not be forgotten. It was and continues to be important to me to remind those people in the Morayfield state electorate affected by the recent flooding event that as a community we will not forget them, as a government we will not forget them and as their state member I will not forget them. I will do my best to help them. I will do my best to be with them through these troubling times. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111719"></A>
In the days and weeks following that tragic day I went door to door visiting people affected by flooding. I sat with them and I cried with them. I cleaned out flood affected sheds and even got attacked by a water rat. I cleaned out blocked gutters. I attended street meetings and community barbecues. However, I was most moved by a visit to a street in Morayfield. The people who live in this street are poor. I have never seen people so poor. They are poor. But what they lacked in financial capacity they made up for in courage, resilience and inspiration. I cannot imagine how I would respond to seeing everything I own being discarded on my footpath. But the people of this street, these courageous people, told me that they would be alright. ‘It’s the other people’ or ‘It’s my neighbour you need to worry about’, they would say. My faith in the strength of the human spirit was renewed that day in that street. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1111722"></A>
I would like to thank Councillor Chris Whiting, Councillor Adrian Raedel and Senator Mark Furner for taking time to join me in doorknocking affected people in the Morayfield state electorate. Thank you also to sports minister Phil Reeves for visiting affected sporting clubs with me and to community services minister Karen Struthers for calling me and checking on the people of the Morayfield state electorate. I would also like to put on the record my appreciation to Telstra, in particular Kris Carver from Telstra Country Wide, all Telstra workers in the Morayfield state electorate and the members of the Community and Public Sector Union for helping to get affected people reconnected to the telecommunications network so that they could call their friends and family to tell them that they were alright. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121461"></A>
I also thank the members of the miscellaneous workers union who contacted me offering support and assistance. Whenever and wherever help is needed, the Missos are never too far away. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121466"></A>
It is also important to note the valuable, tireless and selfless work of local groups and local people throughout the Caboolture region. I say thankyou to the Morayfield and District Lions Club, the Apex Club of Caboolture, the Forest Ridge North Neighbourhood Watch group and all Neighbourhood Watch groups in the Morayfield state electorate, the Rotary Clubs of North Lakes and Caboolture, the Seventh-day Adventist Church on Caboolture River Road, the Queensland Police Service and other emergency services workers, the local newspapers and radio stations and all the local people who helped other local people in one way or another. Thank you. I would like to specifically note the outstanding work of the community recovery team from the Department of Communities. This team was of unbelievable support to affected people throughout the Caboolture region. Everywhere I go I hear people praise this team. They say well done and thank you. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121477"></A>
Finally, I say thankyou to our Premier, Anna Bligh. Thank you for your strong, compassionate and dedicated leadership. Your commitment to us, your commitment to Queensland, is truly inspirational. Our community’s response to these heartbreaking tragedies has emphasised that great Queensland spirit of getting involved, helping your mates and working hard for those in most need. Despite our sadness for what has been lost, we should use this opportunity to build on that spirit. Let us challenge each other to be more involved in our communities. Let us get to know our neighbours just a little better. Let us spend more time with those we love. Let us always remember that we live in a great place with great people. Let us never forget that we are Queenslanders. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The natural disasters in Queensland have left many communities throughout our state in a position of desperation. The stories shared in this House by my colleagues whose communities were directly impacted by the disasters captured the horrifying extent of the devastation that the floods and Cyclone Yasi inflicted state-wide. </A></Hansard-Body>

For the many Queenslanders directly affected, the colossal and heart-wrenching task of rebuilding lies immediately ahead. The unwavering spirit that has been the driving force behind clean-up efforts across Queensland has been evident to us not only on our television screens and in the newspapers but also in the simple acts of goodwill that have been demonstrated by our local communities. We have heard countless examples in the House this week of how individual willpower and community strength can prove uplifting even in the most tragic of circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121487"></A>
The electorate of Aspley was spared the destruction that has devastated our state, but the community’s willingness to extend an arm of friendship and to help those who need it most has been manifest. It seems that everyone has a family member or friend who has been affected. I think this is the reason we have seamlessly come together as one with the will to restore our state. Queenslanders everywhere, either directly or indirectly, have felt the impacts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121488"></A>
We received many calls at my office from constituents wanting to know how they could help by donating money, clothes, furniture and sundry items to those who were evacuated from their homes. Others wanted to know where to sign up for the next volunteer clean-up day or where to help fill sandbags. We also received extensive feedback from community groups who had organised fundraiser events that received tremendous support from local residents. Everyone just wanted to help. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121491"></A>
There was the team at Subway, Carseldine, for example, who donated food for the SES workers and established a drop-off point for locals to donate cans of soft drink and bottled water to be distributed to those hardworking volunteers. Members of the Kedron-Wavell RSL sub-branch loaded five Army trucks from the Gallipoli Barracks with donations, including children’s bikes, clothes, linen and kitchenware, and took them to the flood ravaged town of Theodore. It was these sorts of contributions that ultimately made a big difference to those communities who lost everything. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121496"></A>
The Aspley Lions Club held a sausage sizzle fundraiser at Bunnings, Carseldine on Saturday, 15 January. Over $3,500 was raised for the appeal. It was heartening to see people buying up shovels, gumboots and brooms ready to join the ranks of the mud army and assist in any capacity. The following day I joined Councillor Norm Wyndham from the McDowall ward and the Brisbane City Council registration team at Doomben, where around 1,800 volunteers turned up to offer their help. Some came from as far away as the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast and interstate. Many of the people I had met the previous day at the sausage sizzle arrived with their shiny, new gear in hand and a positive spirit, ready to provide hands-on assistance to those in need. The selflessness and enthusiasm to help their fellow Queenslanders was truly inspiring and I thank every one of them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121499"></A>
The member for Lockyer offered a moving account of the heroism of local residents in the face of unimaginable adversity. Family members and neighbours helped each other onto rooftops as floodwaters swallowed their homes. Many of us could only watch television footage in sheer disbelief. Thirty-five people perished in the floods and 20 of these were in the Lockyer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121500"></A>
The member for Hinchinbrook spoke of the stoicism and resolve of communities in his electorate and their commitment to rebuilding in the aftermath of Cyclone Yasi. This dogged determination comes as no surprise as they are a pretty tough breed up north. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121501"></A>
The leadership and statesmanship demonstrated by my parliamentary colleagues across the political divide at a time when their electorates have been faced with almost total devastation is inspiring. Their constituents have lost their homes, they have lost their possessions and some may have lost family members or friends. This leadership will be needed for a long time to come as people face the enormous challenges ahead. I am confident that Queenslanders will continue to help each other get back on their feet, support affected businesses and see that the state is restored to its former glory. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121503"></A>
There have been comparisons made to the 1974 floods and Cyclone Tracy as weather extremities, but the events of the past months have set a new precedent for the 21st century that will demand that we plan accordingly for future infrastructure. Population density is increasing throughout the state and the impacts of natural disasters will only intensify without effective planning. The road ahead is indeed a long and rocky one, and now more than ever the people will demand transparency and compassion from their elected representatives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121504"></A>
This has been a chaotic and harrowing time in Queensland’s history, but we have been served a poignant reminder that sympathy, camaraderie and courage are not in short supply in Queensland. To the police and emergency services workers, the SES, on-call public servants, our Defence Force and the army of volunteers who fought tirelessly to ensure the safety of, and give support to, those affected, I extend a heartfelt thankyou. On behalf of the Aspley constituency I offer my thoughts to those people and undertake that they will remain with them until such time as their areas are back to normal. Our people are here in Aspley whenever or wherever they are needed. You will not be forgotten. <Hansard-Speech-End>

In the days and weeks following the different stages of the impact of these disasters there was a clear sentiment from people I met who were saying, ‘Don’t forget us.’ They implored that they would be feeling for some time the impact of the events which had taken them to their knees. The devastating natural forces and the subsequent devastation in many other areas meant that media attention shifted from one crisis to the next unfolding crisis. So we saw a situation where those who had suffered so much did worry that perhaps their particular circumstances, which had been so incredibly difficult, might be cast aside. As we remember in this vast state that there have been so many impacted with such incredible forces of nature, we have a responsibility to remember them all and to work to support them all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121550"></A>
As members of parliament well know, as do the thousands of volunteers and front-line public servants, the hardest work is not done in the media spotlight but in the ongoing slog to repair, restore and rebuild homes, hearts, communities and businesses. I pay tribute to those countless thousands who answered the call for help, to the heroes who risked their lives to save others and to all who slogged in the heat and humidity in the clean-up and rebuild of shattered homes and businesses--and this is ongoing. Our police, the firies, SES, electricity linesmen, other emergency service personnel, council leaders, workers and all involved in front-line services have risen to the task in an outstanding way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121551"></A>
I pay particular tribute to my colleagues Ian Rickuss, the member for Lockyer, and his wife, Ann, whose community was so brutally savaged by flash flooding which took many lives; also to the member for Hinchinbrook, Andrew Cripps, whose beautiful North Queensland electorate was shredded by Cyclone Yasi; to the member for Toowoomba South, Mike Horan; and to so many MPs from across this parliament, across the political divide, who have had a real impact in their local areas but who have also been hands-on in supporting their affected communities. We stand alongside of you. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121553"></A>
If there is a silver lining in these terrible events, it has been to see the best of people coming forward, thousands of volunteers, at personal cost to themselves, armed with shovels, brooms, mops; tradies volunteering their labour; and unskilled labour volunteering their elbow grease. I will never forget the sight. It was inspirational. Among the tragedy of lost homes and precious possessions turned to garbage on the kerbside was this wave of people of all ages but particularly young people, giving of themselves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121554"></A>
I was proud to work alongside other workers of the mud army in Brisbane and also volunteers from the Maroochydore Surf Life Saving Club in the clean-up in Ipswich. As the member for Nicklin said, we worked together with this great surf club, and it was wonderful to see these young people in action. Sunshine Coast surf-lifesaving clubs also sent their highly trained volunteers with rubber duckies from the seaside to the front line of inundated streets of Brisbane, working alongside SES personnel to check houses for stranded homeowners. There are many, many other stories of volunteer organisations and of volunteers individually answering the call. There has been something of the Anzac spirit, mates helping mates and strangers providing solace through practical service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121559"></A>
After the immediate crisis, the need for help does not go away. In fact, it can become so much more critical as despair can replace courage when the recovery is prolonged and wearing as people count their losses and bear the daily strain of getting back on their feet and getting their businesses, their farms and their lives back in order. This is a mental burden which can be hard to fathom. In meeting with farmers at Cecil Plains with my colleague the member for Condamine, Ray Hopper, I heard how some of these farmers went under floodwaters not once but twice in a very short period of time. Many lost their third crop in a row. They are hardworking, proud people who do not ask for handouts, but now they have been dealt a devastating blow of losing their homes and their livelihoods, and this is a story that is told in so many areas. They survived the drought--10 years of drought in parts of Queensland--only then to invest in the crop they hoped would be their turning point. And they have lost it. They cannot get back on their feet without help. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121561"></A>
Governments have a responsibility to recognise these diverse needs throughout this state and, for us in our personal giving, to equip the front-line services--both professionals and volunteer services--to go where we cannot all go and to give practical help and mental health support. Too many lives have already been lost. We do not want to lose anymore as people struggle to deal with the fallout of their losses. Tragically, we are already hearing stories where this impact is becoming a reality. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121562"></A>
There are lessons to be learnt from what went wrong in these events and what went right and how to ensure the rebuilding is done with integrity, efficiency and cost-effectiveness. I will say more on these issues when the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill debate is before the House. However, at this time I will note that the Bruce Highway, a National Highway, needs national priority in improving its flood immunity as well as other critical transport links which have been ripped apart. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121564"></A>
A few weeks ago I drove from Bundaberg to Rockhampton where I met with affected communities, council leaders and road workers when the Rockhampton Airport was still underwater and the Rockhampton section of the highway had been reopened. Queensland was divided for 12 days when the highway was cut at this critical juncture. But the impact goes long past the recession of the water. There are huge impacts upon people’s livelihoods, on the transport sector and on the businesses that rely upon those transport links. The member for Hinchinbrook, Andrew Cripps, has also raised other transport industry impacts, and I applaud his advocacy, as the repercussions from Cyclone Yasi require special attention for people in the transport and trucking and related industries if they are to survive and to be able to go on serving these local economies on the road to recovery. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121566"></A>
There is a long road ahead. But we have seen a magnificent response from Queenslanders. We have seen a generation responding to a cause. In some ways it is almost a rediscovery that our neighbours really are our fellow members of Queensland. But there is a lot of work to be done, a lot of questions to be asked about how to approach these needs and, most importantly, a great need that we do not forget in this vast state the vast areas that have been impacted and the diverse needs that need to be met not only with compassion but also with extremely practical help. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Infrastructure and Planning) (6.05 pm): Throughout our state’s history our character has been forged by what can be devastating natural forces. The events of this summer of sorrow have further formed Queensland and Queenslanders. Thirty-six lives lost in the wake of these terrible natural forces are an indelible reminder to us all of the frailty of humans. But our humanity means that those 36 lives are not lost to their families, to their friends, to their communities--those 36 lives will continue to touch many, indeed, as evidenced by the poignant contributions by honourable members in heartfelt support of this condolence motion. On behalf of the people of the Stafford electorate, I express our deepest condolences to those who have lost friends or family in the floods and the many others who lost property or suffered hardship as a result of the rising waters and of Tropical Cyclone Yasi. </Hansard-Body>

It has been a terrible time for Queensland and few, even if only through the emotional impact of the tragedy, have gone unaffected. While those directly impacted have struggled with the elements, loss and grief, those around them have rallied to help. This debate has highlighted the breadth of ways in which the true character of Queenslanders has shone through--be it the resilience of those whose homes and businesses have been inundated, be it the courage of our emergency services and utilities workers, or the demonstrations of mateship through the volunteering effort or generous support for appeals for assistance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121576"></A>
In the Stafford electorate our community was spared any direct impact of the great flood of 2011, but our community was there in the response. When my honourable friend the member for Everton joined me at the Newmarket State Emergency Services depot and at the Brisbane City Council’s Stafford depot, both in my electorate, our efforts to fill sandbags saw us as part of teams of many hundreds of volunteers from an array of backgrounds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121579"></A>
For many northsiders, the only way they could contribute was via the fundraising efforts, which began when the floodwaters peaked in Rockhampton and they continue today. I could not mention every effort in this regard, but I will note the efforts of some of those Queenslanders whose character is truly still being moulded. Local schools directly unaffected, such as St Anthony’s in Kedron and St Columba’s in Wilston, have adopted sister parish schools in Ipswich and Rosewood respectively. Students as young as six have written messages of support to pupils they have never met. Last Friday alone, one school raised more than $1,100 for much needed books, uniforms and sporting equipment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121582"></A>
But the contributions do not have to be on that scale. They do not have to be on the scale of the significant contributions from our friends overseas and across Australia that we have heard of during this debate. At Somerset Hills State School at Stafford Heights, one year 3 student and one year 4 student took it upon themselves, and with the assistance of one of their parents, to doorknock their street, and they raised $53.40, which was promptly sent to the Premier’s Flood Relief Appeal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121587"></A>
In addition, students at Wilston State School have filled 80 shoeboxes with small gifts and toys and individually addressed them to the 80 students of the Alpha State School. It is just to let them know people are thinking of them. They went so far as to add extra presents for the young siblings of those students to ensure that no-one was left out.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121588"></A>
After having extended the sincere condolences on behalf of my constituents, I would now like to in turn thank northsiders and Queenslanders in general for their generous and ongoing goodwill. The events of this summer of sorrow have formed Queensland and Queenslanders. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(6.10 pm): On behalf of the people of Springwood, I would like to express sincere condolences to those families who lost loved ones during this tragic time. The scale of devastation has touched us all. So many people have lost so much--homes, personal memoirs and items that represent their family history. Memories of their lives and businesses have been taken away. We grieve with them, all of them, in their sadness. </Hansard-Body>

We can all remember the scenes before the end of last year of the water rising around Rocky and Central Queensland. I was in contact with a friend living near Theodore. I will always remember her saying to me, ‘When I hear the chopper I always go out and wave because I know it will be someone I know having to evacuate their home. I feel so sad for them and I want them to know that we will be here for them when they return.’ She also told me about the Friends of Theodore group that was set up to assist those in need. I know they raised much needed money to help. I was happy to donate to this organisation and to advertise this charity on my Facebook page. The Friends of Theodore did wonderful work out there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126748"></A>
Then in 2011 we saw more death and destruction from Mother Nature’s force. First the floods and then Cyclone Anthony and Cyclone Yasi impacted on communities from one end of this state to the other. I particularly want to thank the Springwood people who went out and helped with the clean-up and who organised food and drinks and took them into our suburbs of need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126750"></A>
I cannot attend a function or do my shopping without being stopped by people who have stories to tell of either families who have been impacted by the floods or the cyclones or stories of how they helped with the clean-up or stories of the devastation that they saw. They all want to keep assisting because they know how fortunate we have been in Logan. I thank each and every person who donated their time, hard work, money and goods to all those in need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126752"></A>
I know the churches and schools in my area are assisting in communities like Goodna that have lost everything. I visited Goodna with the member for Bundamba. I, along with the people of Springwood, will continue to work with her and Pastor Allan Morris from the Shiloh Christian Church to assist as needs change through the recovery and rebuilding stages. The number of people from my electorate offering their assistance has been outstanding. I look forward to continuing to work with them to assist our fellow Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126754"></A>
I know that state government and other workers were put into evacuation centres to assist before these events or assist in setting up services after the devastation. It is not very often we thank our public servants, but today I want to recognise their hard work during this time. I know some of them are still away from their families. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126755"></A>
I spoke to someone who told me that at their workplace there were two people who had lost everything. They know that these people will need to be cared for and assisted during the months ahead. Imagine going to work and how you would feel when it is time to go home. People are going home to their home, to their furniture, to their kitchen, to their kitchen utensils, to make their dinner, to hop into their bed, to hop into their clothes and their life has not changed. You work every day alongside them and yet you return to a caravan that a family or friend may have given you or a rental home or a room at someone’s house, to clothes that have been donated and to bed linen that has been donated. You have a place that is shelter but it is not your home. Imagine how that must feel and how hard that must be. We must remain sensitive to those around us and we must remain committed to rebuilding those people’s lives. This must be our No. 1 priority.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126756"></A>
I do not think there were too many people who slept the night that Cyclone Yasi hit. While we can never imagine the fear North Queenslanders faced that night, we wanted to be awake and ready to assist as soon as we could. Distance was not going to be a barrier for our spirit had made north and south one. Once again, that true Aussie spirit came out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126758"></A>
I cannot stand in this place today without thanking our wonderful emergency service officers all over our state. The Queensland Police Service used every communication media available to get out information to the community. I, along with many others, watched briefings on YouTube and read many messages on Facebook and Twitter. These messages not only conveyed important information but also showed the variety of jobs our police officers took on during the preparation period and after the devastation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126763"></A>
Anyone from around the world can tune in and watch people like Chief Superintendent Paul Taylor speaking with people in communities flattened by Cyclone Yasi. I hope they will get on to the Premier’s Disaster Relief Appeal site and donate. The briefings from Chief Superintendent Alistair Dawson or Assistant Commission Brett Pointing kept us updated regularly either on TV or through live streaming. They had our attention. I have had the pleasure of working with these three officers so I knew that our state was in great hands. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126766"></A>
I know police officers from Logan were sent to various parts of the state to assist those in need and to give some respite to local officers who had worked frantically with their communities. I know they appreciate being sent away for only seven days at a time because it allows them to be with their families and do any necessary work they may have to do if the weather impacted their homes. I thank those officers for assisting their fellow Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126767"></A>
Firies and ambos were there to help. Our emergency helicopter officers, rapid water rescue teams and our courageous SES officers from all over our state and other states were there to help. Australia is so fortunate to have them. There is no doubt we have the best emergency services in the world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126768"></A>
An image I will never forget is of the Army working in our communities--moving trees, moving debris off our rail tracks and our roads. I know the Navy also played a very important part in clearing the river and making it safe for water activities to start again. For a country that does not have compulsory national service I say we have a very great country because we know that those men and women of the services are there because they want to be. They want to be there helping us and protecting us. To them I say thankyou. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126769"></A>
The electricity workers throughout the state have one mighty job to do and a lot ahead of them. I want to say thankyou to them because I know during times of frustration often our Energex and Ergon workers cop a bit of abuse. They do a mighty job and this will be one of the mightiest they have to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126771"></A>
To the state disaster management team I say a very big thankyou. Deputy Commissioner Ian Stewart did one almighty job and even had time to Twitter his encouragement and support to all workers on the ground. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126773"></A>
I want to acknowledge every MP in this House who has been impacted by the floods or the cyclones. You have made your communities proud. We can see how much you care for them. We will be here alongside you and assisting you with the rebuilding of your communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126774"></A>
I said before that I was stopped at functions, at schools, at shopping centres, everywhere by people who said to me--and I want to quote them--‘Please pass on our thanks to Anna. She did one mighty job.’ People from interstate who were staying here at the time of the floods have also told me how impressed they were with the leadership of our Premier. Those who stop me want to tell me what great work she did during this tragic time. Today, I take this opportunity to pass on their thanks. I also want to pass on my thanks to our Premier for her leadership, stamina and compassion during this time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126775"></A>
I finish with an image that all of us will remember. The good chaos that was created by all of those who wanted to help--the thousands who came out with mops, shovels, brooms. Whatever it took to clean up they brought it with them. That image was beamed around the world. I had many people from overseas say to me that it is an image they will remember of Australia because it is an image that would be impossible to find anywhere else in this world. It defined the true Aussie spirit--proud to be Australian, proud to be a Queenslander. <Hansard-Speech-End>

I also add the condolences of everyone who lives in my electorate. The loss of life from these natural disasters has affected every Queenslander and is something we all feel personally.</A></Hansard-Body>

In Logan, the recent natural disasters were a surreal experience. While we sat there high and largely dry, people living only 10 minutes drive away were hurting from the effects of flooding and other natural disasters. That being said, the people of Logan have done everything they can to assist their neighbours in Brisbane and Ipswich and all over Queensland. There has been some creative fundraising to provide financial support, as well as people who have done their best to provide practical support. There are so many examples. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131919"></A>
Dave and Deb from Stockmans Tucker Butchery at Meadowbrook have been holding a sausage sizzle fundraiser every Saturday and have raised thousands of dollars for the Premier’s Disaster Relief Appeal. The Islamic community of Queensland had a massive fundraiser on the weekend after Australia Day, raising tens of thousands of dollars for the relief fund. One of the ones that is most touching to me involved Jeta Gardens, a retirement village in my electorate. The Brisbane-Chinese Lions Club, the Australian United Hospitality Association and the residents of this nursing home came together to provide $6,000 worth of donations to the Premier’s Disaster Relief Appeal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131921"></A>
Also, in terms of practical assistance, I had the pleasure of accompanying radiographers from the Logan Hospital along with volunteers from the Centre Against Sexual Violence to help the member for Yeerongpilly to assist his residents in Rocklea and the Rocklea State School in their clean-up. The Waterford Demons, the local rugby league club, trekked over to Goodna on many days to help out their rugby league rivals at Goodna. The Beenleigh PCYC has also raised tens of thousands of dollars to support the flood recovery effort.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131927"></A>
Locally, we were quite fortunate. We had some localised flooding, but we were very fortunate that the Wyaralong Dam was completed in December 2010. It was predicted that it would take five years to fill that dam, but it filled in a matter of weeks. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MOORHEAD:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The Minister for Infrastructure and Planning is here to inform the House that it took 25 days to fill when it should have taken five years. As well, Logan is home to many emergency services personnel--firies, ambulance officers and police officers--who have been put on the front line of the rescue and recovery efforts, and that is a contribution that Logan is happy to make.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131931"></A>
In conclusion, I would like to briefly mention two other things. The first is the importance of social media in the flood effort. Twitter was a forum where people came together to match those people who were prepared to help with those people who needed help. The QPSmedia Twitter feed gave fantastic advice for residents, particularly with their mythbusters, which put many people at ease. Even Meshel Laurie from Nova 106.9 was able to house many hundreds of pets who might have found themselves homeless during the flood event.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131933"></A>
Finally, I would like to pass on the thanks of many of my constituents to the Premier. Even as late as Saturday, the Kingston South Neighbourhood Watch asked me to pass on to the Premier their thanks for her leadership during this time and also for the great supply of information about Cyclone Yasi which meant that the loss of life that could have happened did not happen. That is a great saving for Queensland. I look forward to doing everything that I can and that Logan can to help the rebuild effort in the months to come. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Our sympathy and prayers are with those who have lost their loved ones, whose lives were taken in such tragic events. May their souls rest in peace and one day unite again with us all in the fullness of time. Each and every one of us who have been placed in this parliament as leaders to our respective communities has experienced or been touched in one way or another by the pain and suffering that was inflicted on so many Queenslanders and which made many of us weak during the events that took place but has since made us all that bit stronger as a result of these ordeals.</A></Hansard-Body>

Fortunately there was no loss of life in the Beaudesert region, but it must be noted that the natural disaster has impacted greatly on the livelihoods of many farmers and small businesses in the region. Some residents were evacuated to the Kalbar community centre from Kalbar and the caravan park on the Boonah showgrounds as localised flooding increased and numerous roads were being cut off. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131942"></A>
Like those in the rest of Queensland, the communities within the electorate of Beaudesert went above and beyond the call of duty in assisting their neighbours in the stricken Lockyer Valley, Toowoomba, Ipswich and Brisbane regions. I want to acknowledge the numerous fundraisers held throughout the region, including the bush dance at Kerry organised by the Opperman family. There was a ‘Don’t Rock the Boat’ fundraiser held at the Woodhill community centre organised by Ray Fleming and the BobKats as well as our local radio station, BeauFM, which is headed by Michael Bassett, which raised more than $5,500 towards the Premier’s relief fund. The Kooralbyn community held a dance and fundraiser, which was put on by the chamber of commerce. The Tamborine community hosted a fundraiser at the Bearded Dragon Boutique Hotel; this was organised by the Neighbourhood Watch group which was led by Geoff McConnell and Kym ‘Tornado’.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131954"></A>
Elina Juusola-Halonen and her team at Caddies Community Care Centre in Jimboomba held a fundraising day with car washes, sausage sizzles and activities for the kids. Numerous community organisations such as Rotary, Lions, Quota and Zonta throughout Boonah, Kalbar, Aratula, Rathdowney, Beechmont, Tamborine Mountain and Canungra held events. Next Friday, the P&amp;Cs from Warrill View, Harrisville, Mutdapilly and Peak Crossing will be holding a bush dance and barbecue fundraiser to assist their neighbouring schools that were affected by the floods in Ipswich. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131967"></A>
Special thanks go to Andy McCann from Peak Crossing for organising a team of us to assist in the dismantling of a castaway shed donated to the Boonah community by the owner. This will be salvaged and used as a men’s shed for a support group. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131970"></A>
Thanks go to the Jimboomba RSL--to John Lilley, Karen Opperman and many others for approaching me to assist in organising a convoy and transit to Grantham to deliver supplies and provide barbecues to the locals and emergency services personnel. President Jim Short walked into the electorate office with a trolley full of water and bread which he purchased first thing in the morning after resolving the motion put forward at the RSL the night before. As pensioners, Jim and his wife, Edna, went above and beyond with their generous contribution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131973"></A>
Another special contribution which I will never forget was from an elderly gentleman who proudly brought in a plastic bag with one kilogram of sausages. You could read in his face that it meant the world to him to know that he was contributing to the cause within his financial limitations. When he requested that he did not wish to be named or recognised for his contribution, it struck me that his contribution was literally more than he could afford.</Hansard-Body>

All the rural firies, the SES and general emergency services personnel from right across the Beaudesert electorate have done and are still doing their region proud. There are too many to name but, boy, was I proud when our rural firies drove into Harris Street, Grantham and I saw a bunch of familiar faces--tired and worn out but ready to do it all over again. To Senior Sergeant Bill Sheehan from Jimboomba Police Station who was transferred to Rockhampton: well done on your efforts. In particular, thanks go to the Scenic Rim disaster management committee--Mayor John Brent and the six Scenic Rim councillors--who were in constant contact with my office and kept me up to date. Appreciation also goes to Father Columba Macbeth-Green of Marian Valley, Canungra. As chaplain to the Queensland police he spent a week in Grantham during the search for the missing and provided comfort to the heartstricken and overcome. </Hansard-Body>

On a lighter note, a group of us delivered sandwiches, chips and water to households in Bannerman Street, which runs parallel to Oxley Creek just down the road from my brother’s house. We decided to lighten the spirits of those struggling to clean up in the heat and to return in the afternoon with an esky full of XXXX Gold. We loaded up the car with a few cartons and then began dropping off the refreshments. By the time we got to the third house, we approached a group of people all sitting down. After we offered them a beer, one of the ladies stared in disbelief and began cross-examining us and eventually accused us quite loudly of all being looters, to which my mate Bernie replied, ‘If we were looters, the beer would be warm and we’d be charging you guys.’ She quickly decided that we probably were legit and reluctantly dug her hand into the ice and thanked us with a grin and a mixture of embarrassment and appreciation. </Hansard-Body>

The community spirit was alive and well in Goodna. The tenacity of the member for Bundamba ought to be admired as she provided a people’s service, operating her electorate office from a tent. She lost everything in her office, much of the contents of which were her own personal belongings. It was amazing to see the amount of people who were pitching in, as her daughter Stephanie tried to salvage the odd photo and organise a team of people to tear down the bits of ceiling that remained and to mop the floors. It was truly incredible to see the whole office completely gutted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131987"></A>
After dropping off a few basic items at her tent, the locals insisted I take a box of bananas from the local fruit shop. Given the cost of bananas right now, I felt pretty guilty dropping off about $30 worth of goods to them and loading up about $60 worth of goods from them. Such was the generosity of these good people. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1137242"></A>
To my colleague and neighbour the member for Lockyer and his wife, thankyou. Thankyou for rising to the challenge in what must have been one of the most difficult times to help and console a community grieving and in disbelief whilst casting your own concerns to one side. Whilst on a mercy run to Grantham, words, even pictures, could not describe the reality and extent of what had happened. Crops were replaced with bathtubs and household items were scattered all over the place like a disorganised tip. Cars were crumpled like alfoil and homes reduced to vacant blocks. Amongst the ruins an obvious boost of encouragement was the fresh colours of our nation’s flag waving boldly above the ruins, and as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and also the member for Toowoomba South rightly noted, the spirit of the Anzacs still lives on.</Hansard-Body>

 Amongst the ruins an obvious boost of encouragement was the fresh colours of our nation’s flag waving boldly above the ruins, and as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and also the member for Toowoomba South rightly noted, the spirit of the Anzacs still lives on, stronger than ever. One farmer I met and spent some time with on his property was Derek Schultz, who had lost everything. With 60 employees and tens of thousands of dollars in repayments every month, his attitude was reduced to those three common words--‘she’ll be right’. To my friend and federal member for Wright, Scott Buchholz, you are a true champion. Few knew that Scott had his own tragedy to deal with following the death of his father only weeks before the natural disasters, yet he was determined to execute his duties to the people he represented and stuck alongside them all the way together with the member for Lockyer. Despite his own personal turmoil, he carried on in the face of extreme adversity and selflessly served others before himself.</Hansard-Body>

This morning Mr Speaker mentioned the passing of Ted Newton, and I think it would be appropriate to mention the passing of Ted Newton coupled with this condolence motion. Ted started in the parliament in 1973 and I did work experience with him in 1995 and have kept in close contact with him ever since. He passed on 31 January. He had a deep appreciation for our parliamentary system and a very entertaining sense of humour. Paul Reynolds, his close friend, said that when he saw him in the Wesley Hospital his last words to him were that he was not scared but just sad, and that very much epitomises Ted. He enjoyed every living moment on earth and I thank him for the mentorship that he gave me through my work experience.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137252"></A>
I was fortunate enough to attend Ted’s funeral at Holy Trinity in Fortitude Valley last Saturday. On the Monday night before his death I called the Wesley Hospital and read a text from my father to him, because it was my father’s idea to do work experience here. He said to thank Ted for putting me on the straight and narrow--I do not know how accurate that part is--and to let him know that dad was storming heaven for him. In true Ted Newton style he said, ‘Whatever you do, don’t storm heaven. We have enough of those down here!’ That was his sense of humour. I am grateful to Ted for everything that he taught me about politics. If it was not for his humour and many stories, I probably would not be standing here today. We shared many a red wine on his deck in Bardon and discussed all the problems of the world and how we could best solve them. I wanted to put that on record on behalf of a lot of parliamentary staff who worked with Ted. May he rest in peace.</Hansard-Body>

Amongst all of the tragedies, I want to mention the success of the Wyaralong Dam which is located in the Beaudesert electorate. I want to thank the Minister for Infrastructure, who is present in the chamber tonight, for the communications with my office and for the success of that project, which was just finished a few weeks before it was filled. Prior to the floods some locals were saying that it would never be filled, but it was filled within 25 days. That also prevented a lot of floodwaters flowing into Logan. So that is certainly one of the success stories that came out of this disaster. I think it would be appropriate if I could indulge in tabling Queensland Water Infrastructure’s 12 pictures that went out to the community about the Wyaralong Dam project and the success of the operations there.</Hansard-Body>

There has been a clear message from this parliament to the insurance companies from all members of the parliament: please be compassionate. I am aware that tonight the member for Yeerongpilly will be launching a consumer based ‘Support a Compassionate Insurance Company’ campaign. I certainly welcome that and congratulate him on instigating that, because those insurance companies that will lend a helping hand above and beyond the call of duty of the written word will be remembered in time to come. I ask them to assist Queenslanders in their moment of need. Special thanks also to my wife, Christy, and her friend Ellen, who spent many nights into the wee hours of the morning preparing hundreds of sandwiches for all of the volunteers in the Ipswich and Oxley areas.</Hansard-Body>

Cyclone Yasi added more pain to an already suffering state, and our northern brothers and sisters were not forgotten even though the pressures on resources and supplies were stretching thin. To all our colleagues in those regions, in particular to the member for Hinchinbrook, well done for the support that you provided to your communities. It was the fear of the unknown that left many of us down here feeling frustratingly helpless to assist in your defence. Distance will not divide us. If you are a Queenslander, you are a Queenslander and the rebuild and recovery will no doubt take place without fear or favour.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137260"></A>
Our Premier undoubtedly did an admirable job throughout these tragedies and none of us will ever fully understand the silent pressures that she would have been constantly encountering given the demands on her in that position. I think it is entirely appropriate therefore to also acknowledge and thank her family for the sacrifices that would have had to have been made in order for her to undertake the huge task that lay ahead of her. To the Leader of the Opposition, the huge effort and sacrifices that you and your family would also have had to make throughout these disasters is much appreciated.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137262"></A>
One story which will be branded on all of our hearts was that of Jordan Rice. None of us know when our time is up or how we will leave this life. But when that moment is upon us and one has to make a decision between our life or somebody else’s, there is no greater love than sacrificing your own. May God look after this little man and may he rest in peace with his mother.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137263"></A>
As collective representatives we must be aware that there are many amongst our communities who may never properly recover from these disasters and we must ensure they are supported financially, physically, spiritually and mentally well beyond the visual repairs and rebuilding which will eventually take place. Sometimes an overdose of our Aussie spirit can get the better of us, and there will be many amongst us who bury the hurt behind a tough face as they try to move on. These people will need our support for a long time yet to come. The industry of politics can often be seen as a very sanitised and robotic process in the public eye when we meet here in what the Speaker often reminds us is the people’s house. But there is a very strong underlying human element that exists in each of us, and that has began to transform amongst us and it is my hope that we can maintain this into the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137266"></A>
Of course there will always be argy-bargy and hot air flowing to and fro. That is the nature of democratic debate, but we must always safeguard the separation of the person and the profession. Let us battle it out against each other in these chambers with good intent to push the betterment of Queensland whilst being able to leave our boxing gloves in the ring. These natural disasters have inevitably brought communities together, and even though as neighbours we separate our property lines with fences we must always make sure that these fences are never too high that we cannot shake a hand or lend a shovel. Like all members in this House, I have never been more proud to live in Queensland and call myself a Queenslander. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Hervey Bay--LNP) (7.37 pm): On behalf of the residents of Hervey Bay, I offer my sincere condolences to the families who have lost loved ones throughout the floods. I also offer condolences to the families who have lost property and, in some cases, families who have had to leave pets behind when they went into evacuation centres. Having been the mayor of Hervey Bay and the chair of the counterdisaster committee, you realise just how many people you rely on in times of emergency. I want to thank all of the people who have developed the management plans--the state emergency department, the volunteers and the council staff--because it is not the most exciting thing to develop. We all hope that when developing those plans we never have to use them, but those plans saved a lot of lives during the floods and cyclone. Being prepared is the one thing that saves lives.</Hansard-Body>

Earlier I heard the member for Chatsworth talking about firies being prepared and trained for these emergencies. In times of disaster you always rely on many people like police and other rescue personnel. Those people risk their lives for others, as do the SES, the volunteers, state emergency departments, the ambulance and the fire services. Whether they are rural or urban, the fire services are always there to help, as are VMR and the Coast Guard. They are always there and are well trained to deal with floods and other such events.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142423"></A>
Thanks also have to go to the council staff in the control rooms of the emergency management departments. I have been in council chambers with a number of council staff making sure that the generator is going so that when the power goes out you have electricity in those buildings so that the computers can keep going. A lot goes on behind the scenes that a lot of people do not realise. My thanks go to the girls who bring you the coffee to keep you awake, but you cannot sleep anyway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142426"></A>
All of those council workers who work in the sewage treatment plants and the water treatment plants are so important as they make sure that those plants are working as soon as possible after any disaster. I would like to thank all of those people for the time and effort that they put in. The Ergon Energy workers who connect the electricity after storms, floods and cyclones have to work in some horrible conditions. They are working in the rain, in storms and things like that to try to get the electricity back on. The people from Telstra try their best to keep the communications open. We always have to think of them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142427"></A>
My thanks also go to the media, especially the radio. It is a way of getting your message out when all the power goes out. The ABC, the commercial radio stations and the community radio stations all need to be thanked for all the help that they give in times of crisis. My thanks go also to our hospital staff--the doctors and the nurses. It should not be forgotten that most of these people have families at home who have to fend for themselves while their partners are out in the disaster areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142428"></A>
I would like to thank all the organisations in Hervey Bay that have raised money for the disaster appeal: the Z-PAC Theatre, the artists who put on a show and raised money, the Baptist Church, the RSL, the boat clubs, the hotels in Hervey Bay, the bowls club, the sporting clubs, the social clubs, especially our service clubs--Lions, Rotary and Apex--and so many more who have given to help their fellow Queenslanders. All I have to say to all of my colleagues here and to all Queenslanders is a big thankyou for their efforts.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110216_194136" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Redcliffe--ALP) (7.41 pm): I rise to convey my sincerest condolences and those of the people of Redcliffe to the victims of the natural disasters that have occurred over the past few weeks. The tragic effects of the recent floods and Cyclone Yasi devastated a large part of Queensland, shattering the lives of so many people. Those natural disasters have left many Queenslanders homeless and with huge bills to make their homes livable again. My heart goes out to everyone who has been affected by these natural disasters that hit one after the other in a very short period, banking up so that they caused unprecedented destruction right across the state. I am proud that Queenslanders have pulled together so heroically to clean up right across the state, particularly our mud army. </A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1142436"></A>
My electorate of Redcliffe was not hugely impacted by these disasters, but many Redcliffe people who are not new to adversity were among those who hurried to join the mud army and assisted in cleaning up affected homes. Many people also spent evenings baking and delivering the goods to evacuation centres. Others collected furniture to take to people who have been left with nothing. Community groups organised fundraisers and I believe that there are more to come. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142437"></A>
The immediate disaster is over, but for those affected there is still a long way to go as they wait for news from insurance companies and begin to pull their lives together again. The rebuilding will also take some time. The emotional toll has also yet to fully surface, as reactions set in after the adrenaline rush of the initial clean-up. So many people will continue to need support. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142438"></A>
It is vital that each community is supported in order to kick-start their economies, repair their road infrastructure and transport systems and rebuild their social and recreational facilities. That is the challenge we are meeting currently. This is new ground and the Bligh government is moving as swiftly as possible, in conjunction with the federal government, to deliver the relief that people and communities most need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142439"></A>
I would like to commend the Premier for the swift and effective way in which she brought all levels of government, state emergency services and the military together in the quickest time possible to ensure that the preparation for these events was sufficient and effective and that people had the support they needed as soon as humanly possible after the event. This was the result of the learning from many other natural disasters and very good organisation. Roads were opened and power was restored in the earliest possible time. The Premier tirelessly traversed devastated areas, assessing the damage and the needs of people and communities and putting the necessary support in place immediately. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142440"></A>
I would also like to thank Minister Roberts for his tireless work right throughout the disasters, all the SES workers--ambulance, police and military--utility organisations such as the power and the water organisations, all the members of this House for their work to assist the people in crisis and also, of course, the volunteers who gave of themselves to support fellow Queenslanders in crisis. This pulling together is an Australian and Queensland trait--part of our pioneering spirit. We know that together we will stand, survive disasters and prosper to create a better Queensland and a better lifestyle for all Queenslanders. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142452"></A>
One of the things that has always concerned me is the claim that ‘this is a one-in-100-year flood’ or ‘this is a one-in-100-year bushfire’, because we do not know when that 100 years starts. Some areas of Queensland have had the highest flood peak on record. Is that the one-in-100-year flood or is that the one for the past 100 years and it starts again from now? We really need to acknowledge that we have suffered grave devastation. We cannot let that devastation occur and not take very strong steps to ensure that it does not happen again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142453"></A>
I have a concern about the reference to people as victims. Certainly, it is always a sadness to lose a loved one, but to lose a loved one in the circumstances of these disasters is really deeply disturbing. They are the real victims. Those people who have lost all of their property or have lost personal possessions or who have suffered injury are in fact survivors, and it is the survivors we have to support. It is the survivors who can look forward with hope. I will deal with the aspect of hope later in my speech. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1142454"></A>
We have heard from all members about the gratitude that we owe to our leadership. I place on record my appreciation for the manner in which the Premier provided details Queensland-wide, as did the Hon. Neil Roberts, the Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services, and his staff, particularly David Smith, who went to great lengths to let everyone know what was occurring. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152605"></A>
I take into account the contribution of our police officers. In most cases the local coordinator was a senior police officer. All in all I believe it worked well. In relation to the emergency services and medical teams, I had the honour of representing the minister at the Australia Day Awards for Emergency Management Queensland. At that ceremony I used a comment which I think is something which we have all tried to say in this House: these were not people who did anything out of the ordinary; they were ordinary people but they did extraordinary things and continued to do extraordinary things because it was necessary to protect our citizens. I acknowledge the contribution by defence service personnel; the helicopter pilots of both Emergency Services and the defence services; federal, state and local government and private sector employees; and voluntary workers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152608"></A>
In the Rockhampton area, which was probably the second place to really feel the brunt of flooding, members may have heard of Hastings Deering. Hastings Deering in Rockhampton went right under water. It has about 140 employees. That company kept all of those employees on. They were, in fact, asked to go out and assist community groups and to assist with manning barricades. In fact, they were being paid fully by Hastings Deering during the whole of the flood. They had great fun when they went back to work because a lot of their machinery which had been under water seemed to be a collection point for snakes. In the first day of clean up they managed to collect 99 venomous snakes, about 80 per cent of which were browns and taipans. They knew where to go. These people worked right through and then had to go back and clean up their own workplace. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152610"></A>
We have heard about the many fundraising activities. That fundraising continues. We have heard the instances of children donating their pocket money. We have heard of people coming forward to provide assistance. The evacuation centre at Rockhampton was at the university which is in the seat of Keppel. For 10 days to a fortnight the people in that evacuation centre were cared for by Red Cross people. They were not just people from Central Queensland, we had people from as far afield as Tasmania. They were fed by the Salvation Army. Those Salvation Army people provided breakfast, lunch and dinner for up to 180 people for a fortnight. I went to the evacuation centre to have a talk to Ross Dobbs who was in charge. I was going to do a sausage sizzle and he asked if we could do the sausage sizzle on a Sunday that he already had pencilled in because it would give his people an opportunity to go to church and have the Sunday with their family, which they had not done for over 14 days. A lot of the food that was used was actually donated. The Emu Park Bakery sent up two trays of bread just out of the blue. The butcher where I got the sausages, Wayne Spresser of Emu Park, does open Sunday morning but he also provides music and entertainment and he said that he and his friend would come to the centre and sing. It was well received. He, in fact, paid someone to run his business while he came up to the evacuation centre for the benefit of the people who were there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152612"></A>
These are the sorts of generous people who live in our communities. Many people do not want to be recognised. Many people say they do not want a lot of assistance because there is somebody else worse off than them. I mentioned earlier about hope. About a fortnight after the major flood had passed Brisbane there was an article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
. The writer, whose name escapes me, used the words that I used: that those who survived were, in fact, not victims, they were survivors. He referred to a Latin maxim in relation to hope. The Latin maxim is dum spiro spero. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOOLIHAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will tell you in a minute. It grabbed me slightly because that is the motto of my family. The English translation of it is ‘while I breathe, I hope.’ All of those people who have survived hope for a better future. That hope for a better future will be provided by the people of Queensland. It will be provided by neighbours. It will be provided by friends. It will be provided by people from overseas. I do not think that anyone who questions whether or not there is an Aussie spirit should lose sight of the fact that the Premier hit the nail on the head when she said we are from north of the border; when we get knocked down we get up again. Billy Moore epitomised that when he ran through the tunnel at Lang Park yelling ‘Queenslander’. Despite the fact that we have got a lot of assistance from overseas and other states, we have looked after ourselves, we will look after ourselves, and I think the bipartisanship and support of this motion of condolence shows that every one of us is a Queenslander who cares for our fellow Queenslanders. I would like to thank everybody for their input in assisting people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152617"></A>
Emerald was the first and Rockhampton was the second to receive some fairly substantial flooding, but it seemed to percolate almost as if Queensland ran downhill because then it went to Bundaberg and further down to Toowoomba and the Mary Valley, and thereby hangs the tale. We have mentioned Cyclone Yasi but we forget that three days before Yasi we had Cyclone Anthony, which went right through Queensland to the south-west of the state. Large quantities of rain fell over the channel country from Cyclone Anthony. It ended up in Victoria as a rain depression. I am not really sure, as I am sure most of the people sitting in this House could not be sure, that there will not be more cyclones during this season. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152618"></A>
The hope that we can rebuild, that Queensland can get up off its knees and become the prosperous and secure state that it has always been, will occur by dint of a lot of hard work by a lot of very dedicated people. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Townsville--ALP) (7.57 pm): The past two months have been what can only be described as the most incredibly tragic in our state’s history. On behalf of the people of Townsville I extend my sympathy to the family, friends and communities of the 35 people who have died during these extreme weather events. My sympathies also go to those who have lost homes, farms, properties, businesses and personal effects collected over a lifetime. None of us has remained unaffected by the images and stories we saw flashed up on television screens day after day of heartbreak and destruction, of death and of survival. Words hardly seem to do justice to the depth of feeling that I have for what has occurred in Queensland this year. Like millions of people across the country, and indeed around the world, we in the north watched in horror as reports came in on the events in Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley. I extend my most heartfelt sympathies to all members of this House whose communities have been affected, including the members for Lockyer, Toowoomba North and Toowoomba South who have lost so many good and decent people from their local towns and communities, whether adults or little children who had only just begun their lives.</Hansard-Body>

Images of the past weeks had turned people’s reactions from shock and sympathy into action to assist flood affected Queenslanders. Townsville people were doing whatever they could do to help, whether it was amassing collections of practical, personal and household goods or volunteering and assisting in flood affected communities. Some of our emergency service workers had completed three or four deployments to central and southern Queensland between Christmas and Cyclone Yasi hitting our coast. They were exhausted after the floods and then they had to come back and prepare our own local communities for what was coming. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157781"></A>
People had been donating and raising money. I will give just a couple of examples because, as we have heard over the last two days, there have literally been thousands of different fundraising efforts conducted. In just a couple of days 16-year-old Katie Brenton organised a concert in Townsville with local young musicians and teenagers. She raised over $700 at that concert. The Northreach Baptist Church held an appeal day, which raised many thousands of dollars. Mark Brine from A Touch of Salt restaurant raised over $32,000 in a single lunch sitting on Sunday, 30 January. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157787"></A>
After the floods and raging torrents receded and the massive clean-up and rebuilding began, along came cyclones Anthony and Yasi. Many people from North Queensland believed they had seen it all before, but we were wrong. On Sunday, 30 January I was attending the A Touch of Salt fundraiser. Local 4TO radio announcer Glenn Mintern and I were urging people to give and to assist our fellow Queenslanders from central, western and southern Queensland in their recovery from floods.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157794"></A>
Cyclone Anthony was moving towards the coast and whilst we were somewhat concerned, we were much more nervous about the monster system following it. Based on hydrology information available to us, we estimated some 70,000 Townsville residents could have been affected by a storm surge that had the potential to be six metres above HAT. When we started talking about figures like that in the local disaster management meetings that I sat in on, the look of horror on the emergency workers’ faces was palpable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157797"></A>
History now tells us that Townsville did cop a bit of a hiding from Yasi. There would not be a street in the city that has not sustained tree damage. Eighty-five per cent of our city lost power and many properties suffered minor and not so minor structural damage. Our recovery is well underway and I have to thank Ergon Energy in particular. I will talk more about the recovery in the bill that will follow this debate. I say thankyou to Ergon for the amazing work that they have done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157798"></A>
Townsville’s recovery is well underway, but the recovery for our northern neighbours will take much longer. The people of the Hinchinbrook and Cassowary Coast regions, including the member for Hinchinbrook, have my most sincere sympathy, admiration and support in rebuilding. We have watched the wounds heal after Larry ripped these communities apart only five years ago and now, inconceivably, they have to do this all again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157799"></A>
I love the coastline between Townsville and Cairns. I have been travelling it all my life. I look forward to revisiting some of those communities again very soon. Mission Beach is a particularly special place for me. It is a place we used to go to as children on holidays. It is the place we now take our kids to at least three or four times a year, just for a weekend getaway. I can assure the people of Mission Beach that we are going to be back again soon. We also love the giant gumboot at Tully and the bikini tree that is on the road into Mission Beach. I hope they both made it through Yasi. I am not sure if they did. The member for Hinchinbrook is nodding, so I am hoping that they both did. </Hansard-Body>

 (Kawana--LNP) (8.04 pm): I rise to speak in support of the condolence motion before the House today. In recent weeks Queensland has been battered by rains, floods and cyclones. She has been tested to the extreme, so much so that statistically 70 per cent of her was covered in waters. The terrible human cost of this disaster is something that we will all live with for quite some time. Sadly, 35 of our fellow Queenslanders lost their lives to the torrent of water that swept across this state with three people still missing. My thoughts and prayers are with those families who have not only been impacted in some way but who have also lost loved ones. </Hansard-Body>

On Sunday, 9 January my family and I were travelling home after a few days at Jimna. We were heading down the Jimna to Kilcoy road and soon realised that something was not quite right. Half the range had completely fallen and blocked the road. We turned back and waited till Monday. Overnight more of the range slipped. We were stuck. The local ranger drew us a mud map to get us down the Kilcoy Murgon Road. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157818"></A>
When we arrived in Kilcoy it became apparent that many towns in Queensland were in severe trouble. Kilcoy was cut off to the outside world. We spent some five days in Kilcoy. At the same time we watched in agony as fellow Queenslanders, particularly those in Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley, were devastated by the torrents of waters and floods that traversed the area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157819"></A>
I recall being in the Kilcoy pub with my family and some 150 other stranded travellers who were stuck in Kilcoy with no way out north, east, west or south. The Kilcoy folk really came to the party. There were hundreds of people stranded in Kilcoy. The local Kilcoy Lions Club set up the emergency evacuation centre where they fed and made 300 meals a day. There was such a diverse range of people stuck in these floodwaters in Kilcoy. But it was great to watch the community spirit unfold in a town that was cut off from the outside world. After three to four days the milk ran out, so the milk was coming over by boat from the dairy. The abattoir workers were being choppered out of Kilcoy across the river into the abattoir to butcher the cattle. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157822"></A>
On the 10th and the 11th we watched the unfolding events in Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley. As I said, the town folk of this area of Kilcoy really stood by the people who were stranded, some of whom had a couple of days of clothes and others who had no money and no access to bank accounts because the ATMs were empty. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157824"></A>
I want to thank the people of Kilcoy, particularly Lorna Sherwood from the Kilcoy Lions Club, who did a lot of the coordinating at the emergency evacuation centre. I want to thank Sandy Adams who, with her team, provided over 300 meals a day to the flood stranded guests. I also want to thank the special events group which is a not-for-profit association that helped; the SES and, of course, all the emergency service workers; Sergeant Marty Tanwan, who was one of the area coordinators and the local sergeant in the town of Kilcoy; and the IGA. On the Monday the IGA was fully stocked. By the Friday it had run out of bread, milk and personal hygiene supplies but it kept donating to the local Lions Club and the butchers in the area to feed the hundreds of people who were stuck in Kilcoy until the roads were clear. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157827"></A>
There are a couple of events in people’s lives that they can recall. They can remember exactly where they were at that point in their life. For me, I can remember exactly where I was when the world found out about Princess Diana’s death and also September 11. I will never forget being stuck in Kilcoy as Queensland flooded and we watched on the news as the Lockyer Valley and Toowoomba were ravaged by this flood from hell. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157828"></A>
While flooding is something that we have seen at various times in our past, flooding of this magnitude has been widely reported in the media in comparison to the devastating floods of 1974. For those of us who were not here in 1974 it is hard to imagine flooding of such magnitude sweeping down the Bremer River, into Ipswich and the Brisbane River and into many suburbs. Thankfully, many communities were able to prepare themselves for the inundation of floodwater, in some cases on more than one occasion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165443"></A>
Whilst statistically 70 per cent of the state was covered in floodwater, many communities did have time to prepare themselves for the rising waters. But let us spare a thought for those in the Lockyer Valley and directly east of the Toowoomba range who had no warning of the wall of water that was heading towards their small but close-knit communities. Sadly, there was also loss of life suffered in Ipswich as the floods swept through the Bremer River and on to Brisbane.</Hansard-Body>

We were greatly underprepared for the events of 10 January 2011 in Toowoomba, Murphys Creek, Postmans Ridge, Withcott, Grantham and throughout the Lockyer Valley. The human cost of the Queensland floods in the summer of 2010-11 is immeasurable. We as legislators and leaders in our respective communities are charged with the task of rebuilding Queensland and ensuring that we are more prepared to respond to natural disasters across this great state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165449"></A>
As the floodwaters subsided and the clean-up task began, our state faced another natural disaster of epic proportions. Tropical Cyclone Yasi was a massive storm set for landfall somewhere between Townsville and Cairns. Many of the residents who live in and around the city of Innisfail in North Queensland and who were still rebuilding and getting their lives together after enduring Tropical Cyclone Larry on 20 March 2006 were preparing for an event that had the potential to be even more devastating. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165452"></A>
The spirit of North Queensland should never be underestimated. While the region is often prepared for the annual cyclone season, the circumstance of two massive cyclones--Larry and Yasi--in the space of just five years has the potential to paralyse many communities for decades. Wind speeds of between 250 and 300 kilometres an hour are a frightening prospect, but the tenacity that the people of North Queensland displayed in the face of tremendous adversity in enduring these massive cyclones is truly inspirational. In comparison, Hurricane Katrina had recorded wind gusts of 280 kilometres per hour. </Hansard-Body>

We have heard much about what it means to be a Queenslander. More than being Queenslanders, we are Australians. Throughout the years, in the most terrible of situations, Australians have banded together. We are a family, and nothing brings a family closer than times of immeasurable trouble. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the emergency services personnel across Queensland who have worked so tirelessly in very dangerous situations to protect and assist their fellow Queenslanders in their time of great need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165454"></A>
The Queenslander spirit has never been more evident than during the recent natural disasters across the state. In the aftermath of the floods, it was great to see so many volunteers out to help their fellow Queenslanders with the difficult task of cleaning out their homes and businesses and in many cases having to count the cost of the damage and start all over again. This tremendous gesture of mateship embodies the true spirit of our state. When times get tough, the first question many people ask is, ‘How can we help?’ </Hansard-Body>

In my own electorate I was happy to support the fundraising efforts of the Kawana Waters Uniting Church and the Uniting Churches of the southern Sunshine Coast region in assisting with the Help the Flood Victims concert, which was held at the Events Centre on 29 January. With the assistance of those who attended, the variety concert event had some very generous donations from business--Ian McDowell from Sunshine Toyota and Bob and Natasa Shelley from australianeedsyou.com, who helped in raising the funds--totalling some $20,000 in one night. These funds will be split evenly between the Lockyer Valley and the Burnett regions to help rebuild communities. So I say to my friend and colleague the member for Lockyer: as you and your community were facing your darkest hours, the people of Kawana were thinking of you, were praying for your community and will gladly hand over the split cheque of $10,000 to help in and around your community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165461"></A>
There have also been significant other fundraising events in my electorate which I have been pleased to assist and support. On Sunday, 23 January, Dave Holmes and his team from Honky’s Events arranged the Flood Festival 2011, a variety of local music acts and activities for families in the Kawana electorate. Our local businesses were called upon and, boy, did they deliver and come to the party! Thousands of dollars worth of auction items were donated. Flood Festival 2011, on top of the $20,000 raised by the Uniting Church, raised another $13,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165465"></A>
On Sunday, 6 February, the Sunshine Coast Unite for Queensland Flood Appeal was held by a local organisation with the assistance of the Kawana Waters Surf Life Saving Club and the Lions Club of Lake Currimundi-Kawana. Another $5,000 was raised from that afternoon which included performances from Uncle Bob’s Jug Band, the Sunshine Coast Ukulele Masters and a surprise performance from their local member--me--as an Elvis Presley impersonator. I was either that good or that bad that they requested a second song. Of course I obliged.</Hansard-Body>

 No, no. Residents from Living Choice Retirement Village in my electorate also organised a local donation pledge of food and clothing which was sent to the Ipswich community in the aftermath of the devastating floodwaters. I would like to publicly thank Mr Eric Brusewitz and Dawn Chalkley for their efforts in organising this donation of much needed supplies to residents in some of the hardest hit areas in Queensland. I want to say thankyou to the Kawana electorate for sending volunteers and thanks to the surf-lifesaving club for sending their RPVs and their lifesavers and for donating money. Individually these fundraising efforts and donation pledges may seem insignificant in size, but collectively they will provide a great deal of assistance to residents who will struggle to recover from these disasters for a very long time. </Hansard-Body>

So although my electorate did not face the battle from hell with the floods and cyclones, we were thinking of our fellow Queenslanders and were doing what we could without fully understanding or appreciating the severity of the situation. But what we did do is come together in all forms of community groups, some of which I have mentioned today, to fundraise, to raise awareness and to pack boxes to send throughout Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

In one of Australia’s unofficial anthems, <Hansard-Italic>
I am Australian</Hansard-Italic>
, the writer, Bruce Woodley, penned two new paragraphs following the devastating bushfires in Victoria. One new paragraph is particularly relevant to our recent disaster events in Queensland. He added the words some 22 years after the original song was penned. The paragraph reads--</Hansard-Body>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110216_201645" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Gladstone--Ind) (8.16 pm): I rise to support the Premier’s condolence motion for Queensland’s natural disaster victims. Since Boxing Day 2010 we have been privileged to see compassion, strength, resilience, generosity and love in the face of intense devastation. We will never forget the dramatic events which have occurred in our state over the past six weeks or so. We cannot begin to believe that the things we have seen will drift from memory; however, except for those directly affected by the floods, those directly in the path of what is called the inland tsunami or those directly in the impact zone of the cyclone, we will forget. It will pass into our memory. </A></Hansard-Body>

Many people in Brisbane do not remember the devastation of the 1974 floods because they were not directly affected or they did not live here. I do because I was here. I remember the stench of the mud, as would anyone who has been through flooding. But the memory fades, thankfully, and it is therefore critical that, at this time when experience and recollections remain raw, we say thankyou, we recognise the communities so deeply affected and we make decisions which will, as much as possible, reduce the risk in any future incidents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1165499"></A>
From each person in my electorate I pass on my deepest sympathies to the families who have lost parents, partners or children. Such losses are immeasurable. The grief will remain, and please know that our thoughts and prayers are with you. To those who face periods of deprivation, those who have lost their jobs, farmers who have lost crops or stock: we are thinking of you. Thinking does not put food on families’ plates, and that is where funds from the state and federal government programs are critical. The measure of a community is how it cares for those in need. The Premier this morning said that the Premier’s appeal currently stands at $213,520,780. This has been collected from individuals, companies, governments and other nations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170879"></A>
I know the SES in townships in the middle of Tassie were standing on the side of the Midlands Highway swinging buckets and collecting for the Queensland flood. That was prior to Yasi. As a measure of care, that is astonishing. We add to that the millions of dollars worth of food, clothing, toys and household goods which have been given. Then we add to that the millions of dollars worth of clean-up work that has been done voluntarily. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170883"></A>
Central Queensland after the floods, the Lockyer-Toowoomba area after the devastating wall of water and later the areas of Hinchinbrook and other places in North Queensland after Yasi have all been the focus of community concern and sympathy. The list of individuals, families and organisations mentioned here in this place over the last couple of days has been significant. Aside from those mentioned, there is an army of unnamed community members who have selflessly provided physical, emotional, psychological and financial support to people they knew and many they did not. We will remain indebted to this anonymous army for decades to come. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170885"></A>
My electorate was spared the brunt of the flooding and the cyclonic conditions. We had localised flooding, including a small community isolated on the inland side of Pikes Crossing. One lady was a week or two away from having her baby. I contacted the SES and they took her contact details. I was able to assure her that with the contacts provided she was in good hands for a medivac should it be required. We were all encouraged by the news that in several places across Queensland, in the face of significant trauma, the safe birth of a little one worked to bring balance back to our lives once more, particularly when the news of some of the losses of young children--children torn from their parents’ arms--reached us. I find it impossible to imagine how those parents would have felt and indeed how those who have survived will manage the grief and despair that they will feel. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170888"></A>
Isolation occurred in the Boyne Valley. Even though the Boyne Valley Road near Nellie Simpson Road was flooded as well as the low single bridges, we were greatly spared. Individuals in my electorate are to be praised for the roles they filled. They include the local disaster coordinating committee, including police Inspector Graham Coleman, representatives of the emergency services council and community members, the bands of volunteer workers from Queensland Rail, the Gladstone Ports Corporation, Lions, Rotary, and other service organisations and groups and individuals packed up tools and went to where they were needed. Initially in our area it was Theodore, but I know that others went north and south as the need arose. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170891"></A>
Terry Hill, the regional director for Main Roads, was a sentinel in terms of keeping the community informed about road conditions and safety for motorists. For a period of time, he remained available to ABC Radio for local information and for state road conditions. I commend him for his availability, his accuracy and his compassion. He is certainly a great man. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170892"></A>
I also commend the RoadTek workers. From early December roads in my electorate were deteriorating significantly with the prolonged rain. In great measure, the start of this deterioration was much earlier with insufficient funds being spent on the Bruce Highway for a number of years. Having said that, RoadTek workers were constantly out patching roads. For weeks when rain was incessant it was a thankless job with patches popping out due to the amount of water in the subsurface of the pavement. But they remained undaunted. Most large, dangerous potholes were patched within 24 hours. They were amazing and I can only commend them for their work. I believe that, where it was possible, they would have done the same amount of work throughout the state--that is, until the floods made it impossible to do the patching. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170895"></A>
Similarly, Gladstone Regional Council workers have continued with their tireless efforts to patch roads which, in some instances, were completely undermined. In early discussions with the council, I could understand their frustration that the direction had been given from government that, to get the national flood funding, any flood rehabilitation had to be done by contractors and not by council day labour. That will result in delays in work being done as the contracting process will take more time. Additionally, in smaller councils the majority of their work needed to be done to ensure cattle and crops could either be taken off properties or stock fed. I commend each council worker for their dedication. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170897"></A>
The staff of the Gladstone Area Water Board also worked with the residents isolated on the western side of Pikes Crossing to ensure access from their isolated properties could be achieved by using a service road for the dam. I commend Jim Grayson and his team for their effort. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170900"></A>
During critical weather events workers from the primary service areas are asked to be available to carry out their work in dangerous and difficult circumstances. I commend the police, SES, hospital, ambulance and fire staff, the Red Cross, St Vincent de Paul, Salvation Army and other charities, Energex and Ergon and all the other service providers that turned out during incredibly difficult times. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170902"></A>
The Australian Defence Force has also been present during the hard yakka doing the grunt work, if you like, of cleaning out and stockpiling rubbish. It was not uncommon to see them in Brisbane streets outside somebody’s home where they had pulled out the material that had to be removed and stockpiled it on the footpath. They would be having a smoko or waiting for a truck to pick them up. Whilst it is easy to dismiss and say that they were just doing their job, they did it with enthusiasm and they did it because they cared as well. Individuals in all these organisations make a conscious decision that, after ensuring to the best of their ability the safety of their own family and homes, they will leave and commit their energy to others. This is the strength of our nation and of our state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170903"></A>
While the Gladstone electorate fared well during these storm events, the majority were conscious of the needs of others. We did have isolated incidents of public frustration or dissatisfaction. My office received a number of contacts from residents who were concerned that staple items had disappeared off the shelves--items such as milk, bread, eggs, formula and nappies. I put on the record my appreciation for the work of my electorate office staff. We did have a lot of calls on the office and they worked tirelessly in order to respond to concerns. They checked and found that baby supplies and like products remained on shelves in chemists. They were available when people desperately needed them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170904"></A>
I rang the disaster management group and kept in touch with police and emergency services. Replenishments were arranged within a day and major stores had also commenced restocking. Within days, things began to return to normal in Gladstone. Replenishment was organised, people just needed to be patient, and overwhelmingly they were. They also needed to keep in context that we had a shortage of food where other townships, like those in the areas in the Lockyer and in Hinchinbrook, did not have shelves to put food on. It was important to keep our situation in perspective. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170906"></A>
As an indicator of the ingenuity of our locals, the store owners at Ubobo, isolated and with supplies significantly dwindling, organised restocking through cooperation with QR and the use of a road-rail vehicle. Their tenacity paid off. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170907"></A>
As soon as the flooding started at Theodore, a Gladstone group started a collection. They set up in the NRG car park. NRG is a power generation plant and they were incredibly generous with their facilities. My contact was Ros and this team worked tirelessly to pack containers with food, clothing and other items to go over to that decimated community. I know they received so much from the community to put into those containers. They went not only to Theodore but also to other parts of the state as the tragedy unfolded. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1170908"></A>
My community has also joined so many across this nation to help those devastated. After the flooding my office--and I know other members have mentioned this and I believe it is the same group--was contacted by Hannah’s Foundation and asked to be a receiving venue for school items. People responded and it was my privilege to take those donations to Rockhampton. There were school supplies for children in that area who had lost all of their back-to-school items. I thank all those who donated and Hannah’s Foundation for swiftly taking action. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1176190"></A>
There have been fundraising events, small and large, across the electorate. On 5 March we will have the mayor’s ball. Each fundraising event is greatly appreciated. I put out a call for toys and items to go up north for children under 12. After the first few days, we had to contact a local storage firm. I commend Kitty from Storage Choice who offered a shed free of charge. It is filling up fast and those toys will go to Cardwell, Tully and other areas north in the next fortnight. I thank all of those who have donated. I believe that if you can give the little kids something that they can hug and cuddle or some toys that they can play with it gives mum and dad a bit of a free hand to be able to do the jobs that are very difficult with a little one around your feet. There is nothing like having a doll to hug or a teddy to cuddle or pull its ears off or whatever. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1176198"></A>
I am sure some members here, like me, received emails from a resident at Dalby outlining actions taken against a number of residents in that area who were endeavouring to assist in the emergency they faced. I forwarded the email to government to have the allegations investigated. If only one allegation has substance, it is bitterly disappointing. We have all stood in this chamber rightly outlining the ingenuity of individuals and communities in coming together and lending each other a helping hand. The information in the email is in direct contrast to that ethos we so rightly are commending in this debate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1176201"></A>
When the time came to close the Hannah’s Foundation appeal and I drove through to Rocky, I took the opportunity to visit Depot Hill and the Port Curtis area, which are two localities amongst others which were inundated for a long period of time. The member for Rockhampton represents a diverse community and the people in these particular areas are doing it tough. While they face regular inundation, they do bounce back. It is unfortunate that some comments were made about their motives for not evacuating. These people are experienced in floods; sadly, they are also experienced in human nature and know that their properties, wet but not submerged, are attractive to looting and wanted to stay in their homes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1176203"></A>
Each speaker to date has spoken of the magnificent generosity of spirit of all who put their shoulder to the wheel during and after these floods and cyclone events. Overwhelmingly, Queenslanders and indeed Australians have worked to build and not tear down. The exception to that rule is the looters. They truly are the scum of the earth. There is no justification for their actions. In the ’74 floods, members of my family lived at Gailes. Les got up during the night and went outside and the water was around his ankles. He went back and woke up his wife, who is my sister, and said that they had to go. The water was then up to the door of their caravan, which was their home. By the time they waded out, the water was up to their thighs and it was only a matter of minutes. As the flood subsided, looters were diving into the creek and stealing anything of worth from the vans that had washed down the creek. The looters then were moral bankrupts and so are those who do it today.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1176206"></A>
My grandma was a kindly soul. I remember that the only thing she did not accept well was her grandsons walking around without their shirts on. She commented on that occasionally. However, it was seldom I heard her speak negatively, until an incident after she had made the decision to move into a nursing home--she would not come and live with us. One day, a pair of her stockings went missing after she had washed them. Her comment was this: ‘I hope when they’--that is the alleged thief--‘wear them they fall down right in front of everybody.’ That was as nasty as she got. In the same vein, I hope that those who have preyed on the misfortunes of others suffer a similar fate. May the TV they stole fail; may the furniture or items they felt they had a right to above the rights of those who were flooded be a constant reminder of their lack of personal morality. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1176208"></A>
While speaking of moral vacuums, I must bring to the condolence motion the feelings of many in relation to insurance companies. To those companies which in the very fine print define, deceive and split hairs over what constitutes a flood, you are putting your trusting clients through hell. Many sit and wait for hydrological reports which could take months. That is not what clients signed up for. The message I bring to you is this: ‘Say what you mean, mean what you say. If you cover flood, cover it and be done with it.’ People take out insurance and pay premiums year in and year out with the expectation that at their time of greatest need they will not be required to argue, justify and defend their expectations. To those companies which are acting true to their word, thankyou. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1176209"></A>
There are several other matters my community wishes me to raise--issues of infrastructure for the community in light of our strategic importance, but it is more appropriate to raise them during debate on the Reconstruction Authority Bill. However, it was significant that both the Premier and the Prime Minister landed in Gladstone as a base to inspect damaged areas around us. I support the community’s view. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1176210"></A>
I commend the Premier for her role in disseminating information to Queenslanders. Her calm, informed and compassionate leadership was both essential and appreciated. Those in the team also providing briefings and directions to discrete communities are commended too. ABC Radio must also be commended for their continuous coverage of events across the state as they unfolded. I cannot recall that they had anyone standing up to their knees in floodwaters for effect, but the information they provided was critical for families and communities who were otherwise isolated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1176213"></A>
There is so much more which could be said. People’s homes will be rebuilt, roads will be patched and bridges will be repaired. Fridges and lounges will be replaced and life will return to some form of normality. Healing, however, takes much longer. Some scars will remain, with the loss of children, loss of partners and loss of parents. Those experiences will be indelibly etched in the minds and hearts of those affected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1176214"></A>
As the rebuilding continues, we must remember those so deeply affected and continue for some time to provide support, counsel and care to them. We are a unique people. We are a blessed nation. We are facing adversity, but with continued strength we will rebuild. For those most affected, we must remain sensitive, aware and available. I support this motion.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Gaven--LNP) (8.36 pm): Queensland in the last month faced one of its greatest challenges in its relatively short 200-year history and 150 years as a state. We are a big country with a big heart, but for too many Queenslanders there were not enough tears that could be shed to share their pain when nature rose up and threw itself upon our quiet contentment.</Hansard-Body>

We on the Gold Coast were spared much of this terrible suffering endured by so many other Queenslanders. I know that all Gold Coasters want to express their collective grief. The majority actively wanted to help and many actively did so all over the state. They have raised millions of dollars at a variety of events, including a massive event at Tedder Avenue on Main Beach. I congratulate Ms Katie Page and her family and Ian Vasileski for their initiative in doing so. Katie is a St George girl with her sisters and she has never forgotten that. To all the others who ran many other events, I thank you all. All of that money went to the Premier’s fund and we all dearly hope those funds are spent wisely and promptly and no-one is discriminated against. I share a commonly held view that the means test is set far too low and it denies many fairness in accessing funds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1176225"></A>
I would also like to thank all Gold Coasters who gave generously to the care baskets that were distributed widely across the state. My wife Susie is the councillor for Surfers Paradise. With Councillor Margaret Grummitt, Councillor Jan Grew and Mayor Ron Clarke, they shipped nearly 180 tonnes to all communities, including Brisbane, Ipswich and its surrounds, the Lockyer, Toowoomba, Oakey, Dalby, Miles, Condamine and Theodore. The Gold Coast has adopted Theodore--it is somewhat similar to those people from Gladstone--as their town for ongoing assistance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1176232"></A>
To Don Kirker of Allspan Constructions and his driver, Barry Hallam, who supplied the B-double that carried all these goods to the west, I thank you very dearly. To the Gold Coast Muslim community and Goss transport, I thank you for your great efforts in transporting a lot of these new donated goods. To Bruce Chater, who is the doctor in Theodore, and all the families of Theodore and the surrounding district, I dearly hope that my family’s gift to you gives you many years of comfort and care when your health is compromised. It will be an enduring legacy from us all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1176234"></A>
To all those in regional Queensland, we particularly want to say that we do not forget you and we appreciate your resilience and perseverance. Our state’s fortunes are partially dependent on you and in times of crisis we will never abandon you. I hope this was the message conveyed to all. I especially want to thank Peter Woodhouse, his wife Kim and all their staff from their business at Woodhouse Removals for their packing, storing and transporting of a whole integrated surgery to make this happen in Theodore. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

To Gary Kershaw and Ken of Caloundra Removals: I dearly thank you as well. To Parkwood Rotary and Hot Tomato radio station on the Gold Coast for assisting my wife, Susie, in the mattress campaign, trying to get new mattresses for all of these communities: I thank you. The business of Making Mattresses from my electorate in Nerang has supplied new mattresses to many of those in Goodna, Redbank and parts of Ipswich. I want to thank it very sincerely.</Hansard-Body>

I, like all members, am a very proud Queenslander and feel blessed to have been born in Australia. The great challenges that this country imposes on us all as citizens are nothing compared to that which the country gives back. I am sure that this is the true message that Dorothea Mackellar wanted to send with her ‘sunburnt country’ poem. I had the great privilege of being able to give back during the most recent floods in Queensland. By great virtue of opportunity, training, friendship, family and good fortune, I was able to make a small personal contribution as well as a financial one from my wife and family. I could only do this because everyday people in Australia are able to do so. This is the great privilege of being born in this country.</Hansard-Body>

This was a one-in-100-year event--whatever that 100 years is--and every one of the 4.5 million Queenslanders really needed to do something for their fellow Queenslanders immediately and to keep doing it. I think many really did so. I offered my services to those in Central Queensland communities, in whatever role they wished me to play. I thank the health minister, Paul Lucas; the member for Bundamba, Jo-Ann Miller, who is here with us tonight; the Premier; Stephen Beckett, her deputy chief of staff; Director-General Mick Reid; Steven Waller, the regional health director in Rockhampton; the member for Gregory, my great friend Vaughan Johnson, who was here earlier; Inspector Mick Keys, who is in charge of the regional area; and the communities of Longreach, Blackall, Jericho and Alpha for helping me to assist those families in the Central Highlands region who at the time of the floods needed medical care at a very crucial time. Many others certainly volunteered their services as well. I acknowledge all of them and I congratulate them all for helping Queenslanders in what was a very dark period.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181857"></A>
In conclusion I would ask you all to consider the plight of the twice flooded town of Jericho in the Central Highlands region. It is a town of 130 very needy people for whom everyday life is a great challenge. They have absolutely nothing and have been somewhat forgotten. They got flooded twice. With the second flood they lost absolutely everything of what little they had when they returned to their homes. Amidst all of the chaos and confusion of those who attract greater attention, we are often judged more by what we do for those who can least help themselves. Appropriately, Jericho, with its biblical historical links, might be one place to judge whether we have truly mastered the task of rebuilding and recovery in Queensland.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110216_204204" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Sunnybank--ALP) (8.42 pm): Most of my electorate of Sunnybank was fortunately unaffected by the flood inundation experienced by many of our neighbouring electorates. However, I do have residents in areas of Archerfield and Acacia Ridge, where people experienced inundation throughout their homes. There is a mix of residences in Granard Road, Gladstone Street, Rocklea Street, Beatty Street and Gregory Street. Some of these homes are owned and occupied by pensioners and the aged. These people have found themselves living in a shell of a house with very little furniture and clothing. The main thing I am finding as I go around to visit them is the very stoic resilience of these people. They do not feel sorry for themselves; they believe that they are lucky. It has been my experience that the poorest people believe that there are others who are worse off than they are. I find that I almost have to pry to get them to let me know what they need us as a community to do for them.</A></Hansard-Body>

Prior to the floods these people were the self-sufficient in our society, having paid off their homes when they were younger when this area comprised market gardens and the like and it was not the busy commercial area it is today. These people do not have the money to relocate and, as they live on a pension, they do not have funds to go to the shops and replace their lost furniture, clothing and personal belongings, not to mention food items and other grocery items such as washing powder, cleaning products, insect spray and the list goes on. They are most grateful for the emergency money that they have received, but this money has long been spent on cleaning products and other necessities such as the purchase of a new fridge or stove.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181866"></A>
Other residents--we cannot forget these, either--are those who live in rental properties. These people have also lost all of their belongings. As this is an area where it is reasonably cheap to rent, most of these residents did not have any kind of insurance and they have lost all of their personal belongings and furniture. They have nowhere else to go. They rely on the property owners to carry out repairs, and I have to say that, from speaking to these people, some of the owners of these properties have been absolutely marvellous and done the right thing. They have forgone rent and got in there and cleaned up the properties very quickly and installed new kitchens, walls et cetera. However, other rental property owners have not been so forthcoming and have caused their tenants much grief.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181867"></A>
However, the majority of these people are also very humble. They have told me that the best thing I could do for them is to look out for their elderly neighbours who are not able to look after themselves. I want these people to know that, even though their numbers are not big, I will not forget them. I, along with my electorate office staff, will continue to do whatever I can to lobby for a fair deal for them. In fact, most of these people do want to stay in their homes, whether it is a rental property or their own personal home. However, there are a few residents who are homeowners who would like to have a buyback by the council or some other body because they have been through the 1974 floods and now they have been through this one and they really cannot tolerate it anymore.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181871"></A>
One really poignant couple who I have spent some time with are the Walczuks. The daughter lives at 39 Granard Road and her mum, who is in her 80s, lives at 58 Granard Road. Both of them have had their houses dreadfully inundated by the flood and they are looking for buybacks, the daughter by Main Roads--and I am going to make representations on her behalf to see if we can have that happen--and the mother by the council if that is possible. We will make representations on their behalf. Clearly, there are so many people who have been entirely traumatised by this flood that they simply cannot return to these properties, and I find that more significantly in aged people who are beyond 80 years of age.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181873"></A>
Another group of people who deserve mention--and there are a lot of them in my electorate at Acacia Ridge--are the businesspeople who lost power for over two weeks and simply could not undertake any business activities because they did not have sufficient generators or, if they did have generators, they were not enough to power their computers or the other things they needed to conduct their business. There are a lot of large businesses in Acacia Ridge that are head offices for a lot of smaller businesses throughout Queensland. When you take out head office, you take out the small business wherever it is throughout the state. There are also a lot of small businesses in Acacia Ridge that simply could not operate for the two weeks that they lost power. While we have spent a lot of time in this House talking about individuals--and certainly we should do that because they are so powerfully affected--we should also acknowledge that the businesses of Queensland have done it tough this year by losing their income for two weeks and they are trying to get back on their feet now.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181874"></A>
I am very fortunate to proudly declare that the electorate of Sunnybank is a multicultural electorate of Queensland. Our multicultural groups have been incredibly proactive in fundraising. The Taiwanese community has already given a cheque for over $100,000, and I am advised that it is going to double that. There is significantly more to come from it. For example, the Sunnybank RSL and the Queensland Chinese Forum held a fundraising dinner at short notice and it ended up raising more than $40,000. The Islamic community has also been actively fundraising. It tells me that it has so far raised over $100,000. But it is not stopping there, and I am sure we are going to see a lot more from that very generous community. The Islamic community is also very organised in terms of having its own thrift and charity shops and has collected a lot of household items to distribute to people.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181878"></A>
The community from the Spanish Centre at Acacia Ridge has also raised over $3,000. No-one asked these people to contribute; they did this because they wanted to help out their fellow Queenslanders. Besides the multicultural community, though, the rest of my electorate has been very active in its fundraising. For example, the people at Iceworld at Acacia Ridge have raised over $6,000. Yesterday I visited Pro Honda at Rocklea, which itself experienced inundation and was out of business for two weeks during the blackouts, and director Paul Peterson handed me a cheque for over $6,000 from a fundraising event it has held. The wonderful community at the Southside Sport and Community Club has handed in more than $30,000 to the Premier’s welfare appeal.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181922"></A>
Another group, Appliances Online--one of Australia’s largest online appliance and whitegoods retailers--started fundraising via their Facebook fans and donated more than $80,000 to the appeal. I know many residents have personally given to the flood relief effort. Just yesterday, one of my staff was at the local bank waiting to be served and the people in front just walked up to the counter and handed over $500 to the fund to assist the disaster victims. I am sure that over the past two days members have reflected on what a great country we live in when there is so much generosity from everyone we meet.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181924"></A>
We all have tales of wonderful community stalwart volunteer efforts. The people in my electorate who were inundated are very grateful to the volunteers who came to them in the days after the flood and without asking just made their lives so much easier by bringing in their gernis and their backhoes and their trucks and cleaning up their house for them. I know that it is always dangerous to nominate individuals, but I will nominate one tonight and that is Myrna Stevens. She is a wonderful stalwart in the Sunnybank Hills community. As soon as the problems that people would experience were apparent, Myrna and her band of helpers, mostly from the Neighbourhood Watch, set about baking fruitcakes. After first experiencing much frustration on being told that these cakes would not be used at the evacuation centres because of health regulations, they decided to offer these cakes to volunteers in the clean-up effort. Along with the people of the Acacia Ridge neighbourhood centre, they drove around the clean-up areas and offered the hardworking volunteers a piece of fruitcake, a piece of fruit and a drink and they could not keep up with their supplies. Myrna also set up her home as a collection centre for donations and then personally delivered those donations to people in need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181928"></A>
The need does not stop. In the past two days I have been visiting all of the people in my electorate who had been inundated. They still need assistance. Some of them need assistance with insurance companies. Some of them need assistance with their landlords. Some of them still need basic furniture items for their homes--things like wardrobes, lounges, bedside tables and mirrors; simply things that they do not have. But still no-one complains and still I have many generous organisations in my electorate who will continue to work on fulfilling those needs for the people in my area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181929"></A>
Last but not least, I wish to thank the local volunteers who presented themselves at the Macgregor State High School and other centres to assist people who they had never even met clean up their property. Many others gave their services to relatives and friends in need. As I said yesterday, I have two sisters in Yeronga--one at The Corso and another one close to it who were both affected and inundated by the floods. I have relatives in Grantham who were also affected. I think in these times we help our own. We look after our family and we look after our friends and that is what Queenslanders have done for the past few months. I think we have come out of this disaster as a wonderful, caring community. I think we have harnessed the great tank of goodwill in our society. Hopefully, in the months ahead, as some people experience frustration and some people want to change their lives and some people want to rebuild their lives just the way they were, we can deliver good outcomes for each and every one of those people. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Barron River--ALP) (8.52 pm): I am very grateful to have the opportunity to place on the record on behalf of the people of my electorate their sympathy and condolences to the family and friends of those who have perished in the floods and cyclones in what has been described as Queensland’s summer of sorrow. For those of us throughout Queensland and the nation who have never lost family or friends or homes or personal possessions to the forces of nature, we cannot really know the loss and the grief, but we share it and understand it. In this place we have only words at our disposal to express our thoughts. As well as adding my personal condolences to those on whose behalf I speak tonight, I particularly want to express my sympathy to the families and friends of those who are to this day still missing. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1181938"></A>
Like most people outside the areas directly affected, I watched the disaster of the floods unfold on television and as the days passed our summer of sorrow cast its pall across vast swathes of our vast state. I join with all of those honourable members who have already spoken to this motion in thanking all of those people who have supported and who are continuing to support flood and now cyclone ravaged communities. Many of them travelled from all parts of the state and indeed from around the nation and even from overseas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181939"></A>
I specifically want to thank my constituents and all of those people from Far North Queensland who left their families and joined the preparation, rescue, relief and reconstruction effort. I also wish to thank everyone who has raised funds and donated to the Premier’s Disaster Relief Appeal and take this opportunity to remind everyone that the need for donations is not over and that we must continue to see the total climb well beyond its latest tally, which today reached $215,925,456. This appeal fund is all the more important now that it will also help the victims of Cyclone Yasi as well as the floods. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181941"></A>
Just as the floodwaters began to recede and the recovery and reconstruction effort began to gear up, along came Cyclone Anthony, closely followed by Cyclone Yasi. In speaking about the impacts of the cyclones in my community, I hope that these words will be understood in the context of the great personal losses that have been sustained throughout Queensland. Most people will say that their losses are insignificant compared to those of others, yet it is important to acknowledge that these events have affected people across the state directly and indirectly in a wide variety of ways. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181942"></A>
Cyclone Yasi was the largest and most powerful cyclone in living memory. It menaced communities between Cooktown and Mackay before crossing the coast in the very early hours of Wednesday, 3 February 2011. As the cyclone approached the Queensland coast, by Tuesday the impact zone was looking more likely to include the city of Cairns. By Wednesday morning, Cyclone Yasi had been upgraded to a category 5 storm and the warnings of very destructive winds were coupled with warnings of a powerful and destructive storm surge. A storm surge has particular significance for thousands of people who live in low-lying coastal suburbs, towns and villages that are vulnerable to inundation. In that category in my electorate are the communities of Machans Beach, Holloways Beach, Yorkeys Knob, Trinity Park, Trinity Beach, Kewarra Beach, Clifton Beach and Palm Cove. Thousands of people heeded the advice of authorities and applied precautionary common sense and evacuated to the homes of family and friends on higher ground. Many, including newcomers without established connections and large numbers of tourists, sought refuge in the three designated shelters in my electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181952"></A>
One such shelter is located at Redlynch State School and it is a new sports hall and gymnasium that incorporates additional design features that enables its use as a cyclone shelter. This dual-purpose facility demonstrates well how new public infrastructure can, and in appropriate circumstances should, be adapted for use as cyclone shelters. But these measures are expensive. Upgrading the facility for this dual purpose added some $2 million to the cost. Among the many amazing stories to emerge from these events was one at this very shelter where, as the cyclone was wreaking havoc outside, a baby was born. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181953"></A>
I visited these shelters shortly after they opened on Wednesday morning and again after the cyclone had passed on Thursday morning. Although Cairns was spared the destruction that was visited upon our friends to the south, the anxiety and fear was very evident on the faces and in the voices of the people as Cyclone Yasi approached, just as the relief was equally evident once the danger had passed. I would like to thank everyone who supervised the evacuation centres and shelters and commend those who took shelter for their good humour and cooperation in trying and stressful circumstances.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1181954"></A>
Cyclone Yasi’s destructive winds and associated storm surge has devastated Tully, Mission Beach and Cardwell and many other towns and villages in surrounding areas. Its destructive power has caused damage from Cairns to Townsville and for hundreds of kilometres inland as well. Homes, farms, businesses and public infrastructure have all been damaged or destroyed. The damage bill is huge and rising and the task of community recovery and rebuilding is massive. Some 200,000 households lost power yet, as we have heard today, within a week 180,000 had been reconnected. Today, nearly two weeks later, 7,421 people are still without power. Power at my home was out for just a few days and in that short time you become very conscious of how much we rely on electricity for our basic needs, let alone comfort and convenience. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187609"></A>
I would especially like to thank the workers in Energex and Ergon who have worked so hard and so effectively to restore power to our flood and cyclone affected communities. I think it is also important to acknowledge that the timely and forceful warnings of the threat posed by Yasi, the evacuation of people from their homes in the impact zone and the thorough and effective preparation carried out by people explains why there were no fatalities as a direct result of wind or storm surge. There is no doubt that these measures saved lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187610"></A>
I want to conclude my remarks by just making some comments about the Cairns Base Hospital. The Cairns Base Hospital and the Cairns Private Hospital were both evacuated prior to Cyclone Yasi. This was a sensible and wise precaution made for many valid reasons and a decision I fully support. However, with the winds barely passed some people, including the Leader of the Opposition, say we should put the brakes on the redevelopment of the Cairns Base Hospital. He is wrong. The redevelopment of the Cairns Base Hospital is critical to the delivery of more health services for our community. Stopping work on that redevelopment would mean delaying vital services for Cairns. It would mean not opening the final stage of the emergency department expansion, which we will open before the middle of this year. It would mean not delivering the vital cancer services that we as a community have fought so hard for. Cairns needs the hospital redevelopment to proceed full steam ahead. I am determined to deliver on what we promised: more services sooner for Cairns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187611"></A>
The current redevelopment means that we are delivering real services for people in Cairns now. Already the redevelopment has delivered a cardiac catheterisation laboratory, a brand-new car park, a brand-new community health facility, additional chemotherapy chairs, a paediatric chair and a new MRI suite. This means that right now more than 200 patients a year requiring treatment for heart conditions such as interventional cardiology are receiving it locally. By the middle of this year most of those requiring cancer care treatment will get it in Cairns, not Townsville or Brisbane. There will be 340 patients a year who will be able to obtain this treatment locally. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187612"></A>
But I know there are genuine concerns in the community about what will happen if another Yasi comes and hits Cairns square on. There are worries that a storm surge worse than that we experienced with Yasi might render the emergency department inaccessible for days. I have spoken with the health minister about these matters and about the evacuation of the Cairns Base Hospital. I have emphasised to him that the people need certainty that good solid contingency plans are in place in case the worst happens next time. The health minister has assured me that the lessons of Yasi will be learned, Queensland Health will ensure that future service planning has regard to the lessons of Yasi and that hospital design in the future continues to have regard to the best way to house all the most essential services having regard to the vagaries of our climate in Tropical North Queensland. I will continue those discussions with the Deputy Premier and the Minister for Health and with the Cairns and hinterland health team. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187613"></A>
These dual disasters are an immense challenge for the people in the affected communities and indeed for all Queenslanders and the nation. We will rise to that challenge and, despite the damage and devastation, Queensland will be an even better place to live and an even better place to visit.<Hansard-Speech-End>

(9.03 pm): I rise to support the motion of condolence for Queensland natural disaster victims and to pass on the sympathies of the people of the Sandgate electorate. I also pass on a message from so many of my constituents who wanted to thank the Premier for her calm and dedicated leadership throughout what seemed a never-ending stream of natural disasters. I acknowledge all the hardworking Bureau of Meteorology and Emergency Service workers who worked tirelessly to keep us safe and the members of the Queensland parliament who worked night and day for their constituents. I spent some time helping the member for Mount Ommaney and visiting many of her residents. I was amazed at the member’s energy, dedication and passion for her constituents. I heard some dreadful stories. I met folk in Oxley who had water over their roof gutters. I met folk who stood in houses like skeletons but said to me, ‘I’m okay. You’d better go and check on my neighbour.’</Hansard-Body>

Like most people I had family and friends in flood zones and in Cyclone Yasi’s hit zones and spent sleepless nights following the news and reports from my Twitter and Facebook friends, but nothing can compare to living through the terrifying floods and howling cyclonic winds. Last year my community lived through the trauma of losing a child. Just yesterday I attended the anniversary mass for St Patrick’s student, Elliot Fletcher, whose young life ended tragically on 15 February 2010. I can only encourage Queensland communities who have experienced the trauma of losing loved ones to stick together, talk to each other and let others help you. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187621"></A>
In October last year residents in the suburb of Deagon in my electorate experienced flooding as a result of the combined forces of heavy rains and a king tide so we took the flood warnings very seriously and people in flood prone areas prepared for the worst. Luckily, we were mostly spared, with some minor flooding at Pine Rivers our main impact. However, we watched in amazement as evidence of the devastation further inland washed out into Moreton Bay. Water tanks, outdoor furniture, pontoons, trees, wildlife and bits and pieces of people’s lives found their way onto the beaches of Shorncliffe, Sandgate and Brighton. It was quite a sad sight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187622"></A>
I thank and congratulate the hundreds of volunteers who cleaned up the bay and the beaches and joined the mud army of volunteers in the suburbs of Brisbane. Our local councillors, Victoria Newton and Amanda Cooper, did a great job coordinating volunteers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187623"></A>
Finally, I would like to thank and congratulate the many local community organisations and individuals who contributed to the many charity drives for toiletries, school stationery and cash for those whose lives had been turned upside down. We have had some very innovative fundraisers in my electorate: yoga on the Shorncliffe Pier; a tattoo day that I went to but I didn’t get a tattoo; and a netball competition just to name a few. I am particularly proud of the work of many of my service clubs, businesses, sports clubs, schools and churches who answered my call for help to put on the Flood Relief Fair at the Sandgate PCYC last Sunday. The Bracken Ridge Central Lions Club, with the very energetic Sharon O’Sullivan at the helm, jumped at the chance to help raise funds for the Premier’s Disaster Relief Fund and put in hours of hard work to make the fair a huge success. We raised just under $10,000. I trust that that cash in the hands of people who live in the towns destroyed by Yasi or submerged by floodwaters can be spent locally to rebuild lives and help businesses get back on their feet. I know that all levels of government will pull out all stops to get services and facilities back in order and I have faith in the people of Queensland to help others and help themselves through the stormy days and back into the sunshine. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(9.07 pm): It is with both gravity and urgency that the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill has come before this House. It establishes the Reconstruction Authority through the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Act 2011. It amends a number of acts: the Building Act 1975, the Disaster Management Act 2003, the Integrity Act 2009, the Land Valuation Act 2010, the Public Service Act 2008 and the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971. </Hansard-Body>

The LNP will be supporting this bill. We need to rebuild our state as quickly and effectively as possible. The official process starts here with this bill. I have reservations about the bill and the bureaucracy contained within it, but as a parliament we need to show Queenslanders that the recovery from disasters is underway. Soon the LNP shadow minister for flood recovery, the honourable member for Redlands, will make his contribution to the bill. I am proud to have appointed the member for Redlands to this important task. In my opinion it is lamentable that the Premier did not think it appropriate to dedicate a minister to the cause. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187637"></A>
As leader I want to rise today and give hope to all Queenslanders that we will support the rebuilding of our communities, the reconstruction of our infrastructure and the rebooting of our industries and economies. I want to tell Queenslanders that their parliament recognises the problems and the trauma they have endured but we are also committed to building a stronger, safer state. We recognise the urgency in getting the reconstruction and recovery of Queensland underway. In offering our bipartisan support for this bill we acknowledge that there will be improvements or refinements that could be suggested to the process. </Hansard-Body>

The magnitude of the recent flooding across our state was immense. As we have heard over the last couple of days, it is estimated that over 70 per cent of our state was impacted by flooding. Tragically, 35 people died and three people remain missing as a result. As our great state was still cleaning up after being inundated by floodwater, North Queensland was battered by Cyclone Yasi. This massive category 5 cyclone unfortunately claimed another life. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1193223"></A>
Over the last two days members have recounted harrowing tales of tragedy and survival experienced in their electorates. We have heard tales of hope, tales of heroism, tales of luck and tales of humour. More tragically, there have also been tales of loss and tales of heartbreak. Now is the time for Queensland to join together to rebuild--to rebuild the houses, the businesses, the infrastructure and, most importantly, the lives of people who lost so much at the hands of flooding and cyclones in recent months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1193225"></A>
Many words have been used to describe the floods that have damaged and distressed our state in the last few months. There are, however, too few words that can capture the tragedy adequately. The hurt and horror caused by these disasters will linger for a long time to come. There were cases of unbelievable and incomprehensible devastation, with lives lost and communities torn apart. There were people who saw their lifetime’s belongings and mementos destroyed and lost. There were people who lost livelihoods--businesses they had put years of effort and toil into. The stories of heartache go on and on--economic pain caused by damage or isolation, material and property loss and, above all, trauma and psychological pain. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1193226"></A>
As I said yesterday, no Queenslander could be unmoved by the footage of the tragedy as it unfolded in Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley. No-one could comprehend the scale of the flooding as, one by one, our major centres and our small towns succumbed to the water. Across the state there are people hurt by floods and cyclones, people who have lost everything to the water and the wind. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1193227"></A>
The trauma will be borne acutely by those who lived through the disaster, but it is shared by all Queenslanders. We have heard that over the last couple of days, with almost every member speaking on behalf of their electorates, showing that this experience has been shared by all Queenslanders. There are people who rely on stalled or stuttering industries for employment and food on their tables. There are businesses sustaining losses and community organisations rebuilding their own premises at the same time as helping others. There are people who helped their neighbours and those who helped strangers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1193228"></A>
We cannot forget the impact that the events of December, January and early this month have had on anyone. These are exemplary, everyday Queenslanders. Now the responsibility is to ensure that the damage from the disasters is limited and that the support, assistance and recovery processes are started as quickly and as effectively as they can be. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1193229"></A>
I want to turn now to industry impacts. The damage to industry and business is massive and not limited to those who had water through their doors or experienced floods. The impact of this summer will be felt for some time by our small businesses, major industries and taxpayers as our economy recovers. Queensland’s three major industries--tourism, mining and agriculture--as well as our small businesses were all hard hit. Many small businesses which closed because of damage or staff shortages have had to bear the loss and some continue to do so as they await rebuilding or the return of customers. Some are unexpectedly casualties of the flooding. A simple example, the Nindigully Pub, illustrates the impact on a business which is miles away from the floodwaters but which is still bearing the cost as a result of road closures and blocked access. However, it is not eligible for government assistance. Other businesses that were not flooded lost their stock in transit--a write-off for the business. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1193232"></A>
As I travel the state I see many communities who rely on tourism. They have been hard hit in recent months. Priority needs to be given to ensuring that these tourism enterprises receive urgent assistance and rebuilding. However, most of the tourism industry is still operating. They will receive no assistance or handouts, but their income over this peak season has been decimated as visitors either defer their visit or change their itinerary in the mistaken belief that Queensland is closed. We must get the message out that most of Queensland’s celebrated tourism industry is open for business. Much of this industry is small business and is hurting badly. Red tape is a recurring theme for businesses and a very real threat to their viability. The Reconstruction Authority will have a real role to play in clearing the hurdles bureaucracy puts in the path of reconstruction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1193235"></A>
Our major export industry, mining, has been badly hit. As we heard reported today, about 13 per cent of our mines are now operative. Mines have been flooded and road and rail connections to export markets have also been cut. The loss of export income and royalties will hurt our economy and state budget for some time to come. In addition, this industry is a major employer of Queenslanders, both directly and indirectly. As well as that, our farming industry has been hard hit, with crop and livestock losses. Furthermore, the loss of infrastructure such as fencing will take substantial time to recover. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1193236"></A>
Let us have a look at infrastructure. It can be argued that the biggest challenge of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority will be rebuilding our infrastructure. Our road and rail networks are so critical for our economy and our lifestyles. Over a quarter of our road network has been impacted and will need repair or rebuilding. Key sections of our rail lines have been cut. The most prominent example is the rail line to Toowoomba along which so much material is transported to the port of Brisbane. This is expected to be closed until April as a result of the flash flooding which claimed so many lives. Our water, sewerage, electricity and other public utility infrastructure has in many cases been swept away. The Queensland Reconstruction Authority will have a huge task in overseeing the rebuilding of this state. The LNP will support the rebuilding task. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1193239"></A>
The main aim of this recovery must not be just to return Queensland to normal operation but also to prepare our state for future extreme events. Queensland is a state of droughts and flooding rains. Unfortunately, for too long this government has failed to prepare. In the last budget we saw that the state was facing an $84 billion debt. This is the government that sent Queensland bust in a boom. But despite this spending spree, this government did little, if anything, to prepare our state for flooding. The government emptied our coffers but did not invest in the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1193240"></A>
After Cyclone Larry, then Premier Beattie promised to prepare for the future. There were grand promises about cyclone shelters, summits and other practical steps to cyclone proof our state. The question is: what have we seen since then? The answer is: little, if anything. Once the priority had passed, the media had moved on and memories were forgotten, we saw the government quietly walk away from real action to prepare for the next event. I implore the government: let us not waste this chance. The Reconstruction Authority has a real chance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1193243"></A>
I turn to the nature of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. This Reconstruction Authority was originally set up in response to the devastating floods that Queensland experienced during December 2010 and January this year. The LNP supports the expansion of the responsibilities of this authority to encompass the devastation wrought by Cyclone Yasi. The authority is being established to manage and coordinate the government’s program of infrastructure reconstruction and recovery within disaster affected communities. Under this bill, the authority is granted substantial powers to carry out this role. These powers are modelled on the powers of the Coordinator-General and the ULDA. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1193248"></A>
Many questions remain regarding the nature, role and responsibilities of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. The role of the authority is broad ranging and has a lot of parameters as yet undefined. The authority will be responsible for deciding priorities for community infrastructure and services required in the recovery of communities. The process that the authority will use to communicate with communities and other decision makers to establish these priorities is a question mark at this stage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198859"></A>
There is a general function, without definition, to work with the communities to ensure communities’ needs are recognised. In a broad sense, the authority is responsible for flood mitigation, community protection and rebuilding, expedition of regulatory approvals and setting the priorities for community infrastructure and services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198862"></A>
The manner in which it will undertake these functions is not yet fully evident. Information must be collected and collated about infrastructure and other property damaged or otherwise affected in the disaster event, and data sharing which facilities flood mitigation, protection, rebuilding and recovery of communities must be implemented across all levels of government. Yet, at the same time, the authority has overriding powers which allow it to make decisions, extract information and establish processes without the agreement or assent of other entities such as local government. Penalties accompany noncompliance with many of these powers, which strengthens the need for the powers to be used with restraint and transparency. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198863"></A>
The authority will also have responsibility for ensuring the recovery facilitates flood mitigation, taking responsibility for the longstanding neglect under this government. The board will have power over the authority in that its strategic priorities will be enacted through the authority. The minister--the Premier--will also have a lot of oversight and intervention powers over the authority. The authority will, as asked, advise the minister about putting into effect the recommendations of the commission of inquiry. These recommendations are only accorded the status of ‘possible implementation’ which, in itself, potentially diminishes the standing of the commission. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198864"></A>
The minister may give the authority a written direction about the performance of its functions or exercise of its powers. The minister can declare a project for proposed development to be a declared project if it is to be undertaken in a disaster affected area of the state or it is necessary for flood mitigation or rebuilding purposes. The minister can prepare a regulation to declare a reconstruction area. For projects the minister deems critical or essential for state economic, environmental or social reasons, the minister can declare a critical infrastructure project. The authority may, with the minister’s approval, give a step-in notice to a decision maker and applicant to state that the authority is making an assessment and a decision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198865"></A>
I want to turn now to the matter of the responsible minister. The rebuilding of Queensland will be an enormous task. It is not one to be taken lightly but fast-tracked with action taking community needs and views into account. Under this legislation, the responsible minister has a substantial workload that is highly time critical, including directions, declarations, regulations, submissions, approvals and amendments. The lack of a unique minister dedicated to this portfolio is alarming. Rather than devoting a minister to the sole task of rebuilding our state, the Premier has chosen to swallow up this responsibility to sit alongside numerous other duties. To manage the recovery properly there needs to be a minister who is the driving force behind the reconstruction without concentration being diverted elsewhere. There needs to be a focus purely and simply on getting the job done, with as little bureaucracy as possible and without diversions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198868"></A>
Flood recovery and reconstruction after Cyclone Yasi will not be a task for a couple of months but for many years to come. It is a full-time requirement that needs to balance many factors to ensure the best possible outcomes for our communities and state. The Premier is already juggling her role as federal president of the ALP while undertaking a range of tasks as Premier. Where in that scheme of things will flood and cyclone victims come? What about ensuring Queensland is properly prepared for the next event, particularly once the media scrutiny has moved on, as it inevitably will? Too many times we have seen that this government is only interested as long as there is a hard hat involved, only to lose interest when the cameras are no longer focusing on them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198870"></A>
The LNP has recognised the need for long-term and real commitment to this recovery. To that end, we have moved swiftly to appoint the member for Redlands as the shadow minister for flood recovery. He will be assisted by Lawrence Springborg, the shadow minister for major projects, infrastructure, planning and trade; Mark McArdle, the shadow minister for health; Tim Nicholls, the shadow Treasurer and the member for Clayfield; and the honourable member for Maroochydore--in all those areas of health infrastructure, social infrastructure, economic infrastructure and transport infrastructure. This is to accord the flood victims and the reconstruction of affected areas the importance and attention they need and deserve into the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198873"></A>
I want to turn now to the matters of transparency and accountability. The authority will have substantial funds passing through its hands, will make decisions impacting on people’s lives and livelihoods, as well as determining what the government’s priorities will be. It is vital the Queensland Reconstruction Authority be open and transparent in its processes and reporting. It must be asked: what relationship will the authority have with departments? What role will cabinet have in overseeing the authority and its determinations on priorities? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198875"></A>
As the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements funds are both Commonwealth and Queensland government moneys, what controls will each government retain? What powers will the authority have to make decisions that impact on prior approvals and what compensation will be made available? What promise do we have that the funds from the Queensland government projects being rolled back for the recovery will actually be spent on flood recovery projects and not on just more Labor waste? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198877"></A>
The government has already claimed that the Abbot Point terminal proceeds and the 15 per cent public transport fare increase will go to fund the restoration of public infrastructure. As both of these were already scheduled, what acquittal will be provided so Queenslanders can be sure the funds will actually be spent on flood reconstruction? What about infrastructure not covered by NDRRA funding? Will the government give priority to this infrastructure? Will the authority be reporting publicly or to parliament on the numbers and types of progression notices and notices to decide? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198878"></A>
What if the state or local government agency fails to comply with a progression notice or a notice to decide? Will that be publicly reported? If the government issues a decision on a step-in notice against the written recommendation of a local government, will this be publicly disclosed? What guarantee will landholders subject to a deferred acquisition land order have that this order will not reduce their land valuation into the future as they can only sell to the government? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198880"></A>
The authority has stated that it would prefer to operate on the invitation of local government but has the power to override them. So the question is: what appeal rights will the local authority have? The authority’s jurisdiction only extends to areas impacted by the recent floods and/or Cyclone Yasi. Therefore, flood prone areas that were not affected will be unable to access the powers of the authority to pre-emptively act to improve their flood immunity. Instead, they will have to continue to fight their way through bureaucracy. What options to streamline this process will they have? These questions and many others need to be answered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198881"></A>
I want to turn now to flood mitigation and water management. The authority will also advise on the possible implementation of recommendations made by the commission of inquiry. The LNP has supported the establishment of this inquiry but believes it should be a comprehensive investigation of all matters related to the recent flooding in Queensland. The commission of inquiry needs to reflect on the impact these events have had on our communities and the state of the preparation and deliver answers to every Queenslander. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198882"></A>
To do the right thing by Queenslanders who were impacted, we need to make sure we do the best thing for our community and work to ensure that we get the answers and we make the difference. These are questions that need answering, and I fervently hope the commission of inquiry will deliver a report that shows us what went wrong and gives us a foundation to build on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1198883"></A>
Every town affected by flooding has its own set of circumstances. Some, as we have heard over the last couple of days, have been flooded regularly. For others, it was the twice repeated inundations and evacuations that exacerbated the heartache. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1210523"></A>
There has been speculation that there were water management issues which increased the impact of flooding in Brisbane. This, of course, will need to be a focus of the inquiry. It appears that the operating procedures at Wivenhoe Dam failed to keep pace with new technologies and wider developments, effectively reducing the capacity of the facility to react to major flooding events. There were warnings that Wivenhoe and Somerset did not meet the national guidelines for flood mitigation. It seems that this was gauged to be of little importance or urgency as the compliance deadline was set 25 years down the track. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1210530"></A>
At a time when we have seen an unprecedented $9 billion spent on our water infrastructure, including many white elephants, it is impossible to understand why improving flood mitigation at these dams was ignored. It would seem that capital works, which would increase the capacity of the dam for a comparatively low cost, were dismissed without further investigation, while the second stage of an upgrade at Wivenhoe was postponed for 15 to 20 years because of cost. Similarly, low-cost associated works to affected bridges could have improved regular release procedures. The spaghetti jumble of administration imposed by this government on water seems to have led to communication breakdowns and overly onerous bureaucracy, all at the expense of those in flood paths. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204532"></A>
Manuals are of little use if they fail to be practical or relevant. Chains of command are only effective if those at the top are contactable. Delivering forecasts of bad times ahead to the public is not the only job of governments in inclement weather. It appears that there was a long lead-in time to the very wet summer we experienced. It also appears that there was very little planning. An important lesson for the government if it chooses to learn is that panic reactions to crises are no match for planning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204533"></A>
Spending ever-increasing amounts of taxpayers’ dollars on ill-advised or unworkable projects does not protect the taxpayers from foreseeable events. Planning is the best weapon governments have. Constructive criticism is a good foundation for planning. It is to be hoped that the criticisms that will be aired over coming months will be noted and acted upon. Our side of the House will take the information seriously. Planning can also include placing flood emergency response rooms out of the path of flooding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204534"></A>
Release data from Wivenhoe Dam is very difficult to obtain in consistent and complete forms under this administration. Yet it would appear to be likely that this data will show a pattern of low releases from the dam at just the time when one would expect more urgency. Allowing a dam to fill from just over 100 per cent to nearly 150 per cent in the course of one weekend preceding a forecast that there will be a lot of rain over the catchment is sure to be an issue examined by the commission of inquiry. Similarly, releasing one-quarter of the dam’s capacity shortly before the Brisbane River began to break its banks is also a matter for consideration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204535"></A>
My hope is that the hardworking staff who operate our infrastructure are given better conditions in which to work--conditions in which they can act quickly and without impediment in the public interest, without the layers of bureaucracy and tiers of entities which at the moment confuse the processes and responsibilities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204537"></A>
I note that the government has taken the opportunity to roll back the recent swimming pool fencing laws for rentals not just in flooded areas but across our state. The LNP strongly supports the safety of our children around water. We were always concerned when this legislation was brought in that the implementation of the recent changes had been bungled and that landlords may be unable to comply in the short amount of time available before the laws took effect. I know that other members will have comments on that in their contributions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204538"></A>
The government is delaying land valuations by three months, from 31 March to 30 June, on the grounds of the impacts of the recent flooding. Whilst this may be the case, I cannot help but suspect that this is just an excuse as the recent introduction of a new land valuation process required the application of new valuation processes across Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204539"></A>
This bill represents the beginning of the official reconstruction but, more than that, it represents a promise to the people of Queensland--to the people who have lived through these disasters and the people who have lost so much. What they cannot afford to lose now is their trust in our parliament to rebuild their communities. We owe it to the community and these people to ensure the rebuilding is undertaken with practicality, efficiency and compassion. We owe it to Queensland to act quickly and well. Our communities deserve a response that will give them back the communities, facilities and infrastructure they lost, but also a response that provides them with optimism, provides them with hope and provides them with greater expectations for the future. I put on record my intention to pursue this bill’s implementation to ensure it best serves the community. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Constituents have strongly voiced their objections to receiving infringement notices on 26 January on the Burrum Coast in the Kinkuna National Park. The nature of the alleged traffic offence was ‘Failure to comply with official traffic sign--road closed no entry’.

Anyone who sees the picture can see why motorists are fed up and are ready to fight hard against the fines. The ‘road closed’ traffic sign was not erected in the correct manner and in accordance with the Department of Main Roads’s <Hansard-Italic>
Manual of uniform traffic control devices</Hansard-Italic>
, which states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1204554"></A>
The road closed sign shall be used where a roadway is closed to traffic. Barrier boards shall be erected across the roadway in conjunction with the sign and the bars should be aligned to point to the sign. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204555"></A>
This did not happen, so my constituents need to be let off from paying these infringements. It leads me to believe that this is just a money grab by the government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204556"></A>
The constituents charged discovered from the police that if the sign does not comply with the MUTCD then the sign does not exist. The people who have complained to me agree and are fighting these fines today. The DERM rangers who were on the day handing out the tickets admitted and confirmed that other motorists were as confused as they were as to the road closure signs. That begs the question: why did they not reassess the situation? They had confused motorists. Instead of reassessing the situation they just kept writing out tickets and acknowledging the confusion. When motorists asked why the road was open and had no barricades they said, ‘We didn’t want to put the signs across the road as hoons would just drive over them and we didn’t want them destroyed.’ So they have admitted with that statement that the road closure signs were done incorrectly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204557"></A>
As per the DERM’s website on 26 January 2011, only the Burrum Point camping area was closed. That is why motorists entered at the Kinkuna entrance. The road was not closed after all.</Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.37 pm): At the last sitting of parliament in 2010 it came to my attention that Canossa Aged Care Complex at Oxley would lose public palliative care beds. I immediately asked the Parliamentary Secretary for Health to investigate the matter with Queensland Health. After many telephone calls between me, the minister’s office and Queensland Health, I was advised that the Commonwealth funded QEII palliative beds would come online at the end of 2011. So it was decided that after Canossa’s contract expired palliative care services would be taken back by Queensland Health. </Hansard-Body>
<DIV>
<IMAGE xml:link="simple" href="2011_02_16_WEEKLY-78.gif" show="embed" actuate="auto"/>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204569"></A>
Before I became the elected member for Mount Ommaney I was involved in a number of community organisations as a volunteer, one of which was Canossa Aged Care Complex. I have continued to volunteer as a Friend of Canossa over many years. I regularly attend weekly services at the Canossa chapel and participate in volunteer and fundraising events when they occur. My attachment to this place and its people runs deep. There is nothing that I would not do to support this wonderful organisation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204570"></A>
Understandably, I was horrified when this information came to my attention. When I asked the reason this decision was made I was advised that Canossa had suggested to Queensland Health that it wanted to reduce its palliative service anyway. Canossa management and the Canossian Daughters of Charity categorically denied that this would ever be the case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204610"></A>
I have known many people who spent their last days peacefully receiving the greatest of care from staff at the palliative care unit there. It is more than just pain management; it is emotional support and it is spiritual support as you are among the angels, the sisters of Canossa. It is the hope of most residents of Canossa that they would have the choice of being cared for in this very special unit if they needed to be. There are many families of palliative care patients who want to know that Canossa will also be there for them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204611"></A>
The network of friends and devoted followers of Canossa is enormous. After weeks of talking to people from Canossa, local residents, Palliative Care Queensland, the Queensland Health director-general, the acting director-general, the CEO, the Minister for Health and his staff, I finally had a breakthrough. Queensland Health had agreed to extend the contract until mid June 2011, with further negotiation with Canossa after that. Local residents asked me to attend a rally the next day organised by Palliative Care Queensland. When I arrived there, I found that Mark McArdle MP, with two former unsuccessful LNP candidates, were leading the charge against the government. I felt it was appropriate for me to address residents that day. I assured them that although we had a breakthrough there was a lot of work to do to ensure that the quality palliative care services continued at Canossa in the future. </Hansard-Body>

After a meeting held on 10 January--the day before the floods--with Father Jerry, Sister Concetta, CEO Robynne Kent and the minister, it was confirmed that Queensland Health would extend Canossa’s palliative care contract until QEII came online. The minister is also requesting an assessment of Canossa Hospital in relation to the provision of palliative care services for the western suburbs into the future. He will tour Canossa later this week with me. <Hansard-Speech-End>

I acknowledge the package has been developed in consultation with industry groups. I welcome the fact that category C and category D NDRRA have been activated, as they were after Cyclone Larry. These measures will provide much needed support to communities in my electorate affected by Cyclone Yasi.</A></Hansard-Body>

I am grateful the federal and state governments have recognised the significant needs of industries devastated by Cyclone Yasi. I must, however, continue to press for two additional important measures--that being a fuel excise relief payment for households, businesses and primary producers left without electricity for extended periods and a support package for the transport industry to avoid a crippling cost of living increase in North Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204626"></A>
As of 10 am today, there were still 7,421 customer connections without power between Ingham and Innisfail in my electorate, despite the best efforts of Ergon Energy crews working around the clock. The damage to the electricity distribution system in many communities throughout my electorate ranges from serious to catastrophic. In some rural areas, people will be without power for several weeks. Many households, businesses and farmers are relying on generators and this is very costly. Following Cyclone Larry in 2006, the Howard government provided assistance to businesses, farmers and households that needed to generate their own power by refunding the excise paid on diesel and petrol until supply was restored. I urge the federal and state governments to include this fuel excise relief payment to households, farmers and businesses in their support package. Recent increases in the retail price of fuel have exacerbated the problem faced by households, businesses and farmers affected by Cyclone Yasi, many of whom are also catering for extended family, friends and neighbours without generators.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204627"></A>
Many transport operators that normally carry North Queensland products to southern markets have been left without loads and face the prospect of huge increases in costs to bring goods back to North Queensland. For example, road transport operators that normally carry bananas out of areas of North Queensland that have been devastated by Cyclone Yasi will have no loads to carry south. The cost of hauling loads back into North Queensland will be astronomical and freight costs have already increased. Backloading does not exist in the transport industry anymore. Both legs of the journey need to be economically viable. If transport operators are short of loads to carry south, I am concerned the cost of carrying loads back into North Queensland will skyrocket.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204628"></A>
I am worried about the possibility of a double or triple whammy for cyclone affected communities. A blowout in the cost of living on top of a shortage of housing and the loss of employment would be diabolical. I urge the federal and state government’s to amend their support package to provide assistance to the transport industry.<Hansard-Speech-End>

In 1970, Cyclone Ada descended on the area and practically wiped Airlie Beach off the map. As it re-emerged, enterprising locals and blow-ins from the south began to construct accommodation and watering holes and the town slowly gained a reputation as a great place to have a holiday. Today, the town of Airlie Beach has extended up the hill and around the bay, but the one thing that has not changed is the view from the top of the street down to Muddy Bay at the other end. The shop facades are the same as they were 30 years ago, only now they are looking tired and out of place, and the street still floods at the point where Shute Harbour Road intersects Airlie Creek. It is a gun-barrel-straight, bitumen vista that does little to say welcome to our visitors who come from around the world to see the magnificent Whitsundays.</A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1204637"></A>
A year ago, the Whitsunday Regional Council set out to find and collate all the studies that have been done over the years about how we can improve the amenity of Airlie Beach. They came up with some 40 studies and papers which all basically said the same thing--upgrade the appearance of the town’s central heart. Over the next 12 months, plans were draw up and everyone from the Premier to the Prime Minister was lobbied for assistance to help with a much needed heart transplant for Airlie Beach.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204638"></A>
I do place on record my apologies for becoming something of a nag on this issue, as every minister in turn was briefed on the project and taken for a long walk along the offending street. However, as the Australian dollar kept rising and the wet season kept coming and our tourists did not, I was acutely aware that the town needed a shot in the arm to revive flagging spirits and give the business owners a fighting chance of survival. Good news arrived earlier this year with the Commonwealth government confirming that it would honour a $5 million election commitment to the project. It was a start but not enough to make a real impact.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204639"></A>
So, Mr Speaker, you can imagine my delight--indeed the delight of my whole community--when just last week the Queensland Treasurer announced that our government would also support the project with a $7 million funding injection. In even better news, he revealed that a deal had been done with the council that would see it put an additional $5 million in the kitty to ensure that the first stage of the revitalisation operation could be delivered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204640"></A>
The $17 million package will deliver one upgraded and one new roundabout, flood mitigation work, a realignment of the street to allow for a central park and general beautification of the streetscape. The finished product will be a cooler, greener, friendlier experience that allows for sidewalk dining and relaxed shopping. My hope is that property owners along the strip will now have the confidence to commence their own plans for revitalisation because it is not just the street that needs a facelift. In the meantime, I know a lot of business operators would really appreciate some consideration of rent relief so that they can keep their doors open until the upgrades are complete. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110216_214653" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Glass House--LNP) (9.46 pm): In November last year, TransLink released a new draft timetable for the north coast rail service. Within minutes, my office was inundated with phone calls from disbelieving and devastated commuters. Everyone, me included, will acknowledge there are a few positives in the proposed timetable. The new early morning services out of Nambour at 5.10 and 5.38, which replace the current 5.26 am service, are welcomed by those who need to arrive in the CBD early, by 7.02 and 7.36 am respectively. The extension of the weekday Cooroy service to Gympie North also means that there are now two daily return services to Gympie North Monday to Friday. But the flow-on repercussions for the vast majority of the peak hour coast commuters have them begging that these new services be removed and the previous timetable restored, such is the disastrous nature of the proposed timetable. Let me detail their concerns. </A></Hansard-Body>

By moving the morning inbound service that currently arrives in Central at 8.16 to an 8.26 arrival, it means an 8.30 am starter cannot get to work in time. By moving the morning inbound service that currently arrives in Central at 7.42 to an 8.02 arrival, it means an eight o’clock starter cannot get to work in time. By moving the 5.16 pm outbound Nambour service back to 5.04 pm, it means no 5 pm office worker can catch it. By moving the current outbound 5.43 service to 5.47, it means that there is now a three-quarters of an hour gap between this and the previous service.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1204649"></A>
Reducing the express pattern from 20 stations bypassed down to 13 on most services means longer commutes for those who travel furthest and by far the longest, with two peak services in each direction now only bypassing nine stations. Failing to schedule a Nambour service from Central each weeknight between 7.34 pm and 9.34 pm means there is a two-hour gap each and every night. And there is an ongoing failure to guarantee trains with toilets on all services north of Caboolture. Mr Speaker, a 10-minute movement in arrival or departure time may not seem much to you or to the minister, but to those commuters who have set starting and finishing hours of employment it can mean an additional hour on their day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1210667"></A>
These individuals are already doing 12- or 13-hour days; under this draft timetable, it is 13 or 14. That is a crushing blow for the commuter and their family. As someone who, up until my election as the member for Glass House, did this four-hour commute from Palmwoods to the CBD nearly every day of every week, I know that hour can mean the difference between seeing your kids each day and not seeing them at all. Today an e-petition signed by 253 north coast commuters was tabled in this House calling on the Minister for Transport to preserve the existing timetable. Please, Minister, hear the devastated cries of those commuters. Revise the timetable so it does not disadvantage these people, your longest commuters.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Youth violence is a serious issue for the Queensland community and, as a government, we recognise the need to educate our young people about the dangers and consequences of engaging in this type of antisocial behaviour. We have invested over $1 million, which included embarking on a major communication strategy in the One Punch Can Kill campaign. However, governments cannot act alone and there is no doubt the strongest community advocate group on this issue is the Matthew Stanley Foundation. The foundation was formed in 2006 by Paul Stanley after the tragic death of his son Matthew, a young man from Redland City who died after being punched at a teenage party.</A></Hansard-Body>

Paul works really hard in the community to reduce youth violence and I joined him recently to see the foundation in action at the Alexandra Hills Tavern. I am sure some of my colleagues will shake their heads in disbelief at the thought of me in a nightclub at midnight surrounded by hundreds of teens, but duty called and I did my best not to look too out of place! After all, we had important work to do spreading the message of Paul’s most recent campaign. The campaign aims to get the message to our teens that it is cool to ‘walk away and chill out’. What we want to see is the sequence that leads to youth violence being interrupted. We want to find that point where a dangerous situation gets out of hand and stop it. Paul and I spent the evening checking out the ID system implemented by the hotel as well as security measures adopted to ensure that as much as possible the patrons and the staff are protected.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1210679"></A>
The range of security measures that have been introduced by the tavern includes patron identification using their driver’s licence or 18 plus cards at the door and top of the range security camera equipment. I am pleased to note that quite a few potential patrons were turned away because of past incidents. The tavern also employs police officers onsite and is committed to improving patron behaviour. Hotel owner Tom McGuire welcomed the campaign and is committed to open up his tavern to more ‘walk away and chill out’ campaigns in the future. With thousands of locals turning 18 each year in my electorate and visiting clubs, it is important that young people are educated about safety, and that is an ongoing task.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1210682"></A>
While this government will continue to work to develop strategies to combat the issue of youth violence now and well into the future, a community campaign is one that I believe drives change, and the Matthew Stanley Foundation is working hard to tackle youth violence. I want to especially mention the <Hansard-Italic>

 for its donation to the campaign by not sending out Christmas cards last year but giving $15,000 instead to the Matthew Stanley Foundation.</Hansard-Body>

Last Saturday I had the privilege of spending six hours with paramedics on the Gold Coast witnessing firsthand the amazing work that they undertake. As a registered nurse and a former emergency department nurse, I have been on the receiving end of many patients delivered to the ED by these dedicated ambulance officers and paramedics. As a member of the Gold Coast Local Area Committee for the past five years, it was an opportunity that was not to be missed and gave me an even greater respect for the efforts of our front-line workers. I want to thank Col Nash, acting area director for the Gold Coast, who organised the process for allowing me to spend time with our ambos.</A></Hansard-Body>

I had the pleasure of spending the day with Chris Draper, the regional operations supervisor, who went out of his way to ensure that my experience with the QAS was a memorable one. My thanks also goes to clinical deployment supervisor Peter Caffery, who explained how units are deployed and how he juggles the organisation of which crews, which ambulances and what other types of intervention is required such as the use of the CareFlight helicopter. Young Nick King spent time talking to me about his university paramedic training he had undergone. He spoke of the need for more clinical placements and hands-on patient time in the training of young paramedics. He noted the incredible depth of knowledge and contribution of the older officers whose wisdom and experience added to his experience.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1210699"></A>
I also visited the Gold Coast Hospital and met with Daniel Schulz, the hospital liaison officer working the ramp at the hospital. Thank you also to the CareFlight crew, the Burleigh paramedics and the Southport intensive care paramedics who attended the incident in Reedy Creek where a motorcyclist dirt biking in the bush came over the top of his handlebars and sustained a suspected fractured pelvis and was subsequently winched to safety by the paramedics and doctor from CareFlight. Thanks also to the Helensvale paramedics who attended an incident at Main Beach where a young father was treated for a suspected spinal injury. The paramedics talked about the improvements that had occurred in their field over the years, including the introduction of 24-hour counsellors to care for the mental health of our emergency services workers. The advent of HLOs at Robina, Gold Coast and Logan hospitals has made a difference in the time taken getting patients on and off QAS stretchers so that officers can get back out on the road quickly.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1210700"></A>
One issue that needs attention, however, is the concern for the lack of respect our ambos receive from the general public and the number of assaults on officers in the course of their duties. I mentioned that the Liberal National Party had put forward a private member’s bill demanding mandatory minimum sentencing for assaults on our emergency services workers and that we would continue the fight on their behalf. The comment was also made that legislation introduced to stop vexatious calls to the 000 service had had very little effect on the call-out for non-urgent codes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

The official opening was followed by an open day with sausage sizzles, free massages and tours around the new facilities. This precinct was the culmination of five years of construction and a total of $3 million in major facilities funding from the Queensland government. Initially the heated and hydrotherapy pools were built as stage 1 and the state government contributed $1.5 million to their development. Construction began last year on the gymnasium with its allied health hub above and the creche and coffee shop to complete the health precinct with the help of a $1.5 million state government grant.</A></Hansard-Body>

This precinct will give Redcliffe people the opportunity to get active in convivial surroundings and to work on focused programs with fitness and health professionals if they have specific needs. Young children, babies, seniors, people with disabilities, those with injuries needing medical treatment or hydrotherapy and people with chronic diseases all have fun options to be active in groups, learn new skills and change their lives.

This facility epitomises the vision of the Bligh government’s Toward Q2 initiative to make Queenslanders the healthiest people in the nation. Queenslanders are amongst the longest lived in the world. This health precinct will ensure that the people of Redcliffe can have quality lives, enhancing our current bayside lifestyles. The Bligh government sees a quality lifestyle as a priority for all Queenslanders, so funding facilities that give people the opportunities to get active and improve their long-term health outcomes is important. Facilities like the Dolphins Health Precinct will empower Queenslanders to take control of their own health outcomes and to improve their own lives, and that is what this proactive state government is all about--ensuring communities right across the state have the recreation facilities to achieve healthy lifestyles that will ensure continued, long and connected lives.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr Hinchliffe also denied the Government was in negotiation to relocate the showgrounds to a Carrara flood-plain. A source close to Parklands told the Bulletin the Government was ‘eyeing off’ a 42ha block once earmarked for an over 50s resort. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1210768"></A>
Both of these statements cannot be true. At a proposed meeting on 28 February of this month the minister might tell the Gold Coast Show Society which statement is true. I am one of many who remain confused by the conflicting statements made by Minister Hinchliffe.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1210770"></A>
Interestingly, Parklands is a very valuable block of land that seems to attract more than a healthy dose of government interest. Why? Because the site could unlock $400 million to $500 million of cash for no real outlay and $200 million of existing infrastructure will be trashed as a result. Why? We need the site for the proposed 2018 Commonwealth Games and no other site is apparently suitable--as we have been told. Not even the current site of the existing Gold Coast Hospital at Southport is deemed to be suitable. </Hansard-Body>

Do natural disasters ever teach us anything? Certainly, if the choice is either the money or the security of a safe, very large, perfectly designed evacuation centre, Labor under Bligh will go for the money--or so it seems. It is often said that he who hesitates is lost. There is no other real reason, apart from an indecent rush for the filthy lucre here. Build the games village at the master planned 42-hectare site, at the existing Gold Coast Griffith University site or on the existing Gold Coast Hospital site, which is to be vacated in 2013, and leave Parklands as it is. Heaven knows we will need it. <Hansard-Speech-End>

I represent an electorate that is home to a diverse range of families as well as to many people who are struggling in life.

Like my electorate generally, Indigenous people who live in Logan include some families who have great success stories and some families who are struggling and need a hand from governments. Unfortunately, our Indigenous friends and neighbours are overrepresented in this latter category.

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1210780"></A>
But these barriers to providing high-quality services to the people who need them the most are often compounded by the reluctance of many Indigenous people to complain about government services.

That is why I have lobbied Premier Anna Bligh and Attorney-General Cameron Dick to consider the establishment of a unit within the Ombudsman’s office specifically to assist Indigenous people, to ensure they are provided with the services that can start to bridge the gap in life expectancy, health and wellbeing and socioeconomic status that exists between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Queenslanders. A similar unit exists within the New South Wales Ombudsman service and has delivered some good outcomes. </Hansard-Body>

This proposal is definitely something worth exploring here in Queensland. Assistance that could be provided includes help to prepare complaints, taking oral complaints, advice about appeal mechanisms and information about the criteria used for decision making. I know that often this is what members of parliament do every day. I know I do. It is part of the responsibility of being elected to represent people in an area who need every bit of assistance they can get. I am always available to make representations on behalf of constituents. However, sometimes politicians are not the best people to solve problems. I often end up writing letters for constituents or helping people navigate their way through complaints processes. This process is often more empowering and of more assistance than me trying to fix problems for others.</Hansard-Body>

But there is always a limit to what can be expected of members of parliament. There needs to be support for awareness of appeal rights, practical assistance in having concerns investigated and an oversight to ensure that government agencies are treating people fairly. More than any other, our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community needs this support. </Hansard-Body>

I am glad to inform the House that the Attorney-General has asked for this proposal to be a matter considered in the strategic review of the Ombudsman that is required to be undertaken this year. I hope that this proposal can be given careful consideration. A properly resourced program of this nature can go a long way to ensuring that the government can respond to the needs of Indigenous Queenslanders and can begin to close the gap. <Hansard-Speech-End>
