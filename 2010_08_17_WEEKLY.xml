The report shows that ministerial expenditure has remained reasonable and that fiscal responsibility remains a cornerstone of our government. Compared to 2008-09, overall expenditure has increased by only 0.72 per cent. This is below CPI and the enterprise bargaining increases to staff. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998605"></A>
The period of this expenditure included the new IT rollout for ministerial offices and the opposition office. As in previous years, some expenses have gone up while others have gone down. Despite enterprise bargaining increases, employee related costs were down by $23,000 on the previous year. Other savings include motor vehicle costs, which were down nearly $26,000; air charters, which were down $17,500; and communication charges, which decreased by nearly $83,000, along with domestic travel, which was down $207,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998689"></A>
Expenses for my own office, excluding the Townsville office, increased by 5.38 per cent. While an increase to my office expenses, this actually represents whole-of-government savings that were generated from economies of scale by centralising into my office a range of administrative support services including media monitoring, regional media coordination and travel support. This report shows that ministerial expenditure is being maintained at reasonable levels in these tough economic times. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ekka</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.35 am): Mr Speaker, I know that you, along with others, were very pleased to enjoy the best that the Ekka had to offer. The Ekka wrapped up last Saturday, on 14 August, after 10 days of outstanding crowds and fun for everyone. I think that all members of the House would be pleased to see that the 2010 Ekka was a terrific success, with more than 400,000 people pouring through the gates--up 20 per cent on last year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000899"></A>
Mr Speaker, you know that the Ekka is in town when RMs and Akubras become a common sight in the city as the bush meets the town. Traditions such as dagwood dogs, strawberry sundaes, hair-raising rides, fireworks, cotton and wool parades and show bags were popular once again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998954"></A>
I understand that the animal nursery was again the most popular attraction for city raised children at this year’s Ekka. Some children for the first time in their lives saw where milk really comes from. Others were lucky enough to see a lamb being born--a highlight for those children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000898"></A>
The RNA hosted the traditional community cabinet on Monday, 9 August, and I was very pleased to have the opportunity to thank them for their hospitality. I was also pleased to compete in the annual best steak sandwich cook-off. In all modesty, I have to declare to the House that John Cotter of AgForce and I cleaned up with the assistance of a secret ingredient--Mrs Law’s cooked salad dressing, with eggs from local chickens, Mavis and Joyce. It was a bottler. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999073"></A>
The Queensland Government Pavilion was again popular, providing information on initiatives such as our flying start for Queensland children. Healthy fruit snacks were distributed each day and thousands of visitors now know how to make sure that every dollar counts, with information provided on government concessions, rebates and discounts. I think we would all agree, as I said, that the Ekka is a very important event on Queensland’s calendar, and our government is proud to support it. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.37 am): It was with pleasure last week that I announced Queensland Events had secured a deal to host the annual rugby league clash between the Indigenous All Stars and the NRL All Stars right through to 2013. This event is about much more than sport. No-one who saw the inaugural game played at Skilled Park earlier this year will forget it. Indigenous league players had dreamt of this opportunity for decades--their best players together in one team, playing for their families, their communities and their people. What tremendous pride they showed as they pulled on their jerseys and what an enormously positive influence they were on our Indigenous young people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999261"></A>
The game sold out months in advance. It was watched by nearly 1.3 million people nationally and it won its timeslot in Sydney and Brisbane. In addition, $1.5 million was raised for community programs focused on Indigenous areas. We can expect the same excitement and passion and level of interest when the next game is played at Skilled Park on 12 February 2011. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999327"></A>
Celebrations will include the Bumehla Festival, which means ‘celebration of the people’. This free public Indigenous cultural festival will be held at the Broadwater Parklands on 11 and 12 February to coincide with this game. The match will also be good news for Gold Coast hotels, restaurants and shops, with 40 per cent of ticket buyers expected to be from outside South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999390"></A>
Tickets for next year’s game went on sale to NRL club members last week on 11 August and will go on sale to the general public this Wednesday, 18 August. I have no doubt it will be even more popular next year, and I encourage people to get online this week and get their tickets for what I think will be a great game next year. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.38 am): I am pleased to announce this morning a new addition to Brisbane’s events calendar. On Saturday, 2 October this year we will hold the inaugural Brisbane Open House. Public and private buildings of architectural and historical significance will be open to the public for special, behind-the-scenes tours. Up to 21 buildings will feature, including the Queensland Performing Arts Centre, the Gallery of Modern Art, Old Government House, Santos House and the Masonic Memorial Temple.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002728"></A>
This will be the chance for people to tour the areas that are normally closed to the public and the opportunity to unlock some of the secrets and interesting facts behind the buildings that give Brisbane its unique style. For instance, at GoMA the conservation area on the top of the building will be open offering spectacular views to the city. Visitors will also see how artworks are restored. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002729"></A>
People touring QPAC will have a rare chance to explore not only backstage but even under the recently renovated stage. Having done that tour myself I can recommend it. It is one of only two stages in Australia of sufficient size and technical excellence to host something like the world acclaimed Paris Opera Ballet. Visitors to the Masonic Memorial Temple, which is almost 90 years old, will see one of Queensland’s largest pipe organs. I know members will be interested in that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002730"></A>
Queensland government architect Philip Follent deserves credit for this idea. He, along with the Brisbane Development Association, has worked in partnership to get Brisbane Open House up and running. Open house events like this are held in London, New York and Melbourne. This year in Melbourne 65,000 visitors inspected 65 sites. We are aiming for 10,000 visitors for the first Brisbane Open House. I am pleased that the Governor, Penny Wensley, who is patron of the event, will announce further details at a launch today at 11 o’clock at the Gallery of Modern Art. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Grandparents Day; Seniors Week</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002734"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.41 am): Queensland grandparents and their families will be able to take part this year in Queensland’s very first Grandparents Day on 7 November. This will be an annual event held on the first Sunday of each November to celebrate the contributions that grandparents make to Queensland families every day. Like Mother’s Day and Father’s Day, it will recognise the importance and increasing role that grandparents in a modern world are playing in supporting families and particularly young children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002735"></A>
From providing babysitting services to parents to being a source of endless expert advice for mums and dads around the state, grandparents are there to help Queensland families. Queensland will lead the way when it comes to Grandparents Day. Queensland will be the first Australian state to officially recognise grandparents with their very own special day. I hope families seize the opportunity. Many schools and other organisations already offer special days for grandparents. But Queensland’s first Grandparents Day is a unified showing of thanks and appreciation from the whole community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002736"></A>
I think it is fair to say that most grandparents will not expect or want large or expensive gifts. Like Mother’s Day and Father’s Day it is often the handmade gifts and the handwritten cards that touch one’s heart the most. This is about showing grandparents that we appreciate their help and recognise the sacrifices they make to help us. Grandparents Day is the result of extensive consultation with Queenslanders. The community settled on the November date during extensive consultation through the Get Involved website as well as direct contact with electorate offices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002738"></A>
I acknowledge that one does not have to be a senior to be a grandparent, and nor does one need to be a grandparent to be a senior. But as I am sure many will be aware, this week is Seniors Week. Seniors Week is a week-long celebration of seniors and the great contribution that they all make to our community. This Queensland-wide celebration, from Saturday, 14 August to next Sunday, is a great opportunity for Queenslanders of all ages and backgrounds to get together and celebrate the contribution that older Queenslanders make. As part of Seniors Week, I will be presenting to 15 older Queenslanders at Parliament House tomorrow the 25th Premier’s Awards for Queensland Seniors for their work as volunteers in the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002739"></A>
The announcement today of Queensland Grandparents Day is one of a raft of commitments outlined in the first of five two-year plans in the Positively Ageless Seniors Strategy. As part of this strategy, the government has also committed to making life easier for grandparents raising grandchildren by creating extra opportunities for time out. This support is provided in the form of recreational camps and recreational activities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002740"></A>
In June we launched our elder abuse campaign and we will continue our promotion of the Seniors Enquiry Line run by Lifeline. In addition, we are helping the University of the Third Age, a truly great organisation, to provide online learning opportunities for seniors in regional Queensland. We are expanding our Granfriends program to use the experience of seniors in schools to teach craft and other skills to children. Grandparents deserve our thanks and Grandparents Day is the perfect opportunity to do that. I am pleased that Queensland will lead the way. I hope that other states will follow suit. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002744"></A>
I thank all the seniors organisations right around Queensland who do a wonderful job all year round. But in Seniors Week they do a particularly outstanding job, reaching out to older people in our community and helping them to live active, happy and connected lives. I want to particularly thank those organisations for their advice, their assistance and their ideas in putting together our seniors strategy and particularly for their idea about having a grandparents day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002745"></A>
I particularly acknowledge my minister Phil Reeves, who brought this to the government’s attention after senior groups in his area--predominantly led by Val French, who, as everyone knows, is a great champion and advocate for older Queenslanders--put forward this idea. It is a terrific idea. We are very pleased to back it. I am very pleased today to announce that 7 November will be Queensland’s first Grandparents Day. May it be the first of many. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Swine Flu</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002750"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (9.45 am): I do note that the RNA did not invite me to participate in a curry sausages cook-off with anyone. I do note that you could purchase two packs of Suncoast Gold wasabi macadamias for $25--a very good deal--at the Woolworths pavilion, which I did. It is a great Queensland company. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002752"></A>
The World Health Organisation last week declared that last year’s H1N1 swine flu virus had moved into the postpandemic stage. It was welcome news, but we cannot rest on our laurels. Some people may be tempted to think that, because the worldwide effect of swine flu this year has not reached the peaks of last year or the worst fears of the World Health Organisation, swine flu can now be disregarded as a serious threat. That would be folly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002753"></A>
As of 27 June, globally there had been more than 18,200 confirmed swine flu deaths in more than 200 countries. Last year, Australia’s death toll reached 191 from more than 37,700 cases. In Queensland last year there were 12,000 laboratory confirmed cases with 41 of those proving fatal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002754"></A>
So far this year, Queensland has been fortunate to avoid any swine flu deaths. We have a way to go in the winter flu season, but so far so good. Despite having escaped tragedy so far this winter, it would be a mistake for us to now sit back on our hands in the mistaken belief that swine flu is no longer a threat. The spectre of a more virulent form appearing down the track remains. Pigs may not fly, but without vigilance we have learned that swine flu can grow wings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002755"></A>
Our aim is to protect Queenslanders from the worst of this pandemic. That is why the Bligh and Gillard governments are partnering on the swine flu vaccine rollout for a second year. We are approaching one full year since the vaccine became available. While the elderly are the group at highest risk of death as a result of seasonal influenza, the young and middle aged were identified as the most at-risk groups of contracting swine flu--particularly those with chronic, immunosuppressant and respiratory problems, pregnant women, the obese and Indigenous people.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002759"></A>
Panvax H1N1 was developed by CSL Ltd and approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for people aged 10 years and over on 18 September last year. The Bligh government began delivering a free vaccination program in Queensland, in partnership with the Labor government in Canberra, on 30 September last year. It was extended to children aged over six months in early December. The vaccination program extended to mobile teams visiting community clinics in remote and regional areas of the state from the Torres Strait to the cape, the gulf and the central west. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002760"></A>
The total number of pandemic H1N1 2009 vaccines reported as administered in Queensland to 30 June 2010 was 931,729. In addition to this, 126,934 vaccinations were administered at more than 380 weekend school based vaccination clinics between February and May 2010. A total of 931,729 vaccinations were reported. More may have been administered but not reported. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002761"></A>
The 2010 seasonal flu vaccine also provides protection against H1N1 2009 influenza. Those deemed to be in high-risk groups were provided the vaccine free of charge. This year--from 1 January to 8 August--there have been 682 cases of influenza notified to Queensland Health. Of those, 617 were typed as influenza A--with 71 confirmed as H1N1--64 were typed as influenza B, one was not typed and none, I am advised, have proved fatal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002799"></A>
For the same period last year--that is, 1 January to 8 August--there were 16,008 notifications of influenza. I noted with interest two days ago an interview by Warren Boland on 612 ABC Radio with Professor Anne Kelso, who is head of the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Australia. The professor was of the opinion that the federal and Queensland governments had taken the appropriate insurance by purchasing the pandemic H1N1 2009 vaccine. The mild flu season we have experienced to date, Professor Kelso said, could be largely attributed to those vaccines coupled with the antibodies developed by some 20 per cent of the Australian population by the end of the flu season last year. She also said Australia had far fewer fatalities simply because of the incredible hospital care people received.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002804"></A>
In Queensland we had more than 41,000 emergency department presentations for flu and winter symptoms between April and October 2009, 15,000 more than the same period in 2008. We had 1,200 admissions to hospital and more than 160 intensive care unit admissions due to pandemic H1N1 2009 infections. Certainly, the additional 55 ventilators we purchased for our intensive care units helped our fantastic Queensland Health staff to save lives. Professor Kelso also had a word of warning and said that the flu season could still be ahead of us, telling Warren Boland that it is quite common for flu to not really get going until August and then peak in September and wane in October. She said that it was not too late to be vaccinated. For my part, I will continue to urge Queenslanders, old and young, to be vaccinated. I certainly have been.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (9.50 am): Once again it is official: for the fourth month in a row we are leading jobs growth in the nation. Last Thursday the independent umpire, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, released its latest jobs numbers for the month of July. The figures attest: they provide the hard numbers, the data and the evidence that Queensland is the jobs-generating capital of Australia for the fourth month in a row--not per capita, not as a percentage, not pro rata but straight up and flat out more jobs were created here than in any other state. Not only have we outperformed the rest of Australia in jobs generation but we have now delivered 12 straight months of jobs-generating growth into the Queensland economy--that is 12 straight months of jobs growth, month on month the number of jobs increasing, one full year of delivering new jobs and creating new jobs for the people of Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002813"></A>
In July we saw 5,600 new jobs created in Queensland, more than a third of the nation’s total jobs growth. This takes our jobs target down to now be at 38,800--well over halfway to our target of 100,000 net new jobs this term, and delivering it well before halfway through this term of the parliament. It is absolutely clear that the Queensland economy is heading in the right direction and that our economic plan is working, building a recovery and generating jobs just like we said it would. Our trend unemployment rate now sits at 5 per cent, unchanged from a revised June figure. While this is down from the peak of six per cent last October, we recognise that we are not out of the woods yet. The task is not complete. There is an underlying volatility to the data that demonstrates the challenging nature of the situation, and that is why you need a plan. You need a strong plan to deliver and to restore the Queensland economy to build the recovery. That means that we need to keep creating more jobs, and that is what we are doing and that is what we are committed to doing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002816"></A>
We are doing it by putting in place our second consecutive $17 billion building program which is, again, the biggest in the nation, a program that is building hospitals, police stations, public housing and schools--infrastructure a growing state needs and the economic stimulus needed to keep Queenslanders in jobs. We have put in place employment programs like the Green Army that is giving job seekers and young people the training and the knowledge they need to get a start in the labour force. We have delivered tax rebates for employers of apprentices and trainees. We have implemented a suite of first home buyer concessions to stimulate the housing market. We have maintained the lowest payroll tax rate in the nation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002817"></A>
At the last election the Bligh government promised to create 100,000 new jobs if elected. We knew that it would be a tough task, but we remain committed--committed to meeting our target and to continuing to create jobs for Queenslanders. That is the evidence, the incontrovertible evidence from the independent umpire--four straight months of leading the nation in jobs.</Hansard-Body>

Hon. KL STRUTHERS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Algester--ALP) (Minister for Community Services and Housing and Minister for Women) (9.54 am): Seniors Week is off and running. The member for Brisbane Central and I launched the week at a special intergenerational walk at the weekend at New Farm Park. I congratulate the Council on the Ageing and its member organisations for organising the event and for the great work they do for seniors, day in and day out. From Burketown to Baralaba and St George to the Sunshine Coast, community organisations and the dedicated team from the Office for Seniors have planned some fantastic events and programs for Seniors Week. Rockhampton seniors will make lots of fun and noise at the Rockhampton Seniors Rage event, and the member for Albert tells me the Seniors Have Talent competition to be held at the Gold Coast will be a must-see event. The member for Burdekin will be pleased to hear that her local Burdekin Community Association has also received funding to help celebrate the value of seniors in her local community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002832"></A>
I toured the state listening to seniors about what they wanted in the Queensland Seniors Strategy. Seniors talked about the cost-of-living pressures. Our Bligh government responded with increased concessions. We responded with our Every Dollar Counts website that brings all rebates and concessions together in the one place. What form do the conservative governments have on easing the cost-of-living pressures? They in fact put the pressure up. The LNP models itself on the Western Australian government. What did the Western Australian government do in the past year? It cut concessions by $17 million! And we know what Tony Abbott plans to do: he plans on introducing a Coles and Woolies tax, driving up the cost of groceries.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002835"></A>
Seniors have talked about making sure they have continued access to quality health services, including dental care. Queenslanders understand more than most the consequences of the decisions Tony Abbott took as health minister in the Howard government--$1 billion ripped out of our hospitals, GP training places cut, public dental services cut. Tony Abbott has pledged to cut more health services. Our state Labor government is working with the federal government to ease the pressure on seniors and to improve health services, including public dental care.

1 Million Women Campaign</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Hon. KJ JONES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ashgrove--ALP) (Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability) (9.56 am): Women across Australia are banding together to fight climate change as part of the nationwide 1 Million Women campaign. The campaign encourages women throughout the country to do their bit to combat global warming by cutting one million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over the next two years--the equivalent of taking 250,000 cars off our roads in 12 months. Every woman who joins the campaign takes a pledge to cut one tonne of carbon dioxide from their daily lives within a year of joining by doing simple things such as conserving energy at home, reducing their waste, buying local produce and taking public transport or riding a bike instead of driving their car for at least one trip a week.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002841"></A>
The Bligh government is proud to support this important campaign, with our Premier leading the charge as the first ambassador registered in Queensland. And the response from everyday Queenslanders continues to grow. Since the campaign was launched, more than 6,100 Queensland women have joined and have collectively pledged to climate savings equating to an amazing 12,200 kilograms of greenhouse gas reductions. Currently this represents around 22 per cent of the national effort, and Queensland got a huge boost in the last weeks thanks to the efforts of the 1 Million Women campaign at the Ekka. Over 2,000 women were signed up over the course of the Ekka, a clear indication of the motivation of Queensland women to help cut carbon emissions. I was pleased to join the Ekka recruitment drive last Monday and it was great to see so many people eager for the opportunity to make a difference.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002846"></A>
This campaign is another step forward in reaching our Toward Q2 target of reducing Queensland’s household emissions by one-third by 2020. I know Queensland women can and will rise to the challenge of climate change and I urge all of the women in parliament to join the Premier and I and sign up to the 1 Million Women campaign at www.1millionwomen.com.au to make a difference. I say to Mr Abbott, who last night reaffirmed that he does not believe in climate change or global warming and thinks that it is not happening and is not real, that 2,000 women at the Ekka cannot be wrong.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (9.59 am): Overseas trade and investment is vital to a strong Queensland economy and the Queensland government remains committed to expanding our international business links. The work of Trade Queensland has pinpointed key international markets which, through strategic research and networking, are creating opportunities for Queensland businesses and supporting Queensland jobs.</Hansard-Body>

As Queensland’s fifth largest merchandise export destination, Taiwan remains an important trading partner for our state. This week, Queensland’s special trade representative to China and Vietnam is leading a delegation of 14 Queensland companies to promote the state’s expertise in a range of sectors. Queensland specialities in in-flight training, architecture and design, building and construction, food and wine, education and training, and sports infrastructure and transportation will be showcased. This mission builds on the strengthening relationship between our two regions, which has already seen the establishment of the First Commercial Bank of Taiwan opening its Australian head office in Brisbane last year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004380"></A>
There is little doubt that the world’s economic gaze has recently sharpened towards Latin America. The Bligh government has taken early steps to establish a foothold in the market for Queensland businesses looking to expand their base. The Queensland government is very close to establishing its first official representation in Latin America through the appointment of a senior business development manager, who will be based in Santiago, Chile, within the Austrade office. As Chile is Australia’s third largest trading partner in Latin America, Mr Vega will make it easier for Queensland companies looking to take advantage of the free trade agreement, which eliminates Chile’s tariffs on almost 92 per cent of tariff lines, covering 97 per cent of goods. Queensland business is well positioned to cater for the key industry demands on Chile, including exports of coal, LNG, renewable energy, meat, wine and some dairy as well as mining and energy technology and civil engineering and consulting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004384"></A>
Vietnam, which gained entry into the World Trade Organisation in January 2007, is another market in which Queensland companies will soon have access to a dedicated in-market specialist. In a similar approach to that of Santiago, a new business development manager will soon be engaged in the Austrade office in Ho Chi Minh, supporting Queensland companies to access this important market. The Queensland government will continue a flexible approach to its international footprint, ensuring that Queensland companies receive a helping hand in trade and investment markets of interest to Queensland. Trade and Investment Queensland’s new overseas representatives, coupled with the current Taiwan trade mission, will support Queensland companies to grow their business to support jobs and the Queensland economy. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. GJ WILSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (10.01 am): On early childhood education the difference between the Bligh government and the Liberal National Party could not be more stark. The Bligh government is committed to a major reform of early childhood services to ensure that all Queensland four-year-olds get access to kindergarten. This Labor government is committed to an investment of $320 million over five years to provide up to 240 new kindergarten services where necessary. Labor will give all Queensland children a flying start to their education. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004389"></A>
The Liberal National Party is committed to nothing--no additional kindergartens, no additional early childhood teachers; just a dishonest scaremongering campaign waged by the member for Moggill, a dishonest and sneaky email campaign aimed at causing stress to local kindergarten committees. Every kindergarten service will have its funding guaranteed at least at the same level of 2010 plus indexation and many existing kindergartens will receive more funding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004390"></A>
This Bligh state government is dedicated to ensuring that every young Queenslander has access to a quality education for the first time. Funding will recognise disadvantage services in remote and low socioeconomic areas. All existing DECKAS funded services will transition to the new scheme from January next year. This is not a one-off solution; this is an ongoing commitment by the state government to these existing community kindergartens beyond 2011. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004392"></A>
This government’s objective is to increase the percentage of four-year-olds in kindergarten from 32 per cent to 95 per cent by 2014. Starting this week, the Creche and Kindergarten Association and Education Queensland will conduct 20 state-wide information forums with existing kindies outlining the changes and the support that is on offer. It does not matter where in Queensland the kindergarten service is and the population and demographic characteristics do not matter; these services will retain their current level of funding and it will be indexed. The government is working hand in hand with C&amp;K to provide a business advisory service to each existing DECKAS service free of charge. The government will continue to work with individual service providers to maximise kindergarten delivery for Queensland’s four-year-old children. The Bligh government will give Queensland children a flying start to their education. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004394"></A>
We hear nothing from the Liberal National Party on education and training--just sneaky emails to kindergartens spreading misinformation. They promised to dump the government’s $320 million plan for up to 240 kindergarten services across Queensland, scrapping 850 early childhood teachers and 2,000 construction jobs. </Hansard-Body>

Bushfire Season</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (10.05 am): August traditionally marks the start of the bushfire season in Queensland and, once again, Mother Nature is right on time. In the past two weeks we have seen a number of vegetation fires develop in the state’s north, centre and south-east. Thankfully, through the good work of our volunteer rural fire brigades, supported by their urban and auxiliary counterparts and police, the fires were contained quickly and the damage was minimal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004401"></A>
 In yet another demonstration of the government’s strong support for our rural fire brigades, I am pleased to announce today that 120 slip-on units will be made available to rural fire brigades free of charge this financial year. The units hold up to 500 litres of water and are designed to be easily mounted onto utilities and trucks for use in hazard-reduction operations, low-intensity firefighting and blacking-out work. These units are in addition to the 20 that are being provided to brigades across the state under the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service’s partnership with Reliance Petroleum.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004404"></A>
The 120 slip-on units will particularly be targeted at rural brigades identified with primary producer functions and those that are unable to generate adequate funding for such units. The units will be supplied with speed loaders at a total cost of around $810,000. The fire commissioner has notionally allocated the units, with brigades around Charters Towers and Cloncurry, Barcaldine, Roma, Miles, Bundaberg, Innisfail, Mackay, Maryborough, Rockhampton, Toowoomba, Townsville and on Cape York Peninsula set to benefit from this allocation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004405"></A>
Thanks to strong, ongoing support from the Bligh government, the number of slip-on units being used by volunteer rural fire brigades across the state has more than doubled. There are currently around 2,400 units in the field, up from around 1,100 in 2003. In line with our Supporting Our Heroes election commitment, Queensland Fire and Rescue Service’s Rural Operations is working to deliver 25 new and replacement rural fire appliances this financial year and to retrofit Rural Fire Service appliances with fire-reflective curtains to protect firefighters should they be trapped in their vehicle. Petrol driven pumps are also being replaced with diesel driven pumps--another commitment that the Bligh government is delivering on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004408"></A>
The Bligh government is committed to supplying rural firefighters with the tools they need to respond to the threat of bushfires. As we saw at Willowbank yesterday, the bushfire season has begun. For those residents who live in or near bushland, including in city areas, now is the time to prepare a bushfire survival plan. Useful information is available on the Queensland Fire and Rescue website. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Gladstone Port Access Road</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. CA WALLACE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Thuringowa--ALP) (Minister for Main Roads) (10.07 am): The thriving port city of Gladstone will be a big winner in a re-elected federal Labor government. The Gillard government has pledged $50 million to complete the final stages of the Gladstone Port Access Road. It comes on top of $55 million being spent by the Bligh government on roads in Gladstone this financial year. The port access road is a vital link for this rapidly growing region. It services and supports the thriving port precinct, the emerging LNG industry on Curtis Island, the Yarwun industrial area and the mining industry in the booming Bowen Basin. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004414"></A>
We have delivered stage 1 of the Gladstone Port Access Road. There is now a direct connection from our state controlled road network to the port. It means no more big freight trucks travelling through the CBD. That is important in a city like Gladstone, with growing volumes of traffic. More than 1,600 vehicles a day use the port access road and nearly 500 of those are heavy vehicles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004415"></A>
I look forward to working with the Gillard government to deliver the final two stages: extending the port access road even further to meet the future needs of industry, commerce, tourism and the local community. With this $50 million commitment from federal Labor, we will be able to get on with the job of delivering stages 2 and 3 of this important road link.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004416"></A>
The proposed alignment will run parallel to the Dawson Highway. The final stages will see the port access road extended all the way to Red Rover Road at Callemondah. I say to the good people of Gladstone this morning: red, red rover, Gillard come over, because that is the right choice--the only choice for the people of Queensland on Saturday. The federal coalition has turned its back on this state’s engine room. Their Gladstone bag is empty. That is not surprising. We should not be surprised. Tony Abbott thinks transport infrastructure should be a state responsibility. It is a no-brainer. With Gillard for Gladstone we will be in like Flynn. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Fire Ants</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Hon. TS MULHERIN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.10 am): Two new fire ant infestations found outside the current restricted area have prompted Biosecurity Queensland to remind people of the dangers of human assisted movements. It is illegal to move high-risk material such as soil, plants and landscaping equipment from a fire ant restricted area without an inspection. Breaches of movement restrictions by developers, construction companies, landscapers and home renovators increase the risk of fire ant infestations spreading and could lead to the devaluation of South-East Queensland land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005870"></A>
The warning comes as Biosecurity Queensland confirms two new fire ant infestations, one near Ormeau on the Gold Coast, 8.5 kilometres from the nearest known infestation, and another in Clontarf, 11.5 kilometres from the nearest previous detection. In recent months there have been several serious breaches of soil movement restrictions. Regardless of whether these two new infestations were as a result of illegal or accidental movement, it is a timely reminder that all material moved from restricted areas needs inspection. We were alerted to these infestations in time to prevent the significant spread of fire ants but if it continues it could be disastrous for Queensland. Ignoring or forgetting to check movement restrictions threatens to unravel years of hard work in eradicating fire ants from Queensland. Fines of up to $1 million for businesses and $200,000 for individuals are in place for those found breaching movement restrictions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005871"></A>
Fire ants have the potential to ruin the outdoor way of life Queenslanders enjoy. In the US, Texas spends $1 million a year treating sporting fields and outdoor amenities for fire ant infestations so that they can be used by the public. Biosecurity Queensland will continue to work with councils, developers, landscapers and residents to communicate the risk of moving material around. Biosecurity Queensland has also extended the employment of all 191 fire ant staff to continue the fight against infestation. Biosecurity is everyone’s responsibility, but we are ensuring we have sufficient staff to battle on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005872"></A>
Both of these recent infestations were reported by people who have undergone fire ant training offered at the control centre. A Gold Coast City Council officer reported the Ormeau infestation and someone working in the area reported the one at Clontarf. Our system is clearly working. I urge everyone to check their yards for fire ants and report findings immediately to Biosecurity Queensland on 132523 and always comply with movement restrictions. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Local Government, Discretionary Funds</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005875"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. D BOYLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships) (10.13 am): In the Local Government Act 2009 there are new provisions in relation to the use of discretionary funds by councillors. Over the years there have been complaints about councillors who have appeared to have discretionary funds in their back pocket as it were. It seemed they could go to community functions and make on-the-spot decisions to hand over cheques for thousands of dollars. It seemed to some other community groups that this was unfair as councillors, through their discretionary funds, were able to favour some groups over others.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005876"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Seeney:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 It’s unfair to the state members, who couldn’t do the same thing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005877"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BOYLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection. There have been some members of this House who have expressed their concern about this. It is now historical practice. There were also concerns that discretionary funds were not properly and transparently accounted for. The Auditor-General reported on this matter two years ago and, consequently, a new framework for councillors’ use of discretionary funds was included under section 109 of the new Local Government Act 2009 and the Local Government (Finance, Plans and Reporting) Regulation 2010. This has brought in new standards of integrity for mayoral and councillor discretionary funds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005878"></A>
The key elements of the new standards are that a council must let the public know the amount of money in the local government’s discretionary funds budgeted for use by each councillor for a financial year by publishing, within 20 business days after the adoption of the budget notice, the amount in a newspaper circulating generally in the local government area and by displaying the notice in a conspicuous place in the local government’s public office. The notice must invite community organisations to apply for allocation of some of these funds and it must state how they should apply. Then the actual allocation of councillors’ discretionary funds must comply with that council’s previously developed and adopted community grants policy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005879"></A>
This will bring to an end a practice that has no doubt been enjoyed by a number of councillors around the state over these many years. It will bring a new and a proper transparency and accountability for this use of ratepayer funds and it will provide some confidence for community groups that they have a fair chance to share in the moneys available. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(10.15 am): I wish to draw to the attention of the House that yesterday, in line with statutory timetables, I tabled interim land use plans for seven newly declared urban development areas across the state. As part of the Bligh government’s commitment to managing growth across the state, we have tasked the Urban Land Development Authority to give consideration to new areas that could be declared as UDAs. In response, we now have UDAs that will help deliver affordable housing in regional cities, in resource towns and across the south-east corner. These new UDAs are part of the government’s commitment to improve land supply and housing diversity; deliver infrastructure and create employment; utilise best practice design principles to deliver a range of affordable housing options; and maximise sustainable outcomes.</Hansard-Body>

 Wait for it, Vaughan. Under the Regional Housing Diversity program, and in conjunction with the local councils, sites at Oonoonba in Townsville, Andergrove in Mackay and Clinton in Gladstone, totalling more than 130 hectares of land, will demonstrate quality planning and development policy outcomes and will deliver more than 1,300 homes to the market while injecting more than 2,200 jobs into the local building industries. In cooperation with local councils, UDA sites at Blackwater, at Bowen Street, Roma and at Moranbah, encompassing more than 57 hectares of land, will address land and housing supply issues in resource areas to meet the urgent need for key worker housing. These UDAs will deliver more than 800 homes that will help ease the pressure in local markets and establish mechanisms for overcoming impediments to a reliable supply of suitable housing stock while supplying more than 1,000 jobs to the building industry. In South-East Queensland, the delivery of the Woolloongabba UDA delivers opportunities for up to 2,500 homes to be established in an area that is located close to public transport hubs and within the inner city. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005885"></A>
The local communities for these seven sites will continually be involved as the development plans for these sites are progressed. This is part of the Bligh government’s commitment to engage and communicate with the local communities about our plans for managing growth. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.17 am): The Ekka is one of the biggest highlights on the Queensland calendar--an event that kids and adults alike look forward to every August. This year’s show was a raging success, with more than 400,000 people through the gates over the 10 days. I am very pleased to report that public transport once again played a big part in getting people to this iconic event. This year about 200,000 people caught a bus or a train to the Ekka. Ekka shuttle buses ran every 15 minutes until 8.30 most evenings from three city stops and the Windsor park and ride. The Exhibition train station was open and the Ekka loop operated frequently from 8.45 each morning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005889"></A>
The Department of Transport and Main Roads was on display at the Ekka this year. Many visitors to the stall were interested to learn more about the new Queensland driver’s licence, the secure ID card, which will be rolled out from later this year. One of the features of the display was an internet hook-up to the Here for Life web page, a site that allows people to put their knowledge of the road rules to the test. This proved very popular with young drivers. For those who have been driving for a number of years, our new refresher road rule brochure provided a worthwhile and easy-to-remember reminder for some of the dos and don’ts on the roads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005891"></A>
Public transport is the way to go when travelling to major events like the Ekka. Last year 2.3 million people took public transport to major events across South-East Queensland, including at Suncorp Stadium, the Gabba, Skilled Park and the Queensland Tennis Centre. Suncorp Stadium in particular has some of the finest public transport facilities in the world. So it is not surprising that when a crowd of 50,000 fans makes its way to the ground up to 90 per cent of them use public transport. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Hon. PJ LAWLOR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southport--ALP) (Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading) (10.20 am): Today I wish to note in this House the recent passing of two great Queenslanders in Mr Jim Atkins OAM and Mr Jeff McLean. These two men transcended their sporting endeavours and proved themselves to be great Queenslanders. We are all the poorer for their passing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005937"></A>
Jim Atkins was born in Grafton in 1916 and began training racehorses in 1936 following the death of his horse trainer father. Jim moved to Brisbane in 1941 before a stint in the Army during World War II, including service in Papua New Guinea. Then in 1942, Jim moved to Toowoomba, famously riding his two horses from Brisbane to the foot of the Toowoomba range. For 67 years, Jim produced thousands of winners from his Clifford Park base, dominating the Toowoomba premiership as well as winning four Brisbane trainers’ premierships and three Ipswich trainers’ premierships.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005939"></A>
But Jim’s fame did not come solely from his success in Queensland. He was a regular visitor to interstate carnivals and won some of Australia’s greatest races, including the Doncaster with his champion Dalrello and Queensland’s first AJC Oaks winner Just Now. Jim was an inaugural inductee into the Queensland Racing Hall of Fame in 2003 and is fittingly expected to be inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame next month. I wish to pass on my condolences and those of everyone here, I am sure, as well as those in the Queensland racing industry to his wife, Merna, and son, John.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005945"></A>
One of the biggest funerals ever witnessed in Ipswich was held at St Mary’s Catholic Church last week when we lost Jeff McLean after a brave fight against cancer. Jeff was only 62 years of age. My colleague Rachel Nolan knew Jeff McLean very well. He was a 13-test Wallaby winger. Jeff came from the famous McLean rugby family and carved out his own slice of the family history playing for Brothers, Queensland and Australia before a broken leg prematurely ended his career in 1974.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005947"></A>
With almost 40 years as a member, Jeff served as committeeman on the Ipswich Turf Club for more than two decades. I spoke to Jeff at the Ipswich Turf Club about three months ago. Although obviously ill, he was determined to fight to the very end, which he did. During that time, Jeff helped develop the club into the success story it is today, hosting Queensland’s best attended race meeting each year.

It would also be remiss of me not to note the retirement of the ‘voice of Queensland racing’, Wayne Wilson. Wayne is the nephew of the legendary trainer Jack Wilson, who trained Eye Liner amongst other good horses. He is also the son of well-known bookie Herbie Wilson. He began his race-calling career in Gladstone over 50 years ago. Wayne took over as the No. 1 race caller in Queensland following the retirement of Vince Curry in 1982 and since then his name has become synonymous with racing throughout Australia.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1005954"></A>
Alongside his achievements of calling champions, Wayne has been a successful owner, including winning the Macdougall Stakes with a horse called Do You Remember. I wish Wayne and his wife, Sally, all the best in their retirement. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Children in Care, Sports Kits</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Hon. PG REEVES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mansfield--ALP) (Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport) (10.23 am): Children in care will be kicking goals and scoring runs just like their favourite sporting stars thanks to sports kits provided by the Bligh government. Along with the honourable members for Thuringowa and Mundingburra, I recently visited Townsville to hand over the first allocation of sports kits to care providers. The kits, valued at $500, are loaded up with sports gear, including footballs, soccer balls, basketballs, T-ball kits and other sporting equipment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005962"></A>
The kits are designed to give children in care greater opportunities to get involved in sport and recreation. Many of these children, who have been removed from their families due to abuse or neglect, do not have the same chances to get into sport as other children, whether it is a simple game of soccer in the park or an organised sport at club level. The kits give them a taste of a wide range of sports so they can hopefully make a transition into more structured sporting activities and continue an active lifestyle through to adulthood. Most importantly, these kits will put a smile on the faces of Queensland’s most vulnerable children, such as those we saw when we visited these homes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005963"></A>
The benefits of sport and recreation are well documented. Sport can break down barriers and teach kids important values and life skills including self-confidence, teamwork, communication, inclusion, discipline, respect and fair play. Everyone should have the opportunity to get involved in sport and recreation, and I want to make sure our children in care do not miss out.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005964"></A>
These kits are in addition to the extra $1 million that the government allocated to foster and kinship carers earlier this year to help fund sport and recreation activities for children in their care. This one-off funding went towards an allowance of up to $300 per child for costs such as sporting club registration fees and swimming lessons. Through the sports kits and the extra funding for foster and kinship carers, the Bligh government is making sure kids in care get the same opportunities that every Queensland child deserves. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. A PALASZCZUK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Inala--ALP) (Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs) (10.25 am): Earlier this month I visited the University of the Sunshine Coast, where a new autism centre of excellence is being established. I was pleased to announce that the Bligh government will contribute $450,000 a year to the AEIOU Foundation to help run the centre. The centre will support at least 25 local children with autism--15 at the centre itself and 10 via outreach. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005972"></A>
This investment is another sign of the Bligh government’s commitment to strengthening disability services in regional Queensland. We are working closely with the federal Labor government. I was joined by the federal minister, Jenny Macklin, when she committed $1.8 million in capital funding to establish the centre. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005973"></A>
When the centre is up and running next year, it will deliver group based developmental and educational programs, speech and occupational therapy, and physiotherapy. The centre will also deliver outreach services to the Fraser Coast and Central Highlands regions. By the end of next year, I would like to see autism early intervention centres up and running in Queensland’s major coastal centres from Cairns to Coolangatta and providing outreach services to rural and remote Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005975"></A>
Last month I announced a $1 million funding boost for disability services in the south-west of the state. This is great news for south-west communities and it means that community groups from Ipswich to Quilpie can apply for a share of $1 million in extra capital funding to upgrade facilities and equipment. This will help these organisations to deliver day and respite services for people with a disability.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005976"></A>
Just last week I officially opened the new all-abilities playground in Mackay with the Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland. This new playground will give children with and without a disability a chance to play together side by side. The Queensland government contributed $283,000 to establish this playground, with the Mackay Regional Council contributing $120,000. This is one of 16 all-abilities playgrounds that we are delivering with regional councils under a $4.6 million program.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005978"></A>
We will continue to invest in stronger disability services in the regions to ensure that more Queenslanders with a disability get the services that they need. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(10.31 am): My first question without notice is to the Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services.

Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is right. The bomb squad, as it is colloquially referred to, is a unit that the Queensland Police Service resources and takes very seriously. I have met with many of the members of this particular squad. They interact very successfully with their interstate counterparts. They have set up the plans and the operational requirements in order to respond to a whole range of terrorism incidents and bomb related incidents across Queensland. They have been provided with significant resources by this government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007879"></A>
I am not particularly familiar with the issue that the member is referring to in terms of this particular replacement. As I indicated last year, I did visit the bomb squad and spoke to the officers. I viewed a whole range of quite sophisticated equipment that they have to deal with this issue. Obviously, I will look into the detail of that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007880"></A>
On many occasions the opposition raises issues about law and order. In this chamber they regularly talk tough about law and order. On many occasions when they were in government I sat here and heard them talking tough about law and order. However, let us go through some of the record of the opposition in terms of law and order and the resourcing of the Police Service, which is what this issue is all about; it is about appropriately resourcing the Police Service. When the opposition was last in government, the police-to-population ratio was about one officer to every 500 people in Queensland. We funded the Police Service to reduce the police-to-population ratio to about one officer for every 430 people. Since Labor has been in government, the crime rate has reduced by over 20 per cent. Why has that occurred? Because of the additional and appropriate resourcing that this government has provided to the Police Service. One of the key issues raised in the Fitzgerald report was the inadequate resourcing of the Police Service by the National Party government. That is the record of the opposition in this place. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My second question without notice is to the Premier. Under Labor, recent cost-of-living increases, as measured by the ABS consumer price index, included 22 per cent in household rent, 34 per cent in power charges, 23 per cent in gas charges and 32 per cent in water charges. We have had rises in paper rail ticket costs of 40 per cent and go card rises of 16 per cent. Because of the fuel tax, our fuel costs are up 17.5 per cent and rego is up 27 per cent. Premier, what hope can Queenslanders have that a federal Labor government will be any better than this state government? </Hansard-Body>

 They do not want to hear it. We know that the Queensland economy, once again, is experiencing economic growth above the national average. What does that mean? It means that, as we recover from the global financial crisis, we are delivering jobs. We went to the election and said, ‘You can count on us to deliver jobs,’ and that is what we are doing. What else does economic growth mean? It means that people have more opportunity to earn a living, to get wage increases and to spend money in the economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007889"></A>
The best thing that a government can do is work to ensure that the people they represent have real chances to get real jobs. What do we see from this government? We see a government focused completely on jobs. What has it delivered? It has delivered 12 consecutive months of real jobs growth. In the past four months Queensland has been the job-generating capital of Australia, creating more new jobs than any other state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007890"></A>
What do we get from those opposite? They complain about Queensland. They take every opportunity to talk down what is happening here. What does the rest of Australia think about that? By and large, the rest of Australia is voting with their feet. They want to be here because they understand what is happening. They understand that Queensland is an exciting place to be, it is the state of opportunity, it is the state of jobs growth, it is the place to bring up a family and it is the place to create a fulfilling life. Queenslanders are the envy of many Australians, so much so that they are voting with their feet and coming here. When they come they set up businesses, many of which create more jobs.</Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Yeerongpilly. Last week, along with the Treasurer and Minister for Employment and the rest of the government, I was very pleased to see that once again Queensland has been generating jobs. In fact, for the fourth month in a row Queensland has been generating more jobs than any other state in Australia. That is not happening by accident. It is happening because our government has a range of economic settings that ensure that we have the skills in the economy for businesses to expand and we are working to create, develop and nurture new industries, especially green energy industries such as solar and new energy industries such as the gas industry. We have programs such as the Green Army, which are delivering. All of that is adding to our jobs target. We have had 12 months of jobs growth, and for the past four months we have led the nation and we are ahead of our job-creating target. However, we will not take a step back. We will not be complacent about it. People will see our government focused on jobs and on jobs policy. </Hansard-Body>

Of course, we know that the opposition has no economic policy. We know that it has no jobs policy. Those who spend any time on the opposition website will know that its policy section is an empty zone. It is useful to look a little further on the LNP website, because if you enter the membership section it opens a Pandora’s box--a treasure chest--not of policy, though. What you will find there is more than 4,000 products for sale. It is the old LNP shop-a-thon. What sorts of products are for sale? There are no policies for sale.

 Thank you, Mr Speaker. We have made no secret of the fact that Queensland was hit hard by the global financial crisis--a crisis those opposite believe did not exist, just like former Prime Minister John Howard said somehow it did not exist. You can find economists that will tell you a range of analyses and a range of theories, but there is one absolutely independent, rock solid indicator of an economy, and what is it? Jobs growth. When jobs are growing, the economy is growing. When the economy is growing, more and more people are benefiting from it. What we know is that in Queensland--and they do not want to hear it--we have had 12 months of consecutive lift in jobs and for four months in a row the best in Australia. I will champion Queensland in absolutely every forum that I can. </Hansard-Body>

 I thank the honourable member for the question. As we have seen the federal campaign reach its final days, nothing could be more of a stark contrast between the choices facing Australians and Queenslanders on Saturday than the attitude of the two major parties to the national broadband network. On the one hand, you have Tony Abbott, who does not understand what it is. On the other hand, you have Julia Gillard and her team, who understand not only the power of a broadband network to bring high-speed capacity into businesses and homes but also how important it is to get it into regional and rural Queensland. You would think that those people who represent rural Queensland would be jumping up and down calling for a national broadband network. </Hansard-Body>

The Commonwealth government has gone out and engaged in consultation around this issue of bioregions. It has extended the consultation period beyond the election. It has committed after those consultations to further consultation around the impacts. The role of my agency is to provide information to the Commonwealth in relation to both commercial and recreational fishing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010152"></A>
It is quite hypocritical for members opposite to go out and state--as opposition leader Abbott said at a media conference in Mackay--that they would halt the bioregions planning process. Mr Abbott gave the impression that under a federal coalition government there would be no continuation of this process. All that coalition leader Abbott indicated was that it would consult further with industry. This is no different to what the federal government is currently doing with industry. It is going out and consulting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010153"></A>
It is a bit hypocritical for members opposite to go out and state that if a coalition government is elected there will not be any further bioregions. It was a policy of the Howard government to have a network of bioregions around the Australian coastline. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I can, and I thank the member for Broadwater for her question. It is lucky that I can update the House because we will not hear it from the other side. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute for consumer sentiment survey came out on Friday. What did it say? The largest rise in any state in the nation was guess where? Queensland. There has been an 11-point rise in consumer sentiment in Queensland following a 13 per cent rise in the month before. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010161"></A>
Did members see the press release from the LNP welcoming this result for Queensland? No, we would not hear about it. Did members see the press release it put out when we led the nation in jobs growth for the fourth month in a row last Thursday? No, we would not hear about that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010163"></A>
If we were a subscriber to the LNP website we would never hear about those things happening in the Queensland economy. Those opposite are too busy retailing the commercial junk to go out and retail the Queensland economy. They are too busy out there selling Jacques Bogart One Man Show Eau De Toilette Spray. It sounds like the favourite, the one-man show for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Or how about some Carolina Herrera Men’s Eau De Toilette for the bargain price of $72 for members? It sounds a bit like lady scented body wash to me. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010166"></A>
The reality is that those opposite have no policies. They have no economic strategy. They have no jobs target. They have no clue about what to do. All they have is a front for a commercial enterprise that questions need to be asked about. Is this being supported by taxpayer resources in the opposition office? Who is this company that is out there retailing this? Who are the directors? Where is it based? Are taxpayer funds being used to support this exercise? </Hansard-Body>

Mrs STUCKEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland. I refer to Labor and the Greens’ desire to decimate commercial and recreational fishing by flagging over 13,000 square kilometres of area off the Fraser Coast and over 3,000 square kilometres off the southern Gold Coast as future marine protected areas. Has the minister at any time asked for or seen any modelling of the damage this would cause the Queensland fishing and tourism industries or is the minister turning a blind eye while his federal colleagues do another sneaky preference deal with the Greens? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MULHERIN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I do not know about a sneaky preference deal. It is quite obvious that the Labor Party has reached an agreement with the Greens over a preference deal. That is no different to the Liberal National Party and its preference deals with the Fishing and Lifestyle Party, Family First or whatever.

The opposition leader, Tony Abbott, was quite hypocritical when he was in Mackay and stated that a coalition government would halt the process until it undertook further consultation with stakeholders. He has said that the coalition is committed to these bioregions but he will halt the process to undertake further consultation. This is no different to the federal government’s process that is currently underway where consultation is occurring with all stakeholders.

Mr O’BRIEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health. Can the minister please inform the House how high-speed broadband is already transforming health care in Queensland and how Queensland Health’s telehealth program leads the way as a model for the Gillard government’s telemedicine initiative? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012245"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. Queensland has one of the best telehealth programs in the world. Our network of videoconferencing technology makes it one of the largest in Australia and the largest providing health care, with more than 50,000 telehealth connections each year. New South Wales comparatively undertook 17,000. To give the House some of the growth examples for one year alone, mental health, psychiatry and psychology outpatient consultations went from 500 to 902 and outpatient oncology consultations went from 225 to 425. Patients in Toowoomba and Mount Isa can videoconference with a highly trained specialist in one of the state’s premier tertiary hospitals. A little while ago I was in Toowoomba with an anaesthetist and theatre nurse talking to a mum and her son in Dalby for the preoperative consultation. It reduces patient travel time away from home--no-one likes to travel unnecessarily if they can avoid it--and it brings health care to regional Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012248"></A>
In 2010 we invested $10 million for the telehealth expansion and in just 12 months we have increased the sites from 662 to 828. It is never possible to expect to have a specialist in every town in Queensland, as much as we would like to do that. We need to recognise that modern technology allows us to do something about that, and that is why yesterday the announcement from Julia Gillard in relation to using properly the $43 billion NBN money in relation to a network of telehealth consultations is revolutionary--absolutely revolutionary. People on the other side of the House who represent rural and regional areas should be on the phone to their conservative colleagues in Canberra saying, ‘Please match that Julia Gillard promise.’</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012249"></A>
There is a $392.3 million package including $250.5 million for 495,000 services over four years to rural and remote and outer metropolitan areas and including financial incentives for GPs and specialists to participate. One of the problems--and I said this to the rural doctors conference earlier this year and I have said it on many other occasions--is that you do not get paid from Medicare if you are the GP talking to the specialist with your patient in Toowoomba, Cloncurry or wherever. This will now allow that to happen.</Hansard-Body>

Queensland president Gino Pecoraro said that it is recognition of us going into the 21st century. In fact, in 2005 the member for Warrego said that we needed sophisticated telehealth services such as teleradiology, ophthalmology, orthopaedic and pre and post admission consultations. That is what he said, and Labor is delivering it. Julia Gillard will deliver it.

 The honourable member knows full well--this is an issue we have debated many times in this House--that two things have happened during the federal election campaign, and while I was on maternity leave the Minister for Disability Services was acting in my position. She wrote to Peter Garrett following on from correspondence that I had previously written to the minister about setting up a task force to investigate the illegal killing of dugong and turtles in Far North Queensland. This action had already been taken. Furthermore, a task force has already been set up by the federal government to look at this issue and it has already appointed liaison officers who are working with the communities in those areas to reduce the illegal take. However, what I have consistently said to the honourable member, who has in here and in the media continued to make allegations of illegal take, is: show me the evidence. Not once has he ever provided me with anything. I am happy to have a look at those photos.</Hansard-Body>

What I am very curious about is that all of the science shows that the best way to protect turtles or dugong is to protect their habitat. What is the LNP record when it comes to protecting the habitat of turtles and dugong? It wants to wind back the green zone protection that we have put in place in Moreton Bay. Moreton Bay is the largest habitat of turtles in Queensland, and those opposite want to wind back that protection. What postcode does a turtle have to have before those opposite start caring about it? How far up the coast does a turtle have to go before the LNP starts giving two hoots about it? If those opposite want to protect turtles, they will support us in terms of the protection we have put in place in Moreton Bay. What we are seeing here once again from the LNP is base politics.</Hansard-Body>

 I first of all want to dismiss rumours that it was the member for Currumbin hiding herself amongst the lemons in my backyard. This is a very important question, and I thank the honourable member for her question on a very serious matter. The fact is that our Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, is in the member’s electorate today and the Townsville area generally inspecting the good work the national broadband network is doing, something which will be privatised under Tony Abbott. So come the election result on Saturday, I want to know what is going to happen to the future of that. Are there going to be cables lying in the ground going nowhere--a bit like the Rockhampton Railway Station was in 1929 when the tories got in?</Hansard-Body>

I thank the honourable member for the question. During the last election campaign we went to the people with our Fresh Approach policy, which was about modernising our research and development. The member opposite is caught in a time warp. His view of the world is a view of the 1950s. We have gone about engaging with the industry sector around how we go about modernising. We are yet to determine a final outcome, but one thing for sure is that we will continue to engage with industry. We will be reinvesting back into the cereal industry through our disinvest to reinvest strategy. I see that that is no different from the draft Liberal National Party policy statement around assets that are either surplus or redundant--or not so redundant. They will look at those issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014354"></A>
In relation to grains research, the government is committed to funding grains research under a national RD&amp;E framework. That was agreed at a national level through the ministerial council. I note that the state minister for agriculture in Western Australia, Terry Redman, supports this approach to grains research. We will continue to invest in that area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014356"></A>
I want to draw the member’s attention to the fact that the Queensland government has invested pretty close to about $600 million in modernising our research facilities. Last week, I was out at Coopers Plains with the Premier and Senator Ludwig where, through cooperation with the federal government, we opened the new food and health precinct, which will certainly add value to agricultural production in Queensland. This will build on the work that we will do around food policy. </Hansard-Body>

The member for Condamine is caught in the past. He does not want to modernise. He does not want to invest in new facilities. We are certainly investing in the area of science. If he would like, the member could have a briefing on the Queensland agricultural food and fibre alliance that we have established with the University of Queensland. We have invested several million dollars in establishing that institute over the next few years. It will certainly bring a lot of benefits to primary production through--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs KIERNAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade. As the minister is aware, I have a very keen interest in renewable energy. Would the minister update the House on the progress of the Bligh government’s Solar Hot Water Rebate Scheme? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014365"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Mount Isa for the question and indeed recognise her very strong commitment to a clean energy future for her part of Queensland. Queenslanders are embracing solar energy and taking advantage of programs such as our new Solar Hot Water Rebate Scheme. I am pleased to report that, since 1 July this year, we have paid more than 2,397 rebates to eligible applicants. That is 2,397 applicants in just over six weeks. That is $1.65 million going to Queenslanders who are wanting to do the bright thing. When combined with the federal Labor government’s incentives, solar hot water has never been more affordable than it is now. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014366"></A>
The Bligh government is committed to tackling the challenges of climate change and it is also committed to tackling cost of living increases. That is why, through rebates such as our solar hot water rebate, more and more Queenslanders can not only benefit from the use of clean energy in terms of their solar hot-water systems but also reduce their electricity bills by up to 30 per cent simply by converting to solar hot water. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014367"></A>
This Bligh government also has a vision for a solar future for Queensland. That is why we are investing some $115 million over five years on a range of solar initiatives to double our solar energy production. These initiatives include some $35.4 million on CS’s carbon reduction program and nearly $30 million towards our $60 million Solar Hot Water Rebate Scheme and $5.8 million for the Solar Kindergartens Program. These are just three initiatives in our record funding that we have allocated in this budget and forward estimates for solar technologies in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014370"></A>
This is the single largest funding commitment to solar in our history. Why? Because we know that investment is needed in research and development on alternative energy options for Queensland, otherwise the realities of climate change will become all too real for future generations. During the initial stages of development it is not economically viable for private enterprise to invest in these emerging industries. So it is necessary for government to play a role and to fill the void created by a lack of return in the initial stages of technology development. That is why in north-west Queensland we have invested some $900,000 in the Cloncurry solar thermal trial to investigate an innovative way to store energy. Being new technology, there are of course associated risks. The initial advice tells us that, whilst it may not be economically viable technology, there are important answers in terms of how you store that energy using graphite. That is of particular interest in this particular trial and represents a good investment of taxpayers’ dollars. </Hansard-Body>

Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is not readily apparent to me from the documents that I have just very briefly scanned, but I can inform the member that the member for Forde has not spoken to me or contacted me about this issue. I am happy to investigate the matter further. As we know, from time to time development applications for quarries do cause community unrest and concern. That is why we have in place an exhaustive system, developed over the past 10 years, of identifying key resource areas and providing appropriate buffers around those areas for the purposes of quarrying in acknowledgement that there are impacts if quarries are developed too close to where existing residents are. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016589"></A>
The simple fact is that if we do not have quarries in close proximity to where development is occurring then the cost of those developments will increase significantly. The cost of infrastructure and the cost of building roads and bridges will increase significantly as a result of having to truck these materials long distances. That is why across South-East Queensland we have taken the responsible position of identifying where those key resource areas are and not allowing future development to impose themselves in close proximity to those areas. If we do not have those areas with access to South-East Queensland identified then the only place for these resources to come from will be west of the Great Dividing Range. Imagine the costs that that will impose on our hospital building program, our road building program, our schools building program--</Hansard-Body>

 Our farmers do believe in it, I take that interjection from the honourable member. The Bligh government has taken real action with real dollars when it comes to supporting our farmers and our landholders in combating the effects of climate change. In August last year members would be aware that we announced our climate change policy, ClimateQ, which included new programs and extensions to existing programs to help farmers deal with climate change, in particular in reducing their energy and water costs and making sure that they have access to funds for water efficiency. We also led the way in research in this area with a CSIRO report that we released here in parliament. That was a study that found great potential to lock carbon up in our rural landscapes. The Premier and I have lobbied the federal government to enable new programs to help farmers derive an income from locking up carbon in their landscapes. I am very pleased to inform the House that on the weekend the Prime Minister released her new policy, the Carbon Farming Initiative. This is something that we have lobbied hard for. We think that there is new incomes for our farmers in these green programs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016600"></A>
This is in stark contrast to the LNP and its leader Tony Abbott who does not believe in climate change at all. Mr Abbott has been struggling to the finish line--the election date come this Saturday--trying to stay on script. He has tried really hard to stay on script. He promised the LNP hierarchy, ‘I will not put the budgie smugglers on for the next five weeks. I will stay fully clothed’; he promised the LNP hierarchy, ‘I will not spruik the benefits of Work Choices. I will not talk about that for the next five weeks, I promise’. Tony Abbott also promised the LNP hierarchy, ‘I will not deny that climate change is real’, but whoops, he slipped up. We all saw him on <Hansard-Italic>
Q&amp;A</Hansard-Italic>
 and <Hansard-Italic>
Four Corners</Hansard-Italic>
 last night advocating that climate change is not real and, indeed, that the climate is actually cooling. This is in stark contrast to what we have heard ordinary Queenslanders and farmers say. They want real action when it comes to climate change. In actual fact, Tony Abbott has been trying so hard to pretend that he believes in climate change that he has had to steal a few of the policies of the state Labor government to look like he does. For example, he announced a couple of million dollars for a reef package. The LNP leader said that he thinks that it is a good idea to reduce pesticide run-off into the reef. What did the LNP members say when we debated that and they voted against it in this House? Those opposite said that it was not real, it did not have an effect on farming and there was no such thing as climate change. Tony Abbott is trying to get there but we all know what he thinks about climate change--it starts with C and ends in P. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs PRATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Health. Kingaroy Base Hospital has a staff allocation of five doctors. However, in real terms the five doctors are effectively cut to three with doctors taking leave for holidays, sickness et cetera. Since Kingaroy Base Hospital was transferred from the Ipswich Health District to the Toowoomba Health District, doctor staff hours have been reduced which has resulted in reduced after hours accident and emergency. Will the minister review why a reduction in doctor hours at Kingaroy accident and emergency has occurred since the change in health districts with a view to having those doctor hours reinstated in an ever-increasing busy hospital? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I am more than happy to seek information from my department with respect to that. A couple of issues that the member has raised are worthy of comment. The current federal government has indicated that it wishes to make progress towards local health networks. At the present time we have 17 health districts in Queensland. There is certainly some argument for examination as to the size of a couple of them. One of them is in relation to the Sunshine Coast, which takes in not only the Sunshine Coast area but also Wide Bay Burnett. There is a very strong argument for separating those into two separate districts. They would then be local health networks. Similarly, there is a strong argument for looking at Ipswich and Toowoomba. I think we can look at how we might align a number of those hospitals in the member’s area as well. In the appropriate time after the election, if the current government wins, we will talk to the community about what they see is the appropriate alignment for those districts. I think it is important for us to look at that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016606"></A>
One of the big issues that we are faced with in this election is a very clear choice when it comes to the provision of health services. My budget in Health this year is $9.99 billion and it is growing significantly. That is the nature of health demand. We have the second longest life expectancy on earth in this country. We have an ever-ageing population with ever-increasing standards of health treatment required. Prior to 1980 if a person required dialysis and was over the age of 65 they did not get it. Now if you are over the age of 75 you get it at the rate of 10 times the rate of people under 45 and it costs $60,000 a throw per year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016607"></A>
Health demands are changing. One of the real problems that we have is a shortage of doctors in rural and remote locations. One of the aspects of that is training more doctors. I cannot underestimate the importance of Julia Gillard’s announcement yesterday with respect to allowing GPs and specialists specific item consultations under the MBS system of medical consultations. It means that people in the member’s area where there may not be a particular specialist will not have to travel to a larger centre. That is fundamental. That is what modern broadband is about. That does not actually replace the importance of having more doctors in a hospital; I do want to make that point very strongly. Secondly, it is about training more doctors. We know that Tony Abbott froze the number of doctor training places. Peter Beattie--and he ought to be given great credit for this--increased the number of medical school places in our universities. We have gone from 250 in 2005 to 556 this year to 644 next year. They will then flow through. I think it is morally wrong to be pulling doctors out of Third World countries when we should be training our own with local kids. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020924"></A>
That is what we are doing and that is what we have ahead of us: more rural scholarships and more kids who want to be there. We will rotate more and more registrars and other positions throughout regional rural hospitals so they can see the secrets and the great enjoyment of living in wonderful communities like Kingaroy. Thank you for your question. </Hansard-Body>

Speaker’s Ruling, Notice of Motion Ruled Out of Order</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018793"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Order! Before I call the next question, I want to rule on a notice of motion that impacts, I think, on the separation of powers. The honourable member for Burnett has today given notice of a motion that is, in the chair’s view, unorthodox because it deals with matters that are usually in the province of those who administer criminal justice. It clearly raises issues regarding the notion of separation of powers. I have considered whether a motion in such terms and on such a subject is permissible or out of order. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018794"></A>
As I have previously ruled--and you can have a look at my ruling of 24 February 2010--a notice of motion is merely an incomplete motion; it is a proposal. It is for the House to determine whether it will agree to the proposition. As long as the motion, if agreed to, would not offend the law and standing orders and the notice is internally logical, coherent, contains only facts necessary and is able to be authenticated, it should not be interfered with, the matter being left to the House. As I have previously ruled--and, again, see my ruling of 19 August 2009--my role is to simply determine whether a motion is out of order in accordance with standing orders or the operation of the law. It is not my role to usurp the role of the House as to the merits of a motion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018795"></A>
However, the notice of motion as currently drafted is calling on the Attorney-General, not the House, to acknowledge an opinion that the Attorney-General may not genuinely hold. It therefore lacks internal logic. Furthermore, the notice of motion contains facts that need to be authenticated. I am therefore ruling the notice of motion as it is currently drafted out of order. However, I invite the honourable member to redraft the notice of motion and provide authentication for me to consider further.</Hansard-Body>

We saw it again this morning from the Premier, who was having a go at an LNP website and asking whether it is a taxpayer funded website. I can assure honourable members that it is not a taxpayer funded website, unlike the websites of the Labor members opposite. This is a typical membership rewards situation, not dissimilar to a union rewards website through which you can buy products. </Hansard-Body>

What you will not find for sale on our website is Queensland Rail. If you want to buy Queensland Rail, you have to go to the Bligh-Gillard Labor website. That is where you will find Queensland Rail for sale. What you will not find for sale on our website is Queensland Motorways. If you want to buy a highway or a road, you have to go to the Bligh-Gillard Labor website. That is where you will be able to buy Queensland Motorways. What you will not find on our website is Queensland Forestry Plantations. If you want to buy the right to knock down some trees and get some freehold land when the government said all it was selling was trees, you have to go to the Bligh-Gillard Labor website. That is where you can buy Queensland’s forests. However, you will not find the paperwork in relation to the sales because they have not released that, either. What you will not find for sale on our website is a port. If you want to buy an entire shipping port and corporation, you have to go to the Bligh-Gillard Labor website. That is where you can buy yourself your very own port. </Hansard-Body>

But hang on. If you went to the Bligh-Gillard website before the state election, you would not have seen that all these items were up for sale. They waited until after the election and then they put up the new special ‘Labor shop’, the Labor shop where Bligh and Gillard kept their sales secret until it was too late, the special Bligh and Gillard shop where Labor will not even let the public know what the sale conditions are and they will not even let the public know what has happened to the proceeds of the sale. Let us talk about what each party is selling. I have consistently invited the Premier to a public debate in a public forum so that we can discuss with real people Premier Anna Bligh’s and Gillard’s plan to sell off our assets under Labor. </Hansard-Body>

This morning we have seen the parliament reduced to an absolute sham. I apologise to those children who are in the gallery right now whom you have welcomed, Mr Speaker, for having to see the disgraceful contributions from the Premier, the Treasurer and the Deputy Premier. Not 10 minutes into question time they saw that this Labor government no longer believes that it needs to be accountable to this parliament. There seems to be some belief that parliamentary democracy is just an excuse to malign and criticise the opposition or anyone else who dares to express a view contrary to that deigned to be acceptable by the Queensland ALP. I apologise to those children here today who have seen this government’s version of democracy. Government members come in here day after parliamentary day and they hoot and fall about, laughing at their own supreme wit and wisdom. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018819"></A>
I have news for those ALP members who so rejoice in their parliamentary hysterics: Queenslanders are not laughing with them. In fact, they are not even laughing at them. Queenslanders have seen enough of their antics and clowning around and they know that democracy is not supposed to be that way. These children will return to their classrooms tomorrow and hopefully they will not say to their parents tonight, ‘I saw the Treasurer, the member for Mount Coot-tha, who looks like he is not much older than us, and he was screaming and yelling and telling jokes about the parliamentary process, and the Premier and the Deputy Premier were no better.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018820"></A>
The Queenslanders whom I talk to are disappointed that a Premier, Treasurer, Deputy Premier or minister of the Crown would stoop to such unbecoming behaviour. As I have already said, every day during question time there are schoolchildren in the gallery. The Speaker acknowledges them, but the ALP members in this place pay them little respect. How can they justify their behaviour to the children who sit upstairs to witness our democracy in action? I am routinely dismayed by the display that they witness. Do those children leave this place with a sense of the importance of our democratic institutions, or do they go home and ask their parents at the dinner table why elected grown-ups behave like children? </Hansard-Body>

Over the weekend I had the opportunity to read the submissions of the Clerk and the Speaker with regard to the review of the committee system. Both are well researched and thought out documents that acknowledge that the current system of parliament is dominated by the government. Ministerial statements were once reserved for issues of state importance. We all know that they are now a clearing house for unreported press releases that are wasting the parliament’s time. This morning’s contribution from the minister for tourism was an adjournment speech, not a ministerial statement. The Clerk’s submission points out that there has been exponential growth in the use of ministerial statements to the detriment of non-ministerial members. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018824"></A>
 In 1994 ministerial statements averaged 1.9 per sitting day. In 2010 the government is bombarding us with nearly 18 per day. The Clerk’s submission makes clear that the 70 other members of the parliament, excluding the Speaker, are allocated just an average of three minutes per week to address matters of their choosing. The statistics included in the submission of the Speaker make it clear that six times as much time is taken by ministerial statements as compared with private members’ statements. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion, from reading the submissions of the Clerk and the Speaker, that Queensland Labor has systematically squeezed the life out of parliamentary democracy over the past decade through amendments to parliamentary procedure and practice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018825"></A>
The sessional orders have been amended to increase the opportunity for self-praise and decrease the opportunity for scrutiny. Question time has become answerless and, as we have seen, it has become theatre. This long-term Labor government has become so focused at holding on to power that it has trampled over the very organ that delivers it, because the traditional parliamentary democracy also delivers accountability, and it is accountability that this government is most afraid of. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018826"></A>
No doubt tomorrow and for every sitting day until the next state election we, the people of Queensland, will again suffer through the smug, goading, self-praise and mockery that has become the norm in this place. However, ALP members should keep this in mind: while they are laughing away in here, the public is not laughing with them. They are not laughing at them. They are waiting with baseball bats at the ready because of the statistics that I highlighted in my question this morning to the Premier that, once again, she refused to answer. That question included the following statistics: ABS CPI index increases of 22 per cent in household rent, 34 per cent in power charges, 23 per cent in gas and 32 per cent in water charges. There have been rises in paper rail ticket costs of 40 per cent and go card rises of 16 per cent. Fuel costs are up 17.5 per cent and rego is up 27 per cent. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is for the benefit of members, who will be able to see how mind-numbingly out of touch this Treasurer is, because it is 32 pages of drivel. He begins by sucking up to his alma mater and the people in the audience but then, for 32 pages, says absolutely nothing. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1021074"></A>
Our economy is suffering a case of long-term ‘Laboritis’. This morning the honourable shadow Treasurer referred to five reports by the major banks Westpac, CommSec, NAB, CCIQ and Access. When the Access Economics report was released the Treasurer released a press release that stated that the economy was on the right track. This Treasurer cannot lie straight in bed, because his phrase ‘Queensland is headed in the right direction’ does not appear in the Access Economics report. He should be sanctioned, but instead he is lampooned by his own ridiculous spin. All five reports slam the economic ineptitude of the Bligh Labor government and, of course, business conditions are very weak and poor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021075"></A>
Today the Treasurer wanted to come into this place and spruik the unemployment statistics, but we now have 136,000 unemployed, up from 114,000. This is what he considers to be the clever use of statistics, which again shows how out of touch he is with people on the ground throughout the state, because we have more people unemployed than we did last year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021076"></A>
Only this Treasurer could come in here and somehow proclaim that this state is leading the nation when we know that interstate migration is declining, because this is not the place it was. We know that it can be better. We know that the Treasurer is completely out of touch and the Premier is out of touch. We know that they went broke in a boom. Their performance is terrible and their negligent handling of Queenslanders’ livelihoods is criminal. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Pacific Motorway, Funding</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Mr MOORHEAD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Waterford--ALP) (11.41 am): Logan residents see real action every day when it comes to road funding, with $420 million of congestion-busting roadworks underway at the Springwood-Daisy Hills section of the Pacific Motorway upgrade, particularly around the Loganlea Road interchange. However, this project is just one part of more than $900 million being spent on the Pacific Motorway in Logan and on the Gold Coast. Those projects simply would not be possible without the partnership of the Queensland Labor government and an Australian Labor government. This can be seen so clearly when we look at what happened under 12 years of the Howard government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021080"></A>
For 12 years, when Tony Abbott was a member of the federal government, the Australian government did not provide one cent of funding for works on the Pacific Motorway. For 12 years, the Tony Abbott and John Howard government did absolutely nothing for motorists on the Pacific Motorway. They ducked and weaved, telling Queenslanders that they did not have any responsibility for a National Highway, even when the Queensland government offered to equally share costs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021081"></A>
Let us compare this to the proud record of the Australian Labor government. Prior to the 2007 election, with Julia Gillard in the cabinet Labor committed to funding the Pacific Motorway upgrade and to working with the Queensland government, not against it. Only two years after being elected, our local federal member of parliament, Brett Raguse, was there to turn the first sod on the Pacific Motorway upgrade at the Springwood-Daisy Hill section. The evidence of real action is there for everyone to see. Every day excavators, cranes and pile-drivers are working to deliver results for motorists on the Pacific Motorway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021085"></A>
The greatest hypocrisy is that so much of this phony inaction comes from LNP members of this House who shamelessly criticise this government and the Australian government for the infrastructure program on the Pacific Motorway. They toadied to a federal Liberal government that neglected and ignored the Pacific Motorway and treated the people they represent with contempt. They ignored Logan and took the Gold Coast for granted, but as soon as John Howard and Tony Abbott were voted out of government they started a partisan campaign against the federal government. If we look at the LNP’s history on the issue of funding for the Pacific Motorway we see their whining and carping as nothing more than hollow rhetoric. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021086"></A>
Regardless of the politics of the Australian government, I have called and will continue to call on the Australian government to commit to funding for the Pacific Motorway. Along with fellow Logan members of parliament, I lobbied the Howard government and the Labor opposition to commit to funding those important projects. It was so important that the 2007 election saw a commitment that the Labor government could deliver on within weeks of coming to office. I will continue to lobby for the Labor government to continue its funding commitment for the Pacific Motorway. I am eternally grateful that federal Labor could come to the party on the Pacific Motorway upgrade. It will make a real difference for Logan motorists, but there is still more to do. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1021088"></A>
The Gillard government is a government that wants to build Australia. It is a government committed to infrastructure for our outer suburbs, whether to the broadband network or to our roads and public transport. Tony Abbott’s only commitment to the outer suburbs is to cut the services that our families rely on. But LNP hypocrisy knows no bounds when we see LNP members of this place standing beside a campaign for federal funding for the Gold Coast rail line. Tony Abbott proudly announced to his own electorate that public transport infrastructure was never a federal government responsibility--that is until he was forced to override his own LNP candidate in Petrie, Dean Teasdale, to match Labor’s commitment to the Petrie to Kippa-Ring rail line. It is not just that Tony Abbott will not fund public transport infrastructure; he hates it. In 2009, when riding on public transport, Tony Abbott said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021091"></A>
There just aren’t enough people wanting to go from a particular place to a particular destination at a particular time to justify any vehicle larger than a car and cars need roads. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021092"></A>
I have a message for Mr Abbott: if he comes to the outer suburbs I will tell him how important train and bus services are and what they mean for people trying to make ends meet and get a job. Even yesterday he stood by his opposition to public transport infrastructure. When it comes to supporting the Gold Coast rail line, the LNP will not stand up for it; they will only stand against government investment in public transport. Every time they whine and carp, I intend to remind LNP members of the LNP’s history of neglect and opposition to public transport for the outer suburbs. At least the member for Lockyer was honest in his views when he described public transport as ‘middle class welfare’. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(Brisbane Central--ALP) (11.46 am): On Friday, 18 June, transport minister Rachel Nolan and I joined hundreds of workers in a celebration to mark the first tunnel breakthrough in the construction of Airport Link, Australia’s longest road tunnel. The breakthrough occurred in the northbound Airport Link tunnel, 629 metres from the project’s Truro Street tunnel portal and 833 metres from the Bowen Hills end. The 135-tonne road header, travelling south from Windsor, cut through the tunnel face 22 metres below the surface of Lutwyche Road. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021099"></A>
The chair of BrisConnections, Trevor Rowe, and the CEO, Dr Ray Wilson, joined the minister and me in congratulating the 200-plus workers from the Thiess John Holland Truro Street and Bowen Hills tunnelling teams who were on-site to celebrate. The tunnelling teams have been working around the clock in Bowen Hills, Windsor, Kedron and Wooloowin to construct the two main 5.1-kilometre Airport Link tunnels. This important feat represents a significant milestone in Airport Link’s construction program since 24-hour tunnelling operations commenced in May 2009. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021101"></A>
It was a great experience to be there and to see the tunnel machines breaking through the wall. It was an experience I had not encountered previously. It was great to have some members of the public there, particularly Mrs Beres McCallum of the Windsor and Districts Historical Society. BrisConnections presented her with a mounted plaque of Brisbane Tuff and other rocks that have been excavated. I know that that plaque now adorns a wall in the Windsor and Districts Historical Society’s building. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021105"></A>
As we know, tunnelling is a very difficult and dangerous job, and there are a total of 15 kilometres of tunnel on this project. The Truro Street road header that broke through to the Bowen Hills tunnel is one of 11 machines excavating the 1.5-kilometre distance of tunnel between Truro Street, Windsor and Federation Street, Bowen Hills. It is a dangerous job, and occupational health and safety is very important in that environment. The tunnel crews have worked largely unseen to achieve this breakthrough, and their hard work will leave an important legacy for the people of Brisbane. It was great to welcome them after the breakthrough, as they came through the newly created hole from one side to the other. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021145"></A>
By mid-2012, Airport Link, in conjunction with the airport roundabout upgrade, will remove up to 18 sets of traffic lights for motorists travelling from the city to Brisbane Airport and Australia TradeCoast, reducing travel time by up to a massive 50 per cent. Our record $17.1 billion capital building program means that projects like this are delivering jobs--currently more than 2,700 and this is expected to grow to well over 3,000 in the months ahead. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021149"></A>
Airport Link has been undertaken, together with the Northern Busway, Windsor to Kedron, requiring 15 kilometres of tunnelling in total, encompassing road and busway tunnels and connecting ramps. A total of 17 roadheader machines are now carving out the Airport Link and Northern Busway tunnels--the largest number of roadheaders to be used on an Australian project. What a milestone! The tunnelling machines, weighing up to 135 tonnes, are making great progress, with more than four kilometres of tunnel completed to date. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021151"></A>
I also acknowledge the residents living around this massive project. I want to personally thank them for their patience. We know that there is much disruption. I will continue to work with them to minimise the level of impact of this construction site. I understand their issues and problems. I thank the minister and his office, and CNI, in all working together to achieve better outcomes for the residents in the area. I must stress that their patience and goodwill in regard to this massive project--probably the biggest that Brisbane has ever seen--is something that I welcome. I will guarantee that I will continue working with them to ensure that the disruption is minimal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021152"></A>
Here are some important facts: more than six million hours worked; one million plants, including 5,300 mature trees to be planted during the project; 10,000 direct and indirect jobs generated; 40 per cent traffic reduction expected on Lutwyche Road in 2012; in 2016, the busway will cater for 47,000 public transport trips per day--more than five times the current number; in 2026, there will be a bus every 20 seconds. This is a great project for Brisbane. We know it has been disruptive for the residents, and I thank them. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Callide--LNP) (11.52 am): The residents of the Sunshine Coast are the latest people in South-East Queensland to realise the enormity of the failure of the Beattie Labor government to manage essential services like electricity and water. The residents of the Sunshine Coast are the latest people in South-East Queensland to realise the extent to which they are going to have to pay extra every time they get a water bill because of the incompetence of the Beattie Labor government. Just like electricity prices, water prices have gone through the roof. The higher water prices and the higher electricity prices are presenting an intolerable burden on the cost of living for people right across South-East Queensland. But when they get their water bill and when they get their electricity bill every one of those people need to remember always that the increases in those bills for essential services are the fault of the Beattie-Bligh Labor government. They are the result of years of failure to properly manage this infrastructure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021160"></A>
Every resident across South-East Queensland should collect their water bills and their power bills and stick them on the fridge every month between now and the end of next year so that when they go to the next state election they can remind themselves why they should vote this state Labor government into the political oblivion that it deserves. Take your water bills and your power bills with you to the polling booth next Saturday to remind yourselves why you should never vote for a Labor government and why you should vote for a government that can manage infrastructure properly and why you should vote for a government that can manage money properly--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021165"></A>
Let us look at the real facts about water infrastructure. The government consistently released water from Wivenhoe Dam throughout 1999, 2001 and 2002. Then by 2004 we had a water crisis. There was no water infrastructure built in South-East Queensland from the day the Goss government cancelled Wolffdene Dam. They built nothing. They allowed the population to build up to an extent that we had the water crisis in 2006. In 2006 we had an emergency regulation introduced which saw some projects built that rate well with the BER for being a complete waste of money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021169"></A>
The centrepiece, if you like, of the so-called water grid was the Western Corridor Recycled Water Project. This government spent $2.5 billion of Queensland taxpayers’ money on the Western Corridor Recycled Water Project--$2,500 million. Today it stands idle, except for the production of about 30 megalitres--30 swimming pools of water--that the government forces the government owned corporations, the electricity generators, to take. They only take it under ministerial direction. But that is all that that $2.5 billion produces. The interest on that $2.5 billion is paid by every person in South-East Queensland when they get their water bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021172"></A>
Let us look at the Gold Coast desalination project. The government spent $1.1 billion of Queensland taxpayers’ money on that--$1,122 million--and it has been a lemon from the day it was first commissioned. It is still creating problems and it is still not producing anywhere near the capacity that it was designed for. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021174"></A>
I think the people of the Sunshine Coast would want to know that the doozey of them all is the northern pipeline interconnector and the Ewen Maddock water treatment plant. It was part of the Water Regulation 2002. It has cost $800 million. The northern pipeline interconnector was meant to transport water from Traveston Dam south to Brisbane--$800 million. Traveston Dam is gone, as it should be, but the government has spent the $800 million. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021180"></A>
The government wasted something like $500 million on the Traveston Dam itself--much of which it will not get back. It continues to waste hundreds of millions of dollars on water infrastructure that is badly planned and badly delivered. That is why the people of South-East Queensland will pay high water bills for generations to come. The people of the Sunshine Coast, the people of Brisbane and the people of the Gold Coast should direct the blame at the Beattie-Bligh Labor government. Take your water bills to the polling booth next Saturday. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WETTENHALL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Barron River--ALP) (11.57 am): Last week the results of a Queensland first survey conducted by Tourism Queensland revealed some very interesting insights into what Queenslanders think about the social impacts of tourism in their communities. It was heartening to find that the majority of Queensland residents, including those from Tropical North Queensland, agree that tourism has a positive impact in their regions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021195"></A>
The intention of the ‘Your Community’ social indicators survey results is to guide state and local authorities in their decision-making processes on tourism development. Tourism development that is in line with the wants and needs of the local community not only provides a more authentic tourist experience for visitors but attracts stronger support for the industry, which is a win-win for everyone.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021197"></A>
Furthermore, the survey has revealed that overall Queenslanders look favourably on tourism in their cities and towns. It has also highlighted that the majority of Queenslanders agree that tourism has a positive impact on the local economy, increases a region’s profile and feelings of local pride, and leads to new infrastructure and more interesting things to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021198"></A>
Almost 4,000 Queenslanders were surveyed from throughout the state. Ninety-two per cent either were happy with the number of tourists visiting their region or would like to see more. Of the 14 regions surveyed, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast and Tropical North Queensland residents were more likely to recognise the direct benefit from the industry and as a result were more likely than the average Queenslander to agree that tourism had a positive impact on their quality of life. Given that tourism is a mainstay of these regions’ economies, it is great to see that locals recognise its value. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021234"></A>
The majority of residents from the Fraser Coast through to Townsville and also up to Toowoomba acknowledged the benefits of tourists and supported the work being done by local authorities to bring more tourists to their regions. Residents in these areas also indicated they were happy for tourism development to continue. </Hansard-Body>

This inaugural ‘Your Community’ social indicators survey has established a benchmark for future surveys to gauge the impact of tourism on individuals and on their local communities. Tourism is a critical part of Queensland communities and it is important for us to know how to manage the future impact while keeping in mind local priorities and community feedback. The Queensland social indicators fact sheet and regional results can be found on the Tourism Queensland website. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1021237"></A>
Today I would also like to take the opportunity to announce the results of another survey which has revealed the take-up of environmental practices by tourism businesses. The tourism operators’ environmental indicators benchmark 2010 survey engaged almost 1,000 Queensland tourism operators to assess how they feel and what they think about implementing environmental practices into their business operations. The results highlighted that, while 99 per cent of Queensland operators have implemented at least one affordable energy-saving, water-saving or waste management initiative, half of those surveyed believed that there were not enough benefits or cost savings to justify implementing additional environmental initiatives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021238"></A>
Another finding was that a positive number of operators have made the effort to educate their staff or customers about environmental sustainability in their business, which is good news. For example, three in 10 operators surveyed have implemented a formal staff program on environmental changes. Tourism Queensland will use the survey results as a benchmark for the whole state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021239"></A>
Being more environmentally sustainable through the better management of resources, reducing consumption and waste and gaining environmental credentials to have a competitive edge ultimately leads to increased profitability. This school of thought resonates with tourists as the majority of survey respondents indicated that their customers expected them to be environmentally responsible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021240"></A>
People who adopt green initiatives at home are increasingly looking for similar green practices while on holidays. That is why Tourism Queensland has developed a suite of environmental indicators to use in this survey to measure and manage the impact of tourism on the environment. The indicators will be used in future state, regional and local planning and development strategies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021241"></A>
The survey comes off the back of Tourism Queensland’s work over the past 12 months with regional tourism organisations, councils and operators to roll out the Sustainable Regions project. The project is a first in Australia to work with regional tourism operators to transform Queensland into a domestically and internationally recognised sustainable tourism destination. The project has been piloted on North Stradbroke Island, Airlie Beach, Winton, Magnetic Island and the Pioneer Valley-Cape Hillsborough area and will roll out across other Queensland regions later this year. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Public Hospitals, Waiting Lists</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Caloundra--LNP) (12.02 pm): Despite the government’s attempts at spinning the release of the June 2010 quarterly public hospitals report, it represents more bad news for Queenslanders. On comparing the report’s figures with those 12 months ago, it is clear Queensland’s sickest patients are suffering longer. In June 2009, there were 3,672 category 1 and category 2 patients waiting longer than recommended. Twelve months later there were 5,237--an increase of 1,565 or 43 per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021249"></A>
Granted, there have been some inroads into clearing the waiting list backlog for category 3 elective surgery patients. However, this is to be expected when Queenslanders cannot even get themselves on to the list. The waiting list for the waiting list--that is, patients waiting to see a specialist at an outpatient clinic--blew out by almost 20,000 people in just a year to 199,457 as of 1 March 2010. In just six years the waiting list for the waiting list has almost doubled. We have no idea how long people are waiting for specialist appointments across the different specialities and categories because the health minister refuses to make this information available. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021251"></A>
Turning to emergency departments, things are no better. Our emergency departments remain dangerously overcrowded with 34 per cent of patients waiting more than eight hours for the bed they need. This is up from 33 per cent 12 months ago. One in eight Queenslanders are now suffering ambulance ramping--up from one in 10 a year ago. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021252"></A>
It is an absolute disgrace that in the face of these figures Queenslanders learnt that in the 2010-11 Health budget the health minister and the Treasurer have slowed down the rollout of important health infrastructure to shrink the large budget deficit. The health minister simply cannot justify the delay in hospital expansion projects such as those in Townsville and Bundaberg, to name just two, when waiting lists and times at these hospitals continue to worsen. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021254"></A>
The appalling figures in the quarterly hospital report are a direct consequence of 12 years of waste, mismanagement and poor planning from this state Labor government. Time after time we see report after report, audit after audit and review after review telling us that Labor continues to spend huge amounts of money without proper planning or assessment. Labor simply cannot be trusted with the $10 billion Health budget. Labor cannot be trusted to ever deliver health infrastructure where and when it is needed. Labor’s way is to deliver health infrastructure years after it is needed in its marginal seat. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021255"></A>
I can sympathise with Queenslanders who are frustrated with the way their health system operates. I can understand that many are looking to the federal government to fix health and hospitals. Unfortunately, passing health from an incompetent Bligh Labor government to an incompetent Rudd-Gillard federal government will not help because federal Labor are just as wasteful and even worse at delivering services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021256"></A>
Everyone recalls Kevin Rudd’s promise to fix hospitals by mid-2009. This promise was broken and the date passed with no action. Everyone recalls Kevin Rudd’s promises of 31 GP superclinics but only around five have been delivered and many are built in marginal seats in direct competition with long-established successful private clinics. Julia Gillard now wants Australians to believe she will deliver a further 23 GP superclinics even though her government could only deliver five out of the 31 promised in 2007. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021257"></A>
Earlier this year, in a panic, Kevin Rudd threw together a poorly thought-out health plan with as much detail as state Labor’s campaign costings. Kevin Rudd bullied state premiers to hand over GST and sign up to the plan. Only the Liberal Premier of Western Australian had the sense and the guts to say no. How could the Bligh government have been so reckless with Queenslander’s health by signing away to Canberra 42 per cent of our GST for a deal that lacks so little detail? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021258"></A>
From the little detail we have available on federal Labor’s so-called reforms, we know that it will not stop the blame game or cost shifting. It will increase the level of bureaucracy not decrease it. Even less of the health dollar will find its way to front-line health service than before. The states will be in control of the dollars and the local networks will not be local at all because local clinicians will still be locked out of the decision-making process and the networks will simply be existing health districts with the name changed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021260"></A>
Waste and mismanagement are in Labor’s DNA, whether it be state or federal. Queenslanders cannot risk their health with a federal Labor government with a track record of broken promises, waste and abysmal service delivery. The only way Queenslanders will see real action in fixing our once proud health system is to first change the federal government and then change the state government in Queensland. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms CROFT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Broadwater--ALP) (12.07 pm): If there is one program that has truly transformed the face of our schools recently it would be the Building the Education Revolution program. As the Parliamentary Secretary for Education I have had the privilege of visiting many schools over the past few months and every single one of them has a BER project. I have been out talking to principals, P&amp;C members, parents and people walking past in the street. These people know that schools are community hubs. These people know what it means to campaign for funds for their schools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021266"></A>
I can tell members confidently that these funds are being delivered and the proof of the pudding is in the eating. As a Gold Coast member, let me give members some examples on the Gold Coast. There are 162 schools with 655 projects receiving a massive $363.5 million in funds for libraries, classroom upgrades and school halls. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021267"></A>
Did Southport State School get an injection of funds and building work? You bet. It received $3.2 million for a multipurpose hall, resource centre and refurbishments, and the opposition did not want it. Did Surfers Paradise pick up much needed resources and building work? Absolutely. It received $3.2 million for a hall and library, which the opposition did not want. What about Currumbin State School? Of course. It received $3.2 million for a hall, library and smart digital whiteboards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021269"></A>
In my electorate, St Francis Xavier Primary School received $3.2 million for a new resource centre and new classrooms. Burleigh Heads State School received the same amount of money. Cedar Creek State School’s projects, which are opening soon, received almost $2.2 million. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021307"></A>
Gilston Primary School received $3 million for a new hall and Coombabah High School received $200,000 for shade sails, including funding for the upgrade of its home economics building. Every primary school not just on the Gold Coast but in Queensland has benefited, and still those opposite manage to sit back and plot how they would rob our schools of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They did not want it, they still do not and they are out of touch with their entire state by running an agenda that would gut our schools. But an opposition empty on policy is even sounding hollow on the issue. As newspaper clippings and school records will show, they have been turning up to BER openings right across this state, as have members of the federal opposition. Just ask Steven Ciobo and Stuart Robert, who are turning up at these openings and new projects trying to take some of the credit when they wanted to take all of the money away.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021314"></A>
You have to ask yourself why. If they are so stubbornly opposed to this revolution, why are they trying to plaster their faces all over these photo opportunities? I will tell you why: because they know these projects are a fantastic hit with the community. They backed a losing policy in opposition and are trying to switch the betting now that they have realised that this program has been a huge success in Queensland. But do not take my word for it; ask a parent, ask a principal and ask the students who are now studying and learning and playing in 21st century facilities that they deserve. The Bligh government and the federal government are spending $10 million a day on capital works in Queensland schools and the opposition would have gutted more than two-thirds of that figure. Non-state schools are benefiting too, as are small schools that would struggle to raise the kind of money needed to build quality buildings. At each turn in Queensland I see the benefits of this program. This is the single largest investment of capital into Queensland schools in the history of investment, and it has been a resounding success.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021316"></A>
These projects have also created jobs. The Gold Coast suffered more than most during the global financial crisis as the construction industry slowed down and people were looking for work. They found work on these projects--thousands of workers across the state, from our small contractors to our larger businesses that employ many people. The BER created work for these businesses, jobs for locals and unprecedented investment in our schools. I would hate to think what would have happened on the Gold Coast if the BER was scrapped like the opposition wanted. I would hate to think what might have happened in Queensland. That is why I want those members opposite to look our parents, principals, children and workers in the eye and tell them why they would have forsaken this program.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021321"></A>
Those opposite have no more fearmongering to hide behind, as three independent reviews have confirmed the greatest aspects of the BER in Queensland--the job building, the nation building and the quality buildings in our schools. They have nothing left except a hollow mantra that our schools did not deserve this and that our students did not deserve anything better. I do not know what planet they have been living on, but I enjoy visiting in my community and noting the real positive difference BER projects have made. I challenge the opposition to visit any school, speak to parents, students and staff and continue to make the empty argument that schools should have received nothing. That is not what a Labor government stands for. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Hinchinbrook--LNP) (12.12 pm): Two articles in the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 on 14 August by Kathleen Donaghey touched on issues that I have been pursuing in this place in respect of autism spectrum disorder.

<A ID="pgfId-1024609"></A>
The articles quote autism expert Dr Glenys Jones from the University of Birmingham describing Queensland’s two per cent of state school students last year being diagnosed with autism--a rate double that of the United Kingdom--as excessive and worrying. The articles also quote Professor Tony Attwood, an autism expert based in Brisbane, describing Queensland’s two per cent diagnosis rate as excessive by world standards and asserting that either something in Queensland is creating an epidemic or something is happening in the diagnosis that needs to be checked.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021330"></A>
The fact is in Queensland the Bligh government is not capable of determining whether it is one or the other because it does not have any reliable data to make an informed decision. During the hearing of Estimates Committee D on 16 July I referred to a 2007 report from the Australian Advisory Board on Autism Spectrum Disorders that stated that it could not use Queensland figures because Education Queensland declined to provide any data on the basis that there is no nationally agreed definition of autism and Disability Services Queensland did not keep ASD specific statistics. The articles revealed that a review into Queensland’s high rate of autism was ordered by the then minister for education, Rod Welford, but that this review did not go ahead. Evidently, no effort was made by DSQ to secure reliable data in respect of the prevalence of ASD amongst young Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021336"></A>
When I asked Minister Palaszczuk on 16 July about needs based mapping, the minister confirmed that needs based mapping has only been happening now in 2010--three years after the advisory board revealed Queensland’s data shortcomings. I also asked the minister, given that no needs based mapping had been done, on what basis DSQ had been allocating funding to meet the needs of Queensland children with ASD to this point in time. I acknowledged that the minister can point to funding provided to Autism Queensland and the AEIOU Foundation and the delivery of early intervention services in places like Bundaberg and Mackay and, as we heard this morning, the Sunshine Coast, and I welcome these allocations. However, what the advisory board report confirms and what this article reveals is that there is no rhyme or reason--no scientific rationale--behind DSQ’s haphazard funding for early intervention services for ASD across Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021341"></A>
What I want to know is how has the Bligh government been making its decisions about how to fund early intervention services for ASD in Queensland. In April this year I asked Minister Palaszczuk why the Bligh government was refusing to provide funding to Waminda Services in Dalby, a local disability services provider delivering services to the Western Downs and the Surat Basin. The minister did not answer my question in April and the minister did not answer my question when I asked her again during the estimates hearing on 16 July. The truth is that the minister did not answer my question because she cannot answer my question. The minister cannot tell this parliament or the parents of Queensland children with ASD why DSQ is prepared to fund the AEIOU Foundation and Autism Queensland but not Waminda Services, and that is the crux of the problem in Queensland and the reason I am concerned.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021351"></A>
While the minister has described the AEIOU Foundation and Autism Queensland as the major providers of early intervention services that have the capacity to deliver, there are other local providers of support services that have the capacity to deliver to their local communities. While I certainly wanted to draw to the attention of the House the plight of Waminda Services in Dalby, the parallel point that I have been trying to make is that the Bligh government cannot and has not been making genuinely needs based funding decisions because there is no needs based mapping data for ASD.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021353"></A>
In terms of delivering early intervention services for autism in Queensland, we are flying blind, feeling our way through and responding in an ad hoc fashion to an enormous outpouring of competing demands for support services across the state driven by a diagnosis rate double that of comparable jurisdictions that has been described by experts as excessive and worrying. The experts have been questioning the policies of the Bligh government in respect of who can diagnose ASD amongst children in Queensland and how resources are subsequently allocated. I thank Kathleen Donaghey for underlining the questions that I have been asking.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr PITT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mulgrave--ALP) (12.17 pm): The Green Army is an election commitment that is being delivered as promised by the Bligh government. It is a $57 million investment that will employ 3,000 Queenslanders during this term on projects of environmental importance. The Green Army is part of the Skilling Queenslanders for Work initiative in which the Queensland government in 2010-11 will invest more than $106 million to give job related assistance and skills training to maximise labour force participation for an estimated 24,000 long-term unemployed and underemployed people.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021358"></A>
Over the past few months the esplanade at Yarrabah has been undergoing an upgrade at the hands of 12 local men and women who joined Queensland’s Green Army. Yarrabah has one of the highest unemployment rates in the state and is still reeling from the withdrawal of the Community Development Employment Program--CDEP--last year, so this Green Army project was a real boost for these participants. The state government funds Green Army projects in part to achieve results like the Yarrabah esplanade project--attractive green spaces that draw in locals and visitors and teach them about caring for the environment. The changes that have happened to the site have been great to see. Their efforts--weeding, growing native plants, building garden beds, benches, tables, barbecues and walkways--have been a great benefit to the whole community. The state government also funds these projects so that participants can gain skills and experience while working on the projects.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021359"></A>
I was fortunate to be able to be there last week to meet with each of the program’s 12 participants as they graduated at the end of their 20 weeks paid work on the project funded to the tune of $191,980 by the Bligh government. This recent experience completing different landscaping and horticulture tasks, which included learning new skills and how to use tools and other machinery safely, will be a great asset when applying for jobs. They have shown a great attitude to completing the different tasks asked of them and they have also completed some accredited training for the certificate II in horticulture, so heading to TAFE and earning a qualification that will open up more job opportunities is now an option for them too.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021395"></A>
The Yarrabah Aboriginal Shire Council also deserves recognition for supporting, supervising and organising this project. As well as providing the use of vehicles and materials, the council provided great support and supervision for the group, which ensured that the participants gained a lot of valuable skills and understanding and their standard of work was very high. My congratulations go to everyone involved in this project. This group of people should be very proud of their work and have self-confidence as they pursue other employment and training options in the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021396"></A>
But where will those jobs be? When CDEP came to an abrupt end, much of the workforce was left without employment and almost all existing opportunities in Yarrabah were taken up, thanks to the good work of the Yarrabah transition to employment task force. The federal Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs--FaHCSIA--provided a subsidy to provide a bus service based around work hours in order to assist workers to access opportunities outside the community. But this service was an interim transition measure and to remain viable it must be subsidised. The withdrawal of the subsidy would make the cost of travel to individuals for work purposes prohibitive.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021398"></A>
After positive discussions with the state government, the federal government has extended funding for this service until October 2010. But where to after that? In addition to the funding for the bus subsidy, FaHCSIA provided further funding to the Yarrabah Aboriginal Shire Council to engage consultants to undertake a transport study regarding the internal and external public transport needs and options for the short, medium and longer term. For several months I have been investigating options for the continuation of the current service to allow time for longer term options in the study to be progressed. I mentioned earlier that Yarrabah lost its CDEP as it was not designated a remote area for the purposes of the program, largely because, when viewed on a map, it appears close to a major centre like Cairns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021399"></A>
Although the distance to be travelled may not be great, Yarrabah is an isolated community. People do not have access to reliable transportation--public or private. I am not aware of too many communities of 4,500 people that have such limited transport options. However, the community’s proximity to Cairns may yet be the answer, with a water based transport option a logical long-term option. A ferry service like the one that services Palm Island near Townsville would reduce the transit time from 90 minutes to about 30 minutes and would have the added advantage of opening up economic development opportunities for the community. This is an option that governments of all levels need to consider seriously and I am seeking the assistance of state and federal agencies to contribute to a feasibility study and a cost-benefit analysis to secure Yarrabah’s long-term future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021400"></A>
Of course, any talk of a ferry service would first require the necessary infrastructure. A jetty would be a multimillion-dollar proposition. So the discussion around infrastructure and who pays is critical. Then there is the recurrent funding that would be necessary to operate an ongoing ferry service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021401"></A>
Water transport could also allow tourist access to Yarrabah, opening up options for cultural tourism with subsequent jobs growth within the community. It may be that the construction of a jetty must be a development condition of any future tourism accommodation venture that, subject to agreement of traditional owners, would be located on one of Far North Queensland’s best beaches. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021402"></A>
Yarrabah has a strong pool of skilled workers who only need to be matched with suitable employers. But those jobs are in Cairns, not Yarrabah. If we want to combat high unemployment, we have to provide this basic service to get people to the jobs. The alternative is that they have to move away from the community to be closer to work. We have an education system and training and employment programs like the Green Army getting people ready for the workforce, but we have no service to transport workers to the job market. It is for this reason that passenger transport services must be a priority for Yarrabah in order for inroads to be made into unemployment in the community. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr McLINDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Beaudesert--Ind) (12.22 pm): Today, I would like to call on both the Leader of the Opposition and the Premier to, between now and the state election, hold a bipartisan forum on the roles and responsibilities of the state parliament itself. As simple as that may sound, I think that the time has well come that all levels of government need to have a bit of a reality check on their roles and responsibilities. The debate will always go on as to whether we are overgoverned or whether we are governed inefficiently. It is my opinion that it is probably both. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021407"></A>
I think that there needs to be genuine, systematic reform--and a genuine will from both sides of the parliament--of state parliament. Today is the first opportunity that I can place on the public record my draft model for the reinstatement of an upper house, which the Queensland Party will be running as a major policy platform between now and the state election. I have written to all 73 mayors across the state and have been liaising with many of those mayors and with many more to come. They have until 10 September to contribute to this consultation as we formulate a model for the reinstatement of an upper house. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021408"></A>
Over the years there has been a lack of will from all sides of the parliament to reinstate an upper house. I think it is absolutely essential that Queenslanders be given the opportunity to have a little bit more faith in terms of the parliamentary system which, currently, is fundamentally flawed. As things stand, mayors are largely powerless and councils are treading on eggshells, living with a sense of fear in terms of what they can and cannot do. It was Thomas Jefferson who said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021410"></A>
When the people fear their government, there is tyranny; when the government fears the people, there is liberty. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021411"></A>
That quote rings true when we consider the state of Queensland politics today. I think it is well time that the leaders of the major parties--the Leader of the Opposition and the Premier--put on the public record a draft model. I am not saying that my model is right; I am putting it out for public debate. I think we need genuine will from this parliament to ensure that there are credible checks and balances in the representation of the 4.3 million Queenslanders who, slowly but surely, are losing faith in the system that we call democracy here. </Hansard-Body>

Last year I met with the mayor of the Torres Strait Islands, Fred Gela. The people of the Torres Strait want to have their own territory, because they are feeling somewhat disconnected. It was only last week that we saw the north’s bid to split from the state. Only two of 100 delegates voted against the motion at a recent North Queensland Local Government Association meeting to split Queensland. I can understand their frustration. However, I do not support it. But I think the underlying factor is that people, apart from rural and regional Queenslanders, are starting to hurt. The people of North Queensland are feeling disconnected. The people of the Torres Strait are feeling disconnected. </Hansard-Body>

The draft model that I have proposed is that 45 seats will be reinstated in the upper house. Of those, 36 seats will have a four-year tenure and those 36 will represent the 36 most populated councils across Queensland. The remaining 36 representatives would rotate annually in nine seats. That would be 45 seats, which represents half the number of seats in the lower house. The 73rd seat would be the equivalent of the Speaker, which would be the Lord Mayor of the Brisbane City Council. This would also make sure that there are checks and balances and that there is a fair ledger. At the moment, power is centralised in South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021415"></A>
We need to understand that state and local governments need to work together. They need to have faith in each other--not to live in fear of each other, but to be able to work together and provide true representation. To date, it is the only model that I can think of that has been laid on the table that includes in this parliament local and state governments working together and also includes an Aboriginal voice and a Torres Strait Islander voice, both of which will be necessary. Any division on any legislation in this House would provide a trigger for it to go to the upper house. That would ensure that sloppy legislation is not passed in the first instance in this parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021416"></A>
I believe that this model has merit, as do many mayors across Queensland. As I liaise with the mayors, the communities and the councils over the next 12 to 15 months, I say that we need to have faith in local government and the state government being able to work together--not to take the water assets from them, not to impose a water bill separate from people’s rates notices and not, at a whim, to take any assets from councils that ratepayers have contributed to over the years. People out there are hurting. Their rates are increasing and their taxes are increasing. I think a mature approach would be for local government and the state government to work together. It is the only model that will create efficiencies for the state and local councils. It will require a clear and concise set of roles and responsibilities. I now put out the challenge to both major parties to put their model of the House to ensure that there is true representation and that Queensland is no longer, as Tony Fitzgerald would say, the political malpractice of Australia. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Coorparoo, Myer Building</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (12.27 pm): I am pleased to advise the parliament of an exciting new development for the Coorparoo junction area. As many members would be aware--particularly those from the south side of Brisbane--the junction at the intersection of Old Cleveland Road and Cavendish Road is the heart of the suburb of Coorparoo. I grew up on Brisbane’s southside at Holland Park, one of the many vibrant suburbs in the electorate of Greenslopes, which I am now privileged to represent in this parliament. As a boy I can remember going to the junction with my parents to shop at Myer at Coorparoo. In those days, the area was a vibrant commercial hub. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021422"></A>
Since then, shopping trends have changed and we have seen the growth of major suburban shopping centres such as the Westfield complexes at Carindale and Garden City. The departure of major tenants from the old Myer building at Coorparoo meant that this jewel in the crown of the Coorparoo business precinct lost some of its lustre. News earlier this month indicates that this jewel is about to shine again.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021423"></A>
The revitalisation of the Coorparoo junction will take a massive step forward later this year when new markets open in the old Myer building. These markets, which will operate four days a week--from Thursday to Sunday--should boost the local economy and increase commercial activity in the area. The new operators, businessmen Frank Dragani and Tony Abi-Fares, have signed a lease with the Department of Transport and Main Roads to operate the new markets for two years, with an option to renew. The markets will complement existing retail activities in the Coorparoo junction precinct, selling fresh produce such as fish and delicatessen items, gourmet produce and a range of variety items from budget fashions through to specialty clothing. This is a very exciting development and has been welcomed by southside residents, particularly those from areas such as Coorparoo and Camp Hill who use this area regularly. I have been aware of the community’s views on the vacant Myer building for some time. Reactivating and re-energising the Coorparoo junction has been one of my top priorities since my election as the state member for Greenslopes last year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021466"></A>
I am very pleased that we have been able to work with the local business community, such as local business leaders Cass Conwell and Peter Weiss, and the Department of Transport and Main Roads to arrange this new lease. I also wish to acknowledge the support of the transport minister, Rachel Nolan, in making this new retail development a reality. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021469"></A>
Any redevelopment of the old Myer building will complement the next stage of the Eastern Busway, which will include a busway station in the Coorparoo junction area. I firmly believe that the Coorparoo Junction site has the potential to support a mixed residential, retail and commercial development, making Coorparoo the southside’s own urban village and bringing further vibrancy to the area. A development of this nature would also fit in well with the Brisbane City Council’s Eastern Corridor Renewal Strategy. As happens throughout our city, the government wishes to work constructively with the Brisbane City Council to revitalise Coorparoo junction and to work in partnership with the council to explore the prospects of a transport associated development on the site.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021470"></A>
I also note that the traffic intersection of Old Cleveland Road and Cavendish Road is of concern to local residents. While these roads are council controlled roads and the management of this intersection is the responsibility of the Brisbane City Council, I am aware that the council is working on options to improve the safety of the intersection for pedestrians and motorists. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021471"></A>
The state government is also continuing to work with the federal government and in particular with Infrastructure Australia to seek funding for the next stage of the Eastern Busway beyond Main Avenue at Coorparoo. Obviously, the government’s long-term goal is to complete the Eastern Busway so that it will extend from the University of Queensland, through to Coorparoo, Camp Hill, Carina and Carindale, then beyond to Capalaba. Already stage 1 of this project, from the Eleanor Schonell Bridge at Dutton Park to the South East Busway at Buranda, has been completed at a cost of $366 million. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021472"></A>
We have now started on the $465 million second stage between Buranda and Main Avenue. This stage is scheduled for completion by early 2012 and will make an enormous difference to travel times for commuters going to the city or the University of Queensland, particularly residents of the electorate of Greenslopes. At the moment, funding for the next stage of the busway, from Main Avenue to Bennetts Road, is yet to be secured. This will be an expensive part of the overall Eastern Busway project. Early estimates indicate that it could cost upwards of $800 million as construction work will require tunnelling as well as cut-and-cover engineering work.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021473"></A>
The Eastern Busway will bring long-term gains to the community. I will continue to work with all levels of government to ensure the next stages are funded, built and delivered for the community. Regardless of the timing of the next stage of the busway, Coorparoo junction will always be a focal point for residents of the Greenslopes electorate. That is why the announcement of these new markets is so exciting. Along with other residents, I look forward to visiting the markets once they open for business.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<A ID="pgfId-1021486"></A>
I introduce a bill into the House today that reaffirms this government’s commitment to ensuring the highest possible levels of protection for children. The Child Protection (Offender Reporting) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 encompasses a suite of amendments to enhance the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004 and contributes towards establishing national consistency in compliance management and monitoring of reportable offenders both in Queensland and throughout Australia. To this end, the bill amends the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004, the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 and the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 2003. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021487"></A>
On 19 June 2009 the Ministerial Council for Police and Emergency Management--Police met and considered a report containing recommendations that sought to align jurisdictional responses for the compliance management and monitoring of reportable offenders. Following the work of the Ministerial Council for Police and Emergency Management--Police, the Queensland Police Service also undertook a review of the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004 and recommended further changes to enhance the existing legislation. These recommendations collectively underlie the amendments to be given effect through this bill. The amendments are balanced and justified with regard to respecting the rights of individuals but also ensuring the highest possible levels of protection for children as the most vulnerable members of our community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021488"></A>
The Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004 requires offenders who commit sexual or particular other serious offences against children to keep police informed of their whereabouts and other personal details for inclusion in the Queensland Child Protection Register. This register was established under the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004, which commenced on 1 January 2005 and forms the Queensland component of the Australian National Child Offender Register, ANCOR, utilised by all Australian police jurisdictions for information sharing relevant to compliance management and monitoring of reportable offenders and investigation of any suspected noncompliance.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021489"></A>
This bill will enhance the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004 and contribute towards national legislative consistency by reducing the time limit that reportable offenders will have to make initial reports as well as the time limit imposed to report the names and ages of any children living at a place where they generally reside or with whom they have regular unsupervised contact. The time limit for completing an initial report will be reduced from 28 days to seven days and the time for reporting contact with a child will be reduced from 28 days to just four days, imposing an obligation to report within 24 hours of three days contact with a child in any one-year period, whether consecutive or not. These amendments will effectively enhance the ability of police to monitor reportable offenders in the community and enable authorities to intervene in situations where children may be exposed to risk at a much earlier stage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021490"></A>
Reportable offenders will also be required to report telecommunication carriage services, internet service providers, email addresses and/or other electronic identifiers used or intended to be used. The obligation will contribute to monitoring and deterring reportable offenders from using such devices in offences against or involving children--for example, accessing child exploitation material and/or engaging in predatory behaviour such as grooming children via the internet. Reportable offenders will also be required to report their passport details as relevant to monitoring and provide verification of travel outside Australia which will contribute towards deterring child sex tourism and support investigation of it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021491"></A>
To support rigorous monitoring of reportable offenders who pose a risk to the most vulnerable members of the community, they will be required to obtain the Police Commissioner’s approval before changing their name. If a reportable offender proceeds to change their name without the necessary approval under the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004 there is provision for the registrar to correct the register under the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 2003 on application from the Police Commissioner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021492"></A>
This bill also allows for DNA samples to be taken from reportable offenders in certain circumstances if no record is kept. Although it is acknowledged that recidivism risk varies across sex offenders, it is considered important to obtain DNA samples from reportable offenders. The abhorrent nature of serious sexual offences warrants the taking of DNA samples from reportable offenders in the interests of facilitating investigations and providing the best protection for children.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021493"></A>
The increase in penalties for failing to comply with reporting obligations and/or giving false or misleading information from two years to five years imprisonment and the reclassification of these offences as crimes accurately conveys the Bligh government’s view about the seriousness of such offending in terms of the risk it poses to the community. Fines that may be imposed have also been increased, from 150 to 300 penalty units. It is expected that these increased penalties will contribute to compliance including by providing courts with a higher range of punishment that can be imposed, thereby helping to deter such criminal behaviour and ultimately ensure the highest possible levels of protection for children.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021494"></A>
The new class 1 and 2 offences to be listed in schedules 1 and 2 reflect, in part, recent amendments made to the Criminal Code Act 1995 and effectively contribute to the comprehensive coverage of serious offences against children. Significantly, the addition of the new offences will have a retrospective application because the definition of a reportable offender includes a person who has been sentenced and/or released from custody for a reportable offence--that is, a class 1 or class 2 offence--after the commencement of the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004. This will result in certain offenders whose convictions are in the past and who are not currently entered in the register becoming reportable offenders unless their reporting period is deemed to have already expired under part 4, division 5 of the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021496"></A>
New and additional reporting obligations will not apply unless the Police Commissioner has given a person a ‘notice of reporting obligations’ under section 59 of the act. Subsequently, it is maintained that these amendments strike the balance between having sufficient regard to respecting the rights of individuals and protecting children. In order to contribute to national consistency, courts will be given wider discretion to make ‘offender reporting orders’ with respect to non-familial child kidnapping offences. This will bring Queensland into line with other jurisdictions in terms of making non-familial child kidnapping a reportable offence.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021497"></A>
Finally, the inclusion of a declaratory provision in the bill is to put beyond any doubt that any disclosure or release of personal information from the Child Protection Register to corresponding registrars in foreign jurisdictions is and always was lawful. This is to address an anomaly which occurred with regard to information sharing with jurisdictions that introduced corresponding legislation after the commencement of the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004 and Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Regulation 2004 on 1 January 2005.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021500"></A>
I am confident members of the House will agree that this legislation will contribute towards national legislative consistency and enhance the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004 to ensure the highest possible levels of protection for children in Queensland and throughout Australia. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr DICKSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Buderim--LNP) (12.41 pm): It is with great interest that I rise to speak to the Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Bill 2009. I am glad that we are finally having this long overdue debate. On 6 August last year, I asked a question without notice of the Premier. The question was: why are illegal brothel operators in Queensland issued with token fines of a couple of thousand dollars, when legal operators pay $30,000 or more in government fees and charges? The Premier’s response was that if someone is caught doing something illegal and is fined, the government’s laws are working. That did not answer the question: why is illegal prostitution being treated so leniently in Queensland, which the Premier claims has the toughest prostitution laws in this country?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025164"></A>
Two weeks later, I asked a further question on this issue, following the release of the University of Queensland research report on illegal prostitution. I pointed out that the research found that only 10 percent of Queensland sex workers operate in legal brothels--hardly a ringing endorsement of this government’s prostitution laws. On this occasion the Premier seemed to take the issue more seriously and announced the introduction in the House of this bill that is now finally before us. I am very pleased to see that the government has belatedly seen fit to address part of this serious problem in our society. I do find it extraordinary that it has taken so long.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025165"></A>
It was 20 years ago that the Fitzgerald inquiry showed the links between prostitution, organised crime and police corruption. The CMC report regulating prostitution was released in 2004 and its follow-up report on the regulation of outcall prostitution was published in 2006. Finally, the government has seen fit to take some action. Whether it goes far enough is another matter.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025167"></A>
Queensland has had legalised prostitution for 10 years. That has not stopped illegal prostitution from flourishing in this state. One reason for that is the current legislation, which makes operating a legal brothel very expensive. I have already referred to the fees of $30,000 or more. That is what it costs to apply for an average legal brothel licence. A successful applicant then has to pay an annual licence fee of around $20,000 to continue operating that brothel. There are additional fees payable if there are multiple licence holders and for each manager who works on the premises. Each of the licensees and managers also has to have a current first aid certificate--a further expense.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025168"></A>
The average brothel would be required to spend around $35,000 in licence fees and related charges alone. I understand those fees are likely to increase again this year. That is a lot of money. While we may see it as a way of limiting the number of brothels in the state, the real consequence is to encourage people to operate illegal brothels. There is not much incentive to apply for a legal brothel licence when you compare the costs. No wonder there are only 25 licensed brothels in Queensland. The costs and restrictions make it very difficult to run a successful legal business. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025169"></A>
The example I used in my original question to the Premier in August was the penalty handed down on the Sunshine Coast to a man linked to an illegal Asian sex ring. He was fined $2,000, but no conviction was recorded. That is hardly more than a slap on the wrist for someone running a very profitable illegal business. That man’s alleged link to an overseas sex ring points to another issue: the connection between illegal prostitution and people trafficking. We are kidding ourselves if we think that is not happening in Queensland. People trafficking is in the same league as drug and arms smuggling. It causes enormous human misery and exploits some of the most vulnerable people in our society. It is, to a large extent, a hidden problem and difficult to get accurate statistics, but that does not mean we should ignore it. I note that there was a report published that 95 per cent of people-trafficking victims in Australia are women who are forced to work as prostitutes. Anything we can do to stop this should be done.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025170"></A>
There are many positives in this state’s prostitution laws. They prevent brothels from being established in inappropriate areas. They provide protection for both sex workers and customers through health and safety regulation. They set criteria for brothel licence holders and regulate advertising. The evidence would seem to suggest that Queensland’s laws have been effective when it comes to prostitution in legal brothels. What has not been addressed properly is the unregulated prostitution industry, which includes legal prostitution offered by sole operators, as well as illegal brothels. The lack of regulation of this part of the industry is extraordinary when compared to the strict controls on brothels.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025171"></A>
I am pleased to see that the bill before us addresses at least some of the issues relating to illegal prostitution as offered through outcall and social escort services. The CMC has estimated that 75 per cent of prostitution in Queensland involves outcall services rather than brothels. These services can legally be provided by a prostitute working as a sole operator who does not have to pay licence fees. Given the size of those fees, it does not come as any surprise that this law is being abused by those escort agencies that offer illegal outcall prostitution.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025172"></A>
Sole operators are not controlled in terms of health checks, which presents great risks both to them and to their customers. Sex workers operating alone are also vulnerable to violence and exploitation, particularly those who are street prostitutes. The latter are often involved in illicit drugs and may have additional health problems related to their drug addiction. They are very unlikely to seek assistance from authorities. The same applies to prostitutes who may have been brought in illegally from overseas to work in the sex industry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025173"></A>
It will, of course, always be difficult to control or prevent street prostitution. However, the government has missed a real opportunity in this legislation to address the problem of sole operators. Why should they not be subject to some form of licensing, which would include mandatory health checks? As well as providing protection to the sex workers and the community, this would provide authorities with a register of legal prostitutes. Such a register would help not only the police but other agencies, including the tax office and health authorities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025174"></A>
Clause 12 of the bill specifically excludes provision of prostitution from the definition of a social escort. Other clauses in the bill address how such services may be advertised. Advertising for escort services will now have to specifically state that sexual services are not provided. Further, the provider of the escort service is required to clearly inform the client that such services are not provided. While this in itself will not necessarily prevent illegal prostitution from being offered, it will make it much more difficult for those agencies to attract clients. Legitimate escort agencies, such as those who do not provide prostitution, will not be affected.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1025175"></A>
It is to be hoped that these restrictions will reduce the incidence of illegal prostitution being offered through escort services. This is a long overdue reform, as illegal brothels posing as escort agencies are flourishing. They are able to take out cheap advertising in the local papers and, because they do not have the massive licence fees and regulations that are imposed on legal brothels, they are able to charge customers a lot less. Recently I have been told of one such escort business on the Sunshine Coast that is doing exactly that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027785"></A>
Another avenue that should be considered is to legalise the provision of outcall services by legal brothels. I understand that this is allowed in Victoria. With strict laws governing brothels already in place, it would be far easier to police outcall services provided by them than by unregulated sole operators. This bill introduces to the Criminal Code a new offence relating to the business of providing prostitution by two or more prostitutes. It is appropriate that this offence should carry the maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment, making it a serious crime. I note that this will also enable the assets of illegal providers to be confiscated. We need to ensure that all penalties associated with running an illegal prostitution business are high enough to be a real deterrent.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027786"></A>
The amendments in Clause 16 are worthy of comment. A person who holds a crowd control licence is legally able to act as a driver for a sole operator sex worker, provided they do not work for any other sole operator prostitute. A person may also legally receive a message from a sole operator about their location or activities, provided the person receiving the message is not themselves a current sex worker or assisting other sex workers. Sole sex workers are currently allowed to have a bodyguard to protect them, and this is appropriate. The ability to send messages to another person, without that person risking prosecution, should provide additional security. However, I question how these provisions are to be policed, particularly in regard to allowing these people to work for only one sex worker. It will be almost impossible to prevent a driver setting himself or herself up in a nice little business with more than one prostitute. My understanding is that police resources are already limited when it comes to enforcement in this area. Unless that is addressed, illegal operations will continue to flourish. The amendment to the Child Employment Act to make it an offence for anyone under 18 years of age to be employed as a social escort is entirely appropriate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027787"></A>
In closing, I commend to the House the research I have already referred to by Dr Andreas Schloenhardt and the Human Trafficking Working Group at the University of Queensland. Their findings support much of what I have said today. I suggest that the research be used to consider further opportunities to reduce the incidence of illegal prostitution in Queensland. There is still not enough incentive for people to operate legally in this industry. There are experts who can advise government on how to improve the law and its enforcement. We should be making better use of those experts. I commend this bill as a starting point, but much more work needs to be done in this area. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind) (12.51 pm): In rising to speak to the Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Bill I acknowledge the previous speaker, the member for Buderim, and his great advocacy work. He has highlighted many injustices and inconsistencies in the current state legislation. It is largely because of his efforts that this bill is before the House today. I believe that, overall, the bill has the balance right. In its report the CMC said that it operated on the precautionary principle. However, I would like to see some adjustments made to the bill, especially around penalties. I will come to those very shortly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027792"></A>
I acknowledge the five aims of the prostitution bill: to ensure the quality of life of local communities, safeguard against corruption and organised crime, address social factors that contribute to the involvement in the sex industry, ensure a healthy society and promote safety. In the report titled <Hansard-Italic>
Regulating Outcall Prostitution,</Hansard-Italic>
 which informed this legislation, a former chair the CMC, Robert Needham, wrote--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027795"></A>
We were unable to find any evidence--and none was submitted to us--that legalising outcall services from licensed brothels or escort agencies in Queensland would improve the health and safety of sex workers providing these services, or minimise the size of the illegal industry. As a result, we are now firmly of the view that the risks associated with the legalisation of outcalls from either licensed brothels or independent escort agencies (which might include an expansion of the industry overall, and/or an increase in illegal activity either within the industry or more broadly across the state), are simply not worth taking.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1027796"></A>
I say, ‘Hear, hear’ to that. He continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027798"></A>
The CMC sees a risk emerging in this area if those illegal operators become more desperate for workers. These risks could include the importation of prostitutes from interstate, the use of illegal immigrants as prostitutes and the recruitment of underage girls. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1027800"></A>
In a very informative article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 on 14 February this year, Dr Janet Ransley wrote--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027802"></A>
But, as anti-corruption commissioner Tony Fitzgerald noted last year, vigilance is needed to maintain the reform agenda in the face of complacency and self-interest.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027804"></A>
It is easy to forget the scale and reach of the corruption that Fitzgerald uncovered. From the 1960s through to the late 1980s, crooked police at the highest level protected criminals who ran illegal activities in Queensland, especially prostitution, bookmaking and illicit liquor sales. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1027805"></A>
As as well as being harmful in all sorts of ways to the individuals who participate, illegal prostitution is also an indicator of a number of broader social illnesses or sicknesses, corruption being one of the primary illnesses. Ransley writes--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027807"></A>
Fitzgerald did not just expose police corruption but also showed how an ineffective parliament, a distorted and unfair electoral system, a moribund and politicised public service and justice system, secrecy, and a lack of modern administrative appeals and judicial review all acted to entrench and hide that corruption. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027808"></A>
I believe that the illegal prostitution that is happening today is being aided and abetted by the same systemic faults that have started to make their appearance felt since Fitzgerald brought down his findings. If we are to be honest, as legislators we are treating the symptoms and not the causes, which surely must include poverty, illiteracy, abuse, addictions to alcohol and drugs, untreated mental illnesses, relationship breakdowns, organised crime and, of course, outlaw motorcycle expansion. Just as surely as night follows day, wherever you have a growth in outlaw motorcycle gangs and organised crime, you will have a growth in prostitution. You will also have a growth in murder, money laundering, intimidation, extortion, arson, assault, robbery, theft, counterfeiting, and so on. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 How do you fix the problem? In a report titled <Hansard-Italic>
2005 National Gang Threat Assessment</Hansard-Italic>
, written in partnership with the FBI’s National Drug Intelligence Centre to aid communities looking for ways to address the problem, the then Texas Attorney-General provided three recommendations: first the problem has to be acknowledged, then the problem has to be assessed, and then the problem has to be acted on. In acknowledging the problem the Attorney-General said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027815"></A>
Denial is never beneficial. You cannot solve a problem until you admit that it exists. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1027816"></A>
Secondly, to assess the problem, the problem needs to be quantified. This statement worries me, because the CMC report states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027818"></A>
On the other hand, none of the stakeholders, including the QPS, could give any definite indication of the extent to which organised crime features in the illegal prostitution industry in Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1027819"></A>
Surely it should be a priority for the Queensland Police Service to work out exactly how big is the influence of organised crime in the prostitution industry in Queensland. The CMC report goes on to state--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027821"></A>
The other jurisdiction closer to home is Victoria. CATWA argued strongly at the public hearing that legalisation of brothels in Victoria has entrenched organised crime in the state’s prostitution industry. In its Shadow Report for the CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women) committee (Jeffreys, Chambers &amp; Spencer n.d.) CATWA claims: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027823"></A>
Australian states that have legalised brothel prostitution say that they aim to control the size and shape of the industry and contain organised crime. This aim has not been fulfilled ... Even the legal brothels may be connected with organised crime. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1027824"></A>
Of course, we need to act on the problem and, as legislators, that is what we are doing today by contributing to the debate and voting on the legislation. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027825"></A>
I would like to highlight for the House some of the issues associated with penalties as outlined in the CMC report, particularly those related to the employing or contracting of minors. The report states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027827"></A>
Currently, there is no law in any jurisdiction of Australia to prevent people under the age of 18 years from providing social escort services. We believe there should be a prohibition on employing or contracting a person under the age of 18 years for the purpose of providing social escort services. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1027828"></A>
I compliment the government and the police minister for picking up and following through on that recommendation. The report continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027830"></A>
The <Hansard-Italic>
Child Employment Act 2006</Hansard-Italic>
, which came into operation on 1 July 2006, prohibits an employer from requiring a child to perform work prescribed under a regulation under the Act. We strongly recommend that social escort services be prescribed under a regulation under the Act. Social companionship may operate as a precursor to participation in the sex industry, and we consider that the Child Employment Act should be used to guard against this possibility. The only legitimate social escort provider with whom we had contact throughout the escorts inquiry strongly agreed with this recommendation.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1027831"></A>
That refers to recommendation 10, which is--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1027833"></A>
<Hansard-Bold>
That the regulations to the Child Employment Act 2006 prohibit the employment of minors as social escorts.</Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1027834"></A>
Part 4 of the bill amends the Child Employment Act 2006. Under the prohibition on work as a social escort, an employer must not require or permit a child to work as a social escort. The maximum penalty is 100 penalty units. </Hansard-Body-Continued>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
In closing my speech on the Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Bill, I would like to acknowledge that the first priority for any legislator--indeed any member of society--should be to put the care and protection of children before all others. That should be our No. 1 priority. As reported in the CMC report, ‘Currently, there is no law in any jurisdiction of Australia to prevent people under the age of 18 years from providing social escort services.’ I compliment the government because this will be the first piece of legislation passed through any jurisdiction which, by amending the Child Employment Act 2006, will make the employment of children illegal. This bill amends that act by inserting a new section which states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1034684"></A>
<Hansard-Bold>
8B	Prohibition on workers as social escort</Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1034685"></A>
(1)	An employer must not require or permit a child to work as a social escort. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1034686"></A>
Maximum penalty--100 penalty units. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034687"></A>
But I make this point: is 100 penalty units enough? One hundred penalty units equates to $10,000. I find it very hard to come to terms with this fact. If you employ a child to work as a social escort, you are liable for a maximum penalty of $10,000, or 100 penalty units, and no jail sentence. If you shoot and kill a flying fox in Queensland you are up for a maximum fine of $300,000 and a two-year jail sentence. If you scare a flying fox out of a roost you are up for a $100,000 fine and a year’s imprisonment. But if you get a 15-year-old girl or boy to work as an escort, the most you can be fined under this law is $10,000 and no jail term. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034688"></A>
What are these legislative penalties telling us about this government and our society? Firstly, they show what the people who influence the legislators of this government value more--what they think should have a higher status. The wellbeing of flying foxes is obviously more important to them than the wellbeing and safety of our children. Secondly, they show that this government will do anything to appease the extreme greens--the Bob Browns--in order to get preferences to stay in power. Thirdly, they show how out of balance this state and country have become in their priorities. Small minority groups with values very different from ordinary Queensland families have a disproportionate influence and have imposed their extreme green ideology on our laws. If the Anzacs and the diggers who died fighting for us on the beaches of Gallipoli and in the ranges of the Kokoda Track were ever able to come back to life today and experience our laws and modern values, I am sure they would fix bayonets and be charging the steps of this place. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr HORAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba South--LNP) (2.33 pm): The Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Bill is an important bill in that it addresses four particular problems that are occurring and have been occurring for some time with prostitution. By supporting some of these provisions--which act against the illegal operation of brothels but which provide protection for single operators, which provide bigger penalties for those who use under-age people for prostitution and which provide for non-sexual advertising of escorts--in no way are we supporting the increase of prostitution. Rather, we see this as a way of stopping some of the more unsavoury aspects--much of it is unsavoury--or some of the worst aspects of prostitution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034692"></A>
In Queensland, the more recent history of prostitution has been that the Goss government decriminalised single sex-operators in the early 1990s and then the Beattie government brought about the introduction of legalised brothels during its term. At that stage we opposed that legislation vehemently. I remember speaking on that bill and saying something to the effect that it brought about increased opportunities for prostitution. It meant that in Queensland there would be decriminalised single operators, legalised brothels and a continuance of illegal brothels. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034693"></A>
One of the main reasons we have this legislation before us today is that criminal operators have been able to find ways around having to operate as legal brothels and have continued to run illegal brothels. You only have to pick up newspapers to see the expansion of prostitution in its various forms--be it single operators, be it pseudo operations through escort operations or be it legalised brothels. The operation of brothels and prostitutes, through decriminalisation of single operators and the legalising of brothels, has brought about an ever-expanding increase in this trade. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034694"></A>
I admire the courage and the strength of those people who fight to oppose the trafficking and the use of women in brothels and in prostitution--people who genuinely believe in the sanctity of women and who want to see young women in particular have every opportunity to have a good life without being forced, coerced or attracted to the trade of prostitution and all the unsavoury problems that it brings to them not only during their life of prostitution but for many, many years afterwards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034695"></A>
This legislation specifically looks at the issue of illegal operation of brothels. In the past they have been fined $2,000, and that has been compared to the $30,000 cost of a licence to operate a legal brothel. Therefore, it has become attractive to many people to operate illegal brothels, perhaps simply by bringing together an association or a group of prostitutes. The only problem they face is if they get caught--and it is a big ‘if’--and they are fined $2,000. That fine compares very favourably with the $30,000 cost of a licence to operate a legal brothel, let alone the requirement to pass various tests to operate a legal brothel. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034696"></A>
That aspect in itself should bring about a greater strength in trying to stamp out the operation of illegal brothels. But we do not believe that the fine that is proposed in this legislation is anywhere near strong enough to act as a deterrent. I look forward to the comments that our shadow minister will make when he brings forward amendments to increase this fine. The operation of illegal brothels, and thereby the unsavoury use of young girls being trapped in illegal brothels, could be possibly stamped out or greatly reduced if the government were prepared to accept the amendments that will be put forward by our shadow minister.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034718"></A>
Part of the baggage of the illegal operation of brothels is the dreadful business of trafficking young girls. We in Queensland tend to think that that is just a problem that occurs overseas in places in eastern Europe or in parts of Asia where young girls are trapped, trafficked and shipped from one country to another. When one reads some of the information that has been brought together by the academics that the member for Buderim spoke about, it becomes quite obvious that there is something going on in establishing these illegal operations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034721"></A>
Even here in Queensland--and we think of ourselves as part of the great nation Australia--there is this issue of trafficking. How many young girls are enticed to our state and then trapped in a system of prostitution, whether it be through the promise of work, visas or so forth? Of course it is the illegal brothel operators who are the perpetrators of this. The trafficking of young women is one of the worst trades in the world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034722"></A>
In Toowoomba we have had some people who have fought very strongly against this. They have had a lot of courage doing that. Some women in the Zonta Club in Toowoomba have felt that this is something that they should put their energy into. They have endeavoured to expose this to the rest of the world. It is probably one of the best things they could do for young women. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034724"></A>
This legislation also looks at what is called protection of the sole operator. I have heard some people say that this means that there will not be pimps. But pimps are people who live off the profits or the money that is earned by prostitutes. We cannot really describe these protectors in any other way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034725"></A>
This legislation allows sole operators to have a driver, a security officer or a bouncer and a message taker or phone operator. When talking about illegal brothels, the use of young women and the problems that occur with prostitution, we only have to think of these poor young woman endeavouring to pay the wages of those three people--the driver, the security officer or bouncer and the phone operator or message taker--to realise the number of clients they would have to entertain in order to pay those wages, let alone make the money they desire to make. I think this demonstrates what a sordid trade this is and the effects it can have upon young women in particular. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034726"></A>
This legislation allows for harsher penalties--and we support this--for the coercion of under-age young girls into the trade of prostitution. Whether the penalty is sufficient to stop this trade is a matter that I am sure we will address later on in the consideration in detail stage of the bill. The legislation also tightens the advertising arrangements for escorts and escort agencies so that escort agencies cannot be used as a front for prostitution. Whether or not that works is another issue. At least there are attempts within this legislation to address these issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034728"></A>
I know that later on our shadow minister will be moving some amendments to this bill. One relates to the penalty for the operation of illegal brothels. I believe that the penalty for operating illegal brothels has to be such that it absolutely stamps this practice out and no consideration is given to running an illegal brothel. The penalty if caught should just about wipe them out and put them out of business. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034729"></A>
Associated with that will have to be a real desire by the government to ensure that all these matters are properly investigated. I hope the police officers know that whilst these investigations can be difficult and they are busy with other functions the penalty that would apply, if our amendment was accepted by the House, would certainly make their investigation worthwhile and would wipe out some of these criminal types who are running these illegal brothels and taking advantage of so many young women and, as I said earlier, possibly even involved in the trafficking of young women, particularly from countries like Asia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034731"></A>
The other issue that we will address in our amendments to be moved to this bill, which I would like to speak to generally, is the existing rule within the legislation that when an application is made by somebody to put a brothel in a particular city or town those cities or towns with populations of 25,000 or under can veto the application. That means that cities like Toowoomba which have a population over 25,000 do not have the same right as those with a population of under 25,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034732"></A>
This issue has surfaced in our city when there was an application for a brothel. There was a major public rally prior to that application being accepted by the state government. This is an issue that the people of Toowoomba feel strongly about. They feel strongly about it from a moral point of view. They also feel very strongly about it because of the dehumanising of the young women who work in brothels approved by the government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034733"></A>
The people of Toowoomba, like I guess people in many other cities, feel that it is an issue that they would like decided by their elected local members, not by bureaucrats based in a government agency in Brisbane. They feel it is important for their city that they are able to stand up and have decisions made by their local leaders about young women being involved or having the opportunity to work in brothels. In the interests of those young women, they would like to see local people make the decision. They believe that that would mean that locally the decision would be no and they would not have a brothel forced upon the community against the overwhelming wishes of the people of that city. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034734"></A>
Quite rightly, they know that the expansion of the brothel industry means an expansion in the number of men or boys who would be attracted to use those facilities. They see that as bad for the overall morality of the city and community and a further lessening of standards. We see all the time a lessening of standards. People talk about, worry about and say that this lessening of standards is leading to more crime and more problems and what do we do about it. Here is an opportunity to do something about it and maintain some standards rather than having this laissez-faire attitude of letting standards slip further. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034735"></A>
The other very important issue--and this was brought up at that major rally in Toowoomba--is the opinion that is voiced by women who are involved in caring for young women who have fallen into difficulties and have very serious problems with drugs, domestic violence, prostitution and so forth. These are the social workers of the city who provide housing for young families in distress. These are the social workers who counsel young women who have been involved in drugs, alcohol and abuse. These are the social workers who provide care seven days a week, 24 hours a day and opportunities for young women to be taken in. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034764"></A>
These are the social workers who see the results of prostitution after talking to young girls who have gone away to the city and tried prostitution. These people have seen the devastating effects it has had upon their immediate life and they have seen the devastating effects it has had upon their future life. For that reason, those people worked hard at this rally to put in place that rule relating to towns with 25,000 people. Whilst the government has brought in legalised brothels, at least if this regulation was in place it would give local people and local leaders the opportunity to respect the very deeply held beliefs of people, to respect the standards of our city and to respect the dangers and try to prevent the dangers that prostitution and all that is associated with it can bring to the lives of young women. These amendments are very important and I ask the House, when they are moved by our shadow minister, to give them very serious consideration, because it will make our state a slightly better place if we are able to accept them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034767"></A>
In conclusion, whilst issues in this bill bring about a tightening of those four major areas that I have spoken about, that does not in any way mean that we on this side of the House support the expansion of prostitution. We certainly hope that these changes will bring about a reduction in prostitution and those things associated with it in terms of the harm that it does to young women and society.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (2.51 pm), in reply: Firstly, I thank all members from both sides of the House for their contributions to this debate. As I outlined in my second reading speech and indeed as many speakers have indicated, this bill endeavours to strike an appropriate balance between the need for strict regulation of the prostitution industry and also the need to address the social factors, and members have spoken about many of those issues in this debate. The main objective is to deter the involvement of organised crime in illegal prostitution activities and also to enhance the health and safety of those people who choose to work within this industry, however distasteful some people may find it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034771"></A>
The bill sends a very clear message to operators masquerading as social escort agencies. This debate has clearly identified that as a major area of concern, and that is why the bill contains some specific measures to address the illegal prostitution activities of that sector. The Criminal Code already contains a number of offences dealing with prostitution. In terms of the operating of the business of prostitution, those offences primarily target illegal brothels operating at a specific place. That has presented some difficulties in terms of enforcement, and that is why the new offence of carrying on the business of prostitution has been introduced with a significant penalty of up to seven years imprisonment. For example, one of the problems identified that businesses that masquerade as a social escort agency often rent office space to undertake activities other than the provision of prostitution, with the prostitution actually provided or delivered elsewhere, limiting the ability of police to target and prosecute people in that sector. This bill gives police the powers to specifically target that type of operation and indeed illegal prostitution providers wherever they operate and under whatever guise they operate. Illegal operators risk being jailed for up to seven years and having their assets seized, and I note some comments about the level of penalties and will make further comment about that shortly.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034773"></A>
In its 2006 review, the CMC found that the regulated industry of legal brothels did provide a viable alternative to dangerous illegal brothels. I take the opportunity to correct the record of my second reading speech and indicate that this bill in fact implements 14 of the 23 recommendations made by the CMC. The remaining nine CMC recommendations have already been addressed through non-legislative processes, meaning that the passing of this bill today will complete the government’s response to all of the CMC recommendations from that report.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034775"></A>
The bill makes it an offence for social escort agencies to employ minors and also for a person to obtain sexual services from a 16- and 17-year-old sole operator prostitute. That is an issue which a number of members have made comment on, and I will refer to that again later as well. The bill in particular regulates the advertising of social escorts and social escort services, and that issue has been canvassed widely. It will restrict the manner in which social escort providers advertise and create offences if they carry on the business of illegal prostitution. The bill also ensures that social escort providers comply with the same advertising restrictions as legal prostitution providers, and again that was an issue canvassed by many members. The bill also provides enhanced safety for legal sole operator prostitutes when attending outcalls by allowing the employment of a driver or a bodyguard and allowing a person to take an advisory message for a sole operator.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

I now turn to making some specific comments on issues raised by a number of members. In terms of the extent of the illegal industry, the members for Gregory, Aspley, Burdekin, Mudgeeraba, Gaven, Nanango and indeed others spoke about the extent of the illegal industry in Queensland, citing figures of around 90 per cent of the industry not being carried out in legal brothels, and that may in fact be the case. The members for Aspley and Currumbin cited a CMC report which identified that 75 per cent of sexual services are provided by outcalls, mostly illegally. The key message of this bill is that a great deal of illegal prostitution offered particularly through escort agencies is a matter which is addressed through the provisions which regulate the advertising and other measures. Those statistics do not reveal or highlight, however, the number of sole operators. So I think it is not quite correct to suggest that 90 per cent or indeed figures anywhere near that of prostitution activity in Queensland is indeed illegal. There is certainly a significant proportion, but I do not know whether there is any evidence to suggest that it is as high as what some people are claiming. The bill, as I have indicated, proposes strict and effective regulation on the advertising of escort providers which, on the evidence, are significant providers of prostitution services. Following the passage of this bill, those operators will find themselves on the wrong side of the law if they continue to operate in the way in which it is quite evident many are.</Hansard-Body>

With respect to local government input into brothel approval processes, again the members for Gregory, Aspley, Gladstone and Toowoomba South raised the issue of the power of councils to veto brothel applications. The current act of course does provide a provision where local government areas or towns with a population of less than 25,000 can apply for exempt status, and indeed, as the list of local government areas shows, that is quite extensive. I will be providing some response to that proposed amendment, but I would just say that if the amendment was passed it would in effect basically undermine the entire foundation of the legal industry in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034778"></A>
I am sure that there are many communities both within large cities and indeed in smaller communities that do not wish to have a brothel in their midst. I can understand that, but the government went through a very extensive consultation process a decade ago and determined that it was in the public interest to regulate the prostitution industry and simply allowing a blanket provision for any local authority to undermine that fundamental policy objective is something which cannot be supported, and I will say more about that when the member moves his amendment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034779"></A>
The member for Currumbin and others referred to the ability of a sole operator to employ a driver or a bodyguard. She raised the fact that the head of a security firm could act as a pimp to delegate, for example, 25 crowd controllers or bodyguards to look after 25 prostitutes. On the face of it, that type of activity would clearly indicate a collaborative effort between those individuals which would be illegal under the laws that exist and also the proposed amendments to the act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034820"></A>
Members--particularly the member for Currumbin--raised the issue of a recommendation of the CMC review regarding protocols developed between the Commonwealth and the state that allow for action to be taken against people using the telecommunications network for unlawful purposes such as prostitution. I can advise the House that those protocols are in place and that the police are already using those powers now under those protocols to, in effect, disconnect or disable telecommunication services where illegal brothel or prostitution activities have been mentioned. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034822"></A>
The member for Currumbin also raised the Project Axis report. Project Axis was an investigation into child prostitution and organised crime and its report was published in 2000 by the former Queensland Crime Commission prior to its merger with the former Criminal Justice Commission in 2002. For the member’s information, I point out that that report is on the CMC website. All four volumes are there and are, in fact, available for anyone to access. They are public documents. The Project Axis reports are now 10 years old and, although they are useful in some respects for historical research, to some degree they have been supplanted by the CMC’s own reviews into prostitution in 2004, 2005 and 2006--the latter report being the foundation report that underpins many of the amendments in this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034823"></A>
A number of members raised the issue of prostitution and links to human trafficking--the members for Maryborough, Burnett and Toowoomba South in their contributions today and a number of other members previously--and quoted from a University of Queensland research report into prostitution and human trafficking. I think it is fair to say that all members of this House would support the fact that trafficking of young women and children in particular is a heinous crime, is abhorrent and is something no society should tolerate. However, the same report that members quoted from also found that there was no firm evidence that such crimes are rampant or rife within Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034824"></A>
I think it would be fair to say that no-one could deny that there may well be some people who arrive on tourist visas or student visas and who may engage in prostitution activity illegally. Those people are putting themselves at high risk. If they are students here to attend courses, they are not only potentially ruining their careers but also committing criminal offences. A number of members have raised this as a significant issue and I recognise that they would be concerned about it, but I would simply say that the police advice to me is that, although it is recognised as a serious issue, there is no evidence of an endemic problem. But if members or people in their communities have evidence, I invite them to provide that to the police so that it can be pursued and prosecuted because, as we have all said and acknowledged in this place, this is an abhorrent activity that needs to be stamped out wherever it might be existing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034825"></A>
I will turn quickly to a few of the comments that were made today. The member for Toowoomba South--and indeed other members on the opposition benches--recognised at least that this bill goes some way towards addressing the issue of illegality in the prostitution industry and stamping out some of the worst aspects. There is obviously an illegal industry out there and there are probably some abhorrent practices taking place. No-one denies that. This bill and the recognition of the government that this sector requires regulation is a significant step forward in ensuring that we support the legal industry as much as possible and that we do as much as we humanly can to stamp out the illegal industry and all of the nasty elements and nasty aspects of it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034826"></A>
The member for Toowoomba South raised criticism of the $2,000 fine. The member for Buderim and the member for Kawana raised similar issues. On that issue I simply say that this bill provides the courts with the option to impose penalties of up to three years, five years or seven years imprisonment. The bill also introduces a new offence of carrying on the business of prostitution, with a penalty of up to seven years imprisonment. Although each of us may have a particular criticism of an offence against this act or indeed the penalties handed down in any case, we live in a state where we respect and uphold the right of the courts to make determinations on the appropriate penalty based on all the facts and the circumstances of the case. So whereas at face value a fine of $2,000 in light of a $30,000 fee to register or license a brothel may appear to be out of kilter, you would not only need to look at the particular offence that was prosecuted but also bear in mind that the courts have the option of imposing very severe penalties for illegal prostitution activities. Indeed, through this bill we are providing the police with stronger tools and opportunities to prosecute illegal operators and there are penalties of up to seven years imprisonment involved in that as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034827"></A>
The member for Buderim also talked about the 10 per cent of brothels operating legally in Queensland. I think I have addressed that issue. He also talked about people trafficking. The member for Burnett--and I acknowledge and thank him--recognised that this bill does get the balance right, but he criticised the penalty for employment of a minor as a social escort. Certainly, in that regard this bill picks up the CMC recommendation to make it illegal to employ a minor. The penalty is framed in the context of an employment situation. Certainly, if in that context there are any sexual offences or other offences involved, the Criminal Code and other acts provide for much more severe penalties. So I hear what the member says, but I think in the context of the employment arrangement that we are talking about that is the penalty that has been deemed appropriate in this particular case.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037941"></A>
I thank the government members--the members for Brisbane Central, Pumicestone, Kallangur, Toowoomba North, Springwood, Mundingburra, Bundamba and Keppel--for their contributions and for highlighting a number of the positive aspects of the bill. The key issues that they referred to were improving the safety and health of sole operators; the focus of the amendments to keep organised crime out of the industry; the tough sanctions against anyone using minors for the purpose of prostitution, either as an illegal operator or as a client; the sanction for those carrying out the illegal business of prostitution--the new offence that I have mentioned; the regulation of the escort industry, particularly focusing on regulating the advertising regime that they are entitled to pursue; prohibiting minors working as social escorts, which I have talked about; and also the certificate-of-discharge provisions to assist police in prosecutions. Again, that is an important element where clients, or indeed prostitutes or people working in illegal brothels, can receive a certificate of discharge on the basis of providing evidence that can lead to a prosecution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037942"></A>
In closing, I would like to comment that the member for Gaven raised the claim--and I was quite surprised at his claim, actually--that Queensland is moving quickly towards ‘a clandestine era of prostitution ... before legalised brothels’ as if we are moving back to the dark old days which occurred when the party to which he belongs was in power. For those who need reminding I point out that, prior to the regulation of prostitution, under the former National Party government the illegal prostitution industry was rife. They were the days of Premiers being bribed and criminals paying hush money so that they could continue to ply their filthy business. Thankfully, this government has had the courage to step into an arena which many people in the community find quite offensive--and I can understand that from a personal point of view. But a policy decision was taken. It was the right decision: to clean up an industry as much as humanly possible and to put in place a legal framework to ensure we keep the crooks out of the legal industry--we certainly have an illegal industry that needs prosecution--and to seek to improve the health and safety of those participating in it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037988"></A>
I note again that the member for Gladstone has put her personal views on the table in relation to this issue and I respect that. The member for Toowoomba South mentioned the strong reaction to the establishment of a brothel in Toowoomba. I met with a number of women involved in that. I have a great deal of respect for those women. They have strongly held beliefs and they prosecuted their case very strongly. The fact remains that prostitution has been with us for centuries world-wide. It will never be stamped out. We will never rid ourselves entirely of the illegal industry, but with proper regulation and proper enforcement we can at least try to minimise and reduce the criminal element to make that industry as safe as we possibly can. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037991"></A>
In conclusion, the bill does continue to strike an appropriate balance between the need for strict legislation to prevent organised crime and corruption from once again gaining a foothold within this industry and, importantly, addressing the social factors arising from prostitution. With those few words, I commend the bill to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 Explanatory notes for Mr Johnson’s amendments to the Prostitution and Other Acts Amendment Bill [<HypertextLink>

This amendment is important from the opposition’s perspective as it seeks to give local governments of all sizes the final say in development applications for brothels within their relevant jurisdictions. This amendment will mean that the assessment manager must refuse an application when the local government for a local government area has required that all applications within the area be refused under current legislation. Towns with a population of less than 25,000 people are currently not permitted to have a say in such applications and they must have agreements with the minister. The proposed amendments will remove the provision that requires further agreement from the minister when local councils require that all applications be refused. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038001"></A>
In his summary the minister made reference to what can be called the ‘Toowoomba clause’ or the ‘population of 25,000’ clause. It is about giving the people who represent these local authorities a say in precisely what they want for their city. Whilst none of us likes prostitution and brothels in our neighbourhood, I think it is only fair that these smaller cities be given the opportunity to have their say in relation to dictating their own agenda. After all, we live in a democratic society. It is the right of the people to have a say in what they want in their communities. As the minister said, this activity has been going on for thousands of years and it is impossible to stamp it out. At the same time, the opposition believes that it is the right of local councils to have a say and not be overridden by the government of the day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038002"></A>
This is something that local communities should be given the opportunity to determine. In some of those smaller cities it will be difficult to have these establishments placed where they are not near schools, churches, playgrounds or where children are participating in family activities, but placed near commercial type operations. At the end of the day, it is giving a say to the inhabitants of the city in question. This is about the democratic process being allowed to work and community members being allowed to have their say and, at the end of the day, representing the desires of the people in question. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038003"></A>
I urge all members and the minister to think about this. This is sacrosanct to some of those communities. They believe very strongly in it. As the member for Toowoomba South said, he has met with many groups in his community. I know the community of Toowoomba pretty well. I know the community groups in many other cities very well, too. It is a different situation in larger centres like Brisbane, the Gold and Sunshine coasts and maybe Townsville, Cairns and those larger provincial cities. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I know it is. I take the interjection from the honourable member for Toowoomba North and I respect what he is saying. However, the point I make is that a great majority of people in these smaller cities are going to be denied the opportunity to say no. Where the population is close to the demarcation of 25,000, those local authorities should be given the opportunity to say, ‘No, we don’t want this type of operation in our city.’ I think it is only fair that we allow them to exercise their democratic right to say no to this type of activity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040924"></A>
I appeal to the minister and the government to show understanding and fairness in support of this amendment moved by the opposition because it recognises the ongoing needs and the growth of these cities. A lot of them are young cities; they are cities where there are a lot of young people and young families and, therefore, schools. They are places where I believe we should be trying to promote a culture of liveability; they are great places for families and old people, great places for recreation and great places to live. While we do not want to burden the larger cities, at the end of the day we do not need to put in place an impediment or a scourge on these places because of a demarcation figure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040925"></A>
I appeal to the minister to give a lot of thought to this very meritorious amendment. It is one that I believe he will be rewarded for if he can show the people of these larger and smaller provincial cities that no is going to be the answer to placing brothels in those communities. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HORAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would like to support our shadow minister in this particular amendment. He has referred to it as being the ‘Toowoomba amendment’. The fact is that the people of Toowoomba had the courage to stand up and to attend in their hundreds a rally to fight against the imposition of a brothel on our city because they believed it was not the right thing for the city. Their right to make a decision on whether it was imposed on our city under the various planning arrangements was taken away from them because of this regulation pertaining to a population of 25,000. It was imposed upon them through a bureaucratic agency of the government. There was no say for the local people. Someone sitting down here in Brisbane said, ‘Yes, you will have it because it fits particular planning guidelines.’ The adjudication on the planning and the desirability or otherwise of a brothel proposed for a city the size of Toowoomba was taken away from the people and the elected local members, who know and understand their city, and was placed in the hands of a bureaucrat in Brisbane who is following the particular guidelines set by the government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040927"></A>
With amalgamation of councils, of course, the population of council areas is now even higher. No doubt many other smaller cities in Queensland will now be subject to this rule because the population governed by their council may be over 25,000. Pre-amalgamation, the population of Toowoomba was roughly between 92,000 and 94,000. Now, with the eight shires combined, it has around 160,000 people. Other areas of the state may well have had a population of around 20,000 or 25,000. As a result of amalgamation, they will find that they also no longer have a say. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040928"></A>
This is a matter of local people having a right to set certain standards in their own community. Yes, decisions on matters to do with legal brothels are difficult. As the minister and many other people have said, prostitution is one of the oldest professions in the world, but that does not mean it is right. We hear all the time that standards are slipping. The job is getting tougher and tougher for the police. We recently had a case in which police officers arrested someone at an event for using offensive language against them and the case was thrown out of court. The standards in our society are slipping and it is worrying parents and many other people, whether it is on TV, in publications or with the way people dress. Young people who are vulnerable can quite easily do the wrong thing because the overall standards of our community have slipped. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040929"></A>
That was one of the major reasons the people of Toowoomba in large numbers objected to the imposition of a brothel on our city. One of the other important reasons was that, through their practical experience of working with youth, young women and families, people in our city know the dreadful results of prostitution--the immediate results of prostitution on young women and young girls and the long-lasting effects of prostitution on the lives of young women. They know of all the fringe elements that surround prostitution and they have been there, as they say, from time immemorial: drugs, violence, pimps and other people living off the earnings of prostitutes. We have seen it even in this legislation where, for their own protection, this legislation allows single operators to have a driver, a phone operator and a bouncer. Those poor young women have to entertain so many more clients a day just to pay the wages of those three professionals they are employing. That really shows how bad this industry is. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040930"></A>
The people of Toowoomba, particularly the women social workers who deal in crisis accommodation and who deal with young women in difficult, unfortunate and disastrous circumstances, really believe that for the protection of young women, first and foremost, the local government--the people who are elected as leaders, who are in touch with the issues and the people in their community--needs to be able to say, ‘No, not in our community.’ That is what this is about: empowering people to say yes or no, not leaving this decision, which is an important decision for our local community, to bureaucrats in Brisbane doing the government agency’s bidding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043866"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The government will be opposing the amendment. Basically, it is based on a false premise. Obviously, I do not take away the concession that the government has given to communities of 25,000 or less to have that veto power. Indeed, I am advised that currently there are 204 such communities throughout Queensland. The amendment is based on the false premise that prostitution or brothels do not exist in many of those communities. Currently under section 64(1)(c) of the act, that concession is available to towns with a population of less than 25,000. If the opposition’s amendment was passed, basically the entire foundation of the act would be subverted. All of the consultation and all of the policy rationale for establishing the regulation of the prostitution industry in Queensland would disintegrate. Principally, that is the reason the amendment is being opposed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043869"></A>
In addition to that, it subverts the social objectives of the act where legal brothels are going to be in existence. The legislation ensures the sexual health of the community through mandating safe sex practices in those areas where brothels are established. The current legislation ensures the safety of sex workers in licensed brothels. It protects sex workers from exploitation and requires brothels to have acceptable workplace conditions and, also, heavily focuses on preventing official corruption and the involvement of organised crime. In my view, taking away that policy foundation--and, in fact, I am sure that many communities would pressure their councils into taking those decisions--would facilitate the expansion of the illegal industry. The current act and, indeed, the provisions in this bill provide a more powerful platform for police and the legal industry to survive. In my view anything that takes away an opportunity to establish a legal brothel in a community potentially will facilitate the expansion of the illegal industry within that particular community. On that basis, the government will oppose the amendment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043870"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am disappointed in the minister’s response. Again I ask the minister to reconsider. I heard what he said in relation to this. He talks about the expansion of illegal brothels. We can take Toowoomba, Bundaberg or any other regional city as an example. The fact is that the police are already overtaxed in their pursuit of illegal vice and illegal activities in all parts of Queensland, not just on the Sunshine and Gold coasts or in the greater Brisbane area. We will see an influx of criminal activity in some of the centres if the councils are denied the right to exercise their democratic right to represent their people. I do not take lightly what the people of Toowoomba have said. We can talk to people in many other areas of the state and they will all make the same argument. I think it is a fair argument and those people should be heard at this time.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043871"></A>
While there is no doubt that the minister has made up his mind and has outlined his argument for not supporting the opposition amendment, this issue will not go away. This issue is destroying the lives of many young women in our great state. It is a scourge on the lives of women. It is a denigration of their rights. They are being exploited by men who take advantage of them. Certainly we do not condone that behaviour and I do not think anybody in this House condones that behaviour. It is absolutely paramount that respect is shown to women. My point is that we have to look carefully at what the police are saying and work closely with them to protect the rights of local governments to represent the people and reflect what they are saying, as has been described not only by the member for Toowoomba South but also by other members of the House who have talked about other areas of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050042"></A>
If the minister is not going to support our amendment, it is important that he looks very closely at how we can arrive at a demarcation number. We need to be able to say, ‘Yes, brothels can go in here,’ or, ‘No, they cannot.’ I am not talking from a religious or family perspective. We have to give credit to what the community is saying. The local people who make decisions in their communities have to be given a say, because they act on behalf of the majority of people. I do not take lightly what is said by the people who attend meetings. They are leaders in their communities, they command respect in their communities and they have families themselves. They know exactly what this element will bring to their communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043873"></A>
I appeal to the minister: if he is not going to support the amendment before the House this afternoon, can he consider allowing for an amendment to be made in the future that will give security to cities by increasing the number? We do not all welcome this activity; we do not all think that it is a great thing. I certainly do not and I am sure the minister does not. I agree with what he says, but I do not agree that rights should be taken away from the relevant councils. I hope that the minister is able to revisit this issue and give the House an assurance that in time we can give some guarantee to larger councils that they will have a say in how they operate and how they manage their affairs, especially when it comes to the social needs of their cities, in conjunction with the laws that are made in this legislature. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043874"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HORAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In his previous response, the minister spoke about a couple of matters. He said that prostitution exists. Prostitution may exist, but we are talking about the desire of the people of a city to determine, through their leaders, whether or not prostitution is expanded in their city. There is no doubt that, with increasing levels of legalised prostitution in Queensland--that is, the single operators and then the legalised brothels--prostitution generally has increased because it is more available, it is more advertised and it is more open, simply because it is legalised. That is what is concerning local people. They are concerned for the young men of their communities. However, mostly they are concerned for the young women of their communities. Their first and foremost concern is for their young women and the overall moral standards of their cities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043875"></A>
Throwing in the white towel and saying ‘prostitution exists’ is no reason for the people of Toowoomba having a brothel forced upon them through a decision made by an agency based in Brisbane. The decision should be made by people who are in tune with and close to the various groups in the city. Those decisions will be always hard and difficult, but local leaders should be the ones to make the decision, based on what they think is best for their community. Most of our civic leaders do not believe that it is right to broaden legalised prostitution and make it more available. It provides an increased opportunity for the lives of young women to be harmed via prostitution. It is wrong that young women, who falsely think that it is an easy way to make a quid, can be dragged into the profession of prostitution, with all the lifelong problems that it will cause them. The decision should be made locally and not by a bureaucrat in Brisbane. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043876"></A>
The minister spoke about the need for brothels to provide better health standards et cetera for prostitutes. That may be so, but it will happen only to a limited degree because three-monthly health checks are not enough. A lot can happen in three months. It is pulling a bit of wool over your eyes to say that the health problems associated with prostitution will be covered by the fact that legalised brothels are required to provide for three-monthly health checks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043877"></A>
The minister said that he believed that if there was not a legal brothel in a city with a population of over 25,000 there would be more illegal operations. The legislation before us today is about providing sufficient penalties so that we can endeavour to stamp out illegal operations. It has never been possible to stamp out all crime, but if we have adequate investigation and adequate penalties, and those penalties are enforced by the judicial system, we will all but wipe out the incentives to run illegal brothels. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046800"></A>
I think all of those arguments that the minister has put forward can be shown to be incorrect. On balance, isn’t it better to go with what people of a community want and genuinely believe rather than force something on them? You could ask, ‘Is this a bit selfish of some cities to say that they do not want to have brothels and that they might end up in the capital city or somewhere with a larger population?’ But that decision would be with the local leadership of those cities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046803"></A>
I am standing up for my city and the people in my city who did not want a brothel in the town and who wanted their local leadership to have the right to say yes or no, not to have that right taken away from them. I think it is one of the most basic things that we in this parliament can do. It is a precious right and it should be left with the people who love their city, who believe in their city, who do not want to see the young girls of their city trashed. They should have the right to say no and that right was taken away from them. If this parliament were to support this amendment put forward by our shadow minister, we would give some proper dignity and some proper standards to the local leadership of our state so they can do what they think is the best thing for the people in their cities. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I rise to support this amendment. I remember when the consultation occurred in Gladstone. It was at the city theatre. The minister for police at the time was either Paul Braddy or Tony McGrady--I am not sure which one. He came with a party of people to conduct the consultation. Certainly the overwhelming majority of the group in Gladstone were not in favour of prostitution being legalised. None of those people pretends that prostitution does not exist. Neither do I. It is well known. It has been in existence for a long time. But that does not make it right. What many people want is the opportunity to have a say in their own electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046807"></A>
My recollection is that the choice of 25,000 people as the threshold for a council to lose the right to have a say on whether or not a brothel was approved was an arbitrary figure. I cannot recall the basis for the 25,000 people. My understanding was that it was a fairly arbitrary figure, being a city of medium size, that was decided on. However, it does not in any way indicate that there are many in those communities, those bigger towns and cities, who really do not want legal prostitution. They do not want brothels in their region. Local councils are planning approvers in many other instances. It appears anomalous that they do not have a greater power in relation to the approval or disapproval of this use of a property. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046809"></A>
In my speech during the second reading debate I made no secret of my opposition to prostitution. There are many in the community who do not want the abuse of young men and women to be validated. On that basis I support the amendment that gives local authorities an inherent right to make comment and to be involved in the approval process or the non-approval process of legal brothels. </Hansard-Body>

‘(2A)	If the court imposes a fine in addition to, or instead of, imprisonment for an offence against this section, the fine must not be less than 1000 penalty units for a single offence.’.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050067"></A>
The opposition believes that this is a very serious amendment. It seeks to act as a deterrent by setting a fine of not less than 1,000 penalty units for the offence of carrying on the business of providing unlawful prostitution. Where a court imposes a monetary penalty, we are proposing that the minimum that it can impose is 1,000 penalty units. The court is not prohibited from using other penalties as defined within the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050069"></A>
We have deliberated over this clause for some time. I say in defence of our moving this amendment that the minister said earlier that there are terms of imprisonment imposed in this clause but our proposed amendment will make it even tougher or provide an impediment to people breaching the provisions relating to the illegal operation of prostitution. Whilst there is a penalty of 14 years imprisonment in the bill, we believe that a penalty of 1,000 penalty units would be an absolute deterrent if it were imposed by the courts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050070"></A>
The minister said earlier today that this will give the police the power to impose tougher penalties when pursuing illegal prostitution. The police can only bring these people to the courts. It is then up to the courts to impose the penalties that will be a deterrent to undertaking this illegal activity. At the end of the day, if we are going to be realistic about making our penalties tougher and trying to stamp out this industry, we have to put checks and balances in place that will act as a deterrent to the criminal activity that many people highlighted in the chamber this afternoon and during the previous sitting week, when most of the debate of this legislation took place in the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050071"></A>
The real issue is putting in place tough penalties that will send a message to that element of society that feeds off illegal prostitution. This would be a real deterrent if these people were brought before the courts. This is not something that we have dreamt up overnight; it is something that we believe is balanced and will give some strength to this particular clause in the legislation. Proposed clause 2A will give more muscle to this clause. It will certainly give the courts more muscle in imposing penalties on those people who want to violate the law as it stands. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050072"></A>
I appeal to the minister and the government to endorse this amendment moved by the opposition today because it will certainly give strength to this aspect of the legislation. I believe that it will send a clear message that Queensland is going to be tough on this type of activity if the law is breached. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050073"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Again, the government will be opposing the amendment. This is one of those issues in relation to which the opposition is again seeking to impose a mandatory sentencing regime. The government firmly subscribes to the principle that the courts need to make decisions on the appropriate penalty based on the facts and circumstances of the case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050074"></A>
Throughout the second reading debate a number of members raised the example of a $2,000 fine compared to a $30,000 licence fee. We do not know the particular circumstances of that case. We do not know the severity of the alleged offence in that case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050075"></A>
The facts are that this bill provides penalties of up to three, five or seven years imprisonment for a number of offences. Through this bill we are introducing a new offence of carrying on the business of prostitution with a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. Through the advertising restrictions on escort agencies or escort service providers we are introducing financial penalties of 10 times the cost of either the advertisement or the website that advertises those particular services. The bill as it amends the act provides ample opportunity for the courts to impose appropriate penalties on individuals or groups of individuals involved in prostitution activity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050077"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HORAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I support our shadow minister in moving this amendment. Whilst I understand that the minister has said that there is a range of penalties in the legislation, some of which include jail, what we are addressing here is the financial penalty that would be imposed. The previous penalty of $2,000 was obviously an insufficient deterrent to someone setting up an illegal brothel or an association of girls that they have working for them. They would probably be able to cover the $2,000 fine fairly easily. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050078"></A>
What our shadow minister is attempting to do is make the financial component of the deterrent such that it is a true deterrent. The number of penalty points proposed means that the fine could be up to $100,000. That should virtually wipe somebody out from ever doing that again. More importantly, the penalty of up to $100,000 should act as a deterrent to people entering into illegal prostitution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050079"></A>
We support our police in the hard work and time it takes them in endeavouring to track down some of these operations. They would like to know that, at the end day, the deterrents through the justice system--they are firstly provided by the parliament in terms of the range of penalties and then applied by the court system--are there. That makes all of their investigations and hard work worthwhile and actually goes a long way towards eliminating this practice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053311"></A>
If the financial part of the deterrent is not adequate and does not have a wide enough range, then to the people who have been able to operate--and apparently, from all reports, have been operating in reasonable numbers and amounts--$2,000 is not a deterrent. It costs $30,000 for a licence for a year for a legal brothel. Many of those people may not comply or may have a police record of some sort which means that they would not be able to get a brothel licence. Therefore, those people are tempted to do it illegally and a $2,000 fine is certainly not a deterrent to them. For a deterrent to be serious and to work, it must not only impose the possibility of jail time that the minister mentioned but a fine or financial penalty. I am not sure whether it can be a mixture of both, but if it is going to be a financial penalty it has to be a serious one that actually works that is a real deterrent and puts the word around within that industry that if you get caught for this it wipes out a very serious amount of your financial assets for a long time and therefore it is not worthwhile contemplating setting up an illegal brothel.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053323"></A>
For God’s sake, there are many people who do not get 14 years imprisonment for murder or rape or other heinous crimes. I wonder whether a court would impose that type of penalty today if these people were brought before the courts by the police. A deterrent such as this will make people think, ‘God, it’s 14 years jail and a $100,000 fine. We don’t want either of those.’ This is a measure towards trying to bring some sanity and some structure into this legislation so that it will be a deterrent to the criminal element who want to be a party to this. That is the main thrust of this legislation. Whilst we are trying to create an environment that will provide some of the unfortunate people who find themselves in this predicament with a safer workplace, it is also about sending a message to the criminal element who want to enter into or stand over or be the beneficiaries of this type of operation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053324"></A>
We did not just pick this figure out of the air. We thought this through very carefully in order to get a decent structure in place that will be a deterrent through the passage of this legislation. This is something which has merit and I hope that the minister sees that the objective we are trying to achieve is constructive and positive from the opposition’s perspective. There would be many people in everyday Queensland--in voter land Queensland--who would support this amendment and who would think that this is the right way to go. I appeal to the minister to give some credence to this amendment and support it. If we are going to be genuine in bringing about reforms in terms of being tough on this element out there giving our communities a hard time and giving our police a difficult time, this is the part of the legislation that can say that the message is clear and precise--that is, 14 years jail coupled with a $100,000 fine or the 1,000 penalty unit fine. I believe that that shows that we are fair dinkum and we are tough on this issue.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1053326"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Just to respond generally and in a sense to repeat some of the things I have said, there are some circumstances obviously where it is appropriate to set a particular penalty. If you speed, it is pretty clear cut that you have broken the law in that you get a fixed penalty such as losing your licence and pay X amount of dollars. Here we are talking about instances where the facts and circumstances will differ according to each particular case. The severity of the intensity of someone’s involvement in the prostitution activity or the illegal activity will differ according to each individual case. The government stands by the principle that we are putting in place in this legislation and these amendments today have appropriate penalties for the various offences. It is then up to the court to determine, based on the facts and circumstances, what is an appropriate response in each circumstance. So we oppose the amendment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053327"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HORAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This clause of the bill is all about endeavouring to stop illegal prostitution, and members on both sides of the House are quite genuine in wanting to stop illegal prostitution. There is probably more misuse of young women in illegal prostitution than in other forms of prostitution. With regard to the penalties, there is a mixture in the statutes of jail and fines. I think I would be correct in saying that very often the penalty is probably going to be only a financial penalty--that is, a fine. The minister has said that there are varying levels of intensity of illegal prostitution, and he may well be right. It might vary from someone who runs two or three prostitutes illegally to someone who runs 10, 15 or 20 prostitutes. We on this side of the House are saying that illegal prostitution is out and, whether it is two, three or 20 prostitutes, you will face a fine that will run you out of business. That is what this is about.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053328"></A>
For some operators a $10,000 fine is probably quite affordable, but $100,000 will probably put most of them, if not all of them, out of business. That is what this House should be about today. We have seen some absolutely massive fines imposed in other areas of law such as environmental law with regard to the killing of various wildlife. Here we are talking about protecting young women from the illegal trade of prostitution through illegal brothels. It is a pretty serious matter. It is probably one of the most serious matters that we can discuss. The amount of money in terms of the fine that is being put forward in this amendment would act as a deterrent when $10,000 would not. I would ask the House and the minister to consider this. I think it has some merit if we are genuine and serious in wanting to say an absolute no to illegal brothels and illegal collectives of prostitutes run by someone who is living off the earnings of those poor unfortunate young women.</Hansard-Body>

Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The member for Toowoomba South has just highlighted something very specific, very precise, and he has given an accurate assessment. We are talking about illegal operations. We are talking about a deterrent. If we are fair dinkum about cleaning this industry up, there is another aspect of this industry--that is, the health aspect. As the member for Toowoomba South said earlier in relation to the three-monthly checks, in many cases the three-monthly checks are a joke. If we are going to be tough on this whole operation, we have to be tough right across-the-board. That is exactly where the opposition is coming from. We know that we are not going to stamp it out. We know that it is out there. It has been going on for thousands of years, as the minister rightfully said. However, at the same time we have to protect the wider community and the people who live in that community to ensure that we can get some decency into this industry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056636"></A>
The fact of the matter is that that criminal activity exploits these unfortunate girls and it is the Mr Bigs who will fill their hands with the dollars in question. I believe that a $100,000 fine is going to be an absolute deterrent to some of these blokes, because they will not want to hand over 100,000 big ones. If the minister accepts this amendment moved by the opposition and this penalty becomes part of the legislation, I believe that it will send a clear message. I believe that the police will support it and I believe the wider community of Queensland will support it because, in reality, we are about trying to get some management back into the structure of this awful industry so that the element that is breaching the rules all the time can be brought to its knees and told, ‘Hand it over’ because the way it is now it will be virtually a slap on the wrist. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056639"></A>
I find it hard to believe that these people could be subjected to a 14-year jail sentence or even a seven-year jail sentence. I would be interested to hear from the minister if that has ever happened. I doubt it. We know of the findings from the Fitzgerald inquiry in relation to trying to clean up this industry. This legislation is certainly an opportunity for us to be realistic in our approach and our direction. If we could have a bipartisan approach on trying to correct some of these issues, I think we could make Queensland a better place. I urge the minister to give consideration to supporting this amendment.</Hansard-Body>

Mr STEVENS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mermaid Beach--LNP) (4.18 pm): I rise to speak to the Property Agents and Motor Dealers and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 and, at the outset, I advise the House that the Liberal National Party will be voting for this bill as a practical step forward to tightening legal loopholes that exist in the current act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056662"></A>
The Property Agents and Motor Dealers and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 seeks to amend the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000 and, in particular, makes specific amendments to chapter 11. The bill will amend chapter 11 of the PAMDA and make parallel amendments to the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997. The amendments will also simplify the process and reduce red tape for delivering contract and warning statement papers and eliminate loopholes available to buyers to opt out of contracts, thereby promoting greater certainty in residential property sale transactions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056667"></A>
Currently, chapter 11 requires a seller to deliver contract papers in a specific order. If this order is not followed, then that gives rise for the buyer to terminate the contract at any time before settlement. The buyer is bound by the contract only if the papers are signed in order, for example, a signed information statement provided by the seller, a signed warning statement and a signed contract. If that strict process is not adhered to, the contract will not legally bind the two parties. This bill aims to fix this loophole and create greater certainty in residential property sale contracts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056669"></A>
These amendments have been deemed necessary as a response to the Service Delivery and Performance Commission’s <Hansard-Italic>
Report on the review of regulatory reform (phase 2)--Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000</Hansard-Italic>
, which was presented back in March 2008. The Service Delivery and Performance Commission review of regulatory reform was to identify the major regulatory features of the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act and to recommend legislative amendments to simplify the level of regulation while maintaining effective consumer benefit--in other words, protection. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056671"></A>
The review looked at many areas of the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act, including real estate agents, property developers, motor dealers, auctioneers, pastoral houses, codes of conduct, commercial agents, other issues and the presentation and delivery of residential real estate contracts, which is the focus of these amendments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060260"></A>
The government’s response to the Service Delivery and Performance Commission <Hansard-Italic>
Report on the review of regulatory reform (phase 2)--Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000</Hansard-Italic>
 supported the streamlining of the presentation and delivery of residential contracts but rejected repealing chapter 11 on the basis that it believes that it ‘contains important consumer information provisions which would be reduced if Chapter 11 was ... repealed’. It also believes that ‘there has been no measurable decrease in the volume of sales proceeding to settlement and it has improved the quality of contract documentation and preparation by real estate agents’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060261"></A>
I sincerely hope that the nondeletion of chapter 11 does not provide an opportunity for our erstwhile friends in the legal fraternity, of which the minister of course is one of the famous glowing examples, to exploit further loopholes. As they say, necessity is the mother of invention. I am sure there will be some genius legal eagle out there who will exploit these provisions in some shape or form later on, and I am sure we will be back in this House to make further amendments to the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060262"></A>
In the PAMDA changes to chapter 11, ‘Residential property sales’, the following sections will be pertinent. I will set out the existing sections of the act that refer to residential contractual requirements. In section 365(1), parties are bound by the relevant contract when certain formalities are adhered to. In section 365(2)(a), when sent by fax the document must be in the following order: a cover page that draws the buyer’s attention to the warning statement and the contract; the warning statement; the relevant contract; and any other documents. In section 365(2)(b), when sent by electronic communication other than fax the communication must be presented in the following order: a message that directs the buyer’s attention to the warning statement and contract; a single document, consisting of the warning statement and the relevant contract, with the warning statement appearing as the first or top page of the document. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060263"></A>
In adhering to the legislation as it stands, we are defining a process that is subject to physical human error rather than concentrating on the written content of the contract. What relevance does the order of documentation received by electronic conveyance have to the validity and, most importantly, the intention of the written contract? In section 365(2)(c), when being handed documents or receiving documents in ways other than by electronic communication, for example by post, the documents must be in the following order: the warning statement and the relevant contract. The seller must direct the buyer’s attention to the warning statement and then the relevant contract. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060264"></A>
Section 367, ‘Buyer’s rights if a warning statement is not given or is not effective’, applies if a warning statement requirement is not adhered to. The buyer may terminate the relevant contract up until the contract settles by giving notice of termination to the seller. If the contract is terminated, the seller must refund any deposit paid within 14 days after notice of termination is given. Therefore, the expected changes will be to eradicate the opportunity for buyers to terminate the contract for a simple error on the seller’s behalf. The seller will no longer be vulnerable to contract terminations if he, she or the agent mixes up the pages in a contract or forgets to attach a warning statement before forwarding the contract in an email. </Hansard-Body>

When the sale of units is added, the requirements of the Body Corporate and Community Management Act come into force--that is, the BCCM Act disclosure statement and information sheet, which is form 14 under the BCCM Act. The bill makes parallel amendments to the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997. </Hansard-Body>

The global financial crisis has had a major impact on the residential and commercial property markets across the globe, and Queensland has not been immune. We have seen the development of the least affordable housing market in the world, and this has had a significant impact on young people being able to manoeuvre to find a way to get into the market. It is even getting harder out there. If one goes outside of this cloistered area and talks to the taxidrivers, the restaurant owners or any person out there in the job market, one will find how difficult it is becoming. The more certainty we can give in this particular market to this section of the industry to assist young people heading into the housing market the better. It is very much a positive step towards maintaining what we have left of the real estate market. </Hansard-Body>

The current economic outlook shows a decline in first home buyers and general home buyers in the December quarter 2009. The dramatic reduction in first home buyers across the state, down from a peak of 30 per cent of the market in May last year to just 17 per cent in December, meant that sales of affordable properties also plummeted. This is due in some way, of course, to the introduction of the federal government’s first home owners boost and the first home owners grant. From 1 October 2009 to 31 December 2009 the first home owners boost was halved to $3,500 for established homes and $7,000 for new homes. From 31 December 2009 the federal Labor government decided to cut it altogether. This is yet another Rudd-Gillard government policy debacle to add to the home insulation crisis, the Green Loans Program, the solar rebate confusion and the Bligh Labor government’s complicated and compulsory sustainability declaration forms--weren’t they a big hit? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060268"></A>
In relation to contracts that are important for this particular year, house sales under $500,000 dropped from 5,753 in June 2009 to 4,502 in December 2009. Unit prices over $250,000 but under $350,000 have gone the same way--down from 2,252 in June 2009 to 1,498 in December 2009. We can see the devastating effect it is having on the market, and that is why any of these contracts that people enter into as potential buyers must be given certainty in this current hard market. The slowing of the market is a concern, and the Bligh government must ensure it does all it can to protect this market in the downturn. This legislation will do that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060297"></A>
This is why legislation such as the bill we are debating today is important: to ensure all loopholes are addressed for smooth contractual procedures for the seller and the buyer of properties in this state. Certainty is a very important part of the real estate market. This legislation we are debating today will, I hope, shore up some more certainty for real estate participants. </Hansard-Body>

Since the introduction to parliament of the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000, significant amendments have been made in order to protect consumers and industry from any gaps in the legislation and to reflect the changes in the industry over time. I must say that most of them have been reactive, not proactive, by successive Labor governments. That is always going to be an outcome of poorly drafted, all encompassing, specific orders legislation, which is the hallmark of Labor governments, with bureaucratic and red tape wrapping on all of its legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060306"></A>
The PAMDA was first introduced into parliament on 7 September 2000 by the then minister for fair trading, Judy Spence. After the bill was passed, the legislation commenced on 1 July 2001. The purpose of this act was to repeal the Auctioneers and Agents Act 1971 to provide a more inclusive act that dealt with all of the industry’s arising issues and to also provide more regulation where needed. There was an urgent need for legislation regulating this area as consumers needed to be protected from dodgy salesmen and sales practices in both property and motor dealer sales. There especially was a need for protection for consumers from high pressure sales techniques used to promote residential properties. The provisions in the original act mostly provided for the protection of consumers, and this was clearly needed. A lot of the provisions also caused small business to be caught up in red tape, which prevented small business in Queensland from running smoothly. The opposition expressed its concern that consumer protection was going too far and infringing on the fair business practices of those in the industry. In fact, the current member for Toowoomba South, Mike Horan, spoke at that time about the overregulation of the industry. He said--</Hansard-Body>

At the end of the day, a person has to take responsibility for the decisions they make.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060310"></A>
While supporting the protection of consumers in relation to the sale of motor vehicles and property, the opposition was also concerned about potential detrimental effects that would flow on to Queensland business. The opposition was also concerned after the various stakeholders complained that the bill was unworkable and was bad news for industry employment. That reference was from Mr Denver Beanland, the opposition spokesperson at the time. I well remember all the telemarketers doing a great job marketing these properties down there. A lot of legislation we have is as a result of their very effective, high pressure techniques. All sorts of claims were made about how people had been ripped off. Today nearly every one of those people who bought those properties has made an absolute fortune and would be thanking those telemarketers left, right and centre.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060312"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Lawlor:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 They could have made a bigger fortune because they could have bought them cheaper instead of being ripped off and making money for the marketeers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060313"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will take the minister’s injection that they could have bought them cheaper. The fact of the matter is that they would not have bought them cheaper because those telemarketers actually talked them into buying the property in the first place. That is why we have this legislation today. We have to be very careful about creating a nanny state mentality in instituting all of these warning statements and processes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060314"></A>
It reminds me very much of an appropriate statement about our tendency to go flat out in terms of putting in place new legislation in this nanny state. It reminds me of the words of ‘The Death of Common Sense’--</Hansard-Body>

Provisions introduced predominantly attempted to wind back the powers and discretion of industry stakeholders in order to protect consumers. Property agents and developers were required to disclose any personal or commercial relationships they have with mortgage brokers, lawyers or valuers. Any property developers who sell more than six residential properties in one year must now be licensed. Sole agencies selling agreements were reduced to 60 days, which contrasts with the 90-day requirement in the Auctioneers and Agents Act 1971. Any contract for the sale of residential property arising out of an unsolicited approach from a property agent or seller is now protected by a five-day cooling-off period. The Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act also introduced the concept of a warning statement being included in any contract for the sale of residential property. The warning statement would include advice for the buyer to obtain independent legal advice before signing the contract and the seller must draw the buyer’s attention to this warning statement.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060330"></A>
Motor vehicle dealers were required to provide warranties for all vehicles they sell. This was to protect consumers from being sold dodgy cars and would hold dealers more accountable for their business practice. Motor vehicle dealers have to provide a three-month or 5,000 kilometre warranty on a car less than 10 years old and which has travelled less than 160,00 kilometres and a one-month or 1,000 kilometre warranty for cars over 10 years old that have travelled more than 160,000 kilometres. Motor vehicle dealers were also obliged to give a one-day cooling-off period on the sale of all used cars. PAMDA also dealt with the replacement of the Auctioneers and Agents Committee by the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Tribunal with authority to conduct disciplinary hearings, hear and determine consumer complaints involving more than $10,000 and to review the department’s licensing and registration decisions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060335"></A>
The first amendment to the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act was in 2001. The need to change certain provisions arose out of the issue that marketeers of investment residential properties were changing their marketing and sale tactics in order to avoid the provisions of the original PAMDA. This reflects the fact that when one particular door is shut, then the people involved in these practices unfortunately look to open other ones and thereby continue the very convoluted legislative processes that we see in play in catch-up football with this legislation. Generally, the amendments were desperately needed to close loopholes left by the original legislation and to strengthen the regulatory framework. These amendments were issued to parliament on 11 September 2001 by the then minister for fair trading, Ms Merri Rose. I will not even go there in terms of the history.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060338"></A>
The changes came into effect on 29 October 2001. It was stated that the aim of this bill was to protect the interests of consumers and encourage licensees to act lawfully to avoid having their licence suspended. The opposition recognised the need for these reforms but was concerned about the lack of stakeholder contribution due to time constraints. As it turned out, the legislation still needed a lot of work and consultation from industry stakeholders was essential. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060376"></A>
Various changes were made to regulate precontract procedures. The five day cooling-off period was extended to include all residential properties, in contrast to the previous requirement including only contracts arising out of unsolicited approaches by sellers. This provision still excluded contracts arising from an auction. Changes were made to the warning statement to make it more specific and to recommend that the buyer obtain an independent valuation of the property. In addition to this, a contract should include the contact details for obtaining information regarding an independent property valuation and also how to instruct the property valuer. In another bid to promote accountability for property agents, all agents and developers must disclose to the buyer all financial benefits the agent will gain from the sale and promotion of the relevant property. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060379"></A>
A number of other changes were made to combat the loopholes in the current legislation that property agents and developers were taking advantage of. The blanket term of ‘unconscionable conduct’ was officially prohibited on the part of any person associated with the sale, promotion or marketing of the relevant property. Also ‘misleading or deceptive conduct’ and ‘false representations’ for the same persons were banned. This was needed in order to close loopholes found by industry stakeholders and to protect consumers from dodgy property sales tactics. </Hansard-Body>

The amendments also dealt with issues extending the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Tribunal’s power to order the cessation of activities and to hold public examinations of any person associated with the sale, promotion or marketing of the relevant property. The jurisdiction of the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Tribunal was also extended in order to hear complaints against any person involved in the sale, promotion or marketing of the relevant property and the authority to issue orders for the payment of civil penalties to the state and compensation to the victims. The amendments authorise the District Court to impose increased fines to provide a stronger deterrent for persons breaching the act. The new provisions also provide increased powers for the chief executive to seek substantiation or representations made by any person involved in the sale, promotion or marketing of property. The chief executive’s powers are also expanded to allow him or her to immediately suspend a licence. </Hansard-Body>

After the 2000 amendments to the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act, no more amendments were made until the 2004 review brought to the attention of the government the developing issues in the industry that needed to be regulated and reflected in the legislation. The review examined consumer protection issues, with the government indicating that it would make the relevant amendments to the legislation in order to address those issues. The opposition was in agreement with most of the following provisions, but again there was a concern for the absence of protection for businesses in the industry. While consumer protection is of high importance, it was obvious that the wants and needs of industry stakeholders were ignored and a lack of consultation also proved worrying. The first issue identified was the problem of misrepresentation of sale or purchase prices to consumers regarding property. The government proposed that agents be prohibited from quoting sale or purchase prices that did not reflect the agent’s true assessment and be prohibited from deliberately underestimating the expected selling price to potential purchasers. Agents must also record the estimated selling price in the agency agreement with the vendor. </Hansard-Body>

The code of conduct needed to change to respond to changing industry practice and the conduct of real estate agents. The proposed changes provided for the regulation of agent behaviour in relation to things such as unsolicited mail-outs, telemarketing and cold calling for agency appointments. Changes were also recommended for the rules regarding the use of residential tenancy databases. It was also recommended that the code be changed to prohibit the selling of property within a residential complex whilst maintaining the letting of those properties within the complex and to prohibit unreasonable behaviour leading to things such as the lockout of other agents. The registration and identification of bidders at auctions also arose as an area that needed amending. It was recommended that the auctioneers code of conduct be changed to require the registration of all potential bidders at auction and to identify those bidders at the time of each vendor bid. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1060383"></A>
Some issues arose in relation to the sale of motor vehicles. The government felt the need to make changes in relation to the required motor vehicle warranty. In the case of a claim on the warranty, the dealer would have previously nominated a repairer and that repairer must not be at an unfair distance from where the vehicle is situated. If the vehicle is situated further than 200 kilometres from the dealer’s place of business, the dealer must provide another repairer where the vehicle is situated. The review also recommended that the act be changed to require motor vehicle dealers to disclose to the clients that they are, in fact, licensed dealers. This will protect the consumers’ warranty and cooling-off periods as they will be made aware that they are buying from a licensed seller. It was also recommended that the maximum penalty be increased for unlicensed motor dealing to act as a more effective deterrent. I understand that there is a very high profile website from which a lot of cars are traded. As I understand it, under the act there is a maximum of six trades per day or week. Unfortunately, some of the dealers operating on this fairly popular website are acting as motor dealers without the proper licensing requirements. That is another issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060385"></A>
To promote further accountability within the industry, more requirements for auditing were recommended, such as that trust accounts and audit reports meet accounting standards and requirements of the act and to ensure that auditors carry out a wider range of checks, including levels and timing of commission paid or claimed by licensees. The review recommended that both real estate agents and motor dealers in training should register as doing so would protect both trainees and consumers. Also, a commercial agent cannot be appointed to act in specific circumstances unless that appointment is in writing. To provide more accountability in motor vehicle sales, it was recommended that a dealer’s licence renewal be conditional on dealing from only the specified premises. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060386"></A>
Following this review and the consequential recommendations, a bill was eventually introduced to pass these new provisions. The changes commenced in 2005 to counteract these issues. Provisions in the bill prohibited inappropriate practices such as over and under quoting of property prices by real estate property agents. It required that motor dealers operate from an approved premises, although I understand that in the electorate of Southport on certain Sundays some dealers are opening in a discreet manner. It will be interesting to see if those venues are followed up by the officers of the department. </Hansard-Body>

Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I hate to bring this to the minister’s attention, showing his departmental office how ineffectual he is in keeping on eye on matters in his own backyard, especially in relation to matters he is responsible for. However, other people are bringing those matters to my attention. I am sure they will be lodging the appropriate complaints. Certainly it is not up to the member for Mermaid Beach to act as a guardian in the electorate of Southport. </Hansard-Body>

The legislation also introduced penalties for excessive or improper commission offences, with a requirement that such commissions be returned to the client. Since the original PAMDA, major amendments were made in 2001 and 2005. The amendments before the House today indicate a need for change in the regulation of residential property sales contracts, to improve the procedural process of contractual arrangements for the sale of houses and units. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060391"></A>
The opposition has had thorough consultation with industry representatives and the wider community. In particular, I would like to thank Mr Dan Molloy of the REIQ for his input. He is very supportive of this legislation although he said it fell short in some areas. Some of the other members might bring that to the attention of the minister for further consideration. Obviously, the UDIA had no problems with the bill. The minister has consulted with the legal fraternity and it is supportive as well. The government consultation has been varied. According to the explanatory notes, the government consulted with the community and there was extensive consultation with the Queensland Consumers Association, the REIQ, the Queensland Law Society, the UDIA, the Property Council of Australia and the Motor Trades Association of Queensland. There was also consultation with the Department of the Premier and Cabinet, the Treasury, the Department of Justice and Attorney-General, and other appropriate government agencies. In all of these legislative matters there needs to be a balance between the needs of the buyer and the needs of the sellers. We believe that this legislation takes that into account fairly and justly so that these changes can occur. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064302"></A>
According to the explanatory notes, there will be no additional cost to government. The only costs will be for producing and publicising to stakeholders and these will be absorbed by Fair Trading’s budget. I am sure the minister will be able to advise how much of Fair Trading’s budget will be dedicated to advertising this fact far and wide through all of those areas--the Law Society, the REIQ and others--to make sure that it is fully and completely understood by all industry participants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064305"></A>
The legislative review committee said that in some cases it may infringe on the rights and liberties of individuals, arguably, as the rights of the buyer to terminate because of contract delivery are abolished in this bill. The buyer will now have the same rights as the seller to terminate a contract before settlement. The minister has already dealt with that in response to the legislative review committee. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064306"></A>
There are some significant changes. Part 2 section 366 requires a lawyer engaged by a buyer in a sale to provide the buyer with a lawyer’s certificate and must explain the nature and meaning of that certificate. Section 367 requires a buyer to receive a copy of a property evaluation for what the buyer has bought. Section 368 sets out information which must be included in a warning statement. Section 368A requires that an information statement must attract the buyer’s attention to the warning statement. This can be done orally or in a simple paragraph. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064307"></A>
Subsections 368A(4) and (5) make it clear that a residential contract does not become another separate contract when terms and conditions are changed so long as the residential property is the same and the parties remain the same. Subsection 368A(6) states that it is an offence not to provide an information statement directing the buyer’s attention to the warning statement. Section 368B provides a defence to the above offence. If the seller realises the mistake and withdraws the contract before it is binding then this will be sufficient to stop that offence from occurring. Section 368C requires that the warning statement must be attached to the relevant contract. If the relevant contract is for the sale of a unit then the information sheet must also be attached. </Hansard-Body>

 Okay. But I heard the cheering. In conclusion, I would like to reinforce the opposition’s position of agreeing with this legislation, as we believe it will tighten loopholes. We have concerns that it may create some more loopholes that need to be addressed to improve the procedure and delivery of successful residential contracts in Queensland--matters of concern I shall raise further for the minister’s clarification in the debate in consideration in detail. I certainly reiterate the LNP’s support for this bill’s passage through the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (4.52 pm): I rise today to contribute to the debate on the Property Agents and Motor Dealers and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The objectives of the bill are to amend chapter 11 of the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000 and to make parallel amendments to the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997. The bill will simplify the processes for the delivery and presentation of contracts for the sale of residential property, while still maintaining consumer protection provisions, and thereby promote greater certainty in residential property sales. Any changes regarding the process of purchasing a new property are welcomed as long as the same level of buyers and sellers protection is maintained. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064315"></A>
The purpose of the current chapter 11 provisions is: to give a cooling-off period for persons entering into relevant contracts; to require all proposed relevant contracts and relevant contracts to include consumer protection information, including advising of the cooling-off period; and to enhance consumer protection by ensuring the independence of lawyers acting for buyers. The act requires sellers to continuously draw a buyer’s attention to the warning statement, and to the information sheet and the disclosure statement if it is a unit sale, and to attach those documents to the proposed contract in a strict order. This process of having to make sure the warning statement and disclosure statement are delivered in a specific order time after time has created a loophole, allowing buyers to get out of what sellers believed to be a watertight contract. If a purchaser of a property has changed their mind for any reason and they can establish that the contract documents were not presented in the right order, either in person or electronically, they then have the right to terminate the contract at any time before settlement even after the cooling-off period has expired. The courts have confirmed this interpretation of the act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064316"></A>
A number of real estate agents in my electorate of Mudgeeraba have indicated to me that the current need to present contracts in a particular order is overly complex and laborious. Because of this process, many of them have had to cancel contracts, leaving them and the seller to start the process of selling all over again--and all because a purchaser may have changed their mind or found a cheaper property. Buyers seeking to avoid residential contracts have been able to rely on minor and technical breaches arising from, often inadvertent, failures by sellers or sellers’ agents to comply with the requirements for delivery of contracts under chapter 11. An example of a breach under the current act is the circumstance where an agent might have sent a property contract to a buyer via fax or scanned the contract and sent it by email and when sending the fax or email the agent faxes or scans contract pages before the warning statement pages. This scenario is grounds for termination under chapter 11 of the current act. Even though the buyer’s attention may have been drawn to the warning statement and they were fully aware of their rights and consequences of entering into the contract to purchase, they have a right to terminate at any time before settlement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064317"></A>
The bill will implement a preferred approach to simplify the presentation and delivery of residential real estate contracts. The bill also contains amendments to the BCCM Act, which are parallel to the chapter 11 amendments, and makes amendments to the PAMD Act to implement a number of other minor recommendations by the SDPC by removing many of the requirements for the presentation and delivery of residential real estate contracts and by limiting the circumstances under which a buyer may terminate a contract for technical breaches by the seller or seller’s agent. However, the principle of requiring a seller to draw a buyer’s attention to important precontractual consumer protection information contained in the warning statement, and information sheet for unit sales, is retained. This will still give purchasers protection and make them well aware of the contract they are about to enter into. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064318"></A>
Under the amendments to the PAMD Act, it will be an offence for a seller to not attach a warning statement, or information sheet for unit sales, to a proposed relevant contract. The right to terminate must be exercised within 90 days of formation of the contract. If the buyer signs the warning statement, they are taken to have seen and had their attention drawn to the statement and the buyer may not terminate the contract. The amendment removes the technical requirements for how the warning statement is to be attached to the contract and in what order the warning must be presented by the agent or seller. This in turn removes the right to terminate the contract for a technical breach. I am sure that residents and agents alike in the fast-growing area of the Mudgeeraba electorate will be pleased with the protection that this legislation affords. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr BLEIJIE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kawana--LNP) (4.56 pm): I rise to speak to the Property Agents and Motor Dealers and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010, which is before the House today. At the outset let me reiterate the point made by the shadow minister that we will certainly be allowing this bill to pass through this chamber today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064321"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Lawlor:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Oh, thank you. That’s very decent of you. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064322"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, we will. When the shadow minister made the comment, there were certainly interjections from those opposite, particularly from the member for Morayfield. For the benefit of the member for Morayfield, I remind the honourable gentleman that those on this side of the House, and I personally, will always support government legislation that shows that once upon a time they were incompetent when they particularly brought in relevant legislation but they have the guts to come back before us in 2010 and fix up their mistakes. That is what this is all about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064324"></A>
I am reminded of the second reading speech by the honourable minister at the time I think back in 2005. The minister at the time, particularly in relation to the warning statement, said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1064326"></A>
The amendments to the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act relate to real estate transactions. They will provide certainty for sellers of residential properties or their agents when transmitting precontractual documents by facsimile and other electronic means.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064327"></A>
That was some five years ago, and those amendments at the time have certainly not provided anything. All they provided was uncertainty in the profession. They provided uncertainty in the legal profession. They provided uncertainty in the property profession. They provided uncertainty for real estate agents. Now, some five years later, the government is again introducing legislation to fix up its mess from so many years ago. If it had talked to the industry at the time of those first amendments, it would have understood that we have arrived at a point today that we should have arrived at many years ago. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067988"></A>
This bill will amend chapter 11 of the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000, commonly referred to as PAMDA, and will make corresponding amendments to the Body Corporate and Community Management Act, BCCMA. The proposed amendments in this bill remove the current requirement that directions be given to a buyer after signing the contract but before they are bound under the contract. The removal of this ambiguous double direction will, I am sure, reduce noncompliance issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067995"></A>
The amendments also remove the requirement for the warning statement and any information statement with respect to unit sales to be attached to the contract as the first and top page of the contract. The warning statement and information statement must merely be attached to the contract. I say to the honourable minister that under the current legislation contracts had to have the warning statement, which is the statutory form 30C. The current legislation required the 30C to be attached as the first and top sheet of the contract. These amendments to the legislation basically get rid of that requirement. I would appreciate it if the minister in his response this afternoon could explain the reasoning behind changing the requirement to have it as the top sheet to now have it attached anywhere through the documentation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067996"></A>
The bill introduces a 90-day period for a buyer to exercise their right to termination because the warning statement requirements have not been complied with. The bill will simplify the processes for the creation of residential property contracts and will create certainty for all parties involved in the sale of residential properties. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067997"></A>
As the shadow minister for tourism and fair trading has stated today, the Liberal National Party believes that this bill is a practical step towards tightening the legal loopholes that have arisen under the existing legislation. I am glad that the government has realised this. It is about time it tried to reduce the red tape and burden for consumers and industry and enacted this legislation to bring about more efficient, effective and productive processes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067998"></A>
The bill is a response to the review of the regulatory reform, phase 2, of the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000 to identify the major regulatory features of the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000 and to recommend legislative amendments to simplify the level of regulation while maintaining effective consumer benefit. The details of the review are set out in the Service Delivery and Performance Commission’s March 2008 report. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068000"></A>
The amendments provide significant changes to property and conveyancing practices and are welcomed by the legal community, developers, financiers and the real estate industry. The introduction of the 90-day period for buyers to exercise their right to terminate the contract for noncompliance with the warning statement requirements will provide some certainty and peace of mind to sellers and developers with longer periods of contract, particularly off-the-plan contracts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068001"></A>
It is important to note that, even though the contract process has been simplified through these amendments, the amendments do not remove the key consumer protections, including the cooling-off period and the requirement to at least attach the warning statement and information sheets for unit sales. The existing requirements under PAMDA and BCCMA set out a very stringent process and order for the warning statements and information sheets to be attached to the contracts for the sale of residential property. If the order is not strictly adhered to or certain documents not acknowledged then a buyer has the right to terminate the contract at any time prior to settlement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068004"></A>
In practice, what we have at the moment is a situation where a buyer signs a contract as an offer to the seller. It is then sent to the seller. Prior to the buyer signing the contract, the seller, giving the blank contract to the buyer, must direct the buyer to the 30C warning statement. The buyer then signs the contract as the offer. It goes back to the seller. The seller then signs it if they accept the offer. When the seller or the seller’s agent sends the fully executed signed contract back to the buyer, they must again direct the buyer to the warning statement. It was a double-dip direction which has created all the controversy and legal cases and loopholes in the current legislation. It was a mess when it was first introduced. One of the most litigated issues in the courts in terms of conveyancing was over this particular section: is it attached, is it not attached; is it a facsimile or an email? The whole system was a mess. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068005"></A>
The strict regime and red tape process resulted in noncompliance issues in the sale of several properties allowing buyers to terminate contracts at any time prior to settlement. This was due to the loopholes. This created uncertainty for sellers and the industry. When I was practising property law we had a contract for the purchase of a block of land. It was an off-the-plan block of land. The buyer signed the contract some 12 months past and the block of land still had not received title. It was due to settle in three months time. The global financial crisis hit. The buyer looked at their investments and opportunities and decided they did not really want to purchase the property. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068006"></A>
They came to me as their legal adviser and asked whether there was any way they could get out of the contract. On the face of it the answer was no because there were no conditions left for them to get out of the contract, having satisfied finance and all the other conditions. A review of the file, bearing in mind this was 12 months after it was signed, found that the seller’s lawyers, when sending me the contract, did not direct my attention to the warning statement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068007"></A>
The way the loophole works is this. We lawyers get the contracts and we direct our client’s attention to the warning statement. When one acts for the buyer, it is the seller’s responsibility--the seller’s agent including their lawyers--to direct the attention of the buyer to this. This was not the case so we were able, after a period of 12 months, to terminate the contract. I think the 90-day provision is a good thing because it gives certainty. People know what is happening in 90 days time. We will not have buyers like my client at the time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068008"></A>
Lawyers act for sellers and buyers. We do what we are told and we do what we get paid for. I would not actually call it a loophole; it was more the fact that the seller’s lawyers were required to do it under the legislation. But because the legislation was such a mess and confused so many people, some in the profession took advantage of that--as I did on that particular day and saved my client a lot of money. It is a couple of years later and we are here to fix the problems. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068009"></A>
In order to comply with the existing stringent requirements, the legal and real estate industry have had to increase the paperwork and red tape. This has of course resulted in increased costs to the consumer. The removal of these exhaustive requirements will result in a simplified and tighter process for entering into contracts for the sale of residential property and will provide peace of mind to the sellers and the industry professionals. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068010"></A>
Under the new system, the statement directing the buyer’s attention to the warning statement, which presently is the form 30C, is still a requirement but the amendments basically get rid of the issue around when the buyer becomes bound under the contract. The confusion was around when one became bound under the contract. It was about whether they got the fax, when it was faxed, who sent it and so forth. Now the seller will provide a direction to the buyer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068011"></A>
I still think we treat consumers with contempt in terms of their intelligence. I am pretty sure that when a buyer picks up a contract, if the first and top sheet is the warning sheet and it is in a font size of 80 and says ‘Warning: read this before signing a contract’ they know what to do. I believe that consumers have sufficient intelligence that they know what ‘Warning: please read and understand this and sign prior to entering into a contract’ really means. I think Queensland consumers are intelligent enough to work that out without having to be told to look at the warning statement. Essentially it has become a warning of a warning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081024"></A>
I must say that, in a time when consumers are relying on electronic forms of negotiation more and more, the amendments streamlining the process for issuing contracts by email and facsimile are long overdue. In the 10 years since the introduction of PAMDA, the Labor government has introduced over 30 pieces of legislation to amend PAMDA. In 2005 we saw the Labor government introduce amendments to set in place those stringent requirements that I speak about with respect to the order of the warning statement and information sheets. Late last year we saw the Bligh Labor government introduce and support the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill which, of course, as we recall, introduced the mandatory sustainability declaration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068015"></A>
I recall that at the time we were talking about property law I distinctly told the minister that this was going to be a complete mess and they would end up amending the form. Of course they deny, deny, deny. What do we know now? It has been amended some three or four times since. Again, if those opposite had spoken to the industry and listened to the opposition they would understand that. Despite the objection from the industry and the Liberal National Party with respect to the detailed and onerous form, the Labor government went ahead and forced this checklist on sellers. However, only one month and four days after the commencement of that sustainability declaration, which of course is tied in with property sales, the government released the newer, simpler version of the form. There were two further versions in as many months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068052"></A>
The question Queenslanders must ask themselves is: how many times does it take for a Labor government to get it right? The Bligh Labor government needs to consider the impact that its actions have on the residents and industry of Queensland before it introduces more and more red tape and regulation such as that declaration. Each and every knee-jerk reaction of the Labor government results in increased expense to the cost of living for Queenslanders. Every time the government needs to fix up its incompetent messes or simplify its own red tape, Queensland taxpayers are left to foot the bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068057"></A>
Page 15 of the bill that we are debating today contains a cooling-off provision. Under the current legislation the cooling-off period starts the day after someone becomes bound by the contract. That is how it is worked out when someone becomes bound by the contract. Under the new bill, the cooling-off period starts the day after the buyer receives a copy of the executed contract from the seller. I have two questions to the minister that I would like him to research before he gives his summation at the end of this debate. Where a buyer receives a copy of the contract, the bill says that that is when the cooling-off period starts. However, if a buyer is really determined to get out of a contract, they may in practice allege that they never received the contract in the first place. Once a seller sends the contract back to the buyer, the seller does not know that the buyer has received it and when the cooling-off period in fact starts. The buyer may receive it but then wait another two weeks. The seller may call them and ask if they have received it and the buyer might say, ‘No, we haven’t received it,’ and then terminate and deny that they ever received the contract, because the seller does not know where it has gone. They assume that it has gone to the buyer if they have in fact got the address right. Subclause (2) of proposed section 369 states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1068059"></A>
... if the buyer signs the relevant contract after the seller signed it, the buyer is taken to have received a copy of the relevant contract ... when the buyer has both signed the relevant contract and communicated the buyer’s acceptance of the seller’s offer ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068060"></A>
If the buyer has signed all of the documentation and then communicated it back to the seller, the second issue is that the communication of the acceptance to the seller is not really detailed in the bill. Is a phone call acceptable if the buyer rings up the estate agent? Practising lawyers would know the rules of offer and acceptance, but that may not be so clear for a lay person such as a real estate agent. If this explanation is not provided in a similar way that it is now, people will be debating when someone is actually bound by the contract under the cooling-off period and then people may terminate and it may end up in litigation. I would appreciate it if the minister could respond in his summation at the end of the second reading debate or during the consideration in detail stage as to how that will take place.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068061"></A>
In conclusion, I would appreciate the minister’s reply to a few things: firstly, the cooling-off period; secondly, the warning statement as now not being required to be the top sheet but attached anywhere throughout the contract; and, thirdly, the new termination provisions and the 90 days. The termination provisions are now contained for the buyer in certain circumstances. The current situation is that the seller gives the direction of the warning statement; the new situation is that the seller gives the direction directing the buyer to the warning statement. However, the buyer will not have the right to terminate if they have signed the warning statement. So there are two issues here. If I am a seller I still have to direct the buyer to the fact that there is the warning statement and so I provide that direction. If I do not, I get fined and 200 penalty units apply. However, if I am a buyer and I sign the warning statement, wherever it is contained in the contract, then I do not have the right to terminate but the direction may not have been given to me. I want to understand the importance of having the direction at all if the buyer has to sign the warning statement and they cannot terminate in any event. I would appreciate the minister’s response in his closing remarks. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr WENDT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich West--ALP) (5.14 pm): I want to quickly lend my support to the Property Agents and Motor Dealers and Other Legislation Amendment Bill before the House today. I am also happy to note the support of the opposition in this regard. I should also thank the member for Kawana, who has just graciously advised that he will also let the bill go through. It is important to know that, in addition to simplifying the contract delivery process for residential property transactions, the Property Agents and Motor Dealers and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 seeks to rectify a number of other provisions of the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068068"></A>
For example, a number of those amendments will reduce regulatory requirements for the licensed occupations of real estate, motor dealing, auctioneering and commercial agents. In particular, removing the requirement for motor dealer applicants to provide proof of local authority approval for business premises restores these applicants to the same position as applicants for other licences under the act such as real estate and commercial agents. It is considered that removing this requirement from the act frees up the licence application process. However at the same time motor dealers, like any other business, still need to comply with local authority by-laws and requirements about business premises, business conduct and advertising at the business premises. It merely removes redundant requirements in the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068070"></A>
An important modification of the act for licence applicants is the removal of a requirement for applicants for residential letting agents’ licences to provide proof of body corporate approval to carry on the letting business from a community title scheme building complex. At present, as most would be aware, to obtain body corporate approval the potential letting manager must have purchased the rights or assignment of the letting rights to the building. This includes outlays for the rights to the business and the purchase of a unit within the complex amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars. I believe that it is unreasonable to expect an applicant to outlay these large amounts or, for that matter, to have the purchase financed through loans without certainty that the applicant will ultimately be successful and that a licence would be issued following body corporate approval.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068071"></A>
With this in mind, the amendment will allow applicants to apply for a licence which will be processed to assess their qualifications, eligibility and suitability. Once this is done, they would be advised of the outcome of that assessment and then, subject to that assessment, a licence would be issued upon submitting proof of the approval of the body corporate for the person to conduct letting rights in that building complex. I think we would all agree that this is a far better approach to the application process and at the same time removes the risk of financial loss for unsuccessful applicants.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068072"></A>
There are a number of other technical amendments which reduce red tape and are therefore more efficient and effective for the licensed occupations. In conclusion, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the minister for introducing this bill that not only implements a number of reform recommendations from the former Service Delivery and Performance Commission but also aligns with the government’s stated policy of red-tape reduction and meaningful regulatory reform. As such, I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms GRACE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Brisbane Central--ALP) (5.17 pm): I rise to support the Property Agents and Motor Dealers and Other Legislation Amendment Bill and, in doing so, want to make a few short comments in relation to it. One of the main reasons for speaking on this bill is that I welcome many of the changes that are incorporated in the bill. People who buy their first home or unit or car are probably making one of the biggest decisions they will make in their life and there is an expectation by people in the community that their consumer protections are found in legislation and that they cannot be ripped off in relation to these big decisions. I support this legislation and I also welcome the support of the opposition because it does the three things that I believe good legislation should always do: wherever possible, it should reduce red tape; maintain consumer protection in that we are not watering down consumer protection; and simplify processes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068079"></A>
I notice that in the legislation warning statements when buying a home and information sheets are still maintained when buying a lot under a community title scheme, and the cooling-off periods are still maintained and the rights of those consumers are still maintained in the legislation. I fully support any amendments that simplify the delivery and presentation requirements for proposed relevant contracts without reducing, as I said before, consumer protection or information requirements. I am glad that this legislation will ensure that these often minor technical failures in the contract delivery process are not fodder for litigation. After hearing the member for Kawana on how solicitors often go about finding loopholes in these contracts, it is a welcome relief in this legislation that those loopholes and minor technical failures in the delivery process are being removed from the legislation. I might even be so bold as to say that we had to do this because of the lawyers playing in the area.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068120"></A>
The bill seeks to amend chapter 11 of the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act by altering the processes by which a proposed residential property contract is presented or delivered to a prospective buyer. The bill simplifies contract presentation and delivery without forfeiting consumer protection, and I believe it is important that that is maintained in the legislation as it is. For example, important consumer information about property sales is retained and the cooling-off provisions, which I welcome, are also preserved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068121"></A>
The bill also seeks to remove or reduce red tape by removing a requirement that licensees must advise of their intention to open any trust account. It is important that licensees who receive moneys in trust will deal with those moneys properly and that those moneys are safeguarded in the interests of the person to whom they ultimately belong. Licensees are still required to notify the Office of Fair Trading when a trust account is opened or closed. Those licensees are also required to deal with holding, reporting, accounting for and paying over any trust moneys held on behalf of trust creditors. I believe that it is well received that those protections are still there in the legislation. The measure to remove the requirement for licensees to notify of the licensee’s intention to open a trust account reduces regulatory red tape without in any way reducing the protection offered by the legislation to trust creditors regarding the treatment of money held in trust by licensees.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1160653"></A>
The bill will also remove the requirement for motor dealers to provide proof of local authority approval to operate motor-dealing activity from motor-dealing business premises. I have many motor dealers in my electorate and I know that many of them who are either there or intending to open will welcome these changes. As we know, local authorities, through their by-laws, regulate the use of premises for business purposes, including motor dealing. Therefore, there is no justification for duplicating any regulatory requirement regarding business premises in the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000. I believe that the removal of this requirement makes very good sense. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068124"></A>
As I have said previously, any reduction in legislative requirements, which this bill advances, without reducing consumer rights and the protection of those rights is a commendable ambition and ought to be supported. I believe that the minister and his staff have done a good job in tidying up chapter 11 and in making sure, as I have said, that we deliver on the reduction of red tape while maintaining consumer protection and removing those technical errors in simplifying the processes for contract delivery. They are steps in the right direction. They have done a great job with the legislation. I congratulate them on it and I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms JARRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Whitsunday--ALP) (5.22 pm): It is my pleasure to rise to make a very short contribution to the debate on the Property Agents and Motor Dealers and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. Buying a property, whether for personal use, commercial use or for investment, is still probably the biggest financial transaction that most of us will ever make. Therefore, it is important that this activity is sufficiently complex so as to provide consumer and vendor protection while also being transparent and easy to follow. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068128"></A>
During my last experience of buying a property, my solicitor raised with me his concerns about parts of the process and, in particular, the dire consequences for a vendor if contractual papers are presented in the wrong sequence. Therefore, it is pleasing that, through this amendment bill, the government is simplifying the requirements for the exchange of residential property contracts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068129"></A>
A number of real estate agents have expressed concerns about the onerous complexity of complying with the current provisions for presenting and delivering residential property contracts to buyers and the significant consequences if a mistake or omission is made in presenting a proposed contract to a buyer. Under the current legislation, if an agent makes a mistake or omission in delivering a proposed residential property contract to a buyer, the buyer can terminate the contract at any time up until settlement. In the case of sales of proposed lots or units in community title schemes, settlement can sometimes take years to achieve. So it is unfair to the owners or developers of these properties that an intended sale can fall over years after the initial making of the contract because of some error--often technical or minor in nature--with the devastating consequence of the loss of the sale. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068130"></A>
The amendments will simplify the processes for the presentation of property contracts and provide a statutory cut-off for buyers to exercise any right that they may have acquired as a result of improper or incorrect contract document presentation and delivery. This amendment will provide greater certainty in the real estate marketplace. With those few words, I commend the minister for his positive move to remedy this issue. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (5.25 pm): Australians have an enduring love affair with property--Queenslanders even more so. Any new regulation or amendments to our existing property acts must build on the best parts of that which works well and remove or alter that which does not. As we all realise, the act is a massive tome that is almost unrecognisable compared to that from which it originated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068133"></A>
Despite that, Australians young and old are purchasing property that they simply cannot afford. Very quickly, their rental payments that were being made prior to their successful purchase of the property look very reasonable indeed. What has happened in the most recent downturn in the property market has in part led to the changes that are being made to the act. The public have in very large numbers sought legal avenues to escape binding property contracts. In the past, that has led to some escaping from contracts that would potentially financially ruin them. What does happen in some cases is that those from whom they are purchasing or failing to purchase, as the other party in these transactions, are being destroyed in the process. Such is the impact of the weaknesses in the act and such is the difficulty when dealing with personalities, property and contractual agreements involving the most important things in people’s lives. Sadly, it is only when people reflect on the difficulties that they have either placed themselves in or have found themselves in and the stresses that follow that they discover that the property that they coveted or suddenly do not wish to own is not the most important thing in life after all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068134"></A>
The property industry continues on, despite huge mortgages with near impossible average payment schedules. The public continue to want to own their own slice of heaven. An article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 of 13 May this year reported that payments are now routinely 150 per cent more than what was deemed previously acceptable. The impact of this increase, with rising interest rates and the greater demands for equity, leads to the potential for resumptions by banks and increasing rates in the forthcoming few years. The CEO of Westpac, Gail Kelly, has highlighted this in her CEO’s report to the market. There is a greater disparity between the rationale of a 25-year oppressive mortgage and considerably lower rental costs for a similar property than there has ever been, but that has not deterred the market. The public have an insatiable desire to purchase their own home in the suburbs where they can establish their families and their lives. No wonder we are seeing family problems when the financial problems hit home, too. This is very much the driver behind the changes to PAMDA--so that people know what they are getting themselves into. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068136"></A>
Rather than summarising the changes in list form, I thought I might follow the minister’s lead from his second reading speech. The amendments will indeed clarify and simplify the process and delivery of rental property contracts when a real estate agent or seller gives the proposed contract to the buyer. Local agents in my electorate of Gaven have said almost in unison that the changes are long overdue. They support them. They believe that it will be easier and clearer for all parties. The previous act was choking the process. There was far too much emphasis on repetition of warnings, even after informing the buyer literally minutes earlier when a minor adjustment to the contract was to be made that was endorsed by both parties. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068137"></A>
Correctly, the minister has highlighted the amendments to PAMDA that will do most to reassure those builders, developers and sales agents who are selling both off-the-plan and project-built homes. Unfortunately, the changes do not go quite far enough. There is still considerable leeway for buyers to renege on contracts very close to the point of delivery of the home or commercial structure. The ease with which this can occur will continue to cause grief to project development and is concerning, particularly in this market. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068138"></A>
Queensland has and will continue to have significant new home construction because of the 1,800 new Queenslanders who are arriving weekly. The Property Council of Australia’s figures estimate that, currently, we are 140,000 homes short in Australia. The vast bulk of these homes are needed in Queensland, then in Western Australia and then in New South Wales. These are telling statistics. Interestingly, the figure which represents the home shortage equals the current Australian national debt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072139"></A>
The minister has specifically cited for change those provisions relating to chapter 11 which have been recently used by considerable numbers of buyers who, for all sorts of reasons--mainly due to changes in economic circumstances--wish to avoid contracts. They have used the section related to technical breaches and the act of noncompliance with the requirements. The extraordinary situation of not faxing pages in the correct order has led to a technical breach and the contract subsequently falling over because of this. This has been corrected.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072142"></A>
Similarly, chapter 11 has also been substantially redrafted by the government in its response to the former Service Delivery and Performance Commission, as it was called at the time. As the explanatory notes indicate, the SDPC recommended several changes to chapter 11, parts 1 to 3, requirements concerning the presentation and delivery of residential property contracts. It also recommended parallel amendments be made to the body corporate management act. The government did not support a complete repeal of the act. It has justified this because it appears to be overprotective of consumer protection provisions. These are specifically one-page warning statements and the issue of the cooling-off period. In all fairness, maybe both are reasonable. In summary, the government is attempting to balance certainty of contract with consumer rights. This is appropriate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072143"></A>
PAMDA is a massive act. This bill is adding quite a few more pages in other areas. In his second reading speech the minister went into the detail about the warning statement issue, the signing acknowledgement issue, the right of contract termination as it relates to the seller’s or agent’s responsibilities, and drawing the buyer’s or purchaser’s attention to the warning statement. It is all quite sensible. Also it seems clear and it does not provide the need for the seller or the agent to repeat themselves literally minutes after going through the contact. In general terms, there are negotiations over price and there are amendments to the price. Having to go through warning statements multiple times is unproductive and unnecessary. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072144"></A>
As I have said, the agents are happy, the targeted consultations with key stakeholders appear to have delivered a good outcome and it will be interesting to see in practical terms how it works. In general terms, buyers need exits and sometimes sellers do, too. But as in all contracts, the reasons for doing so need to be balanced. Currently there does appear to be an unfair weighting in the purchaser’s favour. The cooling-off period remains, as I have indicated from the government’s response to the SDPC recommendations, as does the right of purchasers to include such terms as finance to be approved and building and pest inspections to be passed as additional waivers on contracts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072145"></A>
The transitional arrangements do not affect those existing rights. The government has set a 90-day maximum pre-amendment right to terminate for so-called technical breaches. For example, the prescriptive order of delivery of documents will cease on commencement of the act. Again this is a question of balance. The minister says that sellers are now provided with much certainty and buyers will have sufficient time for termination. It is hard to really have a fixed view of the 90-day contract maximum capping other than that there has to be a time limit. I suspect the choice of 90 days came about by someone saying it was about right. I am not sure who that someone was, nor do I think it was really thought through. I have concerns because currently the housing market in Queensland is flat, whereas Sydney had a 26 per cent price increase in the last 12 months and Melbourne had a 21 per cent increase. In both markets unemployment is falling whereas it is increasing in Queensland. The participation rate in Queensland in particular has fallen and it is unclear why. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072146"></A>
Some Queensland contracts are known to be longer, with some buyers obviously speculating on the market, using the delayed settlement contract with smaller deposits. The actual numbers are hard to come by and the information is hazy but the banks say that it is increasing. Also, some sellers are considering the each-way bet to close out sales at lower prices with the hope of a later flow-on percentage increase, particularly in the Brisbane and coastal markets. Generally the trend is that the Brisbane market is six months behind the Sydney market when rising. It often flows to the Gold Coast first, then the Sunshine Coast then westwards. These trends have continued in Australia since the Second World War. There is no reason to suspect they will not continue in the same way. This then implies that the market remains volatile and we will see uncertainty in the market at least for the next two years. Certainty is what the market needs, and a contract that is enforceable goes a long way to achieving that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072147"></A>
The difficulty is that this bill, as I have highlighted, has avoided that difficult area that is critical in Queensland of the new home market and the project home market. In Queensland there is massive population growth and movement--it is sea change primarily--and also satellite suburban movement to our major South-East Queensland cities. The new home market, both project builder for owner/occupier and investor, still has too many exit points for purchasers that exist right up to the end of the contract that can leave developers, builders and others completely at risk should the purchaser suddenly wish to exit. By virtue of this, the banks have increased the equity position of those project developers. By nature, when it occurs more frequently than it should it drives volatility and our builders can become severely affected. In a growing market this is a very dangerous problem that we do not want because it has an impact on our capacity to deliver truly affordable housing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072148"></A>
In my electorate of Gaven, which together with Coomera is the fastest growing electorate in Australia, new home and investor construction remains massive and shows no sign of abating. But the development of projects has been slowed significantly. The problem I am highlighting certainly occurs in this market, but what we see here should be giving all other areas a clear insight into what we need to avoid to make our communities stronger. In doing so we reduce problems for residents and builders alike.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072149"></A>
There are changes to the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997. The changes are to ensure that potential buyers are provided with information sheets about bodies corporate where it is relevant to their purchasing situation. Bodies corporate have had a pretty awful time in Queensland for quite a while now. The problems they have faced have been driven from below and above. The critical case of penthouse owners who challenge the right of bodies corporate to charge a higher differential over smaller unit owners has led to changes which for many would seem unfair. There have also been complaints ranging from overcharging to ignoring legitimate requests for repairs, especially for investor owners in bodies corporate who rent their properties out. There are many problems in between. Those problems from above mainly relate to a distant government and its departments that cease to want to play a practical role in assisting resolutions. This needs correction.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072150"></A>
We will no doubt be seeing problems again with investors, site amalgamators, nuisance tenants and, should I say, those who are land banking, being involved in bodies corporate on key sites over the issue of land utilisation and redevelopment as housing densities increase under SEQ planning statements and there are shrinking property sizes to house these greater densities. Land does increase in value slowly, but unpredictable massive price valuation adjustments can occur when greater densities are approved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072151"></A>
Primarily the amendments of the BCCM Act are to enable potential purchasers to be fully informed. The problem is that bodies corporate in practice range from being very transparent and relatively inexpensive to being very secretive and very expensive. One can only hope that a prospective purchaser buys a property where the body corporate is user-friendly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072152"></A>
In reality, bodies corporate rely on owners and occupiers to be fair to one another. On the Gold Coast, to allow for those who really feel afraid of bodies corporate, some new developments have prospered in the market because there was an avoidance of a body corporate. Interestingly, some good alternative strategies have been put in place to facilitate the same results for occupiers. It has worked better in closed estates for over-50s where no rentals are allowed. This eventually will restrict the market. Whilst this always limits the market, it does reduce problems in certain cases. We need to make sure there is a full range of methods and situations for the public so that they can choose the one that suits them best. The government needs to avoid being unduly prescriptive.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072153"></A>
PAMDA is a mixture of necessary regulation, newer modern reactive regulation and overregulation. It is a bill that encompasses part of the critical, greatest lifetime investment Queenslanders and Australians ever make. The negotiations are usually the most stressful and either the most exciting or the most terrible times of one’s life. Obviously the bill needs to reflect the kind of seriousness that such decisions involve. I think some of it is good, but I wonder whether consciously avoiding an area that occupies 50 per cent of the market was truly avoidance or whether it was ignorance. If it was ignorance, it is probably not too late to suggest that we need to build on the existing bill and the minister needs to address that in his concluding remarks. Either way, in our own Queensland market the new home market is going to remain very choppy indeed and PAMDA is still a long way from addressing that. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr CHOI</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Capalaba--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.38 pm): Thank you for the opportunity to contribute briefly to the debate on the Property Agents and Motor Dealers and Other Legislation Amendment Bill--PAMDA for short. To establish why this legislation is important we first need to take a step back and examine the situation here in Queensland. In 2008 the former Service Delivery and Performance Commission conducted a review of the PAMDA legislation and as part of that review extensive consultation took place. Stakeholders such as the Queensland Consumers Association, the REIQ and the Queensland Law Society were all involved.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072192"></A>
This consultation revealed, among other things, that the real estate industry and legal stakeholders believed the process surrounding residential real estate contracts was overly complex and prescriptive. The clear message to the government was that we needed to cut red tape and maintain protection for consumers, of course, and make sure the law did not allow people to act unfairly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072194"></A>
This amendment bill before the House today is an important one. I point to the fact that South-East Queensland is Australia’s fastest growing region to emphasise the importance of this bill. By 2031 our population in the south-east corner is expected to grow to more than four million people. My electorate is part of Redland city. There are currently more than 140,000 people living in the area and that is expected to rise to between 170,000 and 220,000 by the year 2031. That means a greater demand for housing; more houses will be bought and sold and more contracts will change hands. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072197"></A>
While there has been some contraction in the construction industry of late, a recent Access Economics report stated that the sheer pressure of population growth should drive an upturn in residential building activities in the long run. That means jobs for Queenslanders. In my electorate of Capalaba, two suburbs--the suburbs of Capalaba and Alexandra Hills--have the highest number of tradies in Queensland. More than 2,000 people are employed in the construction industry in my electorate alone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072200"></A>
Creating jobs like these is one of the reasons this government is investing $17 billion in our building program, which is vital to support the economy. That is why we have encouraged industry by providing the first home owner scheme initiative, which has been successful. These jobs are important because they make the Australian dream of homeownership possible. This bill is important because, as more and more Queenslanders step up to make one of the biggest decisions of their lives--to purchase a home--they are afforded as much protection as possible without being unfair to the sellers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072202"></A>
The process of entering a contract, especially for first home buyers, is a very daunting one. This bill continues to contain provisions to ensure that a cooling-off period exists for persons entering into a contract, as well as to require all contracts to include consumer protection information. It also continues to enhance consumer protection by ensuring the independence of lawyers acting for buyers. The seller or the agent will be required to give a clear statement to the buyer, either in writing or verbally, directing the buyer to the warning statement and the proposed relevant contract. The buyer must sign the warning statement before the contract is signed, acknowledging that they have read and understand fully the information contained in the warning statement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072204"></A>
Under the amendments to PAMDA, it will be an offence for a seller not to attach a warning statement to a proposed contract and it will attract the maximum penalty of 200 units. Under this bill, the buyer has the right to terminate a contract if the seller or their agent failed to give a clear statement to the buyer directing their attention to the warning statement and proposed contract at the time of giving the proposed relevant contract to the buyer. The bill deems that, if the warning statement is not attached to the proposed contract, then a clear statement has not been given. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072206"></A>
I believe this bill strikes a fine balance between protection to the homebuyers and the sellers. As it stands, chapter 11 of PAMDA allows buyers to avoid contracts for minor and technical breaches. For instance, under the current act, some things such as faxing pages of the contract in the wrong order can lead to a buyer withdrawing from a contract. So amending this aspect makes life fairer, in my opinion, for all parties concerned. Changes to this act will also achieve the aim of cutting red tape and providing adequate protection for consumers. It is a win for consumers. It is a win for sellers as well. I commend this bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr RYAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Morayfield--ALP) (5.44 pm): I rise to contribute to the debate on the Property Agents and Motor Dealers and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. Some of the most important and valuable assets owned by people are their homes and their motor vehicles. Most people have heard that the most important thing that they will ever buy is their own home. However, most people have limited experience when it comes to the purchase of real estate or motor vehicles. It is this limited experience which places individual purchasers in a somewhat vulnerable position when compared to the position of a real estate agent engaged by the seller or a motor vehicle dealer engaged by the seller. Ultimately, the seller’s agent is not only more experienced in sale transactions for these types of property but is also coming from a position of enhanced knowledge about the nature and character of the property and the sales process. What is more, it is unusual that a purchaser has had the opportunity to seek advice from a legal practitioner about their rights and obligations prior to the execution of a contract of sale. This is particularly the case for people who are purchasing real estate. In my view, it is critically important for those buyers to be afforded protection by the law. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072211"></A>
Consumer protection is a necessary component of our legal and economic framework and ensures that those people, who may be at a disadvantage when purchasing certain property or who may be in a vulnerable position compared to the position of a seller or a seller’s agent, receive support and assistance under the law. At the same time, it is important that fairness and balance be promoted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072212"></A>
I have spoken before in this place about my passion for the concept of a safety net for vulnerable, marginalised and disadvantaged people. I am pleased that this Labor government has supported, and continues to support, strong safety net protections for purchasers of real estate and other property in Queensland. The amendments contained in this bill maintain consumer protection provisions in respect of residential property whilst at the same time enhancing certainty for sellers, agents and purchasers, removing red tape and promoting balance and fairness for all parties. Clearly, from recent court cases and from anecdotal evidence in the real estate industry, significant uncertainty exists in the residential real estate market concerning the presentation and delivery of residential property sales documents, particularly the warning statement, and the proposed relevant contract. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072213"></A>
In the case of residential sales contracts with long settlement periods, such as in the case of sales of lots or proposed lots under a community title scheme, because of some error, often technical or minor in nature, the buyer effectively receives a cooling-off period which can extend for years. This is clearly not the intention of the legislation. It is unfair to the owners of these properties that an intended sale can fall over years after the initial making of the contract merely because the real estate agent made a mistake in not following precisely the requirements of chapter 11 of the act in presenting a proposed relevant contract to a buyer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072214"></A>
Another unintended consequence is that, in the case of an error or noncompliance with the contract delivery requirements, buyers are often provided an opportunity to renegotiate sales contracts on terms more favourable to themselves than previously accepted and agreed to in the disputed contract and vendors only have the option of accepting these altered terms or losing the sale altogether. The amendments in this bill seek to limit the time in which a buyer may terminate a contract because of some error in presenting the proposed relevant contract without a warning statement. The provision limiting termination action to 90 days from the time that the contract becomes binding on the parties should give buyers sufficient time to consider their position, seek appropriate professional legal advice and take remedial action considered necessary. Allowing termination rights to extend for years is unfair to sellers and promotes disruption and uncertainty in the real estate market, particularly for the sale of lots or proposed lots in community title schemes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072215"></A>
The amendments in this bill are good amendments. They provide greater certainty for the real estate industry; they maintain important consumer protection provisions for purchasers; they remove red tape and provide simplified processes for the presentation of contracts for sale of residential property. These amendments in this bill will enhance the experience for purchasers, sellers and sellers’ agents and are, accordingly, welcome and necessary additions to the Queensland economy and the community more broadly. I commend the minister, his staff and the departmental staff for their hard work in respect of this bill. I commend this bill to the House and encourage all members to support it. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr HOOLIHAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Keppel--ALP) (5.49 pm): In speaking to the Property Agents and Motor Dealers and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, it is necessary to look at what has arisen over time in relation to residential property contracts for single lots; that is, stand-alone premises, and for lots under the Body Corporate and Community Management Act. Both acts are covered by this amending bill. The original method of having a contract for sale was that each party would sign a contract in the terms agreed between them and then they would exchange contracts. Queensland always had a slightly different approach in that the contract that was to be used was signed by both the vendor and the purchaser. As the nature of property contracts evolved, there were a variety of ways that people could get out of a contract and it was necessary to introduce legislation to control what people were made aware of when they wanted to buy property. For some strange reason, the ability of the average person to see a house that they liked and sign a contract on it was always outweighed by the fact that they never bothered to listen very closely to what they were told or the advice they were given. Consequently, it often fell to the legal adviser acting for them to find some way to correct their oversight or to get them out of the hole into which they had dug themselves. Other a period, the act required various documents to ensure that purchasers were made aware of the implications of their purchase and, more specifically in relation to body corporate lots, any potential outgoings. It was required that a notice be given as to details of the body corporate arrangement and the administration and sinking fund outlays, which people tended to forget about when working out how much they were able to pay for a property. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072255"></A>
Because of the method that had evolved, the presentation documents, including the notification of the rights of a purchaser, had become very prescriptive. It was at the stage where, if a real estate agent drew up a contract for a seller in Brisbane and forwarded it to a buyer in Townsville, it was very important that the documents were sent in a very specific order. When they were received, they were to be kept in a very specific order. They had to be signed, acknowledging certain documents at certain stages, and they had to be returned in that same order. As a result, a lot of loopholes were created and sometimes some unscrupulous claims were made that the documents were not in the right order. It had become a very onerous process. Hopefully, the amendments to the act will alleviate those problems. The real estate industry, in particular, expressed concerns about the complexity of complying with the current provisions regarding presenting and delivering residential property contracts to buyers, particularly in relation to termination if a mistake or omission was made in presenting the proposed contract. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072256"></A>
The bill amends chapter 11 of the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act and chapter 5 of the Body Corporate and Community Management Act. Hopefully, these amendments will bring both those acts into line. The member for Morayfield spoke about the ability to terminate contracts years after they are signed, particularly in relation to people who purchase property off the plan. The bill amends the method by which the notice is to be given to outline to the buyer their rights and obligations in relation to the contract, the cooling-off period and the importance of seeking professional advice as appropriate. Very often, once the documents are signed it is too late to obtain legal advice about any of the matters in the contract. If a person realises they may have made a mistake, their only recourse is to look for some way of getting out of the contract. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072257"></A>
The amendments to the Body Corporate and Community Management Act ensure that the provisions in relation to sale of lots are compatible with and match the changes made to the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act. In particular, it is noted that the Body Corporate and Community Management Act is being amended to provide that the information sheet and disclosure statement required under the Body Corporate and Community Management Act are attached to the proposed sales contract. At the moment they can be presented by the agent prior to the actual receipt of the contract, but now they will need to be attached so that they refer to that contract. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072258"></A>
The other amendments in the bill relate to the return of a deposit paid in relation to a proposed lot in a community title scheme. It requires that if the contract is terminated the deposit must be returned within 14 days. Penalties are provided for a failure to return any amount paid by way of a deposit. All in all, I believe the amendments proposed in the bill will make arrangements fairer for the seller and for the buyer. Hopefully, entering into a contract will not end up with either or both parties determining that they have to go to court to have the matter resolved. The amendments ensure the contract provisions are clear and simple to follow, and that there is no conflict between the two chapters of the separate acts. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr SORENSEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Hervey Bay--LNP) (5.56 pm): I rise to speak on the Property Agents and Motor Dealers and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. While the bill appears to attempt to clarify the requirements for the serving of contracts and warning statements, which is long overdue, it does not do so in a clear and concise manner. The real estate industry has been plagued with badly worded acts, ambiguous meanings and seemingly endless requirements for paperwork that may have little effect on the overall goodwill of the parties to a contract. The Labor government has continually ignored advice from practising agents and the industry regarding flaws in the system for the serving of documents and the drafting of forms. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072261"></A>
The current act came into force in 2000 and there have been various amendments to it. In the past, agents and consumers have had issues with the way the forms are drafted and various aspects of the act and its interpretation including: why does the act cover three unrelated industries? Why is the emphasis on the delivery order of forms and the impractical aspects of these provisions, and the difference in order with different methods of delivery? Why are the definitions not all in the dictionary? They should all be in one place. Why are the approved forms not in the regulations and why are they changed so often, without due consultation with the industry? What about the chapter 5, division 6, the ‘lands not lawfully used for residential purposes’ provision? What about the need for separate licences for auctioneers, pastoral houses and developers? When will the cooling-off period start? What of marketeering provisions and their effectiveness? What of the comparative market analysis provision and the effective contract dates? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072262"></A>
In recent times, the real estate industry has brought to my attention the issue of forms designed by officers of the Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation, with amended variations released on 1 July 2009. Briefly, in the July 2009 issue, fields are not flexible to allow multiple owners, and multiple licences and licensees. Also, there are inconsistencies in forms in client details fields. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072291"></A>
In relation to multiple owners, it is not possible to complete multiple owners--buyers on form 30c--in the fields provided under clients’ details on forms. The forms affected are 20a, 21a, 22a, 24a, 25, 26 and 30c. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072299"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SORENSEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In relation to multiple licences and licensees, it is not possible to complete more than one licence and certainly not dates of expiry as these are ‘boxed’. There are inconsistencies in form client and agent details as they differ on various forms. Form 30c has no provision for a company name. Forms 21a, 22a and 23 say ‘to be completed by client’. As agents and solicitors prepare these forms generally electronically and therefore the client does not complete these sections, does it negate the transaction and appointment? In relation to the form fields, it is not possible to complete more than one date of expiry as these are ‘boxed’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072300"></A>
The serving of forms at present has been nothing short of a joke to interstate buyers where the warning statement must be served before a contract and yet a form 22 must be signed before the warning statement but served after. The bill appears to address some of these issues and retains certain consumer protection. However, at the end of the day, would it not be much simpler to just make the contract unenforceable, at the option of the buyer, if the warning statement was not signed before the contract and the cooling-off period does not start until the warning statement is signed? This bill appears to address some of the issues. But still to have a form advice or statement that refers to another statement defies logic. Perhaps we should still have a form to refer to the form that refers to the statement! </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072301"></A>
Let us look at the objective of the warning statement, PAMD form 30c. It gives the buyer clear warning and information to obtain independent legal advice, to obtain independent valuation from a registered valuer, to not sign the form without reading and understanding it, and to not sign if the buyer feels pressured. It also provides information on building contracts and information on the cooling-off period. Would it not be simpler to have a reference to the warning statement that the buyer acknowledges that they have received, read and understood the warning statement when signing it? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072303"></A>
The objective of many of the forms is to offer consumer protection to buyers and to regulate the manner in which they are expedited. However, one must ask if they are effective for the objectives that are trying to be achieved. For example, there is no legal requirement to undertake searches generally by a purchaser. Only the solicitors have a protocol that indicates what searches are generally undertaken. They include searches of local government rates and requisitions; land tax searches; department of transport searches for possible resumptions; town planning searches; drainage plan searches; Queensland Rail searches for possible resumptions; searches of regional electricity corporation for asset location and possible resumptions; and searches of the contaminated sites register. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072304"></A>
Is it about buyer protection and disclosure or let the buyer beware? While the opposition supports the bill, there are still many issues that need to be resolved within the act. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs MILLER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bundamba--ALP) (6.04 pm): The Property Agents and Motor Dealers and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 is a result of the review of the act, its regulations and codes of conduct, conducted by the Service Delivery and Performance Commission. The report and government response were tabled in this House in April last year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072307"></A>
The government has supported a streamlining of chapter 11 rather than repealing the whole chapter, as there are very important protections in that chapter necessary for consumers. Accordingly, red tape has been reduced, with the removal of some of the prescriptive requirements. The circumstances under which a buyer may terminate a contract has been limited, especially in relation to technical breaches by the seller or the agent of the seller. Warning statements are retained. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072308"></A>
Coming through my electorate office sometimes I have a number of people who get into all sorts of trouble in relation to purchasing homes. I think mostly it is because they have never done it before. They have no idea what they are doing. In relation to Ipswich, one of the most important things is that people need to have full information in relation to the facts on their purchasing a property, not just in relation to contracts but also in relation to property searches. Time and again I am advised of purchasers who try to cut corners by not getting all the searches done. This is just sheer stupidity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072309"></A>
In Ipswich, buyers should always have a mine search completed by the mines department as the city is heavily undermined. In my electorate, the following suburbs have had mining activity: Swanbank; Blackstone; Bundamba; Ebbw Vale; Dinmore; Riverview, which has had open-cut mines; Redbank; Collingwood Park; Goodna; and Redbank Plains. So trying to cut costs by not having these searches done is simply dumb, and it is even dumber to believe the nonsense peddled that the city is not affected by mining activity; it is. Coalmining has been undertaken in Ipswich since the 1850s, and the effects are still with us today. In fact, it is costing the Ipswich Motorway project quite a lot of money filling up the underground mines in the Redbank and Goodna area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072317"></A>
There has been both underground and open-cut mining. In the earlier years many of the older mines were not mapped, and they cannot be mapped because it simply was not done back then. That is why it is so important that these mine searches are undertaken. It is a simple process through the department of mines, and it is certainly worth the money in respect of the cost of purchasing a house. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072318"></A>
It is also important to have all other searches completed as well. It simply defies belief that purchasers can sign contracts--sometimes in excess of half a million dollars--and then advise their solicitors to get the minimal searches undertaken sometimes to save a mere couple of hundred dollars. It further defies belief that some people do not want to have expert inspections done. For example, they do not want to have building inspections done. They cannot see the importance of having pest inspections completed, and some even want to do the legals themselves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072319"></A>
What I am saying is that I think there needs to be some sort of general training program out there for people who have never purchased a home before. It is quite difficult to purchase a home when you are talking about the processes involved. Also, what they should be looking at are the town planning processes. They also need to be aware of the pitfalls in obtaining finance--for example, whether to go through a bank or a building society or some other financial institution. Some people simply have no idea. It is even more important when considering that in my electorate I have 120 nationalities for many of whom English is a third or a fourth language. When you put some of these documents in front of people in my electorate they have no idea what they are signing. Sometimes they can read the numbers--they know that it might be $300,000 or $500,000--but they have no idea what it actually means in terms of the processes involved and what happens after they have signed a contract. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072321"></A>
I thank the minister for bringing this legislation before the House. But, in terms of my particular electorate, there still needs to be a lot of consumer advocacy done on behalf of my constituents, particularly for those whom English is a second, third or fourth language and also for those who do not understand the importance of getting searches done. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind) (6.09 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on the Property Agents and Motor Dealers and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. At the outset, I thank the minister for the briefing I received today from his departmental staff. It certainly was appreciated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072353"></A>
Prior to that briefing I was planning to introduce a number of amendments to this bill dealing with commercial agents and process servers, specifically in relation to sections 344 and 345 and how those agents are actually appointed and the appointment document. As a result of the advice I received from the departmental staff, I do not intend to proceed with those amendments. It certainly saved me some work and no doubt it saved the minister and his officers some work too. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072355"></A>
What came out of the briefing was a common-sense approach. I understand that in the future the government is looking at separating this act so that there will be a stand-alone property agents act, a stand-alone motor dealers act and a stand-alone commercial agents and process servers act. I certainly believe that that should be a definite move. I believe there are conflicts and differences in relation to some of the requirements that commercial agents and process servers have to comply with. They really do not fit into the domain of the property agents and motor dealers legislation. I look forward to seeing the draft bills produced. I certainly hope the departmental officers consult with longstanding commercial agents and process servers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072358"></A>
There is one thing that I could touch on for the minister’s benefit. At the meeting the issue of fair trading officers doing audits of commercial agents and process servers was raised. I went back to my constituent and tried to get further information about whether it was auditing or whether he believed it was the case that members of the public had simply complained about a specific commercial agent or process server. I was informed that there had been a number of audits--for the sake of a better word--of a number of commercial agents and process servers throughout Queensland, in particular in Toowoomba and other areas. If one of the officers could contact my constituent in due course that might be clarified. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072359"></A>
In light of the pending amendments to this legislation, I wonder whether the minister could consider continuing an amnesty that I understand occurred in 2003 in relation to fair trading officers’ auditing of commercial agents and process servers compliance with some of the provisions which they believed they should not have to comply with. But never mind, perhaps that is a discussion for another day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072360"></A>
The bill states very clearly that this bill will commence from 1 October 2010. I understand that that is because the Law Society and the Real Estate Institute have already started to prepare contracts so that everyone knows very clearly that from 1 October there is a new law applicable in Queensland. I commend the bill to the House. I thank the minister for the briefing earlier today. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Bundaberg--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(6.13 pm): The purchase of a home is the most significant investment many Queenslanders make in their life. It may be the only substantial purchase that they make. It is very important that it is done properly. Those dreams and desires certainly affect the individual or the family for a number of years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072365"></A>
Signing a contract is the achievement of many Queenslanders’ dreams and goals. People have saved for years to get their deposit and commit to the largest debt of their lives in an effort to have their own home. Obviously, this is not a decision any family or individual takes lightly. It is a most significant one. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072366"></A>
It is also one of the most complex processes a family or individual undertakes. Anyone who has completed a property deal knows the amount of paperwork that is involved between property agents, lawyers and finance providers. It can be confusing and frustrating for many Queenslanders, especially considering the importance of what is at stake. It can also encompass a number of emotional factors and they need to be taken into account too. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072367"></A>
With the federal government’s first home owner grants, this state saw many people come into the market as first home buyers. The grants led to younger people committing themselves to the investment in their first home. These first home buyers were particularly vulnerable to being the victims of mistakes when negotiating the sale of a property. We know for people buying their first home that negotiating the paperwork involved with these contracts is mind boggling. They need help. They need, as said in the House earlier today, balance and common sense in those dealings. They also need to make sure that their rights are looked after throughout the whole process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072369"></A>
When looking at this legislation before the parliament I was mindful of Queenslanders who face the complexity of buying a property, but in particular future homebuyers taking the plunge into achieving the great Australian dream of owning their own home. When it comes to property contracts, anything this parliament can do to simplify those contracts for future Queensland homebuyers should be strongly considered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072370"></A>
Removing the complex technicalities is the crux of this legislation. In particular, this legislation is concerned with chapter 11 of the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000. As already noted by the government, the provisions in chapter 11 needed streamlining by editing and simplifying some of the processes and ensuring technical failures in the contractual delivery process do not form the basis for litigation. Obviously, having technicalities leading to litigation is not an outcome this parliament wants to encourage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072372"></A>
Back in 2008 the Service Delivery and Performance Commission recommended removing chapter 11 entirely in order to combat the technical failures that were occurring. This solution has not been undertaken. Instead this bill proposes several amendments in order to solve the technical failures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072373"></A>
The most fundamental flaw in the 2000 bill concerns some technicalities involving the order in which documents are sent. Something as simple as not sending the warning statement first can result in litigation, penalties and termination of the contract. The explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1072376"></A>
Buyers have been able to use technical breaches of Chapter 11 to terminate contracts sometimes years after the breach, even though they may not have suffered any material detriment because of the breach. For example, a buyer may simply have changed their mind about purchasing the property because they found a better priced property.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072377"></A>
 While voiding a contract when there is a legitimate problem is completely within the rights of a seller or buyer, to use a technicality such as faxing the wrong document first as an excuse to cancel a sale is a loophole that needs to be closed. I do not think contracts should be cancelled and sellers fined up to $200,000 because of an honest administrative mistake. This is just one example of a technicality that is addressed in the proposed amendments. It clearly sets out the proper requirements for sale and how termination can occur. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072378"></A>
It is entirely fair that the legislation enforces a warning statement that is attached to the relevant contract. In doing so, it sets out that the contract might be terminated if the buyer does not receive a clear statement directing their attention to the warning statements and contract. It can also be terminated if the warning statement is not signed. Thankfully, it removes some of the problematic technicalities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072379"></A>
The most important part of this legislation is that it protects the buyer’s right to terminate the contract for legitimate reasons, but also gives the seller greater certainty by closing the loopholes that can be exploited due to those technicalities. All of these changes are positive. As with any legislation passed by the House, it can sit on counters and benches if a proper education program is not conducted by the appropriate office. I encourage the Office of Fair Trading and other government departments to ensure that buyers and sellers are continually made aware of this legislation and the pitfalls.  </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Accountability within the industry must be raised as well, because it is an industry that attracts an unstable workforce at times. The good people within all of those industries need to know that there is a proper pathway for them and if they do the hard work and they follow the rules they will have an opportunity for a career within that industry. There needs to be education, but education needs to be coupled with an enforcement program that goes hand in hand with the partnership of sectors within the industry to get the best result. During this debate we talked about first home buyers and their vulnerability, but the pressures put on homebuyers these days are great and there needs to be another form of education given to those homebuyers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076787"></A>
The Office for Fair Trading gives out a considerable amount of information already, but there needs to be some feedback from those first home buyers to see if they are taking heed of that information. Fair Trading staff do a magnificent job and always go above and beyond what they are asked. They work very hard and they cover a big area. Anything we can do to simplify their job is a good thing for all of Queensland, especially for those people who are making the precious investment in their first home. There needs to be balance and common sense in relation to this legislation. It is important that all members of the sector take responsibility to ensure that this new legislation works. The likes of Mr Molloy from the REIQ and the different lawyer groups have to take on the responsibility of ensuring that information gets out to their sector in a timely fashion so that the people in their industry are well informed, because they are on the front line giving that information to first home buyers.</Hansard-Body>

I thank the minister for this legislation and also thank the shadow minister for his in-depth briefings and information throughout this whole process. The more we see parliament working together for the betterment of all Queenslanders, the better impression Queenslanders have not just about real estate agents and motor dealers but about politicians as well.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PJ LAWLOR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southport--ALP) (Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading) (6.22 pm), in reply: I thank all members for their contributions and their support for the progressive amendments contained in this bill. At the outset I want to thank the departmental and ministerial staff for their assistance and expertise in relation to this bill. These amendments will simplify and refine the residential real estate contract process in Queensland, delivering benefits to industry as well as to sellers and buyers. These amendments were developed following feedback from the real estate industry after a number of court cases arising from the legislation as it currently stands.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076798"></A>
The purpose of chapter 11 of the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000, or PAMDA as I will refer to it, is to provide consumer protection for buyers entering into residential real estate contracts. Real estate agents operating under the current PAMDA legislation have found some of the provisions to be too prescriptive and onerous and, as a result, the purpose of them has been overshadowed by a complicated process that is leading to inadvertent errors. This was highlighted by a review undertaken by the former Service Delivery and Performance Commission. The government has taken heed of the recommendations made by the commission and this bill brings to fruition those recommendations through amendments to chapter 11 of the PAMDA legislation. These consumer protection measures are mirrored in the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997. The bill also introduces a number of other red-tape reduction measures in other areas of the PAMDA, most notably streamlining the application process for a residential letting agent licence.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076805"></A>
I thank the member for Mermaid Beach for his support of the bill, although I do not agree with his speculation that these amendments may give the legal fraternity the opportunity to exploit loopholes--quite the opposite in fact. As the member himself pointed out, the bill is designed to remove the opportunity for minor and technical breaches that may give rise to termination of a contract. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076807"></A>
I also do not accept the member for Mermaid Beach’s assertion that the government has been responsible for poorly drafted legislation in this area. The real estate market is ever changing. Demands of both buyers and sellers change depending on financial circumstances. Sales and marketing techniques also change over time. It is completely appropriate that the PAMDA be amended as needed to respond to these changes to ensure that the objectives of the legislation, particularly the consumer protection objectives, continue to be met. Technology also changes. In the recent past we had to change legislation as a result of a court case which related to the attachment of documents. When that legislation was changed it was not contemplated that facsimile machines would be available, and obviously when you fax documents there is no ability to attach documents. That is an example of where technology has overtaken the legislation, which then, as a result of a court case, needed to be amended.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076808"></A>
The member for Mermaid Beach described at some length the detail of some of these amendments over time. It is apparent from his descriptions that the government has been proactive in ensuring that Queensland’s property agents and motor dealers regulatory environment remains an effective tool in ensuring a fair and equitable marketplace. Contrary to the member for Mermaid Beach’s claims, this government has also listened carefully to the industry in developing this bill. He went through some of the people who were consulted. The department has consulted with key stakeholders including, for instance, the Real Estate Institute of Queensland and the Queensland Law Society and has taken their feedback on board.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076812"></A>
As was mentioned by the member for Bundaberg, we will be working with the industry to conduct information sessions throughout the state to ensure best practice in the contract process. The bottom line is that not everyone will be 100 per cent happy with these amendments. The bill aims to strike a balance between the needs of all industry stakeholders, including sellers and buyers. I thank the member for Mudgeeraba for her support of the bill and agree with her statements that these amendments will give industry greater certainty and clarity about the way it does business.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076813"></A>
I thank the member for Kawana for his gracious allowance of the bill. His comment that the bill corrects the government’s mistakes is simply incorrect. This bill is responding to a number of court cases, as I mentioned, and the member should understand that it is ultimately up to the courts to determine cases on their merits. The member for Kawana asked why the requirement about the top sheet has been removed. The point of these amendments is to simplify the prescriptive requirements of the PAMDA legislation. To continue to prescribe placing a statement as a top sheet would be contrary to this aim. However, it will continue to be recommended to sellers and sellers’ agents to maintain this practice of attaching the warning statement as the top sheet of the proposed contract documents to maximise opportunity for buyers to sight and sign the warning statement prior to signing the proposed relevant contract.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076815"></A>
The member for Kawana asked me about the cooling-off period in terms of when it starts. It starts on the day that the buyer receives a copy of the relevant contract and not, as the member suggested, the day after. The member for Kawana also asked me about the communication of acceptance. This can occur by any means acceptable in contract law, including orally, written notice, fax or by return signed contract. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076816"></A>
The member for Kawana also referred to clear statements. The proposed amendments contain a requirement to give a clear statement directing the buyer’s attention to the warning statement and proposed relevant contract. The proposed amendments give an example of how a clear statement in writing could be framed. The intention of requiring a clear statement to be given to buyers is to ensure that their attention is drawn to the important advice and information contained in the warning statement, as well as to the proposed relevant contract. It has the additional benefit of ensuring that the warning statement is attached to the proposed relevant contract, as the seller or the seller’s agent cannot draw a buyer’s attention to a document which is not attached to the proposed relevant contract. If a clear statement directing the buyer’s attention to the warning statement and proposed relevant contract is not given, and providing the buyer has not signed the warning statement indicating the buyer’s attention has been drawn to the documents, the buyer may terminate the contract within 90 days of the formation of the relevant contract without penalty. Any deposit paid by the buyer must be refunded.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076817"></A>
Essentially, the warning statement, when it is signed by the purchaser, is basically conclusive evidence that the warning has been given. It even says in the buyer’s acknowledgement, which is essentially a declaration, ‘We have read all sections of the warning statement. We acknowledge that by signing this warning statement our attention has been directed to the warning statement and the attached proposed relevant contract by a clear statement. We have signed the warning statement before we signed the attached proposed contract.’ So it is quite plain that, when they have signed that, that is an acknowledgement that they have had their attention directed towards that warning statement.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076818"></A>
The member for Gaven raised the issue of 90 days. Essentially, short-term contracts typically extend from 30 to 90 days. Longer term sale contracts can be up to 5 years. So 90 days was chosen as the longer period of the shorter term contracts, and that was considered to give parity to all purchasers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076819"></A>
Opposition members made a number of claims that the government has had to make a number of amendments to PAMDA over time. I think I have addressed most of those comments. It is ironic that the member for Bundaberg was full of praise for the amendments proposed in this bill. In terms of other members such as the member for Hervey Bay, I am not sure what that was about. But as well as I could understand it, he asked a lot of questions or made statements. I think the answer to all of those statements or questions is a pineapple. That is the answer.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1076820"></A>
As I previously noted, these changes have been necessary in order to respond to an ever-changing market. I accept, however, that there is a need for the government to recognise that the legislation can be simplified even further and I am considering options for how that could be done in the near future. The bill affirms Queensland as a safe market in which to purchase real estate. The bill is just another way that the Bligh government is working to simplify life for Queensland businesses--in this case, the real estate industry--while at the same time ensuring that consumers have their rights protected. I thank all honourable members for their support of this bill, and I commend the bill to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I have a question for the minister in relation to an amendment that we received today. That amendment relates to notifying buyers. It basically says ‘we notify one buyer’ as opposed to all buyers of the property. I would like to ask the minister about the case where one buyer of a group of buyers does not receive the appropriate advice, which obviously gives him the chance to void the contract because he has not received that advice. The other buyers may well want to proceed, for different financial market reasons, but because that buyer has not received that information he has the capacity to void the contract. How will that situation be addressed by this amendment? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081044"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am advised that it is the responsibility of the seller, firstly, to direct the attention of one of the purchasers. That notification will then be signed and will still be attached in the normal circumstances to the contract. If it is not, then it is up to the purchasers to decide what they want to do. As the member has mentioned, some may well want to proceed and others may not, but the vendor has discharged his or her obligation by pointing out to the purchasers their obligation to sign the disclosure statement. Once that is signed, it is then up to the purchasers to sort it out between themselves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081045"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 But in terms of consumer protection for the other buyers, they do not want to see the contract void. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081046"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Sure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081047"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 They want it to proceed, but because that other purchaser has taken the opportunity to not acknowledge to them that he has not received that advice he may well want to void the contract, which may leave the other purchasers severely financially disadvantaged. That is the issue that I am trying to get around. How do we address that? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081048"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am advised that the seller has discharged his or her obligation--and remembering that in most of these situations there would be an agent involved anyway--but in the event of the situation the member has described where three have signed the warning statement and one has not, then they have to sort that out between themselves. Certainly, the one purchaser who has not signed would not be in a position to rescind the contract, given that the other three had acknowledged that their attention had been drawn to the warning statement. I would imagine they would have to sort that out between themselves. Maybe the solution would be that one of them would drop out of the contract, but they would not be in a position where they could rescind the contract through the default of the vendor to point out the warning statement to each of those four purchasers. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081052"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (7.36 pm): New section 369A provides for a consumer to waive the compulsory five-day cooling-off period. Some buyers who are unaware of real estate rules and regulations could be easily persuaded into waiving the right on the pretext that that would secure the relevant property for them from other potential buyers and would reduce red tape surrounding the contract of sale. They could get that advice from not-so-helpful solicitors. So even though they are independent--all of those matters that the minister talked about--this will result in the sellers pressuring buyers to waive the cooling-off period in order to ensure a speedy sale.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081053"></A>
There is nothing in the legislation to protect consumers from pressure resulting from new section 369B. New section 369B allows the cooling-off period to be shortened. As I have just said in relation to section 369A, I am concerned that unwary buyers will be tricked, forced or pressured into shortening the cooling-off period. As we know, the cooling-off period is an essential part of consumer protection. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081055"></A>
This protection has been in place since 2000. The government is now giving the option for the cooling-off period to be waived. Does this mean that there will be a risk of consumers being taken advantage of and being pressured into giving up this important right? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1081056"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No, it will not involve a purchaser putting himself or herself at risk. In fact, it is a requirement of anyone who is waiving the cooling-off period to get a certificate from a solicitor and that certificate must specify that the solicitor has explained the implications of waiving that cooling-off period. In fact, it can work both ways in the sense that you still have to get a certificate from a solicitor but, maybe in a situation where you might be able to negotiate a better deal, a purchaser can offer to the vendor to waive a certain part or all of that cooling-off period. Nevertheless, even in those circumstances that person still must have a certificate from a solicitor saying that he or she has obtained independent advice and that the implications of the waiving of the cooling-off period have been explained to the purchaser. </Hansard-Body>

Mr STEVENS</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (7.39 pm): Another example is the removal of the provision requiring motor dealers to satisfy the chief executive that the use of the place of business is authorised under the Sustainable Planning Act 2009 for the licence to operate. There are many more provisions that remove requirements in favour of licensed sellers. It cannot possibly be an increase in consumer protection to not make them prove that they are vending from a licensed Sustainable Planning Act premise. Is the change due to potential costs and is this damaging the protection in relation to excluding that planning? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085281"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No, there is no consumer protection issue involved in the point that the member makes. The requirement to provide proof of their business premises being authorised under the Sustainable Planning Act applies only to motor dealer applicants and to motor dealers who change or require business premises. The requirement is usually satisfied by the applicant motor dealer providing some evidence from a local authority that the business premises comply with the local authority’s planning by-laws. However, the requirement for motor dealer applicants to satisfy this requirement is incompatible with the eligibility requirements for any other type of licensed category under PAMDA. That is the only one that was required. It was considered not to be logical just for that one to require that provision. The current provision addresses the use of premises for motor-dealing purposes. More appropriately they are left to the local authority. As the member would be well aware, the local authority polices those sorts of issues. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(7.42 pm): I refer to part 4, ‘Other amendments’. I draw the minister’s attention to the many amendments that remove various requirements for those licensed under this act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085288"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I believe that the member is referring to clauses in the schedule, not in the actual bill itself. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085289"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The other ones were in the bill. This clause relates to part 4, ‘Other amendments’, which I think is clause 24. Basically, clause 1 of the schedule removes the requirement for those applying for an agent’s licence to provide photographs with their application. This is one example of the removal of the accountability for licensed agents and motor dealers. What is the reason for not requiring a photo in an application for a real estate licence? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085290"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am advised that there are around 38,000 of these licensees and it is a massive requirement and a massive use of resources. We require all applicants for licences for resident letting agents, real estate agents, property developers, pastoral houses, motor dealers, auctioneers and commercial agents to supply two recent certified photographs of themselves for the production of a photo licence. Current licensing infrastructure does not readily allow the department to utilise these photographs without incurring substantial additional cost with little apparent benefit to the industries or to consumers in having these occupations have a photo licence as well as a paper based licence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085291"></A>
There are currently in excess of 46,000 licence and certificate holders under PAMDA. The amendment intends to repeal the requirement for applicants to supply photographs except for commercial agents, otherwise known as debt collectors or process servers, and their subagent employees. Because there is a very small volume of applicants for commercial agent licences or subagent licences or registration, these can be processed manually at very little cost. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

As I said, there are 46,000 of the other licences. It is important for commercial agents and subagents to properly identify themselves to debtors because they are repossessing goods, serving process and so on, and that is where the identification is important and required. A photo licence in this case is an appropriate means of satisfying the debtor that the person is a licensed or registered individual. It is not considered necessary for those other 46,000 licence holders. It is basically doing away with another level of red tape. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(7.46 pm): The bill before the House is called the Geothermal Energy Bill 2010. The bill takes its title from the introduction of a new legislative regime to administer large scale geothermal energy exploration and production projects in Queensland. The bill, however, will also introduce a new land access framework that will change the way resource explorers and producers will engage with landholders in this state. Hopefully that part of the bill will provide a more ordered and settled framework for access to agricultural land by the resources industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085311"></A>
The release of the bill and these provisions dealing with land access follows the release of the Land Access Policy Framework in December 2009. The announcement of the proposed framework followed on from the Land Access Strategy released by the government in 2008. These particular provisions of the bill relating to land access have been a long time coming. Many would argue that they are long overdue. That part of the bill that addresses the land access provisions is the part of the bill that has probably been the subject of most public discussion as these provisions extend across the spectrum of the resources legislation so I will consider that part of the bill first in my contribution tonight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085312"></A>
The land access issue has always been a difficult one for farmers and graziers, with many rural landholders seeing the arrival of a mining company seeking access to their land as an assault on their private property rights. I fully understand the importance of private property rights and I know too well the extent to which property rights have been ignored by 12 years of state Labor government legislation. The vegetation management legislation will always be remembered as the ultimate assault on private property rights. It will always be remembered by the rural landholding community as an example of legislation that completely ignored private property rights. The bitterness that that piece of legislation created when it was first introduced in 1999 and through all of its subsequent changes remains very raw amongst the landholding community across Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085348"></A>
I have twice introduced a private member’s bill into this parliament to protect and reinforce private property rights. So I have considered the land access provisions of this bill before the House tonight from the perspective of that very strong philosophical commitment that I have to the security of private property rights. However, it would be absurd to argue that only farmers and graziers have property rights. Anyone who holds a title of ownership has the right to expect that that title of ownership will mean something, that that title will be secure. While each particular title may convey different rights to its holder, it is the security of those rights that is important if our system of legal ownership is to have any integrity. It is important to recognise that any attack on property rights is an attack on everyone who owns anything because if property rights are lessened, then the value of the property is lessened as is the security of the ownership, and the rights that that ownership involve are eroded away. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085351"></A>
It is therefore, I believe, in every property owner’s interest to recognise the property rights of others to protect the value of their own properties. That is a very important philosophical concept that both landholders and mining companies should consider in the current debate about the land access provisions that are included in this bill before the House tonight. If we are to insist, as I do and I have always done, on the recognition and protection of property rights for agricultural landholders, then we need also to recognise that holders of mining titles also have rights under the titles that they hold. In the situations that the land access provisions of this bill seek to address there could quite well be a number of different title holders exercising rights conferred by their titles over the same area of land. Theoretically at least, the situation could involve an agricultural land title owner, a holder of a title under the petroleum and gas act, a holder of a separate title under the Mineral Resources Act and a holder of a separate title again under this Geothermal Energy Bill all having rights over the same piece of land. Thankfully, while that situation is theoretically possible, it would certainly not be common. However, the more common situation involves the overlay of the agricultural land title by a petroleum and gas act title and/or a Mineral Resources Act title.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085359"></A>
Many of my constituents face this very situation. Many of my constituents, who are freehold landowners, find this situation very difficult to manage, especially when they are confronted with it for the first time. For those freehold landowners dealing with the situation where the owner of a resources title wants to exercise the rights pertaining to that title, that involves confronting the reality that they, as freehold landowners, do not have the right of total exclusive possession. In my experience over 12 years as a local member in an area of considerable resource development, given that I represent the southern end of the Bowen Basin, I believe that it is the loss of that exclusive possession which is at the heart of most of the resistance to resource projects by my constituents who are landholders. The frustration and fear that the loss of that exclusive possession causes gives rise to a range of other arguments about the environment, about food security and about social issues. However, the bottom line is that many farmers and graziers have a huge difficulty accepting the loss of exclusive possession. They have a huge difficulty accepting the idea that someone else has rights and access to the land that they believe as landowners they own. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085368"></A>
I grew up on a family property. I own and I have developed a property of my own over a period of almost 20 years. I understand full well the bonds between landholders and the properties. The farming property is more than an economic asset; it is more than a place of business. It is a family home; it is a source of pride; it is a refuge and a sanctuary for independent people. The farm is a public representation of what the individual and family are and it represents what they have achieved over a long period. Their farm embodies a physical expression of their philosophies as farmers and businesspeople. It is a measure of their value as stewards of the land and it is a display of their self-worth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085373"></A>
However, we as landholders cannot deny or avoid the reality of land ownership laws. It is a reality that under our system of land ownership, while landowners have a range of rights associated with their land title that allow them to use and enjoy the benefits of the land, the minerals have always been a state resource separate from the land and have always belonged to the state rather than the individual landowner. The state has always issued titles to explore for and extract those resources to operators who have been obligated to pay royalties to the state for the right to extract those resources, and those royalties have always been to the benefit of all Queenslanders. While there have been some variations over time in what is defined as a state owned resource, the basic concept of the extractable resources belonging to everyone rather than belonging to the individual landholder has a very long history in our system of law. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085379"></A>
In Australia, land has been granted under freehold or leasehold title initially and primarily for agricultural and pastoral purposes, and that title conferred the exclusive right to use the land for agricultural or pastoral purposes to the landholder. The security of those land titles has been an important factor in the development of our world-class primary industries that contribute so much to our state economy. That security of title is vital for the investment and for the protection of our land asset. In the same way, mining titles have been granted to explore for and extract resources and the mining industry, too, has become a hugely important part of regional Queensland and our state and country as a whole. The security of mining titles is equally important for investment to take place and for the resources to be managed properly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085382"></A>
Agricultural land titles have never granted exclusive possession or negated the existence of other titles such as those granted under any of the resources legislation referred to in the bill tonight. So there has always been a necessity for co-existence of title holders, each with a particular set of rights over the same piece of land. In the main, that co-existence between agricultural landholders and the resource title holders involved the farmer or grazier conducting their agricultural business on the land and the mining company gaining access to the land through a prescribed process to conduct exploration activities either looking for or determining the extent of the available mineral resources. Usually, if the resource proved large enough to extract commercially, a mine would be developed. To allow that to happen, the agricultural landholder either sold out or was compensated for the property and moved away. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085384"></A>
However, in Queensland history there have been some smaller examples of long-term co-existence. Smaller scale miners have co-existed with agricultural landholders on larger properties in the state’s north and in the west, and the oil and gas industry around Roma has always co-existed with landholders over an extended period. However, the coal seam gas industry has brought this issue of land access and land access protocols into a sharper focus for two reasons. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085387"></A>
Firstly, by its nature, coal seam gas requires a very long-term co-existence with a large number of landholders over a period of at least 20 to 30 years because the extraction wells are spread over a large geographic area and the effective well life and the extraction times for the gas are long. Secondly, the coal seam gas industry is accessing a resource in an area that is much more closely settled and where agricultural landholdings are much smaller and there is a much greater personal connection between the landholders and their properties. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085391"></A>
Mining companies in the main have no such attachment to the land. They understandably see a resource to be evaluated and extracted. While the social and environmental standards of the industry have profoundly improved over the years, it is still understandably for them a business involving extracting the resource at a minimum cost. For many rural landholders, the sudden appearance of a resources company seeking access to their land and the confronting reality that they do not have and never have had that right of exclusive possession to their properties is a very difficult thing to accept and we have seen the expression of the frustration that that causes in Queensland in recent times. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085393"></A>
The situation is not helped by the attitude of some mining companies who either do not understand or are insensitive to the reactions of landholders to their arrival on their properties. There can be no doubt that, under our current body of law, both parties have their rights and both parties have their responsibilities. The provisions in this bill seek to define those rights even further and to make those responsibilities even clearer.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1085395"></A>
The catalyst for the changes in this bill may well have been the rapid expansion of the coal seam gas industry. It is an industry which has enormous potential to provide jobs and economic growth across a large area of central and south-west Queensland where communities have struggled for decades. Hopefully, the provisions in the bill tonight will increase the opportunities for the long-term co-existence that is necessary between the coal seam gas industry and rural landholders to achieve that mutually beneficial existence and assist that economic potential to be realised. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089974"></A>
It certainly has been a mutually beneficial relationship in some areas in my electorate where the industry has now been operational for some seven or eight years. Around Taroom and Wandoan and west to Injune, landowners who are my constituents have, in the main, come to grips with the changes that the industry has brought and have successfully negotiated beneficial outcomes for their properties. As is human nature, some landholders and some resource companies deal with the situation very differently to others. In the best of the situations that I am aware of as the local member, landholders have been able to negotiate outcomes that make their agricultural businesses stronger. They have been able to do that through accessing regular financial payments that are not dependent on the season or the cattle market, and that money has helped to insulate their businesses from the vagaries of those notoriously variable elements. Many landholders have also negotiated other outcomes with coal seam gas companies that have improved their properties through better road infrastructure or by gaining access to extra water supplies. To date, these good outcomes have been dependent on landholders and companies respecting each other and negotiating in good faith. They have also been achieved in an area where the properties are bigger and the impact of losing that sense of exclusive possession is somewhat easier to manage and deal with. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089979"></A>
However, those good outcomes have certainly not been universal and a formal process to deal with land access issues is certainly overdue. I believe that that formal process, which this legislation will introduce, sets out to take the best practice behaviour that has been developed in the most successful situations by both sides and make that behaviour mandatory for all industry participants via the code of conduct that the bill will invoke. It should mean that there is a greater chance of achieving a respectful relationship between farmers and graziers and the coal seam gas companies that can result in a mutually beneficial co-existence. I strongly believe that there should be no losers and there should be no victims in that relationship. Landholders especially should never accept the role of victims.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089980"></A>
It distresses me that there are always those who want to portray rural landholders as victims. Farmers and graziers are not victims in this whole process, either as it stands now or, more pointedly, as the process will stand after the passage of this bill. I would never accept any situation that made farmers and graziers victims or left them worse off in the long term. After close examination, I believe that the process outlined in this bill certainly does not allow that to happen. The freehold title that those farmers and graziers hold is indisputably the superior title and the provisions in this bill, along with all the other legislation already enacted, gives them and their properties an array of protections. Most notably, the recognition of their freehold title as the superior title in all of this legislation gives them the opportunity to negotiate favourable outcomes for themselves and their properties before access is granted to resource title holders. That is a very important change that is being introduced in the bill before the House tonight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089981"></A>
Since the early 1990s, beginning with the previous coalition government and continuing through the revisions of the Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act and the Mineral Resources Act, there have been a series of new pieces of legislation that have strengthened and protected those landholders’ rights and this piece of legislation continues that trend. Over that period, this parliament has given landholders and the resources industry the legislative tools they need to build the mutually beneficial co-existence that is so important to the whole state. Unfortunately, this relationship is too often dominated by rumour and myth, rather than fact. Unfortunately, there is often a disconnect between the legislation that passes through this parliament and the reality of the activities in the field in places that can be somewhat remote. Unfortunately, some bad experiences in the past are recounted much more often and are much more widely known than the legislative changes that have happened over the years or the provisions of the bill that the parliament considers tonight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089984"></A>
The extension of the resources industry into the more closely settled areas of the Darling Downs, combined with a couple of very badly handled situations, overlaid by a federal election campaign have created an almost perfect situation for a scare campaign in the last couple of months. Political opportunists, such as the Greens and the so-called Friends of the Earth, have been quick to exploit the situation for their own political ends. Their aims have been to try to garner Senate votes for the federal election campaign or to advance their efforts to rid the world of new fossil fuel production projects, and they have been keen to take advantage of people who are concerned, and even fearful in some cases, about what is happening with the rapid expansion of the resources industry in their districts. Those political opportunists have no real long-term interest in regional Queensland or the people who live there. They are simply taking advantage of a situation and the people who are caught up in it. I despise their efforts, because I and other members on this side of the House have represented those people and those communities for many, many years and we will represent and protect their interests for many, many years to come. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089986"></A>
The current state Labor government has been slow to fulfil its role in ensuring that landholders and communities can have confidence in the legislation and the administration of the industry. No matter how good the legislation is, it will never fulfil its purpose without appropriate communication and education for stakeholders and without appropriate monitoring and supervision of on-ground activities. In my view, the state government has a very clear role to ensure accurate information is available to stakeholders about what the legislation and regulations require and to ensure that the general community can have confidence that that legislation is administered and supervised appropriately. In both of those functions, the current state Labor government has failed because it has been torturously slow to act. It has been behind the game all the way. It has failed completely to realise that administering the industry in a closely settled area like the Darling Downs is markedly different from administering the industry in the Cooper Basin or in Central Queensland or in the north-west minerals province. However, the government is beginning to make some efforts, which it should have done quite some time ago. Finally it is getting some people on the ground or at least it is promising to do so, but I am concerned about the length of time it will take to recruit those officers and to get them in place, given the government is already playing catch up on a problem that has been causing concern for some time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089988"></A>
However, I am prepared to give credit where it is due. Last week I was sent the landholders’ information pack, prepared by the department for landholders confronted with the resources industry. I genuinely commend the minister and his department on the preparation of this document. The only problem with it is that it is long overdue. It is a collection of information that should put landholders in a position to adequately negotiate an outcome for themselves. I commend it to members in the House who deal, as I do, with these constituent issues on a regular basis. The document contains things such as the petroleum gas laws and a guide for landholders. It explains the role of the coordinator-general. It explains the adaptive environmental management regime for the coal seam gas industry. I have tried to explain that regime to constituents over and over again. The information that is provided presents that adaptive management regime in a simple and understandable form. The document deals with such things as the approval process. It deals with the contentious issues of coal seam gas water, fracking and flaring, and all the things that cause concern for landholders. It is an information resource that should have been available to landholders much sooner, but I commend the minister and the department for making it available in the way they have. It is a valuable resource and I believe it should assist in avoiding some of the unfortunate problems that we have seen in recent times. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1089991"></A>
I turn now to the detail of the changes proposed for the land access regime. This bill contains some significant changes to a revised land access and land compensation regime in respect of private land. It is to be introduced into all resources legislation in Queensland. In respect of the land access regime, not only will the provisions of the bill apply to the geothermal titles but the bill will also amend the Mineral Resources Act 1989, the Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2009, the Petroleum Act 1923 and the Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004. It will apply the new land access provisions to all resource industry titles across the state and there are transition provisions as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094336"></A>
This will bring a welcome degree of uniformity--uniformity that has been missing to date and the lack of which has, in my view, been the cause of a regrettable degree of misunderstanding and friction between landholders and resources companies. The amendments will affect all authorities and titles under the existing resources legislation relating to land access and compensation, and the changes to each piece of legislation will come into force at the same time once this bill is passed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094340"></A>
The scope of the changes contained in the bill is certainly not inconsequential but would, I believe, represent a mandating of what the best people in the agricultural and resources industry have been doing for quite some time. For the good operators on both sides of the equation, this bill should not represent much change to the best practice example they have already set for themselves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094341"></A>
The bill proposes a land access code to be made by way of a regulation setting out a single land access code for all resource legislation in Queensland. This land access code will set out the best practice guidelines for communication between the holders of resource titles and the owners and occupiers of private land. It will impose on the resource title holders mandatory conditions concerning the conduct of authorised activities on private land being essentially land held under a freehold land title or other land within the state held under a statutory leasehold land title. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094342"></A>
There will be a statutory obligation imposed by this bill upon a resource title holder to comply with the provisions of the land access code and to ensure that any other person carrying out an authorised activity for the resource title holder also complies with those mandatory provisions of the code. If a condition of a licence under a resource title is inconsistent with a mandatory provision of the land access code introduced by this bill, then the bill requires that the mandatory provision will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. This will introduce a welcome level of consistency to a process which at the moment can be very confusing. It will introduce that consistency across situations covered by the same act and consistency across situations covered by different acts. That level of consistency would be welcome by both landholders and resource companies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094344"></A>
The bill also distinguishes between what are defined as preliminary activities and advanced activities being conducted or proposed to be conducted by resource companies. This is a welcome and sensible distinction, with different requirements imposed on the resource companies for each type of activity. It recognises the differing impacts each level of activity can have on landholders and will ensure the process for minor activities is not unnecessarily cumbersome. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094346"></A>
The bill defines a preliminary activity as an authorised resource activity that will have no impact or only a minor impact on the business activities of any owner or occupier of the land on which the activity is to be carried out. Examples given are walking the area of the permit; driving along an existing road or track on the land; taking soil or water samples from the land; drilling without constructing earthworks; geophysical surveying without physical clearing; aerial, electrical or environmental surveying; seismic surveying without using explosives; and survey pegging--all activities which require land access but would not be expected to result in significant impacts on the landowner’s business. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094347"></A>
However, there is a very sensible recognition in the bill that such activities, although minor, can have a much greater impact on smaller landholdings than on larger landholdings. Under the terms of the bill, these minor activities cannot be classed as preliminary activities if they are carried out on land that is less than 100 hectares in size. This provision sensibly recognises that the potential impact of any such activity is considerably greater on these smaller blocks of land and their owners. The minor activities cannot be classified as preliminary activities if the land is being used for intensive farming or broadacre agriculture such as irrigated cropping, plantation forestry or horticulture; for dairy, cattle or sheep feedlot; for a piggery or a poultry farm. Likewise, an authorised activity carried out within 600 metres of a school or an occupied residence or an activity that affects the lawful carrying out of organic or bio-organic farming systems cannot under the provisions of the bill be considered to be a preliminary activity. All of these situations would be classified as advanced resource activities under the terms of this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094351"></A>
The bill defines a range of other more complex and disruptive activities as advanced resource activities and regulates the issues surrounding land access to conduct such activities. Examples of advanced activities given in the bill include such things as levelling of drilling pads and digging sumps, earthworks associated with pipeline installation, vegetation clearing, constructing an exploration camp, geophysical surveying with physical clearing, carrying out a seismic survey using explosives, constructing a track or access road, or changing a fence line. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094352"></A>
Under the law as it will exist with the passage of this bill, a resources company cannot enter private land to carry out a preliminary activity unless at least 10 business days prior written notice of entry has been given to each owner and occupier of the land. The entry period can be no longer than six months irrespective of the type of authority, although a longer period may be agreed to by the relevant owner or occupier of the land in writing. Where it is the first entry notice given to the particular owner or occupier, there must be included with the notice a copy of the land access code, any code of practice made under the relevant resource legislation applying to the authorised activities and a copy of the relevant environmental authority documentation for the proposed activities. The bill also requires that a copy of the entry notice must be given to the chief executive of Queensland Mines and Energy or, for exploration permits and mineral development licences, the mining registrar. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094354"></A>
The bill also deals extensively with the provisions surrounding compensation for landholders for the impacts of those resource activities on their land. The issue of compensation is the one that I believe is most surrounded by myth and rumour and where, in my experience, there has been the most misinformation. For some landholders, no compensation is enough for them to readily accept the presence of resource industry operations on their land. They just want someone to make them go away. For some resource companies, compensation is a begrudging burden and, while they will readily invest heavily in machinery, vehicles and staff, those resource companies quibble over relatively minor amounts when it comes to compensating landholders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094358"></A>
The compensation issue is difficult because the impacts of the same physical presence and the same infrastructure can be so different for each individual and each property. Issues such as the loss of the exclusive possession of the property can be not a big concern for some landholders and almost impossible to accept for others. Physical infrastructure such as wells and pipelines can have a major impact in some areas of a property and very little impact in others. Some resources companies will readily cooperate and relocate infrastructure to suit the landholders, while others just take a more arrogant attitude and say, ‘That’s where it has to go.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094361"></A>
If it were not clear in the previous legislation, this bill makes it clear now--and I think some of the proposed amendments that I have seen circulated that the minister intends to move in committee will make it even clearer--that landholders are entitled to compensation for every impact of the resources development on their property, and that is the way it should unquestionably be. No-one can make it go away, as some landholders want. And those who try to tell landholders that they can make it go away are doing them a disservice. What we can do in this parliament and what we have a responsibility to do is to ensure that the legislation and the regulation is right and fair and provides the protection that is fair and reasonable for landholders and ensures that the resources title holders can exercise their rights as well. I believe that this bill achieves that goal and fulfils our responsibility as legislators. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Under the terms of this bill, each owner and occupier of land will have a statutory right to be compensated for all the compensatable effects of the activities of the resources companies on their land. These compensatable effects are to be uniformly defined for all resource authorities and all resource legislation and include: the deprivation of possession of the surface of the land; the diminution of land value; the diminution of use of land and improvements; any severance of the land; and any cost or loss incurred from the conduct of the resource operations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1094367"></A>
An amendment that has been circulated that the minister intends to move later removes any doubt that such things as professional costs for accountants and solicitors, the time of the landholders themselves in dealing with resource companies and consequential impacts are all compensatable costs. Landholders need to be aware of the extent of their rights to compensation. That is the way it should be. Landholders should be properly compensated because the cost of compensating landholders for the effects on their business is only ever going to be a small percentage of the capital costs of these resource projects. Resource companies should not quibble unnecessarily about the value of that compensation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098790"></A>
This bill also makes it clear that the resource company cannot enter private land to carry out an advanced activity unless each relevant owner and occupier has agreed to an appropriate conduct and compensation agreement or unless each owner and occupier for the land has signed a deferral agreement to defer the negotiation of such a conduct and compensation agreement. The only exception provided in the bill is where each owner and occupier of the land is an applicant or a respondent to an application made to the Land Court to determine compensation or where entry is to preserve life or property or because of an emergency that exists or may exist. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098793"></A>
The bill also mandates statutory requirements for what a conduct and compensation agreement must contain to ensure that such agreements have credibility and that they serve the purpose proposed for them in the legislation. A conduct and compensation agreement under the terms of the bill cannot be inconsistent with the relevant resource legislation, nor can it be inconsistent with any condition of the resource title or any mandatory provision of the land access code introduced by the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098794"></A>
As I indicated at the beginning of this contribution, I come to the consideration of this issue with a very strong philosophical commitment to the concept of private property rights. I will strongly defend anyone’s right to compensation if their property rights are impinged or lessened or affected by public projects or by resource industry projects. So I would consider myself to be a very hard judge of what is a fair compensation process for situations where those private property rights are inevitably adversely affected. I believe that the system should err on the side of the property owner who through no choice or action of their own ends up in a situation where their property rights are lessened or affected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098795"></A>
After considering the proposals in this bill from that philosophical viewpoint, I am left with the conclusion that there is not much else that I can see that could be done to make the compensation system fairer. The only possible issue I can see is the provision that allows land access while a matter is being referred to the Land Court. It is hard to argue that this provision should not be there given that it is possible to foresee a scenario where, without it, the court process could be used to unnecessarily delay a resolution of the access issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098796"></A>
Equally, it could be envisaged that in the extreme the provision could be used to get access without a realistic attempt to arrive at a fair settlement. I would hope that the court itself would serve as a brake on the misuse of this provision by taking a very dim view of situations that were referred for adjudication as a means of frustrating the process set out in the legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098797"></A>
A statutory process for negotiating a conduct and compensation agreement is part of the new regime introduced by the bill and that process must be followed before the matter can be referred to the Land Court. Unless the process has been followed, a resource titleholder cannot apply to the Land Court to have compensation determined and that process, if it is entered into in good faith by both parties, should in all but the most difficult cases, in my view, provide the desired outcome without any need for court hearings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098798"></A>
The resource titleholder may begin the process by giving the relevant owners and occupiers of the land a negotiation notice stating that the titleholder wishes to negotiate a conduct and compensation agreement or a deferral agreement as a preliminarily step to gaining access to the landholder’s land. The initial notice must be accompanied by a copy of the land access code to be established by this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098800"></A>
The bill makes it very clear that it must state all of the following. It must state if the holder wishes to negotiate a conduct and compensation agreement and whether it is in respect of all or part of the compensation liability and all or part of the property. It also must state if the holder wishes to negotiate a deferral agreement and the reasons a deferral agreement may be the best option in the particular circumstance. It must state a full description of the activities proposed to be carried out on the land that may produce compensatable effects. The notice must state where and when the activities are proposed to be carried out and the contact details for the resource titleholder. A copy of the negotiation notice must also, under the terms of the bill, be given to the chief executive or the mining registrar, whichever is applicable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098801"></A>
After the negotiation notice has been given, the bill requires the resource titleholder and the landholder to use all reasonable endeavours to negotiate a conduct and compensation agreement or a deferral agreement. These negotiations must be for a period of at least 20 business days starting from the giving of the negotiation notice so no-one can be rushed into something they did not understand. The bill requires that if during the 20-business-day period a conduct and compensation or deferral agreement is entered into then the resource titleholder cannot enter the relevant land to carry out advanced activities until the minimum negotiation period of 20 business days ends, irrespective of when the relevant agreement is entered into. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098803"></A>
Further, the bill requires that if during, but before the expiration of, the 20-business-day minimum negotiating period a compensation agreement or a deferral agreement has been entered into then either party may during the balance of the 20-business-day period terminate agreement by notice to the other party. So not only is there a defined minimum period for negotiation; the balance of the defined minimum becomes a cooling-off period if agreement is reached earlier. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098805"></A>
There is also a mandated mediation process set down by the bill. The bill requires that if at the end of the minimum negotiation period of 20 business days the landholder and the resource company have not entered into a conduct and compensation agreement then either party may ask an authorised officer of the Queensland mines and energy department to call a mediation meeting. In addition, under the terms of the bill an authorised officer may request the resource titleholder and the eligible claimants to attend mediation if a landholder or occupier gives notice stating concerns about the way in which a resource activity is being carried out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098808"></A>
Equally, the bill allows for a mediation meeting to be called by the resource titleholder if the holder gives a notice stating concerns about the activity of a landholder or an occupier. The bill also sets out that a mediation meeting can also be called by the department itself if for any reason an authorised officer of the department has concerns about the relationship existing between the resource titleholder and the owner or occupier of the land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098810"></A>
The bill ensures that nothing said at a mediation meeting is admissible in future court proceedings without the person’s consent. The department’s authorised officer must, under the terms of the bill, take all reasonable steps to ensure the mediation is finished within 20 business days after it was requested. The bill also determines that if a landholder or the resources company after being given notice of the mediation does not attend, the mediation is taken to have been conducted for the purpose of the party which did attend being able to apply to the Land Court to determine the compensation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098812"></A>
It also determines that if mediation has not been finished within 20 business days after the authorised officer receives a request for mediation or there is no conduct and compensation agreement between the parties entered into within 20 business days after the mediation was called then any party which attended the mediation may apply to the Land Court for it to decide the resource authority holder’s compensation liability. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098813"></A>
In addition, the bill allows that an application can be made to the Land Court to review compensation already agreed if there is a subsequent material change in circumstances. I believe that that is a very important provision because I think there were agreements made in the early days of the industry when both sides did not fully appreciate the extent of the compensatable impacts on particular properties. I am very pleased to see that provision in the bill which allows for an application to be made to review compensation given a subsequent material change in circumstances. So like the compensation provisions, the mediation provisions set down by the bill are very detailed indeed. They should assist to achieve outcomes for both landholders and resource companies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098815"></A>
The bill also contains transitional provisions, that I referred to earlier, for situations where agreements have already been negotiated and those agreements need to be brought under the statutory provisions provided by this bill. It determines that where parties have entered into a compensation agreement which is still in force immediately before the commencement of the amendments introduced by the Geothermal Energy Bill 2010, the bill we are considering tonight, then on the commencement of those amendments any such existing voluntary agreement becomes a conduct and compensation agreement for the purpose of the amendments. It also sets out that any entry notices given prior to the date of commencement of the amendments continue according to their terms to be valid for the carrying out of the activity notified, even though the notice does not comply with all of the entry notice requirements introduced by the amendments in the bill tonight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098816"></A>
To summarise, the land access provisions contained in this bill set out a detailed process which has been worked out by the parties themselves and it is undoubtedly thorough. We will support its passage into law and continue to monitor its implementation to ensure that it produces the reasonable outcomes both the agricultural and resources industries need to continue to provide the great economic base for our regional communities and for our state as a whole. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1098845"></A>
I now turn to the main body of the bill which, as its name suggests, deals with the regulation of geothermal energy. As stated in the explanatory notes that help to define what the main body of the bill is about--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1098849"></A>
Geothermal energy is heat energy derived from the Earth’s natural (subsurface) heat. It occurs in various forms, including hot geothermal water (‘wet’ geothermal energy) or as hot dry rocks. This energy can be used in a variety of applications, including heat pumps, industrial applications and electricity generation. Importantly, geothermal energy has the potential to produce virtually carbon dioxide ... emission-free power.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098850"></A>
Currently, geothermal exploration in Queensland is administered by the Geothermal Exploration Act 2004 which was designed as an interim legislative regime to enable the commencement of geothermal exploration. This bill proposes a more comprehensive regime to administer both exploration and production of geothermal energy into the future as the production of geothermal energy hopefully expands in our state. It also introduces a regulatory framework in which proponents can operate and provides for issues regarding competition with other resource industry title holders or overlapping titles with other resource industry legislation to be addressed adequately.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098853"></A>
Overlapping tenures have already caused difficulty in relations between coal seam gas proponents who hold title and operate under the petroleum and gas act and underground coal gasification operators who hold title and operate under the Mineral Resources Act. It is not hard to imagine that the potential overlay of another title under another regime created by this bill could add an extra degree of complexity to what is already a complex situation. The tenure regime introduced for geothermal energy by this bill roughly follows the regime under the Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004 providing for geothermal exploration permits, geothermal production leases and geothermal data acquisition authorities. Only large scale geothermal exploration and production will be regulated under the bill before the House, with the threshold for large scale production to be specified in a separate regulation. The bill notes that the matters to be considered in determining large scale production may include temperature, flow rates and the amount of energy produced.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098860"></A>
The extraction of ground source geothermal energy by using geothermal heat pumps to heat and cool buildings will be regulated by the Plumbing and Drainage Act 2002, pursuant to anticipated amendments to be made to that act. All other geothermal production that does not meet the threshold criteria will be regulated under this bill only if it triggers existing legislation such as the Sustainable Planning Act 2009 or the Water Act 2000. Geothermal exploration activities carried out with the intention of producing large scale use of geothermal energy will require under the terms of the bill a geothermal exploration permit. Geothermal exploration is defined in the bill as--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1098865"></A>
(a) 	exploring for and quantifying geothermal resources; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1098866"></A>
(b) 	carrying out investigations and other activities associated with exploring for, or quantifying, geothermal resources.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1098868"></A>
Large scale geothermal production activities will require a geothermal production lease. Geothermal production is defined as--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1098870"></A>
... the recovery of geothermal energy--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1098871"></A>
(a) 	on or from beneath the surface of the land in which it is contained, other than production testing; or</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1098872"></A>
(b) 	from a place at which geothermal energy naturally appears at the surface of the land.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1098873"></A>
Data acquisition authorities will also be available under the terms of the bill to allow the collection of data from land contiguous to an existing tenure.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098874"></A>
The bill deals with the issue of overlapping tenure. It generally follows the overlapping tenure regime provided for in the petroleum and gas act, restricting certain activities and providing a process for determining priorities for competing tenures. The bill provides the mechanisms to allow holders of overlapping tenures to make agreements for a structured approach to the timing of activities and the sharing of infrastructure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098876"></A>
Further to this coordination approach, and for situations where it may not necessarily be appropriate, protections are provided in the bill for competing tenure holders. The bill provides that if a geothermal exploration permit covers the same land as a non-geothermal exploration authority then authorised activity for the geothermal permit must not be carried out if the activity will adversely affect the carrying out of the activities under other resource legislation where that activity has already commenced. It also ensures that the application for a geothermal production lease that overlaps with any area of any competing tenure must include a statement assessing the likely effect of the proposed geothermal activities on the future use of the resources under the competing authority, as well as the technical and commercial feasibility of coordinating those activities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098877"></A>
Under the terms of the bill, the applicant must provide the overlapping tenure holder with a copy of the application and the overlapping permit holder then has the opportunity to make submissions in respect of the application. The bill provides for the minister to make a resource management decision on the priority of the tenure holders, and if coordination is unlikely or such an arrangement is not technically or commercially feasible the minister may give priority to one of the competing resources. It is important that the overlapping tenure issue be dealt with in some detail, as it is, and it is appropriate that the minister has to make the decision in the end.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098878"></A>
Given the number of resource titles that have been issued and will be issued in Queensland, the likelihood of overlapping tenure issues emerging is very high indeed. I think it is a widespread hope that geothermal energy will, some time in the future, be a major contributor to the state’s energy grid and the legislation as it is contained in the bill before the House tonight should allow the development of that industry to proceed. The bill also clarifies the situation relating to overlapping tenures for coal seam gas titles issued under the petroleum and gas act and the underground coal gasification titles issued under the Mineral Resources Act.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098883"></A>
The bill also once again seeks to intervene in a long-running dispute between two coal companies--that is, Cherwell Creek and BMA in Central Queensland. This parliament passed a bill in 2008, the Mineral Resources (Peak Downs Mine) Amendment Bill 2008, to deal with this issue and it does not reflect well on the minister or his department to again be seeking a legislative solution to the same legal issue. However, as I did in 2008, I will not oppose this part of the bill, accepting somewhat reluctantly the need for another legislative solution to ensure that the Caval Ridge Mine is able to proceed and provide the economic benefits that have been long promised. The bill also makes some minor amendments to the Electricity Act 1994 in relation to the retailer of last resort provisions and repeals the Timber Utilisation and Marketing Act.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098891"></A>
As I said at the beginning of my contribution, we will be supporting the passage of the bill through the House tonight. It does address a couple of very important areas. The land access issue is overdue to be addressed, as I said, in some detail. I think this bill does address it appropriately. Certainly, we hope that the geothermal energy provisions that the bill puts in place will lay the basis for the development of a geothermal energy industry in Queensland.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr HOPPER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Condamine--LNP) (8.37 pm): I want to congratulate the shadow minister for his in-depth contribution crossing every part of this legislation. This bill introduces a new legislative regime to govern large scale geothermal energy exploration and production projects in Queensland. The bill also introduces a new land access framework, which has been long awaited, that will modify the process of resource company and primary producer engagement in Queensland and is expected to provide a more uniform and strengthened framework for access by the resource industry to agricultural land.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1098897"></A>
Tonight I will be speaking about several elements of this bill, including land access. The recent release of the Land Access Policy Framework was welcomed by the LNP. Land access is a critical part of all negotiations between resource companies and landholders and one that has become extremely contentious in many areas of my electorate. The former electorate of Darling Downs and the now electorate of Condamine will have a massive impact coming upon us in the very near future. Our landholders are going to be impacted very heavily, and we must get this right tonight. This government was disappointingly slow in actioning the framework.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOPPER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Madam Deputy Speaker, they did absolutely nothing. It was not until we had deputations come down here to meet with the minister that some action was put in place. This bill is the fruit of very hard work by the likes of the member for Warrego, the member for Callide and me. We put pressure on the government to represent our primary producers, which it should have done over the past few years. Finally, we have legislation that is a touch towards what it should be. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108021"></A>
This government was very slow in putting together this framework. In some cases, farmers were extremely vulnerable to the resource companies that want to access their land for exploration purposes. Some of our landholders have felt not only exploited but also violated. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1108023"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOPPER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, absolutely. Those people over there would not have the slightest clue. Land access remains a complex issue for many landholders. It is very difficult for landholders to accept that the land of which they have been the custodians for decades can suddenly be occupied by another entity. It is exactly the same situation as a person owning a home in Brisbane and then someone comes in and says, ‘I’m going to use that bedroom.’ That person says, ‘No, you can’t’, but then all of a sudden by law they can. That is simply unacceptable.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108024"></A>
Tonight, we see legislation to address some of these problems. I ask members to imagine themselves as a landholder whose land is suddenly occupied by another entity. This intrusion is disturbing for landholders, which is totally understandable. Rightly or wrongly, they feel that their property rights are being worn away. They feel that their property rights are being taken from them. </Hansard-Body>

 I withdraw. Not a problem. The bill addresses many of the land access concerns and seeks to reassure all landholders that their property rights are still intact. Many of my constituents are freehold landowners. It used to be that if you bought something you owned it. Many, many times we have heard Senator Barnaby Joyce say that if you take something without compensation it is theft. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOPPER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 How rude. I would like my speech to be heard. Those landholders find this situation of a resource company having the right to exercise a resource title difficult to comprehend. The recent landholders information packs that were prepared by the department are a positive step forward to opening up communication channels. We have farmers who have employed people full-time to fight this fight. We also have property owners who are faced with a mining company coming on to their property and they do not know a thing about it. So an up-to-date information pack has been prepared and landholders can access it. That is a good thing. It is not often I congratulate the government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108037"></A>
It is hard for resource company representatives to understand the attachment that primary producers have to their land. It is a long association that spans many generations. The families of many of my constituents have been settled on the Darling Downs for over 100 years. I am from one of those families. Those people are still producing food, foliage and fibre for the people of Queensland and Australia and they are exporting clean, green produce all over the world. These landholders conduct their business in a sustainable manner and find the intrusion of an industry, which has a life span of 20 to 30 years, unsustainable. The only reason Australia did not go into recession was agriculture. Our farmers have it together. They are producing the wealth of this nation and that is the only reason Australia did not go into recession. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108038"></A>
In my electorate, the rapid increase in the coal seam gas industry has caused a great deal of angst. Much of my electorate is covered by intensive farming systems involving the growing of highly valuable crops on irrigation farms. These farming systems do not lend themselves to land access for the exploration of resources. The highly invasive nature of the coal seam gas industry provides many challenges and intensive farming systems are not a desirable place for co-existence between the two industries. That is why we have put in place a policy to protect prime agricultural land. We will protect prime agricultural land and lock it up. I note that the government has copied our policy in a lot of ways. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108039"></A>
The bill introduces practical and significant changes with the revision of the land access and land compensation regimes. These changes are long overdue and will provide much needed security for landholders. The bill will amend the Mineral Resources Act 1989, the Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2009, the Petroleum Act 1923, and the Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004 to apply the new land access provisions to all resource industry titles across the state. As members can see, the bill is responsible for an enormous amount of legislative change, which is why it needs to be right. We must get this right. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108044"></A>
I welcome the uniformity that the bill will bring. To date, uniformity has been missing in action, which has probably contributed to some degree to the misunderstanding that has occurred between the resource representatives and the landholders. Once this bill is passed, all authorities and titles under the existing resources legislation relating to land access and compensation will be affected. The bill differentiates between preliminary activities, advanced activities and makes other welcome changes. This distinction for different requirements is a sensible change that will ensure that the process of miner activities is more streamlined. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108045"></A>
The provision of a minimum negotiation period is an appreciated change for landholders. These negotiations must be for a period of at least 20 business days, starting from the giving of the negotiation notice. The entry period is to be no longer than six months irrespective of the type of authority, except if a longer period can be agreed upon by all parties. That means that a negotiation must be put in place. We need to educate our property owners so that they know their rights--that things can only happen though negotiation and that they must agree to it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108046"></A>
The bill addresses the compensation issue and many landholders will embrace these long-awaited changes. Compensation has been and is a point of contention. Each landholder has their own opinion on what is an acceptable amount of compensation. As the shadow minister said before, in some areas no amount of compensation will suffice. Compensation for intensely farmed land is a different issue compared to grazing land. The impact of the resource activity on one farming system compared to another is very different. Farmers in my electorate are fighting for their interests full-time. Are they going to be paid an hourly rate for their time? Under the legislation, I seriously believe that they can charge the mining companies for the time and effort that they have put into protecting their interests, protecting their farming land and protecting their families. Many of the farmers in my electorate are fighting full-time the invasive initiatives that have been put upon them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112650"></A>
This changes the whole situation in relation to compensation. If we realise what we are up against here and what our rights really are, we can actually protect what we believe in. Under the terms of this bill each owner and occupier of the land will have a statutory right to be compensated for all compensatable effects of resource companies on their land. These compensatable effects are to be uniformly defined for all resource authorities. Some of these include the deprivation of possession of the surface of the land, the decrease of the land value, the decrease of the use of their land and the improvements, severance and any cost or loss incurred from the conduct of the resource operations. Compensatable costs include such things as professional costs for accountants and solicitors and also the time that I spoke about that the landholders themselves spend dealing with the resource companies, and the fuel they use. Landholders should be properly compensated for all their costs and losses incurred and this is very long overdue. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1112653"></A>
This bill proposes a more inclusive system to administer both exploration and production of geothermal energy into the future. Queensland is hoping to expand the production of geothermal energy and this bill introduces a regulatory framework. Overlapping tenures have caused difficulties between various resource companies competing for the same tenure. This bill addresses these overlapping titles. We have seen that west of Chinchilla where two different companies were overlapping and were fighting against each other. On many occasions it has been a big problem. Recently we have seen problems with one of the underground coal gasification projects at Kingaroy. This should alert all of us and cause us to look long and hard at the long-term effects of these relatively new industries.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112654"></A>
Only 15 years ago we were talking about importing gas from New Guinea. We did not realise the resource we had. Now the resource is being developed to such an extent that we do not have the technology to deal with it. We need to take a serious look at the problems we are facing. We need to make sure that our precious underground water supplies are safe from contamination. There are 22 towns in the Western Downs shire that rely on underground water. If we allow an industry to go ahead that affects that water, what will we say to future generations when there is no underground water? It is vital that it is scientifically proven that the process of underground coal gasification and coal seam gas extraction can occur without interference to the quality or quantity of our underground aquifers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112655"></A>
Any changes to legislation that enable closer, more vigilant monitoring of these industries is well received. This legislation tonight goes a step further. As the shadow minister said, we will support this legislation. The LNP has a five-point policy to protect prime agricultural land. I read that policy out in this House a few sittings ago. Our leader and the member for Surfers Paradise, John-Paul Langbroek, came out to Dalby and announced that policy. We are the only party that has said that we will protect our prime agricultural land. We are the only party that has had the nous to do it. I see the primary industries minister sitting across the chamber. We have not heard a word from him. We will protect our prime agricultural land and our farmers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112656"></A>
Included in this framework is a charter of property rights. If something is taken from someone they will be fully compensated. There will be a rural water advisory board that will protect prime agricultural land from all activities. We are not talking only about mining; we are also talking about development. We are going to lock that land up to produce food for the people of this nation. If our underground water aquifers are dewatered or contaminated, we can no longer produce food. We have to be very careful about that when we put legislation in place in this chamber. We are known world-wide for foliage and fibre. We produce clean green food in this nation. We beat every nation in the world with what we produce. It is our duty to protect our land and water. The LNP when in government will absolutely do so. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr JOHNSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gregory--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(8.54 pm): I have been in this place for a bit over 20 years and tonight I heard one of the best researched speeches I have heard on any piece of legislation come from the shadow minister in relation to the Geothermal Energy Bill. I congratulate him on the amount of work that went into it. Every aspect of his contribution tonight canvassed precisely what this very sensitive piece of legislation is all about. It is sensitive in many ways. This industry is in its infancy. I believe that the legislation has many complexities and that we will see it come back here time and time again to be debated in this House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112659"></A>
We are pursuing new horizons with geothermal energy. It is certainly a new frontier in Australia, especially here in Queensland. The coal seam gas industry is another industry that is very fragile, with issues being raised on a daily basis in relation to the underground water table and prime agricultural land. I believe that as legislators we have to be responsible and understanding of the complexities of these two, I suppose one could say in tandem, aspects of new technology: geothermal and coal seam gas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112660"></A>
The first issue that I want to speak on tonight is the Geothermal Energy Bill 2010. This bill repeals the Geothermal Exploration Act 2004 which places limitations on geothermal exploration and production. The real issue is just how much people understand about this new technology and what it offers for Queensland and ultimately for Australia. I believe that it will be the energy source of the 21st century if we can harness it and develop it in a responsible, economical way. It will certainly meet the energy needs of much of our great state, especially some of the remote areas that I and other members of this House represent, in the area of the north-west minerals province and certainly in the Central Highlands region. Geothermal energy will make a significant contribution to looking after the environment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112661"></A>
This bill allows for geothermal exploration of large tracts of this state that hopefully will result in new energy benefits for Queensland. The bill will also regulate access to geothermal resources, provide security for exploration and, more importantly, security for landholders. There has always been controversy because there is a lot of misunderstanding by landholders as to what their rights are. This piece of legislation covers that issue. Not one of us is perfect, but this legislation goes a long way towards providing the security in question. This industry is in its infancy--in fact, it is probably in its embryonic stage--and certainly it has many complexities that are very real. Bearing in mind those complexities, I think that we have to have understanding from industry, landowners and the state as a whole as to how we manage the process on the way through.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117273"></A>
In the long term this very sensitive issue will be a contributing factor to providing energy at a cheaper rate than what we witness now. There is a solar energy system at Windorah in Western Queensland that provides for the energy needs of that little town. As technology improves and as time moves on, we will see a lot more of this type of technology provide for safer, cleaner and more efficient generation of power. It will provide our communities with a cleaner environment in which to live. Ultimately, that outcome will have long-term benefits for those communities and the people who live in them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117277"></A>
We are living in exciting times. I do not think any of us really knows what the future holds in terms of these new technologies and the developments in energy, whether it be coal seam gas, geothermal or whatever other type of energy. Geothermal energy is one source that we have to really embrace. We need to assist companies to make it a viable alternative to our current sources. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117278"></A>
The shadow minister, the honourable member for Callide, provided a very complex and detailed insight into this legislation this evening. As I said earlier, he has researched it very well and addressed every aspect of it. One aspect that he did touch on that I want to talk about also is land access and compensation. They are important factors in this legislation. Still to this day in my own electorate of Gregory and the area around Emerald, north of Emerald and south of Emerald there is prime agricultural land going back down to the Arcadia Valley adjacent to the electorate of the honourable member for Callide. As we know, they do not make land anymore. We have heard of the controversies in recent times of the golden triangle between Emerald, Rolleston and Springsure, that magnificent country around Orion, which is probably some of the best grain growing country in not only Australia but also the world. It is absolutely paramount that we provide security over that land indefinitely. I know there are coal seams under it. However, they do not make land anymore. As the member for Condamine made reference to tonight, the LNP certainly has a policy about protecting that land in question. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117284"></A>
I turn now to the single access code for freehold and leasehold land. This is a very integral part of this legislation. It gives landholders the right to negotiate with these companies in the allotted time. I have to say that in the past 20 years we have seen much legislation come before this House. I think that the rights of landholders have been continually improved by legislation as it progresses. This piece of legislation is different in many ways in that it is now identifying with the needs of landholders in relation to protecting their land, rights and assets. More importantly, we must identify the importance of their asset, the value of their asset, the wealth-generating capacity of that land in question whether it be through grain production, sheep, wool, cattle or whatever the case may be. We are talking about some of the best farming land in Queensland. We are talking about coal seam gas, coal and mineral development. The important factor is that there must be no hidden agenda in terms of compensation to landholders. They should be made aware of their rights and given every opportunity to take advantage of their entitlements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117289"></A>
Turning to the coal seam gas industry, this is a new industry. It is an industry that is locking up a lot of very good land in the Western Downs area and the southern Arcadia Valley area that I represent. The interlocking of pipelines in the gas fields will render a lot of good farming land useless, but this is going to be the network. Many property owners have legitimate concerns, and it is something that I hope the minister will address in his summary sometime tomorrow. It is important that landholders are told up front exactly how this is going to work, how they can continue to operate their farming operations or their cattle grazing operations as the case may be. We are talking about the most productive land in Queensland. Ultimately, this land’s production quality is equal to nowhere else in the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117291"></A>
One good aspect of this legislation is the 20 business days cooling-off period for both parties. I believe in the issue of negotiation with these companies in question. Another good aspect of this legislation that I have studied is the option to go to the Land Court for mediation. I think that is an important priority. In relation to negotiations, it is sacrosanct that landholders are assured that their property rights are recognised, that they are protected and that a multinational company does not ride roughshod over them because it wants to extract the coal seam gas, coal or whatever the case may be. In this case tonight, many provisions in this legislation will clarify some of those issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117294"></A>
I say to the minister that many people, especially in that Arcadia Valley area that falls under the banner of the coal seam gas industry, have major concerns in relation to their own operations. I trust that those people in that southern area just north of Injune can be afforded the courtesy of departmental officers or these exploration or gas companies making certain that there is a meaningful co-existence between both our farming and grazing operations and these coal seam companies. While it is going to be a long-term operation, it is absolutely paramount that we see that agricultural industry co-exist in a productive way with this new form of development that we have never witnessed in that part of Queensland before. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117297"></A>
The issue of it being prime agricultural land is paramount. We do need to address these issues. Over the next couple of years, the new Waratah and Hancock developments--those mega mines--will develop further in the central area of my electorate going back towards Alpha and between Alpha and Clermont. That is a different type of country. We are talking here about red soil, forest-type country. It is not the prime agricultural farming land that we all know exists in the Central Highlands. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117303"></A>
With those few points I say to the minister and departmental officers tonight that it is paramount that we get this mix right, that the farming operations, the landholders and the people who operate those good agricultural operations through that region are not penalised, are not subjected to the torture of being ridden roughshod over by these multinational companies. More importantly, we must work it out so that both the coal seam gas companies or the coal companies and these agricultural operations can gain full productivity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121986"></A>
I refer to the farming land of the golden triangle area and Arcadia Valley just north of Emerald. They do not make that land anymore. I refer to the farming country of the southern downs and the western downs, around Roma and Dalby. They do not make that land anymore, either. We could take a leaf out of the book of the people of Europe, because they look after their prime agricultural land. They have done so for hundreds of years and they will continue to do so. In recent years in the south-east all the beautiful country of the Redlands, which was prime vegetable-growing land, has been developed into residential estates. That is where we have the mix wrong. I hope that we do not get the mix wrong as we develop and secure a coal seam gas industry and a coalmining industry in the very valuable lands above those commodities--that is, coal seam gas and coal. I hope that we can work through this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121990"></A>
The geothermal concept affects Western Queensland and remote areas. I believe that this industry has to be pursued and developed as quickly as humanly possible, because the long-term benefits of the geothermal industry are untapped in more ways than one. Many people are living in and moving to the south-east of the state. We are overtaxing the resources in this part of the world and we need to develop the clean energy resources of the western areas. Mr Deputy Speaker, you come from Western Queensland so you would know as well as I that they are good places to live and raise a family, but we do lack natural resources. Power will be a significant factor in the development of the regions so people will move there. The social infrastructure is there with hospitals, schools and all that type of thing. It is very important that we look at fast-tracking those developments, so that we can secure a future for the growing population of this state. Those of us who have lived in such places for a long period certainly know that they are good places to get ahead and to raise a family while progressing the causes of this great state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121991"></A>
I congratulate the minister for putting together what is very complex legislation. I think in terms of geothermal energy and coal seam gas, this legislation will take the state a long way into the future. However, we have to address the anomalies that exist, such as the underground water issue and the preservation of our prime agricultural land. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Mount Ommaney--ALP) (9.13 pm): I rise to speak on the Geothermal Energy Bill 2010 because I and many others believe that Queensland needs to move forward in relation to the generation of renewable energy. As the member for Mount Ommaney I have been pleased with the level of interest shown by local environmental groups in sustainable energy and their knowledge of the effects of climate change. </Hansard-Body>

One local group, Sustainable Jamboree, was established in 2006 and continues to go from strength to strength, providing programs for local schools, households, businesses and community groups to reduce our ecological footprint and promote sustainability. Sustainable Jamboree’s convenor, Ngaire McGaw, has a high profile in the community for her very hard work and the number of hours she puts into this local community organisation. Recently, ABC Carbon listed Ngaire among the top 50 climate activists in Australia. In 2009 this organisation ran more than 45 public events or activities, usually to large interactive audiences, and the Queensland government provided $10,000 in funding for the group to deliver the Low Carbon Diet program, which resulted in carbon savings of 1,211,822 kilograms per year and an average household reduction of more than five tonnes. The group’s first project was initiating the first community farm at Rocks Riverside Park, where over 100 people from the local community cultivate 40 sustainable garden plots, growing their own produce to share. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1121999"></A>
Like these sustainable energy enthusiasts, people generally recognise that climate change is one of our greatest challenges. The Queensland Renewable Energy Plan outlines a strategy for the expansion of our state’s renewable energy sector. I am pleased that this bill will deliver a flexible framework for regulating geothermal exploration and production. Geothermal energy, described as hot rocks, is virtually emissions free and, therefore, is a greenhouse-friendly energy source. It has the potential to produce more baseload energy for Queensland than any other single source of renewable energy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122000"></A>
Heat energy is contained in the earth’s crust and is derived from natural geological processes which have various forms including geothermal water, steam or wet geothermal energy, and hot dry rocks. This type of energy can be utilised for small scale and large scale power generation. It is estimated that Queensland has at least 90,000 cubic metres of hot rocks, and geothermal production presents a number of potential benefits to the state. These include access to a new and potentially vast energy source, attracting significant exploration and research investment and placing the state at the forefront of this new technology. It is important that Queensland takes responsibility for reducing its emissions and sequestering greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. We need to ensure that our state is well positioned for economic and social resilience by fostering sustainable industries. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122001"></A>
The purposes of this bill are: to implement the Queensland government’s policy for geothermal energy production and use by underpinning the concept that the people of Queensland own all geothermal energy resources; to ensure a consistent approach with other Queensland resource based legislation; and to provide security and flexibility for the geothermal industry in its infancy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122002"></A>
Encouraging regulated large scale production and use of geothermal energy will support rural and regional employment. Our focus is to promote competition and business investment. It is vital that we manage the environmental impacts of the geothermal activities by ensuring that companies obtain the relevant environmental and water authorities before exploration or production activities commence. Everyone recognises that the resources and agricultural sectors are the backbone of Queensland’s rural and regional economy, and their co-existence is critical to the long-term prosperity of the state. This bill addresses those important issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122003"></A>
As a member of the parliamentary Environment and Resources Committee I am pleased that currently we are looking at creating the right conditions for tapping into renewable energy resources in Queensland. Switching to renewable energy resources for some of our electricity needs is the key to reducing climate change risks and ensuring that the state has environmentally sustainable energy sources for the future. Coal-burning power stations continue to produce about 85 per cent of Queensland’s electricity, and demand is predicted to grow by around half by the end of this decade. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122004"></A>
With only six per cent of the state’s electricity now sourced from renewables, it is time to act and to tap into our potentially limitless resources of solar, wind, biomass and geothermal. Research suggests that our state has more geothermal material than any other Australian state or territory. Enormous quantities of virtually emissions-free energy could be produced in Queensland. This bill will move Queensland forward and recognises the Bligh government’s passion and commitment to a clean energy future. <Hansard-Speech-End>

By world standards, Australia is an energy guzzler. Of the 21 nations assessed, the International Energy Agency, the IEA, has identified that we are the fifth largest user of energy behind Canada, Finland, the United States of America and Belgium. Queensland is the most energy intensive state in Australia and we rely heavily on fossil fuels to meet our energy needs. A recent weekly greenhouse indicator shows Queensland emitted 1.458 million tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and unfortunately our energy usage continues to grow at an average of 2.3 per cent per annum. That is why reading the Toward Q2 August newsletter was heartening. I have to congratulate Queenslanders for embracing alternative energy, particularly solar, with the aim of reducing our carbon footprint. I also congratulate the state and federal Labor governments on their subsidies for solar and other renewable energy sources. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126787"></A>
Geothermal energy sources could play a vital role in the federal government’s national renewable energy target of 20 per cent of Australia’s electricity supply to come from renewable energy sources by 2020. The committee that I chair, the Environment and Resources Committee, is currently inquiring into the opportunities and challenges for the Queensland government associated with increasing the proposition of electricity generated from renewable energy sources in this state. Our latest hearing was attended by representatives from Clean Energy Australasia who gave my committee a brief outline of their work in geothermal or ‘hot rocks’ energy. They described Queensland as having the largest potential for geothermal energy of any state in Australia. Hence the need for legislation. They also said it was closer to the surface which means easier and cheaper access and that the source would last a million years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126790"></A>
The Geothermal Energy Bill is another step to tackle climate change as we move towards less reliance on fossil fuels. The bill aims to support this burgeoning industry by delivering a flexible framework for regulating geothermal exploration and production and delivering a concise message to the geothermal industry--and that is you can invest in this state, as Minister Robertson says, with certainty and confidence.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126791"></A>
The bill supports the Queensland government’s investment in geothermal initiatives. An example is our $15 million investment in the state’s Geothermal Energy Centre of Excellence and a further $5 million committed to the Coastal Geothermal Energy Initiative, which will identify high geothermal heat flow areas close to existing electricity transmission lines along our coastline. Obviously the further the energy source is away from the grid means it is more expensive to connect to it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126794"></A>
The bill provides for the underpinning of the concept that Queenslanders own the resource which is consistent with other state resource based legislation. It provides a balanced approach to private land access and recognises and clarifies the rights of authority or tenure holders and landholders in relation to access to private land for resource related activities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126795"></A>
I look forward to seeing the wise management of the industry, but the protection of the environment must come first and foremost. I also look forward to the promotion of competition so that the industry can grow and create jobs in the future and help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms MALE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Pine Rivers--ALP) (9.22 pm): I rise this evening to support the Geothermal Energy Bill 2010. This bill amends a number of existing acts such as the Petroleum and Gas (Production and Safety) Act 2004, the Electricity Act 1994, the Mineral Resources Act 1989 and the Timber Utilisation and Marketing Act 1987. I will confine my remarks to the geothermal energy aspect of this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126802"></A>
This bill has been designed to establish a framework to encourage and facilitate the safe production of geothermal energy to accelerate the expansion of the renewable energy sector in Queensland. Geothermal energy or ‘hot rocks’ energy is a virtually CO<Hansard-Subscript>
2</Hansard-Subscript>
 emission-free energy source that has the potential to produce more baseload energy than any other single source of renewable energy. It is for this reason that we need to get the balance right. I will speak tonight about the land access provisions, as this is usually one of the most contentious parts of energy exploration and provision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126803"></A>
The bill contains landmark amendments to the way resource tenure and authority holders access private land and how compensation arrangements are arrived at. These amendments are essential due to the increase in interaction and conflict between rural landholders and tenure or authority holders for land use, particularly in the light of the continued strong growth in coal seam gas and coal exploration and development across the state. The new land access provisions will make it easier for private landholders and mining and petroleum companies to deal with the complexities and challenges caused by overlapping activities by providing a uniform framework for land access and compensation across all resources legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126804"></A>
The key elements of the Land Access Policy Framework reflected in the bill include: a single Land Access Code of Conduct, with all tenure and authority holders required to comply with the code; a notice of entry process for designated ‘preliminary activities’ that will have little or no impact on landholders; a requirement to make a conduct and compensation agreement prior to entry of land for advanced activities that are likely to significantly impact the landholder; graduated negotiation and dispute resolution processes to remedy disputes; and improved compliance and enforcement processes for administering the code of conduct. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126805"></A>
The bill introduces activity thresholds that increase the level of regulation as the intensity or impact of the proposed activity increases. This is a sensible measure that balances the level of regulation with the level of impact. Early exploration activities can have nil or negligible impact on private landholders. The bill defines these as ‘preliminary activities’ which might include taking rock, water or soil samples and walking the land. For preliminary activities, resource authority or tenure holders must give each owner and occupier of land within the tenure or authority area an entry notice and a copy of the land access code at least 10 days prior to entry. Access for these activities does not require a conduct and compensation agreement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126806"></A>
Correspondingly, when the impacts are more significant on the private landholder or occupier, a higher level of accord is required. These activities are referred to as ‘advanced activities’. For advanced activities, tenure holders must be party to a conduct and compensation agreement with each eligible claimant for the land. Where agreement is not reached, the framework provides mediation mechanisms. To assist in the negotiation process, a standard conduct and compensation agreement template has been developed in consultation with resource and agriculture industry peak bodies, along with a negotiation tip sheet for landholders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126807"></A>
The land access amendments introduce an innovative new requirement for mediation to occur between parties if agreement negotiations break down. This has been included on the basis that all stakeholders have expressed a desire to keep these matters out of the Land Court and to use all means to negotiate a mutually acceptable outcome for both parties. Matters cannot be referred to the Land Court for determination until mediation has occurred. A detailed compliance and enforcement strategy will be developed to ensure that these new measures achieve their full effect on the ground, particularly with respect to the land access code. This bill is an important step in the ongoing viability of the renewable energy sector, and I therefore commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Geothermal energy is one of the more latent energy sources that has now been realised, and progress is being realised to harness its power. Although geothermal energy is not a major contributor to world energy sources, its use is increasing. I have no doubt it is going to increase a lot further. I think we are at the base of what hopefully will become a very exciting industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126811"></A>
The Birdsville geothermal power station utilises wet geothermal energy. This provides part of the electricity requirements for the town of Birdsville. I have no doubt that this is where geothermal energy will come into its own--in areas where other energy sources are far more difficult to access. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126813"></A>
In addition to these known resources in the south-west of the state, the Coastal Geothermal Energy Initiative will be investigating additional sources of hot rocks for geothermal energy close to existing transmission lines. There are 38 reported potential geothermal targets identified in eastern Queensland. The Coastal Geothermal Energy Initiative underway will report on the geothermal potential of eastern Queensland and provide potential targets to industry for future potential exploration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1126814"></A>
This technology may well go some way to ensuring that we are working towards emission-free power. However, it has to be undertaken in a planned, methodical manner. With respect, this bill is laying the foundations for that. Whilst investigation of these future potential energy sources is encouraging, the effects on the land and interaction with affected landholders and those adjoining must be considered, and a proven and workable co-existence must be worked through. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131670"></A>
Over the past few months we have witnessed a breakdown in clear communication and questionable process with regard to, amongst other things, underground coal gasification, particularly in the Darling Downs region. There have been numerous documented concerns from farmers and graziers directly affected by the poor processes in place. At this stage, I note that, as third-generation landholders ourselves and our sons as fourth-generation landholders who have coal seam gas exploration activities going on across their property, I can certainly say that we are experiencing this firsthand and from a family perspective we are working through many of these issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131674"></A>
It is noted in the objectives of the bill relating to both geothermal energy and land access that there are many common traits. These relate to improved relations and constructive consultation between affected parties such as resource companies and landholders. In many ways, this is an admission that the present government has acknowledged a need to improve on its processes and work more constructively with landowners. This aspect is to be endorsed and welcomed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131676"></A>
We have to remember that the agricultural sector is still a very important primary industry that Queensland relies on. Queensland relies very heavily on its agricultural resources together with the burgeoning resource sector. As we know, this is the powerhouse of Queensland, but we must protect it into the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131677"></A>
There is an accepted need to ensure planned and controlled resource growth. All Queenslanders would acknowledge a need to keep pace with a sustainable demand for minerals and other such resources within the state. The need for people within these industries to have a balanced framework to co-exist has never been greater. This is an area that will have to be looked at very closely in the next few years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131678"></A>
The retention of agricultural land now and into the future is also critical. I think it is crunch time now in terms of looking at the preservation of agricultural land. Until this point in time this has not been an issue. Now it is definitely coming forward as an issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131679"></A>
The LNP takes a strong stance with regard to the protection of prime agricultural land. Agriculture is the cornerstone of the Queensland economy, as are the minerals industry and the underground coal gasification industry. Protection of our agricultural land has to be balanced with the needs of the resource industry. Agriculture needs to be acknowledged and protected as the economy diversifies and builds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131680"></A>
Within the LNP’s policy on the protection of prime agricultural land there are five key planks. One of those is the charter of property rights which impacts on this issue. We will entrench in law a charter of property rights that will legally guarantee the rights of private property owners, whether they are householders in an urban area or primary producers in a rural area. The charter will ensure that all government policy relating to land and water rights is basically based on science and not on politics or hearsay. The charter will legally enshrine compensation for landholders whose pre-existing rights are diminished perhaps as a result of government policy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131683"></A>
With regard to protecting prime agricultural land, the LNP made a commitment in March 2009 that it would protect prime agricultural land from mining. The LNP recognises the long-term need to preserve prime farmland for continued agriculture throughout Queensland and to protect it from mining, urban development and other incompatible uses. We keep in mind the major importance of our resource industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131684"></A>
This issue is fundamental to many areas but is especially relevant to the Burdekin electorate. The Burdekin electorate is blessed with fertile soils in the Bowen and Gumlu areas. They are a food bowl for horticulture produce. I add that these areas are bracing for the impact of the seedling poisoning that occurred in June of this year. Disappointingly, a couple of weeks ago we had a very heavy storm that virtually wiped out huge crops of corn in the Bowen area. From an agricultural perspective, Bowen is doing it very tough at the moment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131686"></A>
The area of the Burdekin delta is very fortunate because it does have an abundant water supply that ensures a consistently high tonnage of sugarcane together with many other varieties of horticultural produce. Added to this, there is prime grazing land for cattle production from the Collinsville region north. Collinsville is a mining region. We are seeing new coalmines spring up there. There is also a great deal of coal seam gas exploration underway in that area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131690"></A>
I have talked to a lot of landholders who are frustrated and concerned about the negotiations and working with these companies. With respect, I acknowledge that the majority of our resource companies are very sensitive and are aware of the impact they have on existing landholders. For most of us, having strangers come into our front garden and dig holes in our front garden would be very difficult to handle when looking at it from an urban perspective. I think it must be acknowledged how very difficult it is for landowners, for farmers, for graziers to appreciate what is occurring when it comes to land access issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131692"></A>
Another facet of the legislation is the rural water advisory panel. The LNP believes that no individual group or community should have their water access or reliability negatively affected by coal seam gas or underground coal gasification development. This is a very serious issue. Certain recent events have started to show how important this is. If their water access or reliability is negatively affected there must be an absolute obligation to ensure that the original landowners do not suffer loss and that their interests are repaired. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131693"></A>
The issue of land access can be quite daunting and confronting to landowners. The majority of these people have put their heart and soul into building up their properties, which may have been in the family for generations. As I said earlier, I can relate to that because I look at my sons who are fourth-generation farmers and graziers. It is one of those things that builds up and is accepted as part of the family. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131694"></A>
Consultation by resource companies needs to be genuine. There needs to be understanding and empathy for the affected landholders. There needs to be an acknowledgement as part of the land access issue that tracts of land are also being withdrawn from production due to rail lines linking the existing and new mines to the eastern seaboard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131696"></A>
Within the Burdekin electorate we are seeing a lot of new mines under development that are negotiating for land right now. Rail lines are to be laid to deliver this revenue source to Abbot Point for export. It is worthy to note that the Hancock line is certainly underway. It goes right through the Burdekin electorate. Waratah Coal has also started negotiations and consultation processes. There seems to be the possibility that two railway lines will go through. That will take up a lot of land and will involve a lot of landowners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131699"></A>
It is very daunting for those landowners. One property owner said to me that their property has had a large piece taken out for a coalmine, it has coal seam gas exploration work going on right across it and now it has a railway line cutting through major paddocks. This man looked at me and said, ‘I just wanted to be a grazier. I just wanted to run a grazing property.’ When we think about what has happened to that property we can understand the difficulties they are facing. They may be getting compensation but it also affects the long-term value of that land. I appreciate that the government is also acknowledging that in this bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136514"></A>
Consultation by resource companies needs to be genuine, with understanding and empathy. There needs to be an acknowledgement, as part of the land access, that this land is being withdrawn from production. As I said, rail lines are being built to deliver the revenue source to Abbot Point for export. The net result in most cases is a considerable impost for graziers as they see their properties divided. This also creates a host of management issues that will be ongoing. These rail corridors will cause concerns in terms of accessing adjoining parts of the property, increased potential for fires from trains, and noise and dust issues. The potential of fires caused by trains is a big issue and certainly something that my area has seen given the dry conditions. Resource companies need to be sympathetic to these realities and need to be willing to fully compensate for those imposts for the mutual benefit that will be realised from the arrangement and a symbiotic relationship has to be built and developed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136517"></A>
The areas for compensation within this bill need to be wide ranging and include such aspects specifically as the depravation of possession of surface of land--that is, the actual depravation to the owner in that loss of land which, even though it may only be a significantly small amount of land, can have a huge impact on the overall value and the overall productivity of that property. As a result, we are seeing a diminution in the value of that land. When that goes down, that is like a slap in the face. We are also seeing a loss of the use of the land and the improvements. We are seeing severance and any cost or loss incurred from the conduct of the resource operations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136518"></A>
The land access objective to facilitate improved relations between resource companies and landholders is to be welcomed and is well overdue given many of the recent issues. The next objective to provide a consistent, transparent and equitable process to facilitate access of private land for authorised activities will also be welcomed to provide a consistent approach to these dealings and will protect the best of intentions by the two parties. There needs to be a credible consistent process to ensure workable outcomes. The last objective is to provide clear dispute resolution, compliance and enforcement processes and powers, with legal proceedings considered only as a last resort. Hopefully they will be needed and used in isolated cases. I am aware that the minister has quite a broad range of amendments to this bill. I support the shadow minister’s stand on this bill. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs PRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nanango--Ind) (9.42 pm): I rise to speak to the Geothermal Energy Bill. I have to say at the outset that there is a lot in this bill that I find very easy to support, especially with regard to the property rights of landholders. Over the last 12 years I have been involved in many incidents where people’s properties have been taken over by mining companies, roads, possible rail corridors, transmission lines et cetera. I have been involved with those people who have felt the angst in these kinds of situations. Some members in this place have possibly smiled or even laughed at the fact that people are going through this and say that they understand what those people are going through. The majority of people in this House cannot understand what it is like to have someone come onto your property and virtually shut your activity down--something that you, your father, your grandfather and everybody else have worked for all their lives. It is a very difficult situation and everybody in this House should try to recognise that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136524"></A>
In this bill the minister is trying to at least make up for the shortfalls of the previous legislation by increasing compensation. Many aspects that the minister has included in this legislation with regard to paying legal costs et cetera have been done by Tarong Energy. If any mining company has endeavoured to do the right thing on many occasions, it has been Tarong Energy. However, it has still fallen short for many people and there is still a lot of unfairness in the whole situation that people have to go through. For instance, how can the value of a property in Kingaroy be compared to a property in Chinchilla and therefore a reasonable price paid for a property? It does not happen like that. It is just not the way it should be done. The value of a property to an individual cannot be overestimated when it has been generational or they have planted a vineyard and after 20 or 30 years they have achieved a really good wine. Nobody can put a price on that sort of thing, but Tarong Energy has at least endeavoured to come to the party.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136525"></A>
Geothermal or hot rock energy could very well be the way to go, and it is admirable that any government is looking for better, cleaner and greener types of energy. We hear the phrase ‘cleaner and greener’ types of energy being bandied around as if to say that because we put a green and a clean on it it automatically is clean and green. I bring to the parliament’s attention once again that they said that UCG was clean and green and they sold it to our community of Kingaroy on the basis that it was clean and it was green. In the last few months it has been proven that it is far from clean and green. Regardless of whether someone believes one part per billion or 100 parts per billion is acceptable, we do not. It is contamination. There is contamination where there was no contamination before. Regardless of whether it is still within the Australian drinking standards, it is still contamination. It is not acceptable, and UCG is not one of those technologies that should be pursued.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136526"></A>
I am going to oppose this bill not because it is full of bad things, because it is not, but because it does not curb UCG. That is why I will be opposing this bill. The Kingaroy and the South Burnett area have dodged a bullet--literally. It could have been a heck of a lot worse. I know that the minister has visited the area, and it was good that he came to the area when invited to talk to people. Like most government bodies, all of the right things were said. The minister said that he would look into it and there will be an investigation. The Minister for Sustainability did the same thing, and I also commend her for her interest. But the people in my community do not want this to be a whitewash. We do not want this technology in its current form to go ahead anywhere else in Queensland, because no community should be subjected to this kind of concern.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136529"></A>
If one reads all of the documentation dealing with UCG it is well known--all the experts agree--that contamination will occur. It is recommended that UCG be conducted away from populations, away from watercourse and underground water, and away from good arable land, yet here it is smack bang in the South Burnett on some of the most prime agricultural land in the state on top of a hill which can lead to the main water supply of Kingaroy. Luckily it has not this time, and we will be fighting to ensure that there is no next time. I believe that the minister is aware of the concerns that the potential is there and I hope that when the expert panel comes to Kingaroy on 25 August it will know and understand that this UCG industry was in the wrong place.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136562"></A>
Hot rock or geothermal might very well be the perfect energy in the right place, but UCG is not. I would like to know if anybody here in this room is a mining engineer, a geophysicist or a chemist? Do members know terms such as coal pyrolysis in UCG or what it is? Do members know and understand the very complicated heterogeneous chemical kinetic reaction processes that occur when you burn the coal? I will bet you 10 to a dozen that there is not one person in here who knows that, but by God I am learning these terminologies and I am understanding them. The more I learn the more concerns I have. This government needs to recognise these terms. Do the people on the expert panel know these things? Do the people who back all of these new technologies understand them? It is a difficult task for anyone in this House to grasp the concept of all the technologies that will be involved in the future, whether they be for energy or any other form. It is a big game of Russian roulette that we play with our communities and I hope my community will not get the bullet. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136565"></A>
So let us go geothermal if it is the right way to go, if it is going to be the one that works and achieves the goal that we want of not harming the earth in any possible way. If that is the way to go, let us pursue it. I hear the LNP members stand up one after the other and say how they have a policy that will protect agricultural land and that they will be supporting this bill. They, too, have also talked about UCG and its possible effects in the future. But I have not yet heard one of them say that they will oppose it until all the kinks are ironed out. I have not heard one say, ‘We will put it way out where there is no population, where there is no underground water and there is no good-quality land.’ They have not said that yet. They can say one thing and they can talk to farmers out the front of parliament when they are protesting and say, ‘We will do this and we will do that’ but they do almost the total opposite when they are in this House. That is something the people are seeing more and more of. They cannot just talk the talk and not walk the walk. They will get found out in the long run. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136566"></A>
I know that this bill will pass and I have to agree that it is probably the better way to go. But it is also a way for me to express the concerns of my community. I know all the members smile and shake their heads, but people live in my community. There are so many questions that have to be asked when it comes to mining. As I said, I am not opposed to mining. I am not opposed to new technologies. Not very long ago I fought very hard to keep 400-plus jobs in my area when it was reported that the Meandu mine was about to close. I know the value of mining and I know the value of it to communities and governments. I know we cannot turn back the clock. I would like to see all open-cut mines disappear in the future. But I do not want the technology that we are investigating to be detrimental to any community in Queensland. It is just not worth it. </Hansard-Body>

 Mr Beutel is out there now all by himself. He has been fighting to protect the memorial park there and the things that his mother has done. Whether it was set up as a mining town in the first place, it is still sad to see a community just disappear off the face of the earth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136573"></A>
I have seen how mining companies work. I have seen how they pick off what they would deem the easy pickings and buy properties one by one. They will take one particular gentleman who has the worst possible country and pay him an excellent price. He had 13 acres. He now has roughly 150 acres. That is what mining companies do. They pick them off. They give this fellow a really good deal and hold out on the ones who have prime-quality country. They pay this man a very bad price and this man right next door a top price. There is no fairness in it and I do not know how you legislate for that type of fairness. I would imagine that it is one of the most difficult things to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136574"></A>
 I have had people crying in my office. I have heard people accuse the state government and mining interests of killing their father because the stress was too much. I have seen it all. I know that they are all emotive things and we should not base things on emotive issues but on facts. But the fact is that there are places in Queensland where mining should not be conducted. This new technology is not proven in Queensland. It is not actually proven anywhere in the world yet. If one person can tell me of one UCG project in the world that is successful, by all means tell me, because the group of people who are fighting UCG have not yet found it. I have asked and I have asked and I have asked for months for an example. Not one has come forward. When you look up the pilot plants that are starting in America and China, what do they refer to? They refer to a successful operation in Chinchilla. That is their example. How can we claim that this is a successful project in Queensland? Yes, we are dabbling with it and they are pilot programs, but they all appear to have problems. But what is even worse is that, when they do have problems, there is such a long delay in reporting it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136577"></A>
 I have mentioned before that when Cougar Energy did their burn Len Walker, their CEO--I think that is his title--said at the meeting at Kingaroy, and the minister was there, that he expects that the crack and the blockage occurred between 20 March to the end of March, in that time period. It was nearly 3 months before we got anything into the public arena. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136578"></A>
So is geothermal the way to go? Perhaps. However, UCG is not. But geothermal has everybody’s hopes. We have seen it around the world. We have seen it in New Zealand. It works--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs PRATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am not a mathematician but I know that I pay a flipping lot now for electricity and so does everybody else. It has gone up sky high. The truth is that we can explore other technologies but not in areas where there are people. We can explore where it is recommended by CSIRO, not where there are people, not where there is underground water and watercourses and not where there is good arable land. We all know that Australia has so much unusable land and so little arable land, or usable land, and that land is mainly on the coastal fringes. It is negligent of us to waste one acre of that land. It is negligent of us not to utilise it to its best use, which is to feed the people of this country and perhaps other countries of the world as their populations grow and their demand becomes greater and greater. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141529"></A>
I know that this is probably not the way to go, but I would get down on my knees and beg that the minister not set up these plants anywhere near communities if I had to. If he would put on hold any future exploration with UCG--until its safety can be guaranteed, and that is not something that anyone is prepared to do--I would be grateful. We have spoken to Len Walker and many people around the world and every single person has said that contamination will occur. It is true that with any mining there will be contamination, but we cannot afford to have contamination in our watercourses.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141531"></A>
When we asked the people who spoke to us how they would deal with contamination they said the likelihood of it is so minuscule that they had not actually thought about it. That is not a good answer. That is a fail in anyone’s book. How does one clean up a watertable? How does one clean up the cavity that is left behind? We say: show us. People are willing to look at the information, but we cannot find anything that says UCG is effective or that the mess can be cleaned up. They tell me that hot rock therapy is good. Maybe it will be the best way to go for our country, but I beg all members not to play Russian roulette with the people of any community because not one of them deserves to have their life, their livelihood or their children’s future gambled with. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141532"></A>
I will be opposing this bill. I will not oppose it because it is a bad bill; I believe it has a lot of good. I would have embraced it, and probably the minister too, if he had just said that he was going to hold back UCG until it was better regulated, better monitored and that there would be severe punishment for anyone who failed to comply with government legislation. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs MENKENS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burdekin--LNP) (10.02 pm): Seniors Week is a good opportunity to recognise the efforts, achievements and needs of seniors in our community, a chance to say thankyou and to highlight what needs to be done to help ageing Queenslanders. Today I applaud our seniors and recognise the amazing contributions they make on a daily basis to their families, their communities and to our state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141544"></A>
Sadly, year after year the Bligh Labor government misses this opportunity and consistently fails not only to recognise the needs of seniors but also to implement any way of gauging and hearing those needs. It is time the minister moved beyond catchphrases and condescension in dealing with seniors and started implementing some active programs for advocacy and political facilitation. At a time when older women represent the new face of homelessness, elder abuse is rising by 20 per cent a year and the rising costs of living are hurting more and more pensioners and retirees, the need for a political voice for seniors has never been stronger. The red tape facing our community organisations, changing family structures and consequent responsibilities that fall to seniors, transport, health, isolation and employment are issues that are facing seniors. Every community concern is a seniors’ concern. The perspective is the difference. We as a community desperately need a place in government that notes and listens to that perspective.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141545"></A>
After another year of rhetoric, what has been achieved for seniors? One document, which would be better entitled ‘Positively Aimless’, a compilation of catchphrases that was remarkably devoid of any new initiatives or ideas, no new programs and tiny funding increases. To find that out, seniors had to wade through pages of glossy condescension and phrases like ‘treasuring wise gems’ and ‘hippy hippy shake’. Seniors deserve better than what this government is prepared to give. They do not want to be told how to age, they do not want to be told what to believe. They want a fair voice and representation in the political process. That means consideration of their needs in policy making, advocacy for the rights of seniors and opportunities to have their input and their opinions heard.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141546"></A>
Seniors have been acknowledged in the federal arena with the Liberal National Party promising to deliver a minister for ageing and seniors, specifically giving older Australians a voice in the political process. Another initiative that I applaud is the Seniors Employment Incentive Payments to help seniors who want to return to work. So many older Queenslanders who have faced redundancy find it hard to re-enter the workforce. They have so much to offer, their experience is irreplaceable, yet they still find it difficult to return to the workforce. A raft of other initiatives, including financial measures and helping improve the safety of seniors in their homes and communities, highlight the need for political priority and variety in helping to improve the quality of life for our senior Queenslanders. So who can we say is a senior Queenslander? A senior is a person who has built up the wisdom and experience of the years. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms CROFT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Broadwater--ALP) (10.05 pm): At 57 Billington Street, Labrador there is a little building that offers to families living in Labrador and surrounding suburbs a range of services. It is the Labrador Child and Family Centre. Formerly the United Church building, the $3 million Labrador Child and Family Centre will help improve the lives of local families with children. The centre has been made possible through the Queensland government’s Community Renewal Program and supports the <Hansard-Italic>
Toward Q2: Tomorrow’s Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
 strategy of building fairer, healthier communities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141550"></A>
I had the great pleasure of representing the Minister for Communities, Karen Struthers, in officially opening the centre some months ago. Recently I revisited the centre to find the centre coordinator, Brooke Hughes, busily working with local mums delivering the centre’s busy schedule of activities and programs. I was pleased to see the centre’s weekly timetable is full of programs for mums and bubs, allocating times for counselling and family support worker availability. There is a playgroup, a read and grow program for children aged 0 to 5, an intergenerational craft group and mums and bubs yoga. On Wednesday mornings new mums and dads have access to the child health nurse clinics, when the wonderful nurses from the Labrador Child Health Centre located on Frank Street come to the centre to conduct weekly weighing of newborns, health checks and offer feeding and parenting advice, a service that I can personally recommend.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141551"></A>
The facility has a large covered veranda and an outdoor play area for children and landscaping that has been enhanced by a great big sandpit that was kindly built by the gentlemen from the nearby Men’s Shed. The Men’s Shed was officially opened last week and I would like to congratulate this group on their fantastic efforts. With 90 members signed up there will be lots of sawing, hammering and sanding going on as they make children’s toys and work on a range of special projects.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141552"></A>
The Labrador Child and Family Centre was developed in partnership with local residents, the Gold Coast City Council and other government and community agencies. It is this collaborative and integrated approach that enables the centre to be the hub of activity, support, services, connectivity, gathering and improved outcomes for young families and their children. I would like to acknowledge Lifeline Gold Coast, ACT for Kids, FSG Australia, Labrador Primary School, Kalwun Development Corporation and Playgroup Queensland for partnering with the Benevolent Society. The Labrador Child and Family Centre has been created as a model of best practice for the Gold Coast and has been set up as a collaborative multifunctional community hub. I encourage Labrador residents to pop by the centre and have a look inside and pick up a timetable of the activities on offer.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141553"></A>
As the local member I am pleased to see the Labrador area benefit from the state government’s community renewal funding through a project that will continue to provide critical support to those who need it and positive outcomes for local families. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (10.08 pm): Nowhere are current hardships experienced by the unemployed and low-income workers being felt more than in my electorate of Gaven. If the walls of my office could tell stories, you would hear tales of people facing constant struggles to obtain food or housing and relying on local groups to provide them with assistance. To illustrate the difficulties, one has to look no further than the Nerang Neighbourhood Centre, which runs a food bank for the needy. Only last year the food bank was providing 12 boxes of food per week, but this has skyrocketed to 120 boxes a week. The centre is in the process of seeking funding to start a Get Set for Work program in Nerang to improve the job prospects of many of these people living off Centrelink payments. There are 2,653 people in the Gaven electorate currently receiving jobseeker Centrelink benefits, and this number increased in June by about four per cent.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146627"></A>
People are doing it tough on the coast. Just recently I had a couple who live in rented accommodation with their three children come to my office desperate for social housing because of their worsening financial situation. One of the really sad points about their visit was that one of the partners was morbidly obese and had wanted to have lap band surgery but they could no longer afford to have health insurance to cover the operation. They told me that they had to stop paying their home, contents and car insurance as well. They had expenses of $2,427 a fortnight and were receiving income of $1,762, made up of Centrelink payments and a Defence Service pension. Despite living in the same rental accommodation for the past 18 months, their finances had become an intolerable burden and they could no longer afford their medications or the $500 they had budgeted for food. They were paying $520 a week for rented housing. These are normal costs on the coast. Because of the enormous shortage of housing on the Gold Coast they were having extreme problems finding something cheaper. Similarly, a father of two children came to my office desperate for assistance. He said that he could either feed his children on the streets or keep them under a roof without food.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146628"></A>
Small businesses are also doing it really tough on the Coast. Unemployment in the construction industry is forcing tradespeople to leave in droves to find work in other areas, and this causes further downward pressure on spending. Our local Nerang chamber of commerce has reported that small business sales are down between 15 and 20 per cent. For example, a respectable tiling business in Nerang has been operating for 40 years and they have never seen it so tough before. They are not sure how much longer they will survive in this environment. Honourable members will hear this story over and over again. The flow-on effect of this struggle leaves small business owners in dire situations. They are forced to reduce staffing hours, creating even more underemployment for residents, and the owners find themselves working 80 hours a week just to support their families. They are in a pressure cooker just to make ends meet. This is coupled with the constant rise in the cost of living and can lead to severe mental health and stress related problems.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146629"></A>
Small business is at the heart of the economy and holds the key to delivering jobs to people across my electorate of Gaven. We must be working towards smaller government, less red tape and lower taxes to give small businesses the fuel they need not only to survive but also to flourish in undoubtedly one of the best places in the world to live. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs SMITH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burleigh--ALP) (10.12 pm): Burleigh Heads must be one of the most beautiful and family-friendly destinations in Queensland. Nearly every visitor I speak to has a memory of coming to Burleigh as a child with their family, on their honeymoon or just for a break and they are now back with their families. But not everyone in Burleigh is on holidays. We have a large resident population who call Burleigh home. There are those who have lived here all their lives and those who have come just recently, but every one of them intends for Burleigh to become their permanent home. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146635"></A>
A community is more than a group of people; it is a living, breathing, caring neighbourhood--a place where we know the families living next door or across the road, where we care what happens to the single parent with small children or the widowed person down the road. I am proud to say that Burleigh has all of this and more.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146636"></A>
The Gold Coast Quota Club has launched a reading program involving students at Varsity Junior College. The program, called QuoCKa--Quota, Cops and Kids--aims to bring police, children and members of the community in a unified, positive framework reading together to demonstrate to young children that the police and the wider community are there to help and support them. To see a police officer sitting down reading with a six-year-old is priceless, and the school community is very excited with the program. I congratulate Quota on this initiative. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146638"></A>
Since uniformed police officers were returned to Burleigh on a trial basis, Inspector Des Lacy reported that there was a 40 per cent drop in reports of property crime and a 45 per cent drop in reports of crimes against individuals. Residents tell me that they feel safer just seeing the police in their area. I thank Assistant Commissioner Paul Wilson and the officer in charge of Palm Beach Police Station, Senior Sergeant Chris Ahearn, for their support and willingness to undertake this trial. I think they would agree it has paid off. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146641"></A>
We have now formed our own Burleigh Community Consultative Committee. The first meeting saw 60 people attend. Six months later we are still averaging 40 people at each meeting. The police are committed to ongoing public engagement to identify new and effective measures to keep our communities safe. The chairperson, Margie Gardner, and secretary, Dan Byron, work tirelessly to make the meetings relevant and ensure that participants’ concerns are heard and addressed by the police officers present. Dan Byron, by the way, is the candidate for the McPherson federal division. Refurbishment of the Burleigh Heads police complex is about to start and I look forward, once completed, to a full complement of police being permanently stationed at Burleigh Heads. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr EMERSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Indooroopilly--LNP) (10.15 pm): The economic lifeblood of my community is small business. I never fail to be amazed by the enthusiasm, energy and commitment displayed by the small business operators. Unfortunately, I also hear a growing level of frustration and that frustration is fuelled by the increasing burden of having to comply with more and more regulations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146650"></A>
Queensland businesses have to deal with 70,000 pages of often turgid and sometimes meaningless compliance regulations. In contrast, the state of New South Wales, with a larger population, has about 40,000 pages. So while Queensland has fewer people, it has almost twice the number of pages of regulations as New South Wales. It also has many thousands more--and in some cases 10,000 more--pages of regulations than Victoria and Western Australia. These regulations tend to strangle enterprise and initiative by small business. It is estimated that they are costing Queensland businesses almost $18 billion a year because owners, managers and senior staff are forced to spend an average 10 hours a week and more than 20 days a year coping with red tape. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146651"></A>
Having run my own business for five years before entering parliament, I understand the challenges of coping with this red tape. Unfortunately, there seems to be little understanding of business from the state government considering the skyrocketing cost of compliance. The difficulty with red tape is that, while each individual regulation can normally be justified by government as being in the public interest, when we add all these individual regulations together it creates a regime that works against business growth and employment. If small businesses were freed of unnecessary red tape, they would be able to put a greater focus on servicing customers and employing more staff. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146652"></A>
Government needs to be committed to cutting red tape and unnecessary compliance costs to give Queensland small businesses the best chance of succeeding, and that will give Queensland the best chance of lifting its economic performance. Government needs to go beyond rhetoric and achieve real regulatory reform rather than grow the regulatory burden. It needs to systematically reduce the 70,000 pages of regulation and set achievable targets to do so. I believe it can start by committing that for every page of new or amended legislation which is passed in our state two pages of old laws are repealed. This is a straightforward approach that would force governments to put as much effort into ridding small business of useless, redundant and unnecessary old laws and regulations as it does into creating new ones. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms JARRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Whitsunday--ALP) (10.17 pm): This is a very special week in which a spotlight is thrown on a very special sector of our society. Yes, it is Seniors Week. I have heard a few interpretations of the week’s theme ‘Positively ageless’, but I would like to think that it means you are only as old as your attitude to life, and the more our seniors get involved with their communities through volunteering or social interaction the more positively ageless they become. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146657"></A>
Last week I had the privilege meeting hundreds of wonderful seniors from right across my electorate. More often than not they are just like me, juggling a number of commitments on any given day as they find time to contribute to organisations like CWA, ESA, Fauna Rescue, older women’s belly-dancing groups or community visitor groups. I am amazed at the energy and dedication of seniors in my electorate who give so much back to our community. That is why this year I held two Seniors Week events to acknowledge and celebrate the contribution of seniors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146661"></A>
The first was in Proserpine and targeted those seniors who volunteer their time to a service or charitable organisation, and what a great morning we had. Morning tea was followed by a very special fashion parade featuring clothes from our local Lifeline store. This was a great event, and I thank my special models for their bravery in strutting their stuff in the Lifeline fashions. They looked fantastic in a range of modern and often designer label clothes that were all available for sale at Lifeline. They did a roaring trade that day and I think we were all amazed at just what value for money these stores provide. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151741"></A>
We were also very pleased to welcome the local fauna rescue group to our morning tea and, of course, we all fell in love with the baby possum. They were hoping to enlist some new volunteers to help host the birds and animals that come their way for care. I really commend the fauna rescue members who take on injured native animals and nurture them back to health and, hopefully, to release. The regime of feeding baby animals can be more demanding than feeding a human baby, so it is a job that takes some commitment but you can tell that it is all worthwhile.</Hansard-Body>

My second seniors forum was held in Mackay and was generously hosted by Breezes lifestyle village. I was delighted to welcome the Minister for Community Services, Karen Struthers, as special guest for this event. She very graciously gave of her time to chat with my guests and provide them with some very useful information about the services available for seniors. I was also pleased to welcome representatives from the Department of Communities and fair trading, as well as the Office of the Public Trustee and representatives from various HACC and other health organisations. We had a lovely morning and, as I did then, I say ‘thank you’ to all of our wonderful, positively ageless seniors for their amazing contribution to society. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr ROBINSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cleveland--LNP) (10.19 pm): Seniors Week is an important time in the Redlands for the various groups that represent our senior citizens and that run events. Seniors Week is important as it gives us the opportunity to acknowledge the significant contribution that seniors make to our local community. Yesterday, Monday 16 August, I joined Sallyanne Atkinson, a former lord mayor of Brisbane, at a U3A breakfast at the Donald Simpson Centre in Cleveland. In her speech she highlighted some of the issues confronting seniors in the transition to the senior years. She also referred to a question that I had asked her prior to giving her speech. The question was, ‘What are you doing with yourself these days’? Sallyanne said that she had been Australia’s senior trade commissioner to France, a representative to the International Chamber of Commerce and various other things. Sallyanne described the activities in her senior years as a ‘portfolio’ of activities. She further explained that sometimes this innocent question--what are you doing these days--may inadvertently be interpreted as a question about an individual’s worth in the community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151754"></A>
I acknowledge the work of various seniors groups in my electorate: the University of the Third Age, the Donald Simpson Centre, the National Seniors Association, the Redlands District Committee on the Ageing, the Redlands RSL, Rotary and Lions clubs, Probus, the Wellington Point and Cleveland bowls clubs and others. The work of those groups is particularly significant as the Redlands is home to a higher than average proportion of senior citizens. I acknowledge the good work of the Redlands U3A, Ted Grant, Julie Porteous, John Butters, other leaders and many volunteer tutors who freely give of their time to share their expertise and talents with others. U3A provides members with affordable education and the opportunity to study and learn in a relaxed environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151757"></A>
I acknowledge the amazing work of Ernie Harrison and the Donald Simpson Centre. Ernie has built a fantastic centre that provides various activities for seniors such as Matildas Quilters, music appreciation, Out With A Difference, Spanish classes, the stroke support group, the theatrical group and Walkers for Health. It was a pleasure to be invited to the recent breakfast and to see the new bus stop that we worked hard to get being put to good use. I look forward to returning this Friday with Rosemary Menkens to meet many more wonderful Cleveland senior citizens. I also pay tribute to other key seniors in the Redlands: June Craven continues to raise much needed funds for the Cancer Council, 107-year-old Edith MacFarlane after whom a department of housing complex was named, 103-year-old Olive Webber who still performs at seniors concerts, Aunty Margaret and Uncle Pat Iselin of the Minjerribah North Stradbroke Island elders, to name but a few. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151758"></A>
I close by raising one issue that has put a slight damper on Seniors Week in the Redlands. For some reason, unbeknown to me and Redlands seniors, in 2009 and 2010 funding to Redlands seniors groups to run events during Seniors Week seems to have evaporated. I ask the minister to look into this and to provide some assistance.</Hansard-Body>

 (Everton--ALP) (10.23 pm): I rise to speak on something that has been very topical tonight, which is Seniors Week. Seniors often go unrecognised for the significant role that they play in shaping the generations that follow them. This week is Seniors Week, giving us a chance to acknowledge the special contribution that seniors make to our communities. In the electorate of Everton I have been delighted to be able to present the Everton Senior Heroes Awards for a second year to a group of very deserving community elders. I regularly meet with Everton seniors and in the past week I have celebrated Seniors Week with dozens more. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151764"></A>
This year 15 awards were given out to the Everton senior heroes. The five winners from the Albany Creek Aveo retirement village were Shirley Whittaker, for organising many trips for the residents at Aveo; Marilyn White, for her hard work organising functions and as a coordinator of the activities committee; Marilyn’s husband Tom White, for being able to help out with committee finances and resolving various organisational problems; Les Ambor, for the many hours he puts into the finance committee; and Elizabeth Eardley, for running the village library, which I was privileged to tour when I was at Aveo last week. Ann Cavallaro, while not a resident at Aveo, was also honoured for her religious education work in local schools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151765"></A>
Another nine winners received their awards at the Mitchelton and District Senior Citizens Club yesterday. They were Pat Stephenson, for her 18 years of service on the club management committee; Ann Howie and Nola Attwood, for teaching migrants conversational English for over 10 years; Beverley Bell, for her religious education teaching at Albany Creek State School since 1993; Colleen Chalk, for her service to Neighbourhood Watch Stafford; Allen Tomes, for his volunteer work with Reach Out Community and Family Care in Everton Park; Jan Neville, for her work with Mitchelton Meals on Wheels since 1997; Ian Turner, for his religious education teaching at Albany Hills State School and his service to the Knights of the Southern Cross; and Des Miles, for his 50 years of service to the local soccer community as a referee and referee coach. I congratulate all 15 Everton senior heroes and thank them for their contribution to our community. </Hansard-Body>

The Bligh government is helping seniors with many rebates and subsidies, including sizable increases to the rebates on electricity and water in this year’s state budget. In addition, this year we have released the Positively Ageless strategy, which outlines a range of new measures to help seniors. We are creating opportunities for grandparents who are raising grandchildren to have time out. We are highlighting the sad occurrence of elder abuse as a means of stamping it out. We are allocating funding to provide nutritional information for frail older people and service providers. We are assisting the University of the Third Age to provide online learning opportunities for seniors in regional Queensland. Through Positively Ageless, the Bligh government has a long-term strategy for Queensland seniors. From my experience with Everton seniors, this vision is very much a reality. I relish the opportunity to continue supporting the wonderful work of seniors in the electorate that I am honoured to represent. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr FOLEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maryborough--Ind) (10.26 pm): I rise to bring to the attention of the House a matter that is very concerning for people in my community. Firstly I would like to thank the police minister, Neil Roberts, for opening up a consultation period so that people can comment on the new draft weapons legislation. A number of people have written to me, including people who run laser skirmish venues. Such venues fill a great need in the community. For example, youth groups and various church groups run great team-building exercises and participate in physically demanding exercise at such places. Skirmish and paint ball games provide great exercise and teach people to think laterally. My friend Bob Davis, who runs Splat Attack at Susan River, is so committed to the community that he also runs a Hard Yakka program for kids who have become disconnected, which has been the subject of much debate in this House. Bob does a brilliant job. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151774"></A>
Tonight I will particularly zero in on the laser skirmish industry. When similar laws were enacted in New South Wales, the result was that players under 18 years were banned from playing laser skirmish and other laser tag games. Some operators were forced to work under positively draconian legislation. It is a very popular game for things such as birthday parties and team-building exercises. It is a multimillion dollar industry in the states. It is of concern that the proposed draft act has broadened the definition of ‘firearm’ from replica to imitation and does not differentiate between real firearms and toys. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151775"></A>
A number of sporting shooters have also written to me about this. I am a member of the Sporting Shooters Association, Wide Bay branch. I regularly participate in target shooting. It is a sport that is enjoyed by everyone from kids to mature-age participants. Target shooting is a fantastic sport for people with disabilities. People travel from all over Queensland to participate in sporting shooting events, which has a tremendously strong emphasis on safety and family participation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151777"></A>
I am a licensed pistol and rifle target shooter. There is a disconnect where people think that shooting must be bad. I remind members of this House that target shooting is an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport. An added burden of compliance has been put on shooters, and legitimate shooters do not deserve to be sacrificed and put in the same basket as people who work outside the law and completely flout the law. I commend the minister for opening this up for discussion. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr RYAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Morayfield--ALP) (10.29 pm): Recently I was pleased to attend the Narangba Valley State High School’s school musical <Hansard-Italic>
Beauty and the Beast</Hansard-Italic>
. All performers--whether they were singing or dancing on stage, playing instruments in the orchestra, or helping as a stagehand or sound and lighting technician--contributed to a brilliant production. I was certainly very impressed by the quality of the performances and the production generally, and I can say without any qualification that the standing ovation and multiple demands for an encore were not only genuine but also unanimous from members of the audience.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151829"></A>
Specifically, I would like to pay tribute to the lead performers--Nate Edwards, who played the beast, and Vivien Emsworth-Copland, who played Belle. Their performances were flawless and reinforce that they have bright futures in the dramatic arts. The live orchestra also is most deserving of particular praise. The orchestra was made up entirely of students and they were just brilliant. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151831"></A>
I also want to note the contributions of the people who designed and built an electronic red rose. I understand that teachers, students and parents came together to design an electronic red rose that automatically dropped its petals at key points during the performance. I commend those involved for this innovative work. It was the icing on the cake.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151832"></A>
Finally, I want to highlight the magnificent contribution to this production by the teaching staff. Mr John Coulson and his teaching staff are to be highly commended for their dedication and their vision. They should not underestimate the impact that their contribution has had on the young people of Narangba Valley High. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1151834"></A>
Well done to everyone at Narangba Valley High. I will certainly remember the day that <Hansard-Italic>

 was performed at your school. And I will certainly remember the day that you made me so proud of the public education system in Queensland. State schools are great schools, and Narangba Valley High certainly proved that on this day.</Hansard-Body>

While I am on my feet, I want to inform the House about some of the outstanding building projects underway at the Narangba Valley State High School and more broadly throughout the Morayfield state electorate. The federal Labor government has been very kind to schools and communities around Australia. Never before have we seen so much investment in educational infrastructure. At Narangba Valley High, a language centre is being built under the federal Labor government’s Building the Education Revolution program. This building project is not only supporting jobs in the local area but also delivering a critically important facility for the Narangba Valley community. However, if Tony Abbott and the LNP had their way, Narangba Valley High would never get a language centre. Moreover, if Tony Abbott and the LNP had their way, Morayfield State High School would never get a trade training centre or new science labs. If Tony Abbott and the LNP had their way, Caboolture Special School would never get a refurbished school hall. If Tony Abbott and the LNP had their way, Burpengary State School would never get new classrooms. </Hansard-Body>

I am proud of the schools in the Morayfield state electorate, and I will do everything I can to support them and their wonderfully talented staff and students. Sadly, Tony Abbott and the LNP want to hurt our schools and our students. How nasty, Mr Abbott. How nasty. <Hansard-Speech-End>
