Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, at the commencement of proceedings today I wish to acknowledge and highlight the plight of the people of Pakistan given the devastating floods that have ravaged the region. Pakistan of course is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and, along with Queensland, is a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. I have sent a message of concern and condolence to a member of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Assembly who is known to me. More than a month has passed since the rains commenced and the situation since then has only magnified and deteriorated. I urge honourable members to consider supporting the flood relief appeal effort through making a donation if they have not had the opportunity to do so already. The floods are one of the worst natural disasters on record. Suffering is immense. The number for the UNICEF Pakistan Flood Emergency Appeal is 1300884233. There are many other aid agencies involved in the flood crisis, and I commend all of those to honourable members. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, I wish to inform the House that I have engaged senior counsel to advise me and settle correspondence in relation to a matter of parliamentary privilege. The matter arises from an apparent attempt to force a member to reveal information or documents the member has acquired and used in the course of, or for the purposes of or incidental to, transacting business of the Legislative Assembly. It is not appropriate that I detail information beyond this advice given the matter is now sub judice. However, I believe it is appropriate that I advise the House when acting as the guardian of the privileges of the House, its committees and its members.</Hansard-Body>

Afghanistan, Death of Soldiers</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.34 am): It is with great sorrow that I again rise in this House to pay tribute to three fine Australian soldiers from the Brisbane based 6th Battalion at Enoggera who have tragically lost their lives while serving in Afghanistan. The thoughts of all Queenslanders and all members of this House are with the families, friends and colleagues of these brave young diggers who died fighting for peace in the war on terror. On Friday, 20 August Private Tomas Dale and Private Grant Kirby were killed and two other Australian soldiers were wounded during an operation in the Baluchi Valley. Sadly, just four days later as the Royal Australian Army members in Tarin Kot were farewelling Private Kirby and Private Dale, their colleague Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney was killed in action whilst on patrol.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130031"></A>
Private Kirby was born in Nambour in 1975 and is the father of two young daughters. His family are extremely proud of him, as are all Australians. Private Dale was born in the United Kingdom in 1989 and immigrated to Australia with his family in 2003. He lived in Adelaide before joining the Australian Defence Force in 2007. This was Private Dale’s first operational deployment with the Australian defence service and he leaves behind his loving parents, David and Karen, and two brothers. Lance Corporal MacKinney was a loving husband to his wife, Beckie, who we all know is expecting their second child in the coming weeks. He was a devoted father to his daughter Annabell. The deaths of these three soldiers is a tragic reminder of the dangerous and courageous work that our Defence Force members undertake in the service of their country and ourselves as citizens every day.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130032"></A>
Today I wanted to acknowledge the friends and members of the Brisbane based 6th Battalion. These people have been selling wristbands in memory of their fallen colleagues. Thousands of bands have already been sold and around $15,000 has been raised. In acknowledgement of this worthy cause, our government is donating $15,000 in matching funds to their effort, and we are working with the organisers to ensure that the next round of the bands can be made available to electorate offices to distribute to the public.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130033"></A>
I think we would all agree that it will mean a lot to those who have lost a loved one and a lot to those who have a loved one still serving to see this show of care and support across the broader community. I will advise electorate officers when the wristbands are available. All money raised from this effort will go towards supporting the families, the wives, the daughters and the sons of those 6RAR soldiers who have been killed or wounded in Afghanistan, including Privates Kirby and Dale and Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney. On behalf of the House, I extend our deepest sympathy to the family, to the friends and to the colleagues of these three fine young soldiers and I again pay tribute to our troops, who continue to carry on with the job at hand with absolute professionalism, true Aussie grit and determination that continues to inspire us all. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.38 am): Mr Speaker, I join with you in commenting on the terrible disaster that is afflicting the Commonwealth nation of Pakistan. The images that we have seen emerge from flood-ravaged Pakistan have been nothing short of horrific. This is a crisis of unimaginable proportions impacting on the lives of millions of people. Latest estimates are that more than 17 million have been affected, more than six million dependent on emergency food supplies and more than four million homeless. Reports this week said that one-fifth of the country had been engulfed and a million people have been displaced over the past few days alone as the flooding shifts south. Like other natural disasters of great magnitude, the floods have been deadly and indiscriminate. Young and old alike have been cut off and isolated without the basics of food, water and shelter. The threat of deadly disease hangs in the air, and right now just surviving is the biggest challenge. Thousands of children have become orphans.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130036"></A>
Queenslanders have always dug deep and they have been incredibly supportive and compassionate when others are in need. Of course, many Queenslanders also understand the awesome power of rivers in flood and how they can destroy lives. Last week, as part of the international aid response, the Queensland government, on behalf of all Queenslanders, pledged $500,000 to the Australian Red Cross. The Australian Red Cross will use these funds to provide medical treatment, shelter, food and clean water to flood victims. I can also inform the House today that a senior medical officer from Cairns Base Hospital, Dr Mark Little, is also ready to be deployed as part of the relief effort. Dr Little will be part of the Australian aid effort coordinated by the federal government to provide much needed medical care to flood victims. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130037"></A>
These are the worst floods to hit Pakistan in four decades. There is a very long road to recovery ahead and the immediate challenges, such as overcoming disease outbreaks and providing basics such as clean food and water, are immense. Our hearts go out to the people of Pakistan at this terrible time and we stand ready to offer further additional assistance as part of the Australian relief effort in Pakistan. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.40 am): Today, I am very pleased to join with the Minister for Transport in setting out plans for a rail revolution in South-East Queensland, with the Cross River Rail project as the linchpin of a world-class rail network. South-East Queensland’s passenger rail capacity under the plan will nearly triple by 2031 under our $123 billion transport blueprint. <Hansard-Italic>
Connecting SEQ 2031: An integrated regional transport plan for South East Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
 maps a clear way forward for transport in our region. This plan is a clear statement of intent by a government with a clear vision for the future. The next 20 years will see a concentration on new railways and new services to manage growth in South-East Queensland. This rail revolution is the next stage of our journey towards a world-class public transport system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130040"></A>
It was in 1997 when a slightly more youthful member for Gregory, as the then minister for transport, laid out a vision under the previous integrated regional transport plan and that vision included the building of a dedicated busway system in South-East Queensland. At that time there was not a single kilometre of dedicated busway. Today, as a result of that plan, we have 24 kilometres of busways in Brisbane--more than any other city in Australia and more under construction right now. Like its predecessor, this new plan is visionary, but the experience of our first integrated regional transport plan shows that, when you have a clear plan for the future, you can make it happen. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130041"></A>
This government has a strong record when it comes to delivering infrastructure and Queenslanders can see the evidence with their own eyes. They can look and see the South East Busway, they can catch a bus on the Northern Busway and they can walk or cycle over one of our pedestrian bridges. Queenslanders can see the Helensvale to Robina rail duplication, they can travel on the new rail line to our airports and they know all about the extension of the Gold Coast rail line to Varsity Lakes. They also can see the new Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges making a huge difference to the road network. They know about the Ted Smout Memorial Bridge and they have driven on the Tugun bypass and they have cycled the bikeways of South-East Queensland. They can undertake all of this travel with their go card, which has been recognised as the best integrated ticketing system in Australia and one of the best in the world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130042"></A>
In the face of doubt and cynicism, we set about delivering the plan that was outlined in 1997 and we will be just as focused on delivering the plan that we have outlined today. The 20-year blueprint maps out 207 kilometres of new railway lines, stretching our network to new suburbs and towns. It means that we will build a 15-kilometre rail line from Alderley to Strathpine, using the predominantly government owned north-west transport corridor. It means we will take rail further than ever before, with line extensions to Maroochydore, Coolangatta, Moreton Bay, Springfield, Ripley and Flagstone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130043"></A>
The Gold Coast Rapid Transit project on the Gold Coast will be extended 40 kilometres from Helensvale to Coolangatta and there will be an eight-kilometre Brisbane subway from Toowong to West End, to Newstead and to Bowen Hills with extensions to Hamilton Northshore, the airport village and Bulimba all possible in the longer term. Our plan also outlines revolutionary new services, including a new service to be known as UrbanLink, which will have more frequent services and higher capacity trains operating inbound of Darra, Strathpine, Loganlea, Ferny Grove, Manly, Springfield, Shorncliffe and the airport. A further service, ExpressLink, will have high-speed express services from Ipswich, Cleveland, Ormeau and Caboolture and CoastLink will link the capital city here with the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast, with high-speed European-style trains set to cut travel time by up to 30 minutes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130044"></A>
The Cross River Rail project, now the subject of a $25 million feasibility study, is a vital linchpin for the future of rail travel here. The Cross River Rail will transform South-East Queensland’s rail network by providing essential capacity at the core of the network that could double the number of train services from the suburbs to the city. It will allow us to provide higher frequency and improved reliability on all lines, making it possible for the rail network to move up to 240,000 people into and across the city during the two-hour morning peak, compared to the current 54,000. That is almost five times the current capacity. That is what is necessary if we are to achieve our vision of a world-class public transport system. The subway system that we flagged in November last year will support the overall rail revolution, helping to move commuters and enabling the city centre to be a place for people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130045"></A>
A fully loaded suburban train carries more than 700 people, taking about 600 cars off the road. That is equal to a line of cars stretching more than four kilometres. With a rail revolution, we can increase that capacity by deploying new trains that can carry more than 1,000 people each. Under this plan, our numbers of three-car trains would increase from 200 now up to 400 by 2031. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130046"></A>
Our 20-year transport plan also includes ambitious targets for cycling in South-East Queensland, which includes a 3,000 kilometre network of cycleway by 2031, including new bikeways and walkways within a five-kilometre radius of major urban centres. There are plans to remove heavy vehicles from suburban roads and to provide a better system around Brisbane to navigate, including the new north-south tunnel connection between Toowong and Everton Park. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130047"></A>
We will, of course, continue to build our successful busway network, with the construction of the Northern and Eastern busways to Bracken Ridge and Capalaba. There will be major freight investment to support the economy, including the full development of the Acacia Ridge freight terminal and a dedicated dual-gauge freight line from Acacia Ridge to the Port of Brisbane in the existing rail corridor. We will also introduce new technology to better manage road and public transport movements, such as information on travel options, real-time management of motorway flows and improved railway signalling. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130048"></A>
This plan is a bold and visionary blueprint. It lays out a vision for better connected communities across South-East Queensland, where people can move with more ease between work, school, recreation and home. The plan will no doubt be met with cynicism by some. Great visions often are. But the simple truth is that we cannot make progress without a plan and our record speaks loudly and clearly of a government that delivers on its plans. This plan is underpinned by a single-minded determination, a clarity of purpose and the financial ability to rise to the funding challenge. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130049"></A>
Our economic strategy has been the subject of renewed debate in the past week, and I welcome that. Few things could demonstrate the need for Queensland to restructure its finances more than the need for better transport options in communities right across Queensland. Here in South-East Queensland, population growth demands that we make the decisions necessary to build a stronger, better passenger transport system. That is why we have a clear economic strategy and our strategy is to invest in jobs and every one of these projects will be a job creator. Our strategy is to invest in skills and our new skill programs will equip people to drive these projects and our strategy includes the sale of some commercial assets, which will be better served by private investment so that we and future governments can invest in new transport assets such as those outlined in this plan today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130050"></A>
With this economic plan, we make clear choices and we unashamedly choose to invest in a modern public transport system that delivers to people, that delivers what Queenslanders need and, frankly, that delivers what Queenslanders deserve. We choose to put the Queensland taxpayer first by delivering better services for them and their families. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130051"></A>
As many would know, this integrated regional transport plan has been the subject of a lot of work, in particular over the last 18 months. Consultation on the plan is now open. It is important that everyone has their say. I encourage all members who represent constituents right across the south-east to get involved. It is about our future; it is about the future of our families and the next generation of Queenslanders. I encourage people to get on the website, to get a copy and to give us some feedback. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.50 am): The Bligh government has a strong economic plan to invest in infrastructure and secure jobs for Queensland. We have the largest health infrastructure program--worth $7.33 billion--ever undertaken in the nation. The only state that comes near us is New South Wales at just over $2 billion. Over the life of this program we will deliver on more than 200 infrastructure projects that will build and expand hospitals and services from the Torres Strait to the Tweed and west to Mount Isa. It will secure close to 40,000 local construction jobs. In just 17 months--since April 2009--it has secured more than 7,580 construction jobs across the state. That is more than 7,580 Queenslanders who could wake up every day knowing they had a job to go to in one of the toughest economic times on record, knowing they had a job because we made tough choices in order to deliver a strong economic plan and knowing we would stick to it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130054"></A>
What is more, our $7.33 billion health infrastructure program will deliver more health services for Queenslanders. For example, it will deliver linear accelerators for the first time at the Gold Coast, Cairns, Rockhampton and the Sunshine Coast; additional linear accelerators at the Princess Alexandra Hospital and Townsville; and expanded cancer services at Hervey Bay, Bundaberg and Toowoomba. That means more cancer treatments for patients closer to their home. In Rockhampton, for example, when complete the new cancer centre will mean around 760 patients each year will no longer have to travel outside the district for cancer treatment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130055"></A>
In April this year I announced a $600 million investment to ramp up services, infrastructure and skills ahead of the Sunshine Coast University Hospital opening to deliver specialist services sooner than even the original date for the hospital. This includes a cardiac catheterisation laboratory, a vascular procedural suite and a new dedicated endoscopy procedural unit, outpatient neurosurgery and sustainable oncology services at Nambour Hospital. Just last month I announced that the new 96-bed ward block would be open for business a good three months ahead of schedule in early October.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130056"></A>
Queensland was hit hard by the global financial crisis but we were determined to keep our foot on the accelerator in terms of our health building program. That is because we believe in public health care. We believe Queenslanders deserve more hospitals, more beds, more doctors, nurses and allied health professionals and more health services. The $150 million Nambour ward block directly secured more than 600 local construction jobs over the life of the project, with more than 200 workers on site every single day as construction peaked. Last Saturday at a special open day, Sunshine Coast locals got their first look at the new Nambour block ahead of its opening to patients. In addition to 96 extra beds, the new block will house new outpatient and antenatal clinics, a new special-care nursery, a new paediatric ward and allied health therapy rooms, as well as patient lounges on every one of its four floors. What is more, the new block also contains dedicated education and teaching facilities. This expanded capacity is great news for residents of the Sunshine Coast.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130057"></A>
But what is more, because we did not take our foot off the accelerator, because we continued full steam ahead with our infrastructure projects, because we made tough decisions, not only are we delivering more health services for patients on the Sunshine Coast but also we are delivering them sooner. Also gearing up to take its first patients in September is the expanded Bundaberg emergency department. The second stage of the $45 million Bundaberg Hospital expansion will more than double the number of ED treatment spaces to 32, up from 13, and deliver an additional 14 short-stay beds, up from six, and a dedicated paediatric waiting area. Stages 3 and 4 will see the expansion of mental health and allied health services, as well as an extra 40 medical and rehabilitation beds.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130058"></A>
We on this side of the House believe that we should be investing in vital public infrastructure and services such as health, education, transport and roads. That is why we made tough choices to deliver a strong economic plan that is building the health infrastructure for Queensland’s future and, importantly, for the future of regional Queensland. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.54 am): The Queensland economic recovery is underway, but it does require further commitment and further work. It is not yet completely broad based and fully self-sustaining. It is sectoral and it is still relying, in part, on public investment. However, private sector capital expenditure data released last week was above the performance nationally, with a very strong result in business investing in machinery and equipment--up 48 per cent, in fact. That same release from the ABS said that business looked confidently to the 12 months ahead. The NAB report last week again pointed to the positive effect of our building program in highlighting the challenges our economic recovery faces. I expect tomorrow’s national accounts to tell a similar story. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130061"></A>
During this time of economic uncertainty, we went to the people of Queensland promising a government focused on jobs. Above all else we said that our priority was jobs: protecting them, creating them, protecting Queenslanders and their families and creating jobs for Queenslanders. We were faced with difficult decisions to keep the focus on jobs, to focus on the Labor priority of providing the dignity of work for Queenslanders, as we faced up to the ravages of the global financial crisis. We said that we were for jobs, not cuts. The alternative proposed was across-the-board cuts to jobs--12,000 of them--to schools, to hospitals, to the services that Queenslanders rely upon. In contrast, this government is delivering jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130062"></A>
There has been 12 straight months of jobs growth. For four months in a row we were right out in front, leading the nation on jobs growth. In recent weeks we have announced more businesses voting with their feet to set up shop and take a stake in the future of the Queensland economy. We are more than halfway through our commitment of 3,000 people getting a chance through the Green Army initiative. We are ahead of target, ahead of schedule. We are more than halfway past our target of generating 100,000 net new jobs across this term. Again, we are not yet halfway through the term of this parliament. Our building program--the choice we made to build, not stop, to fund new infrastructure by divesting some commercial infrastructure--is sustaining more than 100,000 jobs across the Queensland economy. On building sites around this state, in particular in regional centres around this state, thousands of workers, contractors, tradies and their families are in a job today and that is no accident. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130063"></A>
We made our choices. Our choices were clear. The choice today remains clear. To choose the alternative would be to devastate the Queensland economy and devastate thousands upon thousands of Queensland families by consigning them to the indignity and misery of unemployment. We have made our choice as a government and it is a choice that we stand by. We are resolved as a government, as a team, to continue. Our eyes are firmly on Queenslanders whose daily livelihoods are at stake. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130064"></A>
Our strategy is delivering; it is delivering jobs just like we said it would. But now is not the time to coast and it is not the time to engage in recovery-killing capital works freezes like those opposite so callously suggest. Of course there are challenges--as ever. There always has been, even in times of plenty. Those challenges are the ones that we confront today. We confront them today as a Labor government with a single focus on jobs, on the prospects of the young unemployed struggling to break in and get their first job, on the livelihoods of Queensland families and, above all else, the reality that we said we stood for jobs, not cuts, and that is exactly what we are going to deliver. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.57 am): The Queensland government has already committed $556 million through to 2026 for the development of cycle routes under the South-East Queensland Principal Cycle Network Plan. But we are not stopping at that. South-East Queensland’s growing bikeway network is set to expand even further under the Queensland government’s 20-year Integrated Regional Transport Plan set to be released shortly by the Premier. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130067"></A>
The active transport section of the plan contains ambitious targets for cycling in South-East Queensland, including 3,000 kilometres of cycleway by 2031. The plan outlines walking and cycling paths within five kilometres of major activity centres, for example the Logan Hyperdome, and within two kilometres of local schools and universities. It also includes end-of-trip facilities like bike storage, showers and lockers in public transport centres and new buildings similar to the existing facilities at King George Square and the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital. The plan will see trials of green pods at select rail stations. These green pods are end-of-trip facilities for up to 28 cyclists all in an area the size of a single car-parking space. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130068"></A>
This plan is about getting more people out of cars and onto bikes. If we give cyclists a network of connected bike and walking paths, separated from busy roads, I firmly believe that people will choose to cycle more often.  Currently, only 10 per cent of the 9.2 million trips South-East Queensland residents are taking each day are by walking or by riding a bike. We want to double the share of walking or cycling trips from 10 per cent of all trips to 20 per cent over the next 20 years. Our government’s integrated plan will help us reach this target. Here in South-East Queensland, nearly 90 per cent of us live within five kilometres of a major business or employment centre and half of all of our car trips are for journeys of five kilometres or less. It takes only 15 to 20 minutes to cycle five kilometres. Compared to driving, battling traffic and finding a car park, cycling for those short trips is a really viable alternative. That is why we are working on a strategy to get more South-East Queenslanders on their bikes and off the roads. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (10.00 am): By supporting the Queensland construction industry through the global financial crisis and its aftermath, this government has saved thousands of building workers’ jobs. We are spending over $17 billion to build infrastructure such as hospitals, roads and schools and are creating over 100,000 jobs in the process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130071"></A>
The home building industry has been hit particularly hard by the GFC and home builders have been put under extreme pressure. Unfortunately, some builders have cut corners or have gone out of business, leaving homeowners in the lurch. Their home is usually the largest investment that most people ever make. This government will not tolerate builders who do the wrong thing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130072"></A>
We are protecting homeowners during these difficult financial times. In the 2009-10 financial year, the government’s Building Services Authority paid out a record $42 million in claims under the Home Warranty Scheme. This $42 million was a 50 per cent increase on the $28.5 million in claims paid last year. In other words, it doubled in the space of a year. In 2007-08 the BSA approved $32.4 million and $26 million in 2006-07. That serves to illustrate just how significant the payouts are this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130073"></A>
Our record $42 million allowed the homes of 1,705 Queensland families to be repaired or completed, thanks to our unique Home Warranty Scheme, which is the best government home warranty scheme in the world as far as I know. These families would have struggled without the very strong consumer protections put in place by Labor governments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130074"></A>
Last year, the Home Warranty Scheme paid out an average of $10,700 on each defects claim, $38,000 on each non-completion claim and $24,700 on each subsidence claim. Honourable members should think about the effect that has on ordinary Queenslanders’ lives who are struggling to pay for a home. Suddenly their home is not completed and the BSA insurance makes up the difference. Just imagine the turmoil out there in Queensland if 1,705 Queenslanders could not move into their homes because they had not been completed and they could not afford to have them finished. If the LNP cuts the number of Queensland building projects, as it admitted it would do last Friday, I expect many more problems in home building and a further big rise in claims from homeowners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130075"></A>
I also would like to highlight a case brought by the BSA in the Mackay Magistrates Court on 20 August. A builder who failed to rectify work in accordance with directions issued by the BSA was ordered to pay $70,000 and meet the BSA’s legal costs or face six months imprisonment. So much for the tag that some members of this House would give the BSA of being a toothless tiger. I congratulate the court on strongly backing the BSA and consumers.</Hansard-Body>

Strategic Cropping Land</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (10.04 am): Last week the Queensland government announced a new policy framework for the long-term protection of Queensland’s best cropping land. This land, known as strategic cropping land, is the best of the best. More importantly, it is a finite resource. The Bligh government understands this and that is why it must be managed and conserved for long-term food production.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130079"></A>
Currently, Queensland’s best cropping land is increasingly subject to a range of competing land uses including agriculture, mining and urban development. This new framework is essential for striking a balance between these competing interests as the Bligh government continues to build tomorrow’s Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130080"></A>
I am pleased to note that the new policy framework has been well received by organisations such as the Queensland Farmers Federation, AgForce and FutureFood Queensland, who have all gone public in their praise of the policy framework. As of Monday--a week since the launch of the policy--the strategic cropping land content on the Department of Environment and Resource Management’s website had received almost 2,000 visitors. The policy framework document itself has been downloaded 679 times. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130081"></A>
The Bligh government has engaged in extensive consultation in developing the new framework, with nearly 400 submissions received on a consultation paper released in February. In addition, key stakeholders from the agricultural, development and resources sectors have been extensively consulted through a stakeholder advisory committee. As part of the new framework, the government will develop a new act to be introduced in early 2011. The new act will establish definitive strategic cropping land trigger maps and will outline the criteria for validating whether land is strategic cropping land. This process of assessment will be conducted state-wide and will apply to both resources and urban development proposals.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130082"></A>
Resource developments will only proceed if they can demonstrate that the land can be restored to its previous cropping capability at the completion of a project. If there is evidence that a development will permanently alienate strategic cropping land, it will not gain approval to proceed. Strategic cropping land will also need to be considered when land is designated for urban development. Urban developments on strategic cropping land will be subject to the same standard of assessment as resource developments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130083"></A>
The government will continue to work with key stakeholders from the agricultural, development and resources sectors over the coming months to further refine the framework and develop the new act. The deadline for public comment on the strategic cropping land policy framework is 30 September. I urge all interested parties to take the opportunity to register their views. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. GJ WILSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (10.06 am): The Bligh government is giving all Queensland students a flying start to learning and life. As we sit here today, more than 30,000 year 12 students are undertaking the Queensland core skills--QCS--test in world-class education facilities delivered by a Labor government. I know I speak on behalf of all members in wishing students across Queensland the best of luck for the two-day exam. I have a 17-year-old sitting for the exam. As a parent, I have a close familiarity with the challenges of this two-day period. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130086"></A>
The QCS will assess the broad range of skills that students have developed during that schooling. Student results will contribute to the calculation of overall positions and field positions for tertiary entrance. Although sitting for tests can be stressful, I am confident that our year 12 students will do well, and I wish them all the very best. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130087"></A>
This is a major step on the road to giving these students a flying start to learning and life. The QCS is an important part of learning, but it is not the only option for students in our schools. Queensland has 45 per cent of Australia’s school based apprentices--the highest in the country. Much of this is thanks to the Labor government’s investment in school trade training centres, which the Liberal National Party proposes to cut. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130088"></A>
The state government recently undertook the Next Step Survey to look at what year 12 graduates from 2009 were doing six months after completing their year 12 studies. Almost nine in 10 were studying or in paid employment, six in 10 continued in education or training and more than one-third were enrolled in a university degree course. Approximately one-quarter were doing vocational study including apprenticeships and traineeships. Overall, the trend continues to improve. This shows that Queensland students are using the flying start they have received from their schools to find work and study. As Queensland education minister, I am proud of every young Queenslander, no matter whether they have decided to study or to work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130089"></A>
Unlike the member for Surfers Paradise and the Liberal National Party, the Bligh government has a plan for making major improvements to the Queensland education system. The Queensland Labor government has a strong leader, supported by a united team, working to give every young Queenslander a flying start in learning and life. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 Last week, the Commissioner of Police took decisive action to address concerns about the alleged behaviour and misconduct of some police on the Gold Coast. The commissioner announced a range of initiatives that will strengthen supervision and tighten existing policies in a range of areas. Significant and immediate reforms will include the upgrade of the OIC position in the Surfers Paradise division to the level of inspector, with an evaluation to identify whether upgrades are required at other similar sized establishments across the state; doubling the number of front-line district duty officers on the coast from five to 10; appointing two additional professional practice managers to focus on ethical standards and practices; a new policy on the use of police vehicles to address claims of inappropriate usage; and a state-wide review of recruitment policies and procedures. While these initiatives are clearly focused on addressing identified concerns on the Gold Coast, they are also about supporting the overwhelming majority of honest and decent police whose reputations can be tarnished by the actions of a few. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130098"></A>
As part of Operation Tesco, the Crime and Misconduct Commission has announced that it will be conducting public hearings on the Gold Coast in September. The government and the Police Service will consider other policy changes as required and recommended by the CMC following the release of its report. The Police Service of today is worlds apart from that which existed in the pre-Fitzgerald era. The Queensland Police Service of today is characterised by a commitment to professionalism and ethical standards, and also a powerful and growing culture of intolerance towards inappropriate behaviour and towards those who do not accept the high standards expected and required. Therefore, it is no surprise that around one-quarter of all complaints now lodged about inappropriate behaviour are made by police against police.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130099"></A>
Other initiatives announced by the commissioner include the development of new policies on inappropriate associations and gratuities; enhanced training programs for supervisors; and enhanced recognition of good work, leadership, professional and ethical practice and consistent performance. Queenslanders, quite rightly, expect high standards from their police officers. The government stands by the commissioner in his actions to restore public confidence and not let the actions of a few tarnish the reputation and morale of the overwhelming majority of police who are doing the right thing. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PJ LAWLOR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southport--ALP) (Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading) (10.12 am): The Bligh government has said ‘enough is enough’ to alcohol related violence. We want to see an environment where people can go out, have a good time and return home safely. That is why we are declaring special Drink Safe precincts under a $4.2 million plan in Fortitude Valley, Townsville and Surfers Paradise. The Drink Safe precincts will have increased police numbers, better supervised taxi zones, more support services and the creation of special safe zones. We will also legislate for new powers to ban troublemakers from these areas. The use of ID scanners by clubs will also be supported under the plan. In the area of transport, the Drink Safe precincts will feature better access to bus and train information, and the opening hours of the Fortitude Valley Railway Station will be extended. In the health area, we will introduce new legislation to ensure fresh drinking water is provided free to patrons in pubs and clubs. The existing lockout laws will stay in place to provide certainty to both licensees and patrons, and also give the new measures a chance to work.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130102"></A>
This is a trial. We will assess what worked and what did not, and if trading hours need to change then that could be back on the table. Unfortunately, there are those who are criticising from the sidelines before the trials have even started. Meanwhile, the Bligh government is committing $4.2 million to make this work and bring about a safer environment. These measures are long term, community based and holistic and will be continuously monitored. None of the measures will be a quick fix and will need the support of the community, industry and government to be effective. It will take time to inspire change in a problematic drinking culture. This is not only an issue for Queensland but also an issue for Australia. However, I am confident that if government and community work together we can achieve our goal such that people can go out, have a good time and return home safely. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. TS MULHERIN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland) (10.14 am): Today I am pleased to announce that five projects promoting regional economic development in key regional areas will receive combined funding of nearly half a million dollars. As part of the Queensland Regional Development Initiative, projects in Mackay/Whitsundays, Wide Bay/Burnett, Darling Downs/Surat and South-West Queensland will receive $435,000. The funding is part of $7.52 million of funding over the next four years to support regional economic development projects. Funding for projects was increased in this year’s budget by $1.26 million for the four-year life of the program. The increased funding is another example of the Bligh government’s commitment to growth in regional and rural Queensland and to making our regions attractive places for Queenslanders to live, work and raise families. QRDI provides funds to regional development organisations to deliver key projects such as developing skilled labour, creating job opportunities and promoting a region as an attractive place to live for both residents and new workers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130105"></A>
In this round of funding, Enterprise Whitsundays will receive $100,000 for its capitalising on the horticulture industry project, which is very timely following the catastrophic seedling poisoning that recently devastated vegetable crops in Bowen. The Mackay Whitsunday Regional Economic Development Corporation has been granted $65,000 for its green industry diversification project and $55,000 for the retail skills attraction strategy. The Burnett Inland Economic Development Organisation has been allocated $115,000 towards its clean and clever Burnett inland project. The south-west regional economic development remote area development organisation will receive $100,000 to identify and brand the region as the home of the natural sciences. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130106"></A>
QRDI has encouraged economic growth, generated jobs and supported local business in Queensland since 2005. Through regional partnerships and programs like QRDI, over the next 18 months the Bligh government will work with stakeholders on population and prosperity led strategies for boosting the liveability, sustainability and economic viability of our regions. This is another initiative promoting business and population movements to regional Queensland.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (10.18 am): On 1 January this year, a range of new State Penalties Enforcement Registry enforcement powers came into effect, giving SPER expanded options to recover unpaid fines from individuals who refuse to meet their obligations. Introduced by the Bligh government and supported by all sides of this House, these powers included a wheel-clamping trial and the expansion of driver licence suspensions to non-motor vehicle related offences. The broadening of driver licence suspensions is proving to be an effective tool in collecting unpaid fines for a wide range of matters, including court ordered fines for drug or break-and-enter offences or to recover compensation for offences such as assaults. The funds that SPER is collecting are being used to assist all Queenslanders to pay for roads, schools and hospitals and to hire extra teachers, nurses and police.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

However, in the past eight months it has also become clear that some fine defaulters are still struggling to appreciate that they have an obligation to pay their outstanding fines or risk further sanctions. Responsible Queenslanders view driving as a privilege, not an entitlement, and they meet their obligations to society by paying their fines on time and keeping their address up to date, as they are obliged to do by law. Yet there remain some people who are not prepared to meet these basic obligations, even with the express threat of licence suspension hanging over their heads and even after being sent at least four notices. Losing your licence is a tough penalty, but it is a penalty that this government and every member of this parliament have agreed must be available as a sanction for those individuals who continue to purposely avoid meeting their obligations. It takes only one phone call, one letter, one email or one visit to enter into compliance. It is not a difficult hurdle to clear to retain one’s privilege to drive.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132373"></A>
There is no doubt that the new measures are having an effect. A record $166.4 million was collected by SPER last financial year. The expanded driver licence suspension provisions have contributed to this, as have the new wheel-clamping and seizure-and-sale provisions. As at last week, SPER had 38,878 driver licence suspensions in place, with only about one-third of these for non-motor vehicle related offences. Getting a suspension lifted is easy: just pay your fine or enter into a payment instalment plan and SPER will lift your suspension the same day. During 2009-10, almost 40,000 suspensions were lifted as a result of debtors paying their fines or making arrangements to pay them off in instalments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132379"></A>
As I mentioned earlier, these new driver licence suspension provisions took effect at the same time as our 12-month trial of wheel clamping for high-value fine defaulters. Both of these enforcement mechanisms will be reviewed early next year as part of our ongoing commitment to continually improving the SPER system. We want this system to be fair and we are happy to evaluate the effectiveness of the new enforcement powers to ensure they are operating effectively and fairly. Nevertheless, I also want to reassert the government’s determination to continue its pursuit of fine defaulters. If you simply refuse to pay or avoid paying an outstanding fine, you face the risk of tougher penalties. However, with one call to SPER on 1300365635 these tougher sanctions can be easily avoided.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. KL STRUTHERS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Algester--ALP) (Minister for Community Services and Housing and Minister for Women) (10.21 am): The Bligh government is a job creator, building a better future for all Queenslanders. In my portfolio, that means creating more than 3,500 construction jobs around Queensland through our social housing rollout in 2010. It means getting on with the job of building more than 3,000 new social housing dwellings by the end of this year across the state. It means a record investment in housing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130115"></A>
Just last week in Cairns I met face to face with 15 mayors from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to plan the next stage of the housing rollout in their communities. During the current financial year, we plan to deliver 120 new homes and 444 upgrades to these Indigenous communities using $95 million in funding from the Bligh government. This comes on top of our $1.1 billion 10-year partnership with the federal Labor government which will deliver 1,200 new homes over the next 10 years. That means that this year alone we will deliver 67 new houses and 454 upgrades. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130116"></A>
A key feature of the investment is that at least 20 per cent of the labour used to deliver the homes must be Indigenous labour. I know that the member for Cook, Jason O’Brien, is absolutely committed to creating jobs on the cape. He will be pleased to know that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workers are taking up the opportunities on offer through 243 projects that are currently underway.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130117"></A>
That workforce includes 14 Indigenous employees working and earning on projects in Woorabinda, 30 Indigenous employees working and earning in projects in Hope Vale, 14 Indigenous employees working and earning in projects on Palm Island, 22 Indigenous employees working and earning on projects in Wujal Wujal, and every other community has a positive story to tell. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130118"></A>
The Bligh government is committed to closing the gap on Indigenous disadvantage. One of the best ways we can do that is to deliver more housing and that is what we are doing. The opposition treasury spokesman has confirmed that the LNP would ‘reassess’ building and infrastructure projects like our housing rollout. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. A PALASZCZUK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Inala--ALP) (Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs) (10.24 am): According to the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health, 72 per cent of young women aged between 18 and 22 years want to weigh less and only 25 per cent of those in the healthy weight range are happy with their current weight. The 2005 National Health Survey reported that nine per cent of females aged 18 to 24 years were classified as underweight. A 2006 survey of young people by Mission Australia found that body image was a significant concern for close to 30 per cent of young Australians both male and female.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130124"></A>
Frankly, these statistics are staggering. When it comes to body image many Queensland women struggle with self-esteem issues and feel growing pressure to be thin. Images of rake thin, airbrushed models do nothing to help our young women chart the often difficult journey through adolescence. The Bligh government wants young Queensland women to start feeling good about themselves. We want young women to enter adulthood confident and determined to achieve their best--not to be held back by concerns about how they look. I am pleased to announce today two important projects to help our young women develop a healthy body image and positive self-esteem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130125"></A>
The Eating Disorders Association will receive $100,000 to undertake research to reach out to families and young people affected by an eating disorder and provide them with information and support about services available, how to deal with young people and body image, how to promote healthy eating and how to deal with self-esteem issues experienced by young people with eating disorders. The Minister for Health and I have contributed $50,000 each to this project. This will complement the $223,000 in recurrent funding that the organisation will receive from the Department of Communities for 2010-11. We want to ensure that Queenslanders suffering from eating disorders receive the best treatment possible. But to do that we need to ensure that we have proof that we are channelling our funding into the right area. We are determined to do more. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130126"></A>
Today I am pleased to announce that we will also give $29,000 to Isis--the Eating Issues Centre to offer a series of workshops aimed at schoolchildren and community groups promoting healthy eating, body image and self-esteem. This initiative will give young people the support they need to seek help early in the hope of preventing hospitalisation for an eating disorder. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130127"></A>
The mental health of Queenslanders is an issue that the Bligh government is working very hard to address. We need to act early to stop these young people entering our hospitals. We want to give them the support that they need, we need to help them with their self-esteem and we need to ensure that they do get the very best start in life. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. KJ JONES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ashgrove--ALP) (Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability) (10.26 am): This government has a proud track record when it comes to protecting the environment. Queensland has the most unique biodiversity in the world and we are committed to ensuring that it is protected now and into the future. That is why we have a plan to increase the area of national parks to 7.5 per cent of the state by 2020. I am proud to advise the House that we are continuing to deliver on this plan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130130"></A>
Our government has created 17 new national parks and expanded a further 20 across this state in the past 12 months. That is more than 79,500 hectares added to our national parks in just 12 months. From Cape York to the Gold Coast, pristine land of the highest biodiversity values has been protected. The gazettal of the 7,700 hectares Humboldt National Park in Central Queensland last year preserved a number of important, endangered regional ecosystems. In June we created more than 7,600 hectares of new national park in North and Far North Queensland. That included more than 5,000 hectares of important cassowary habitat in the new Macalister Range National Park, north-west of Cairns. Also in June, the iconic Glass House Mountains National Park--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130133"></A>
The total area of national parks in Queensland now stands at more than 8.1 million hectares. That is more than double the combined areas of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra. But we are not stopping there. This state government’s commitment to environmental protection is as strong as ever. Just recently we announced that sandmining on North Stradbroke Island will be phased out and that 80 per cent of the island will be transitioned to national park. Mr Speaker, you would not get this kind of protection for Queensland’s unique biodiversity under an LNP government. The LNP are divided over the future of North Straddie, they oppose the expansion of our national parks, they oppose the protection of the Great Barrier Reef and Moreton Bay. While we protect, they destroy. </Hansard-Body>

“In consequence, Queensland has become highly dependent for a number of years on doctors from developing countries.

“Over the same period, the proportion of doctors originating from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, the Philippines, Bangladesh and ‘other’ increased from 9.6 per cent to 37.3 per cent.

There appears to be a dispute between the Premier and the Premier’s parliamentary secretary about whether or not leadership was raised at yesterday’s caucus meeting.

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My second question without notice is to the Premier. The Premier could not tell the truth about fuel tax, could not tell the truth about privatisation and could not tell the truth about electricity prices, so let us see whether the Premier can tell the truth about leadership. Was the Premier’s leadership raised at yesterday’s crisis caucus meeting of the Labor Party?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130171"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Let me explain to the House the differentiation in allowing this question. The Premier is the leader of the state but is also the leader of the political party. Accordingly, I am allowing the question on the basis that the Premier is the leader of both. I call the honourable Premier. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I am very pleased to have an opportunity to clarify what seems to be some misunderstanding among some people reporting on what was a normally scheduled caucus meeting yesterday. I am happy to put on the record comments by the Leader of the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130173"></A>
Let us be very clear about one thing. The Leader of the House in Labor caucus has a very specific role, and that is to speak to the media after every caucus meeting and advise them of matters of significance that would be of public interest. For example, the Leader of the House advises the media at the end of every caucus meeting of those bills that have been approved by the caucus meeting for introduction into the House and on any other matters that might be of particular public interest. There is nothing unusual at all about what the Leader of the House did. That has been the case in Labor caucuses for decades. There was nothing different about that yesterday. </Hansard-Body>

I think it is wrong to say that we are at odds on any of these issues. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130179"></A>
Let us apply just a little bit of common sense to this. Were the issues that were raised by a pretty extraordinary federal election debated by my caucus? Of course they were. People in the street are talking about these issues. I want a caucus that is engaged in the big issues. I want a caucus that is engaged in the public issues of our time. I would have thought there was a pretty big message there for all major parties. It seems extraordinary to me that there does not seem to be any analysis on the other side of the House about what it might have meant for that side of politics. I do not think it is without a message there as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130180"></A>
Were there issues raised about how we could do better, including me as leader? Of course there were. But was there a question about my leadership? Was there any doubt about any challenge? No. I thank the honourable member for the opportunity to clarify that on the record. I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that there were pretty big messages sent to major parties at the federal election. I would expect that not only would my caucus be debating them but also that it would be a good thing if members opposite did the same. </Hansard-Body>

 I thank the member for his question. I thank him for his interest in managing world-class public transport in one of the fastest growing areas of Australia. Under our plan, timetables will eventually become a thing of the past with turn-up-and-go public transport services under our 20-year transport plan. It will mean high-frequency, high-reliability services operating along core rail and bus routes. It is members like the member for Chatsworth who understand how important reliable, fast, high-speed, high-frequency services are in providing absolute certainty and confidence to the people who live in suburbs like his. If they have that confidence they will use the public transport. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130187"></A>
If they are using public transport, they are leaving their cars behind. If they are taking their cars off the road, that is a benefit to all of us. It is a benefit to everybody who does have to use their car because it frees up road space and it also reduces the emissions that we are putting into the atmosphere, and that is a benefit for all Queenslanders. So I thank the member for his interest in this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130188"></A>
What we will provide under the turn-up-and-go network will include frequencies of 15 minutes all day, seven days a week, quality bus shelters and rail shelters and passenger information, and simplified high-frequency network maps with no need for a timetable. New services called UrbanLink will mean more frequent, higher capacity rail services travelling to the city from the outer suburbs, and that is good news for families buying their first home out in some of the outer suburbs--faster rail, better rail, better confidence in the public transport system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130189"></A>
Our Integrated Regional Transport Plan is a plan that has a very clear line of sight over the next two decades--one where, as we work through each budget, this government and subsequent governments can have a clear vision, and that is what this does. I know there will be cynicism, but the simple truth is that you never make progress without a plan and we are a government with a strong track record of delivering on those plans. </Hansard-Body>

 My question without notice is to the Premier.

Premier, is that true?</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. I have made a number of public comments about the caucus meeting that was held yesterday. I think they have been very clear. Members consistently spoke about some of the concerns being raised by their constituents, but at the end of the day they understood that cutting infrastructure projects in their electorates would be devastating. They one after another indicated that they are not prepared to support cutting the building of new hospitals, new schools, new roads and new rail in their electorates. And why? Because they understand that those projects are delivering jobs. They understand that they are delivering job security. They understand that they are keeping local companies afloat when there is no private investment.</Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Speaker. Did we debate those issues in our caucus at the time? Of course we did. Were there people who expressed some concern and disagreement? Of course there were. It would be implausible if there was not a debate, and I never want to lead a caucus where there is no debate. I never want to lead a caucus that runs out of ideas and does not have the stamina to stand up and debate them. So I am proud of my caucus. I am proud of its ability to grapple with big ideas and to grapple with new ideas. That is what we did on this issue, and that is well known. But it is the hallmark of our caucus that once we have that debate and once the majority makes the decision, that is how this government will operate, and that is how we have operated. There is nothing new about that. It is the platform of the Australian Labor Party. It is one of the fundamental core values that has seen us as one of the longest serving political parties in the history of Australia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130234"></A>
So it is that stability and that unity that is delivered by that sort of discipline. I do not have a problem with members of my caucus talking in caucus about their views. I never will. That is the place where they should debate and that is the place where they debate ideas. What we saw yesterday was, yet again, a caucus putting Queenslanders first, a caucus delivering on hard decisions so that Queenslanders will have a strong, bright future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130235"></A>
Today we see that future outlined when it comes to public transport--the strong vision of our government determined to deliver more to the passengers on our public transport network. How do we deliver that? We make the decisions necessary so that coal companies can invest in the transport of their product to market so that governments do what governments should do and that is deliver better passenger transport on rail and on buses. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOOLIHAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the honourable Deputy Premier and Minister for Health. Would the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health update the House on how the government’s strong economic plan is delivering more hospital infrastructure across the state? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130238"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. The Bligh government is sticking to its strong economic plan to deliver more jobs, to build infrastructure and to invest in Queensland’s economic recovery. Of course, one of the things about investment in health is that you get the capital investment from building the infrastructure, the jobs for those people who are building the infrastructure and, of course, hospitals are very labour intensive in their ongoing operations. Interestingly, there has been some debate about government assets. I make the point that the increased employment in doctors, nurses and allied health professionals in Queensland Health since 2005 has massively outstripped the employment in those agencies that are being looked at for sale. That is what the future of government is. That is what government is about in the 21st century. Frankly, the future government employee will be a doctor, a nurse, a teacher, a social health worker, or a disability worker. That is what the future of government service delivery is. That is where the growth is. Budgets are about choices and we make no apology for making those tough decisions on behalf of Queenslanders. They expect us to do that and, ultimately, whether it is health infrastructure or the $372 million flyover to the airport, it is all about choices that governments make on behalf of people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130239"></A>
Our Health budget this year has grown by 10 per cent on last year’s Health budget against a population increase of 2.6 per cent. Of course, with a $7.33 billion infrastructure program major projects are underway: upgrading EDs at the Logan, Redlands, QE2, Caboolture, Ipswich and Toowoomba hospitals and building a dedicated paediatric emergency department at Prince Charles Hospital. There are also big hospital projects--and you only have to look down the coast to see the strength of the regions of this state--at Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton and Bundaberg. There is also our commitment to the Sunshine Coast. There is not only the capital infrastructure on the Sunshine Coast but also the early rollout of services there in direct response to discussions with clinicians--those people who really want to know. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

This government has distinguished itself by the fact that it will make the tough decisions so that it can deliver more health services. What you are now saying--and you were caught out at the last election because of it--is that you want to make choices that involve negatively impacting on health services. </Hansard-Body>

 The other side of the House wants to make those decisions that will negatively impact on the delivery of health services and other services throughout Queensland. They cannot have it both ways.

 My question is to the Premier. Maxine McKew blames the federal election loss on the Labor Party’s failed campaign, for which the Premier is the national president.

 I thank the member for the question and I have to endorse the comments of others here. I have rarely seen so much boasting with so little to be proud of from those opposite. It is pretty extraordinary that for every week of the campaign those opposite raised the view that, as federal president, I had no role in the campaign and now they are saying that I ran it.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes. This comes from someone who, of course, was hidden. Where was the member for Surfers Paradise? If I were the member for Gympie I would be a lot more worried about the comments from the shadow Treasurer. I note his sensitivity so I will quote from the ABC transcript on Friday. The shadow Treasurer was invited by the compere, Madonna King, to say how he would fund the budget without asset sales. He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130251"></A>
... so what we said is you need to reassess these projects. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130252"></A>
He is condemned by his own words. I am happy to add that one of the projects the shadow Treasurer said should be reassessed was the Traveston Dam. He seems to have forgotten that it was totally reassessed last year and does not exist and is not in the program. Reassessing a non-existent project is not going to fund the ring-road in Townsville and it is not going to fund the hospital upgrades. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130253"></A>
Today seems as good a day as any to remind a few people over there, including the shadow Treasurer, of their own views on privatisation--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130254"></A>
They are all desirable aims arising from the privatisation of the electricity industry in Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130255"></A>
Indeed, one has to wonder why, if privatisation is so good, it has taken so long ... why not sell the poles and wires ... Why not sell the generators... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130256"></A>
We know where the shadow Treasurer’s heart lies on this issue. We know what he tells the boardrooms and what he has told this parliament. That is what he has said on the record. He speaks with forked tongue on this issue. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130260"></A>
I am very happy to advise the House today that one of the ideas that we discussed in some detail, and which we have resolved to take forward, is a program that has been developed by labour unions in the United States. It is a program designed specifically to ensure that elected members of parliament have a much better understanding of the reality of the working lives of the members of their organisations, particularly those in low-paid workplaces. It is a program that some members may have heard of. It is called ‘walk a day in my shoes’. Quite simply, it is a challenge to elected members of parliament to spend the day in the shoes of a worker, particularly in an industry where they may not have much familiarity with and where there is low-paid employment. We resolved as a caucus that we will implement this program in a comprehensive way. I have had discussions with the trade unions. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I have had preliminary discussions with trade unions about their involvement in this program. Some Australian unions have already started putting this program in place. We also resolved that we would be looking not only at large workplaces but also at small enterprises, many of which we know are not unionised but are dealing with real issues out there--industries like tourism, for example.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130265"></A>
Every member of the caucus will be involved in a comprehensive, well-planned program between now and Christmas where we will set out to walk a day in the shoes of workers in our electorates. Some of us will have more than one opportunity to do this. I certainly commit myself to that task--not only here in the south-east but also in regional Queensland. This is a very useful program to ensure that members get a real-life experience--not just five minutes in a shopping centre talking to someone but a whole day talking to people in their workplaces with their delegates in the lunchroom, as well as getting a sense of the sorts of days and work opportunities that people are experiencing. </Hansard-Body>

This is a chance for us to connect in different ways. We do not believe that everything that has been done in the past is the only way forward. We are happy to embrace new ideas.

I refer to the Premier’s statement yesterday when she said that she would resign as Premier if she was a liability to the Labor Party, and I ask: has the Premier consulted with Arch Bevis to find out if she is a liability? Has she consulted with Jon Sullivan, Brett Raguse, Kerry Rae or Chris Trevor? In fact, has the Premier--</Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. I am very happy to outline for the member for Callide the comments that I made in the days after the federal election because I think, frankly, they are worth repeating. There was a very clear message sent by the electorate at the federal election. In the first instance, I believe it was a message to both major parties. Secondly, there is absolutely no doubt--and I do not resile from it--that it was a message to Labor. Part of the message was to state Labor and part of that message was to federal Labor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130275"></A>
What is my responsibility? What is the responsibility of my members? It is to be out there listening to people, hearing the message that they want to give us. That is what we will be doing with new programs like ‘walk a day in my shoes’ and others that we will develop over coming weeks. It is equally important, and I say this as the national president of the federal Labor Party, that federal Labor hears what the electorate has to say. I think this does go a little bit to the member for Callide--those who do not listen to these messages, those who are seeking to point fingers at everyone other than themselves, run the risk of not hearing the message the electorate is sending. </Hansard-Body>

 I do not walk away from the hard, cold facts on this issue and I have not in any way, shape or form. What I do say is that what is important is that we listen, we find new ways of connecting and we redouble our efforts to deliver better services for Queenslanders. In doing that, we will not be resiling from what is a strong economic strategy that will deliver a stronger Queensland--a Queensland with better hospitals, better schools, better roads, better transport; a Queensland that is well equipped for the future; a Queensland that is inoculated to a much larger degree from future economic shocks. </Hansard-Body>

Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Mulgrave for his question. He, like all the other members from Cairns, knows that this government has stood square shouldered with the Cairns council, the business leaders of Cairns and government representatives in Cairns to support the Cairns economy in its hour of need. That is why the member for Mulgrave supports the choices that we have made in order to keep funding programs like the Lotus Glen expansion that kept hundreds of people in work; in order to keep funding building projects like William McCormack Place, the new office building, that kept people in work. It is why we have been able to commit to the cruise terminal development down at the wharfs to keep people in work and provide jobs for the future and it is why we have been able to commit to the new arts precinct in Cairns. We have the courage to commit to the jobs and economy of the future. Those are the choices we have made in order to invest in infrastructure and jobs. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1130296"></A>
When I was in Cairns last week I spoke at the TropLinks conference which aims to gain a slice of the expanding tropical economy, a part that Cairns can play so well into the future. At that conference I was joined by the shadow Treasurer who also supports the notion that the tropical economy represents an opportunity. But that is where the road diverges. That is where we take a different road. Since last Friday the shadow Treasurer has reverted to type. He has gone back to what he has always believed in. He is trying to protest here today, but what did he say on the record back in December 2008--just at the tipping point of the global financial crisis? He said on the record at the ABC, ‘I have indicated to you that some projects will be scrapped.’ The reality is that he has always believed in cutting capital works programs and he is just reverting back to type.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130297"></A>
When the shadow Treasurer said last Friday that they are looking to reassess, reassess is the new ‘de-necessary’. He is practising, getting ready for the leadership. We know that he is there trying to muscle. He is trying to pretend that he is new, urbane and enlightened, but he just reverts back to type as a typical tory: there to get his hands on the throat of the Queensland economy; there to take Queensland workers by the scruff of the neck, committed to turfing people off job sites, making sure that they all lose their jobs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130298"></A>
What do you know? The choice is still clear. On that side there are cuts. On this side there are jobs. On that side they are pulling up the Capital Works Program. On this side we are building Queensland’s future. On that side they are saying no to young people trying to get into the labour market for their first job. On this side we put in place projects to give young people a chance to get their first job. On that side there is not a policy, no leadership and no plans for the future. On this side there is an economic plan that has been delivering jobs for 12 straight months; there are the policies and the plans to build a recovery and to deliver jobs. The big difference is that we have a leader who is going to do it. </Hansard-Body>

Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Premier. The Premier’s director-general has imposed a ban on the opposition office taking out newspaper advertisements seeking feedback on the government’s privatisation agenda. Given that Labor has announced it will be embarking on a talking and listening offensive to tell Queenslanders that something they do not want and something they detest is actually good for them, can the Premier assure Queenslanders that not one cent of taxpayers’ dollars will be used for this campaign, including her ‘walk a day in my shoes’ campaign?</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I am very happy to have an opportunity to talk again about the advertising provisions for the opposition. Let me just give a little bit of history here. Firstly, this opposition has more resources than any other opposition in Australia and it has the only opportunity of any opposition in Australia to use taxpayer funds to run its advertising. It has been an almost unfettered right, and the opposition abused it and abused it for political purposes. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is not that hard to distinguish between material that is party political in nature and other material. It is reasonable in a democracy like ours for the opposition to have access to resources to put forward their policies or to advertise, for example, where they might be as a shadow cabinet. However, the sorts of campaigns that it was expecting the taxpayer to fund were party political from top to bottom. There is no opposition that we can find in the Westminster system anywhere that is funded by taxpayers to do that. The new rules are now in place, and I am happy to table those later today or this week so that everyone can see them. They are consistent with the federal rules and they are there as a recommendation of the Integrity Commissioner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130305"></A>
I would have thought that was a pretty spectacular own goal by the Leader of the Opposition. He had a right that was generally unfettered and he abused it. He abused it to the point where it has now been dragged back to where every other opposition in the rest of the country and in other parts of the Westminster system rightfully is. If the Leader of the Opposition believes that abusing taxpayer funds for party political reasons--</Hansard-Body>

 In the entire history of our government it has never used taxpayer funds to attack the LNP, to attack a leader of a political party or to in a party political way campaign against another member of parliament. That has never been done by our government and never would be because it is an abuse of taxpayer funds. That is what the LNP expects the Queensland taxpayers to pay for. That is what its party should pay for. </Hansard-Body>

 I know why they are upset. It is because they do not want to confront building workers in this state with the grim reality of what they intend to do, which is the same as the tories did in 1929, and that is to cut the Capital Works Program and put all those people out of jobs. The 650 on the Gold Coast and the 600 at Maroochydore would all be out of work. In 1996, when I came into this portfolio, there was $500 million worth of capital works frozen, thanks to the people who sit opposite. They have form. I am delighted to take any of them onto a job site. They can stand in front of the BLF, the CFMEU and all those other unions and tell them that they intend to reassess their jobs.</Hansard-Body>

 My question without notice is to the Premier. According to the federal department of employment, when the Premier made her 100,000 full-time breadwinners’ jobs promise, from which she has now backflipped, there were 25,629 long-term unemployed Queenslanders. According to the latest figures, that number has now increased by nearly half, and I table the supporting documentation. What does the Premier have to say to these 37,025 Queenslanders who are suffering from skyrocketing costs of living while the economy falters under her leadership?</Hansard-Body>

 We are delivering on our jobs promise, we are delivering it ahead of time and we are absolutely determined to continue not only to achieve it but also, if we can, to go beyond it. To those Queenslanders who are still looking for work, to those Queenslanders who are still looking for a job, I say that this government will never, ever sleep on the job when it comes to finding jobs for Queenslanders. We will continue to invest in our building program to create jobs on our work sites. We will continue to invest in our building program so that companies in regional Queensland can keep their heads above water. We will continue to invest in our jobs programs like the Green Army, which are delivering jobs to young people who would be on the scrap heap under those opposite. </Hansard-Body>

Over the next 18 months we will be talking to Queenslanders about jobs. We will be talking to them about how to get jobs, how we can help them, how our government programs will give them a chance to get off the dole queue and we will be telling them that those opposite--</Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Minister for Main Roads. I refer to the $3.3 billion roads budget and I ask the minister to give a guarantee that he will maintain the momentum in rolling out road projects to build a safer and more secure road network and, importantly, to protect the jobs of Queensland’s road workers. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My answer to the member for Waterford is: yes, I can and yes, Labor will. Labor will continue our record capital expenditure on roads and we will continue to employ thousands of Queenslanders across our great state. However, I cannot vouch for the members of parliament opposite. They have the Grim Reaper’s calling card. They want to reassess building projects being rolled out across Queensland. As we heard this morning, the LNP’s chief bean counter has spilled the beans, and we know what that means. It means that important road projects will be put at risk and thousands of road workers will face a very uncertain future, all because the LNP’s infrastructure hit list has been finally revealed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130347"></A>
In the electorate of the member for Gregory, over 40 projects are at risk. I am talking about $6 billion worth of road projects and thousands of jobs in jeopardy. It is time for another road trip, but this time there will be no joy for me because those are the jobs that are at risk. In the Far North, in Cairns, where things are so tough at the moment, $280 million worth of roadworks and 900 jobs are at risk. In North Queensland, in Townsville, $500 million worth of roadworks and 2,000 jobs are at risk. The member for Mount Isa will be interested to know that, in the north-west, a $14 million program and 96 jobs are at risk. In the Wide Bay area, which is a fast growing area of Queensland, $314 million worth of roadworks and 1,800 jobs are at risk by the opposition. In the south-west, 112 jobs are at risk. Members who represent the south-west should speak out in their party room and say that they will stand up for jobs in their electorates. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131814"></A>
On the Sunshine Coast, 900 jobs are at risk, but we hear nary a peep from that side. On the Gold Coast, $1 billion worth of roadworks and 3,500 jobs are at risk. Members opposite who represent Gold Coast seats should tell their constituents that 3,500 jobs are at risk from the Leader of the Opposition and his cronies. In the Fitzroy, 1,000 jobs are at risk through their job cuts. This side supports roads, this side supports jobs and I will be standing up for road workers in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Mr McLINDON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Premier. Will the Premier commit to hosting a bipartisan ideas forum and invite key union leaders, economists, experts and entrepreneurs such as Sir Richard Branson in a genuine effort to prevent the sale of Queensland’s assets? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130350"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. When it comes to ideas forums, I am pleased to advise the member for Beaudesert that some time ago the Queensland government funded the Ideas Festival. It happens every two years. It is a very good program and I encourage him to look at it and to be a part of it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130351"></A>
In relation to asset sales, firstly, the last time I looked Richard Branson owned a private airline; he does not run a public airline. He also owns a private railway. In fact, he may be a good speaker to talk about private investment into transport as a very good way forward. If Richard Branson were here, I think he would say that one of the biggest impediments to his company doing well and employing more people is government owned airlines, which still operate in some parts of the world and which are unfair in the competitive market. Not for one minute do I worry about Richard Branson talking to us about these things. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130352"></A>
What we hear from the member’s question and what we hear from those opposite is that in our budget deliberations we should engage in a process that would effectively remove our obligation to govern. Let us look at asset sales in recent history. When the Hawke and Keating federal Labor government decided to embark on a program of asset sales for assets such as Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, they did not put it to a referendum; they governed. They did not take it to an election. They faced the financial circumstances they encountered and they governed. When Rob Borbidge and Joan Sheldon were elected, they did not take the privatisation of Suncorp Metway, the state bank of Queensland, to the election as an election commitment. They did not take it to a referendum. They dealt with the financial circumstances with which they were faced and they governed. Under John Howard the privatisation of Telstra was not the subject of a public summit or a referendum. He dealt with the circumstances he found himself in and he governed. He then went to the people and the people judged, as they did with Hawke and Keating, and as they did with Borbidge and Sheldon. When Peter Beattie privatised the TAB, he did not take it to an election and he did not put it to a referendum; he governed, because that is what he needed to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130353"></A>
Our government faced the financial circumstances and did what every other government on all sides of politics has done. We made the decisions and we are governing. That was the mandate that we were given in March last year and that is what we have the strength to do. On this issue our record is identical to every other government faced with similar circumstances and our financial strategy, our budget, is not open to some sort of talkfest. That is not how you govern.  </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. Unlike the Liberal National Party, the Bligh government is committed to building world-class infrastructure--buildings and new facilities--for our young people, our apprentices and our trainees. That is why our $850 million SSOT program is continuing, as well as $500 million a year into the non-state school sector, $2.1 billion into new schools and school facilities from the BER program and $60 million into the solar program. Imagine my astonishment to hear that the shadow Treasurer has said that they are going to review all of the building programs. We now know that that is the mask for cuts--building program cuts. The razor gang is out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130358"></A>
I want to know whether the member for Clayfield, as shadow Treasurer, has written to his electorate telling them, for example, that the Eagle Junction State School’s $3 million new resource centre will be gone; the Ascot State School’s $3 million classroom program, gone; the Aviation High’s redevelopment program, gone; Kedron State High School’s $2 million language program, gone. Why don’t they stand up for state schools and for education and training? They stand, however, in contrast to this side of the House, for cuts to the building program, for cuts to jobs. It is in their DNA. If we go back to 1995, that is when they did it. They said it before the 2009 election, and they have said it again. They stand for cuts, cuts and cuts. They have no education policy and no building program. We have, in stark contrast to them, a real plan for the future--an economic plan--real policies and a real leader for Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition) (11.32 am): Today we have seen the technique of the Premier and this government. What we are going to see in the lead-up to the next election is a scare campaign about cuts. That is all they have. They have tried it before, just as Julia Gillard and federal Labor tried to do it about Work Choices. But they could not con the Australian public and neither will this government be able to con the people of Queensland again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130367"></A>
The Premier in her last answer to a question from the member for Beaudesert literally said that she justified the stance on privatisation. This is a desperate attempt to stave off her political assassination. She tried to have us believe that there was no discussion about privatisation and no discussion about leadership at yesterday’s caucus meeting. In fact, once again there was a very clever use of words between her and her parliamentary secretary to analyse what was said. That is what the Premier has tried to be so clever about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130368"></A>
Last week the Premier claimed to have a mandate to govern. That is not what Queenslanders think. I ask honourable members: was there a mandate to sell Queensland Rail? No. Was there a mandate to sell off the ports? No. Was there a mandate to hike up the cost of power, water, rego, land rents, tolls and petrol? No. Was there a mandate to mislead, deceive and betray Queenslanders? No, there was not. Queensland Labor lost its mandate long ago. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130369"></A>
The mandate disappeared when the spineless and witless caucus members condoned the wholesale deception that followed the last state election. They are the words of the Treasurer, the member for Mount Coot-tha, speaking about his own members in the Labor caucus. He called them spineless and witless. The mandate disappeared when the sycophantic, submissive and obsequious Labor caucus last night erased for all time any memory of a mandate from Queenslanders by yet again ignoring them. They say they are listening. They say they are hearing. But in the same breath we hear the Premier saying that she is not going to change anything. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130370"></A>
Labor members will not stand up for their electorates. Labor members will not stand up for the rank and file. Labor members have not kept the promises made to Queenslanders. Labor is the party of the timid, the treacherous and the tactless. Labor is hopelessly divided, and it leaves Queenslanders without hope. Labor is internally at war. Yet those who protest the loudest in their electorates come into this place and do as they are told. As I said, in the words of the Treasurer, he called them spineless and witless. He is so charming. I note that he is not here today with his normal charming interjections.</Hansard-Body>

Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Order! The honourable Leader of the Opposition, I have ruled before that you will not refer to a member who is absent. There may be good reasons why they are absent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130372"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I apologise, Mr Speaker. These sorts of utterances about his own side show why Queenslanders cannot stand the Treasurer almost as much as they cannot abide the Premier. Two-thirds of his own electorate in Mount Coot-tha do not vote for him. What about the honourable member for Murrumba, who I see here today, described as spineless and witless, or the member for Bundamba, or the member for Mundingburra, or the member for Keppel, or the member for Brisbane Central, or the member for Sunnybank? It does not matter who the Labor Party leader is. Queenslanders know that the Labor Party MPs are responsible for deceiving them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130373"></A>
The federal election result in Queensland was a wake-up call to the Premier and the Labor Party. The LNP performance was greater than in any other state, with a swing of over 5.6 per cent and eight seats changing hands, including the long-time Labor held seat of Brisbane. The Labor vote in Queensland collapsed by nine per cent and that should come as no surprise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130374"></A>
On polling day before I went to my electorate I was at polling booths in Townsville. Union members were turning up and refusing ALP how-to-vote cards. One bloke was wearing a CFMEU shirt proclaiming on his shirt, ‘Qld not for sale.’ That said it very succinctly. ‘You sold us out,’ he told the ALP booth workers as he walked past, and he told me to keep up the good work. He was a lifetime Labor voter, yet he voted for the LNP because Queensland Labor has deceived him. I am determined that those people who voted for the LNP at the federal election will do it for the second time at the next state election. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130375"></A>
There may be a change in the leadership of the Labor Party after the disastrous result in Queensland, but the problem is that Bill Ludwig will decide who is the leader, just as he and his union decided that it was time for Kevin Rudd to go. He decided that Julia Gillard would be Prime Minister and he will decide who replaces Anna Bligh. Labor can change the parliamentary leader, but it is the same old faceless union leaders who will decide who the replacement is. Big Bill Ludwig gets the final say on who leads the Labor Party, just as factional union heavies like Karl Bitar and Paul Howes knifed a sitting Prime Minister, ignoring the rights of the electorate to pass judgement on a hopeless and hapless federal Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130376"></A>
Of course now we have a former union leader, the member for Brisbane Central--another one of the spineless and witless, according to the member for Mount Coot-tha--running around trying to get the numbers together for the ABA ticket--anyone but Anna. That is right. The member for Brisbane Central has looked at the booth results. She knows what is coming--baseball bats. But she is only interested now that it is her job on the line. She was not interested when it was the jobs of thousands of her former workmates on the line. There is only one number that the member for Brisbane Central needs and that is big Bill Ludwig’s. Get on the blower to big Bill if you want to knock off the most unpopular Premier in Queensland’s history. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130377"></A>
It does not matter how unpopular the Premier is with Queenslanders. That is not what counts. The survival of the Premier comes down to how popular she is with Bill Ludwig. Labor members are too spineless and witless to do anything about it unless Bill Ludwig gives them the okay. If he told them to go picking water lilies in the Brisbane River, they would be over there doing it, led by Paul Lucas. I bet he is getting plenty of attention these days. His phone must be running hot with the Premier and the spineless and witless pretenders to the throne--and of course the numbers woman from Brisbane Central--all trying to impress the one-man selection panel for Labor Premier. Whoever takes over from the Premier will have voted for the sale of Queensland Rail, the ports, the forestry and the motorways. Whoever is chosen by Bill Ludwig to knock off the member for South Brisbane will have been at the cabinet table or nearby when they decided to betray the trust of Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130378"></A>
No matter who leads the Queensland Labor Party, Queenslanders know they cannot be trusted. No matter who leads the Queensland Labor Party, they too have sold Queenslanders out. No matter who leads Queensland Labor, they have endorsed the huge rises in water, power, rego, tolls and charges. No matter who leads Queensland Labor, they gave us a fuel tax when they promised not to before the election. No matter who leads Queensland Labor, they too have been up to their ears in the deception, dishonesty and deceit played out on honest, decent, hardworking Queensland families. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130379"></A>
Queensland Labor can no longer claim to be the party of the worker. It is the party of George Street carpet strollers who have never had a proper job. It is the party of union hacks who have made careers out of impeding private enterprise. That is what they are afraid of. Those opposite do not understand it. They have never filled out a business activity statement. They are only good at spending other people’s money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130380"></A>
Queensland Labor is the party of high taxes, high charges and extremely low standards. It is the party of debt, deficit and deceit. It is the party of arrogance, hubris and conceit. It is the party of spineless and witless MPs, so detached from reality that they have repeatedly sold out their heartland. It is time that those opposite realised that Queenslanders have had enough of Queensland Labor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130381"></A>
They deserve better. Only an LNP government can deliver a better Queensland and a fairer go for them and their families. Queensland families know the only party that really cares about them and understands how difficult it is to manage a budget with all of Labor’s cost of living increases is the LNP. The LNP is the only party that will look after families. The LNP is the only party that will get business moving again. The LNP is the only party that will bring state costs and charges under control. The LNP is the only party that can turn the Queensland economy around to make this state the best performing once again. The LNP is the only party that can get back the AAA credit rating and restore Queensland economic creditability. The LNP, in contrast to the Premier who just wants to embark on a scare campaign that will not work again, is the only party that can deliver a fresh approach, a new vision and a prosperous future for Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130382"></A>
The message for the spineless and witless Labor MPs opposite is clear. Queenslanders do not care who they choose to replace their current lame duck leader. Labor lame ducks are all the same. For the next state election Queenslanders have put Labor duck on the menu. In the meantime, we are going to keep working in the LNP to provide a new, fresh and strong vision for the people of Queensland and say that politics can and will be different. We will say things before an election that we will stick to afterwards. We will get rid of the cynicism about politics. The message for Labor is clear: the people of Queensland are waiting for them and they have had enough. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Gateway Upgrade Project</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms FARMER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bulimba--ALP) (11.42 am): On the first Sunday in August the remaining two lanes of the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridge opened to traffic. This is a milestone in the Bligh Labor government’s $2.5 billion upgrade of the Gateway corridor. It means that traffic is now flowing on all six southbound lanes of the new bridge. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130385"></A>
The Gateway Upgrade Project is Australia’s largest road and bridge project. Since it opened its effect has been, and will increasingly be, to slash travel times and ease congestion for thousands of busy motorists who use the bridge every day. It means less time spent in traffic and more time for commuters to go about their business. Every extra lane of this project means an extra 1,400 vehicles an hour can cross the river. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130386"></A>
A major revamp of the northbound lanes of the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridge is expected to be completed by the end of the year. By that time motorists will have 12 lanes across the river--six northbound and six southbound. This will be achieved six months ahead of schedule. When all the Gateway works are completed by mid next year motorists will save up to 20 minutes on a trip from Nudgee in the north to the Pacific Motorway in the south. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130387"></A>
This project and all its aspects is not just about easing traffic congestion in our rapidly growing region and slashing travel times for the 200,000 motorists expected to drive across it every day. It is not just about planning for and managing growth. In the bigger picture, it has been about jobs for Queenslanders. It has been about generating jobs for workers in road construction and related industries at a time when jobs and job security are more important than ever--creating in its time between 5,000 and 6,000 direct and indirect jobs for workers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130388"></A>
Quite simply, the completion of the Gateway Upgrade Project will mark the delivery of one of the many vital infrastructure projects that are underway across Queensland as a result of this government’s responsible economic management of the worst financial crisis in the last 70 years. The Gateway Upgrade Project is one of the major tranches of the government’s $18 billion infrastructure program--a plan which the government has been determined to complete, despite strong opposition from the LNP, to make sure Queensland is ready for the future. The program has been put in place to serve the growing needs of our state and has provided much needed stimulus to our economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130389"></A>
Implementing it has not been easy. The global financial crisis affected every economy around the world. The crisis cost the Queensland economy $15 billion in future income--a loss that would have effectively stopped vital works like the Gateway Upgrade Project unless funds could be found from other sources, though this is the action the opposition tells us we should have taken. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130390"></A>
The government’s infrastructure and jobs plan is working. According to the July ABS data, Queensland had locked in its 12th straight month of jobs growth. It has now led the nation in jobs growth for the last four months. In July, 5,600 new jobs were created in Queensland. That was more than a third of the nation’s total jobs growth of 16,700. Delivering 12 months straight jobs growth shows the Queensland economy is headed in the right direction. We are yet another step closer to creating the 100,000 net new jobs that we promised at the last election. The jobs target is now down to 38,800, meaning a net total number of jobs of 61,200 have been created since the promise was made by the government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130391"></A>
The Bligh Labor government is about jobs. That is why it was particularly distressing to have heard the comments of the opposition Treasury spokesmen, the member for Clayfield, about what the LNP thinks about the infrastructure projects we have put in place to create and protect jobs. The member for Clayfield made it clear that if the LNP wins government at the next election it will reassess these building projects. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130392"></A>
The member for Surfers Paradise just tried to tell us that the LNP is the only party that can look after families. I suppose that if the LNP was reassessing building projects then that would have meant the Gateway Upgrade Project would have been looked at as well. If it knocked that project back then I would like to know what it would have said to the families of the almost 6,000 people who had jobs as a result of this massive project. I would like to know what it would have said to families of the people who have benefited from the flow-on effect into the local economy of the project of about $450 million in wages and salaries. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130393"></A>
The Bligh Labor government knows that times are tough for people. What it also knows is that there is no better way to help a family deal with its finances than giving it a job. In tough economic times we need to build projects, not cut them, to build strong economies and protect jobs. That is what the state Labor government has done and will continue to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130394"></A>
Anna Bligh has got a tough job and she is doing a great job. I congratulate the Premier on her ambitious plan to make sure Queenslanders have jobs. I thank her for her commitment to a strong future for our state. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Helping Out Families Initiative</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Speech-Start>
</Hansard-Speech-Start>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr MOORHEAD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Waterford--ALP) (11.47 am): The Bligh Labor government is dedicated to giving the families of Logan a helping hand when they need it most. This promise is being delivered with the Helping Out Families initiative. Along with Desley Scott and Margaret Keech, I was delighted to join the Minister for Community Services, Karen Struthers, and the Minister for Child Safety, Phil Reeves, in launching the initiative in Logan and Beenleigh. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130397"></A>
The launch was appropriately located at the Beenleigh Community Health Centre at Mount Warren Park. The Beenleigh Community Health Centre is the base for Beenleigh’s child health program within Queensland Health and a team of child health nurses. These are the same child health nurses who will be the key to the Bligh government’s Helping Out Families initiative. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130398"></A>
At the moment, parents of newborn children are given the opportunity to attend child health clinics at local hospitals and community health facilities. The Bligh government’s commitment to improving these services to families in Logan is clear. Mothers and newborn babies will now receive up to six visits from nurses based at facilities like the Beenleigh Community Health Centre. Parents and children who are identified as needing extra support can access up to 15 child health nurse visits. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130399"></A>
The initiative also follows through with parents who need extra help by providing support from the Family Support Alliance services through non-government organisations such as the Benevolent Society and Lifeline. These organisations will provide intensive support to families when they need it most. This support will include practical in-home support such as assistance with parenting, home management, budgeting and meal preparation as well as visits from health workers. Families will also benefit from help in life management skills, individual and family counselling and, if they need it, specialist services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130400"></A>
This is a $55 million investment in strengthening families and giving Logan and Beenleigh children a flying start. It means that we can focus on developing the great potential of every child rather than having to react through our child protection system in the worst cases. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130401"></A>
This is the type of investment the LNP will cut. It cannot claim to support families and then oppose important spending initiatives like this. These are initiatives that invest in our future. I know that every parent in my area wants the best for their children, but sometimes parents need a helping hand in one of the greatest responsibilities of life--raising children in a safe and supportive environment. The Bligh government is looking over the horizon with strategies that build a long-term future for our state. As well as building roads, hospitals and schools, we are building stronger families and stronger homes through early intervention programs. This is the fair thing and smart thing to do for the future of our state. It simply makes common sense to give parents the support they need at the earliest stage of a child’s development. Every parent wants to raise their children to their best ability, but some parents may not have the support networks around them that they need.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130402"></A>
When I have discussed initiatives like this with parents at my local schools, parents have told me that there has traditionally been a gap in family support between the end of child health clinics and the commencement of kindergarten programs. With the Helping Out Families initiative, the Bligh government is now trialling a program that provides families with opportunities for seamless family support from birth, through early childhood to kindergarten and beyond. The Bligh government’s commitment to early childhood does not end with this initiative. We have committed to funding levels of the Kent Street community kindergarten with the introduction of the new funding program for kindergartens. We have also seen four of the Bligh government’s 240 new kindergartens announced locally, with kindergarten services coming to Meadowbrook and Waterford and two kindergartens at Logan Reserve State School.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1130403"></A>
On top of an extra year of prep schooling introduced in 2007, Logan families will see a rollout of kindergarten education opportunities for children in the year before prep. This government is investing in the things that matter for our future. Taxpayer funds investing in early childhood support and education means long-term savings and a brighter economic future for our state. It means Queensland will be a state that is supporting families to develop Queenslanders who are prepared for the jobs of the 21st century. This government is not only delivering jobs to Queensland through these tough economic times but also ensuring there are jobs for generations of Queenslanders to come.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr FLEGG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Moggill--LNP) (11.52 am): Recently we saw the release of the Orgill report--the interim report by the implementation task force into the Building the Education Revolution program--and it could be best described as damning. The BER program was implemented by the Rudd government for the stated purpose of stimulating the economy, yet in the interim report we find that 40 per cent of Queensland’s projects are yet to begin--two years after the global financial crisis for which this was supposedly part of the solution. Perhaps the Queensland government is holding back its economic stimulus. At the same time as we see the Reserve Bank ramping up interest rates to try to slow the Australian economy, the Queensland government is holding its projects in reserve.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I challenge the minister in this place to address the recommendations of this report--a report funded by his own federal Labor government. The first of those recommendations, headed ‘Immediate actions’, states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130426"></A>
In the interest of transparency and public accountability, the Taskforce recommends that each education authority publish school specific project cost data related to BER P21 in a nationally common structure with consistent definitions.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130427"></A>
That is something that this government has consistently refused to do, and one of the reasons such a massive amount of money has been wasted out of education in this state is that it will not look at the costings of individual projects. The task force recommends further measures: that school stakeholders should be given more say in the decisions, that they should be using a business-as-usual approach to saving money and that they should save some money out of the exorbitant fees they are charging and put them back into school building projects.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130428"></A>
The task force also criticised governments for using BER money for backlogged maintenance and refurbishment. I note that in Queensland we paid an average of $2,829 a square metre in the public system to build these school halls when the Queensland Catholic system was able to build similar projects for $1,789--figures that this minister has constantly refused to supply for the people of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130429"></A>
While talking about school building projects, I note that EQ did a study on the Broadbeach State School because it wanted to get its hands on a valuable three-hectare waterfront site and examined selling it off to a developer and then housing our children in a 50-storey high-rise as an experiment. This is a broke government to look at things like this. We do not want experiments with the children of Queensland stuffed into 50-storey high-rises instead of schools!</Hansard-Body>

Ms JARRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Whitsunday--ALP) (11.58 am): Nothing is more important than our health, and as a government we spend more money on health care than any other portfolio area. The Bligh government commits nearly one-quarter of the state’s annual budget to ensure that our health system meets the public’s expectation of immediate expert medical attention for every individual in the state. As part of this record spending program more doctors, nurses and allied health staff are being employed by Queensland Health, and this strategy is already paying off. We now have some of the shortest elective surgery waiting lists in the country and our throughput in emergency departments is climbing every year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130433"></A>
We are also spending unprecedented money in this state to build and redevelop our hospitals. For example, Mackay Base Hospital is the beneficiary of a $405 million redevelopment that is occurring as we speak. Importantly, the Mackay Base Hospital redevelopment is not a piece of planning pulled out of the top drawer of Queensland Health; it is a response to a process of community consultation and a clinical services plan that ensures that it will meet the needs of the community tomorrow and into the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130434"></A>
The Mackay Base Hospital redevelopment is just one of numerous hospital renewal projects occurring across the length and breadth of this state but, despite this enormous focus, Queenslanders remain among the most unhealthy people in the nation due largely to the prevalence of chronic disease. More than one-third of all deaths in Queensland are the result of chronic disease such as heart failure, stroke, respiratory disease, diabetes and kidney disease. An estimated seven in every 10 patients seen by a GP have at least one chronic disease and chronic disease is largely preventable.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130435"></A>
It is little wonder then that, in drawing up the <Hansard-Italic>
Toward Q2: Tomorrow’s Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
 document that sets out our goals for a better future, prevention of chronic disease is embedded in the goal to make Queenslanders the healthiest people in the nation. It is an enormous task, but the benefits of tackling chronic diseases are that, ultimately, it will save the government money, save the community lost production and reduce the pain and suffering of thousands of people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130436"></A>
Therefore, I was understandably excited to discover recently that the focus on chronic disease management and prevention is alive and well in my own community. Last week I attended a community and hospital interface education forum at the Proserpine Hospital to hear firsthand how Queensland Health staff are working to reduce the human impacts of chronic disease through both inpatient and outpatient services. Often the first contact with a person suffering from a chronic health problem is when they present at the emergency ward in an acute condition. Of course, the hospital has a well-established inpatient response program for dealing with the pointy end of cardiac-pulmonary issues. The real work, however, often starts after the acute phase has been managed and a program of rehabilitation is designed for the patient. The real message in this speech is that you do not have to wait until you are admitted in an acute condition to access help. The rehabilitation and chronic disease programs are available at any time to anyone who would benefit from participation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130437"></A>
The programs largely focus on addressing lifestyle issues, including exploring healthy attitudes to eating, developing physical activity goals, managing stress and making long-term behavioural changes to support healthy lifestyles. That is not rocket science, you say, but the best bit is that most of these programs are group activities. So as well as realising you are not Robinson Crusoe in dealing with chronic disease, you are also provided with an additional opportunity for social network which, for some people, will have benefits well beyond the formal program time frame. Although the programs are serious in addressing the impacts of chronic diseases, some of the content is a lot of fun. Take the Tai Chi lessons, for instance. This is a great way to address issues such as stress reduction, fall prevention, arthritis relief and relaxation, but it is also a great way to meet people and address the issues of social isolation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130438"></A>
We know that the incidence of type 2 diabetes is greater among men than it is in women. So the hospital offers a program called Pit Stop that is designed specially to appeal to men by being delivered within a framework that they can relate to. This program can be delivered in the workplace and uses the analogy of a car receiving a service to explain how we can look after our bodies by understanding its needs and the appropriate responses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130439"></A>
We have been very lucky to have benefited from great leadership at the Proserpine Hospital. We now welcome a local doctor, Dr Shaun Grimes, to the position of director of medical services. One of Dr Grimes’s first actions has been to establish a regular program of community and hospital interface education sessions like the one I attended last week. These sessions are aimed at educating the community about the services provided by the hospital and to hear back from the community. It is a great idea and I encourage everyone in the Proserpine district to become better informed by attending these sessions. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Callide--LNP) (12.03 pm): This morning we heard that, after 12 years, the Labor government is finally going to start listening. Its new policy approach is to start listening to the people of Queensland. It has taken the government a long time to listen to the people of the Surat and Bowen basins who have been affected by the development of the coal seam gas industry in those areas. But finally the government and the minister are starting to get the basics in place. This morning in the parliament we saw the minister patting himself on the back for finally starting to get the basics in place that that industry needs to be the success that it should be for the people of that region and for the people of Queensland generally. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130442"></A>
I refer to measures such as the move to protect the best of the best of our agricultural land. The strategic cropping framework that the minister announced last week should have been announced last year. It is at least 12 months overdue. Certainly, it is welcomed by all of the stakeholders, but had it been introduced in a timely way, had the government understood the issues surrounding the industry, had the government listened to the concerns that were expressed by all industry stakeholders, all community leaders and all members in this parliament who represent that area, then a lot of the angst and a lot of the concern could have been avoided.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130443"></A>
Similarly, the resource reform package that was announced last week by the minister recognised that the government has a role--a role that I pointed out to the minister at the estimates committee hearings, a role that I have pointed out consistently to the government--and that there is a very big difference between administering an industry such as this on the Darling Downs and the more traditional resource extraction areas of the Cooper Basin and the north-west minerals province. The reform package that the minister put in place allocates 20 staff to the area to respond to groundwater and environmental complaints. As I said to the minister at the estimates committee hearing, the government needs to have boots on the ground--it needs to have people in the field. Once again, although this initiative is welcomed, it is long overdue. It is two years overdue and a lot of angst and a lot of community concern could have been avoided. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130444"></A>
Similarly, with the coal seam gas consultative committees, it was obvious from day one that the communities in these areas needed to be involved. They needed to have information. They needed to have confidence. They needed to be able to address issues in a consultative way. Finally, the government has put in place the consultative committees that, once again, should have been in place for a long time. As I said in the parliament during the last sitting week, the new land access laws that finally passed through this parliament last week were similarly long overdue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130445"></A>
But the debate now has to turn to the other issues that have not yet been addressed--the issues of dealing with the massive development, the growth, the population increase and the economic activity that will come with the development of this export industry. Those regions of Queensland deserve to have the infrastructure in place before a crisis develops. They deserve to have a government that will foresee the need for basic infrastructure and ensure that that infrastructure is in place in those communities before the demand that this industry will bring develops on the ground. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130446"></A>
The coal seam gas industry provides an enormous opportunity for communities that have done it hard for decades, for areas of Queensland that have struggled economically for a long time, to build a bright economic future for generations to come. But it will take a government with foresight and planning to ensure that the people in those communities--those people who live in those regional areas and the people who will move to those regional areas--have the infrastructure and the services that other Queenslanders take for granted. Simple things like the construction of roads, hospitals and schools should be addressed now. The Warrego Highway--the main access road--is an absolute disgrace. The Dawson Highway from Gladstone is not much better. It is an indictment on this government that it is years behind in planning and developing that infrastructure, just as it was behind in planning and delivering the administrative regulation that was required to make the industry a success. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130447"></A>
The government has released the Surat Basin future directions statement. It is long on rhetoric but very short on detail. The government needs to be working with the communities in the Surat and Bowen basins to ensure that the coal seam gas industry provides the economic future that it has the potential to and that it ensures that the people in those regions can take full advantage of this industry and can use the industry to build their communities, to build their economic base for generations to come. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr CHOI</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Capalaba--ALP) (12.08 pm): I welcome the announcement by the Premier this morning of her government’s plan for a rail revolution in South-East Queensland. According to the Premier, South-East Queensland’s passenger rail capacity will nearly triple by 2031 under our new $123 billion transport blueprint. This is fantastic news. <Hansard-Italic>
Connecting SEQ 2031: An integrated regional transport plan for South East Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
 maps a clear way forward for transport in our region. This plan also includes duplication of the track from Manly to Cleveland and a plan to run an express train from Cleveland to Manly. I would encourage everybody to have their say on this plan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130450"></A>
The Cleveland train line services the Redland city region with stations at Thorneside, Birkdale, Ormiston, Wellington Point and, of course, Cleveland. The Cleveland train line is the third busiest on the TransLink train network just behind Caboolture and Ipswich. With the high demand for public transport in my electorate, I will continue to lobby for public transport services. That is why I welcome the recent announcement of doubling the carriages for the 7.55 am service from Cleveland to the city. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130451"></A>
I know that the opposition will say that this is only a plan and it takes too long. This is a major expenditure of mammoth proportions and no-one, irrespective of their political colour, can implement this project without a plan and long-term financial commitment. This $123 billion project cannot and will not be built overnight. I welcome the Premier’s announcement of this forward-thinking plan. I look forward to discussing this fantastic initiative with my constituents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130452"></A>
I catch the train into the city a few times a month. From Birkdale station it is not a short trip; it takes about 40 minutes. However, it can be an extremely productive 40 minutes and can provide some quiet time. That is why I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for Transport that commuters will be able to enjoy a more peaceful journey to and from work with the launch of a three-month quiet carriage trial on South-East Queensland train services. The trial was a result of customer feedback regarding quiet areas. Commuters have been telling us that they would like quiet areas on trains. This government is listening, and the trial is a direct response to commuter feedback. During the trial, the last carriage of all train services will be a designated quiet carriage. The trial initiative will allow commuters to read a book, work on a laptop or simply enjoy a quiet atmosphere while travelling to and from work. Of course, for the trial to be successful it relies on commuters respecting the guidelines of the quiet carriages. The trial of quiet carriages will be held on all South-East Queensland services until 22 November. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130453"></A>
This government has a good record of building things and a good record of delivering on public transport plans. The state government is undertaking the biggest upgrade of South-East Queensland train stations since services began in the 1960s, with $200 million allocated to undertake upgrades to almost one-third of train stations right across South-East Queensland. Part of this allocation of funds and commitment to station upgrades includes park-and-ride upgrades in the Redland region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130454"></A>
I was pleased to hear that work on the $465 million Eastern Busway stage 2 is now three months ahead of schedule, with the project due for completion late next year instead of early 2012. While the project seems a way from Capalaba, cutting down inner-city congestion can shave 10 minutes from a trip in and out of the city, and I hope that the rest of the busway can be progressed as smoothly and as quickly as possible. I call on the federal government, irrespective of who takes office in the next few days, to assist the state in funding the Eastern Busway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130455"></A>
On the topic of public transport, the LNP must explain to the people of the Redlands which projects it will cut after the opposition Treasury spokesperson let the cat out of the bag yesterday about their intentions. He told ABC Radio that the LNP plans to reassess projects. Which project will it cut? It will probably want to cut the construction of the new park-and-ride facility in Capalaba--a $3.4 million commitment--let alone commit to making any plans for the future. The LNP is choosing to subsidise multinational coal companies’ profits over protecting Queensland jobs and building better schools, hospitals and public transport systems. While those opposite continue to squabble, we are planning for Queensland’s future and will continue to deliver public transport infrastructure and protect jobs that the other side wants to cut. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr ELMES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Noosa--LNP) (12.13 pm): On 22 July, during DERM’s estimates deliberations, the acting minister tabled stage 1 of the Fraser Island Dingo Population Study. This is yet another attempt by this discredited department to sanitise and cover up its neglect. Fraser Island is loved by all those who have visited there, and even those who have not know and understand that it is a special place. It is relatively untouched by introduced species of plants or animals. It has high recreation values for walkers, four-wheel drive enthusiasts, fishermen, naturalists and conservationists. It is the home of about 100 locals, yet it is visited by 380,000 tourists a year whose stay on the island is, on average, four nights. That is an enormous strain on a fragile ecosystem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130458"></A>
Earlier this year, with Ted Sorensen, the member for Hervey Bay, I released a discussion paper on Fraser Island so I could not just understand the difficulties facing the island but also start putting together solutions for its future. I have come to understand that this state department, the administrator of the island, is at best incompetent and at worst duplicitous in overseeing the systematic destruction of our native dog. Section 16(1)(a) of the Nature Conservation Act 1992 states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1130459"></A>
(a)	protect the area’s exceptional scientific values and, in particular--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1130460"></A>
(i)	to ensure that the processes of nature continue unaffected in the area; and </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1130461"></A>
(ii)	to protect the area’s biological diversity to the greatest possible extent</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130462"></A>
The department at best rates a D minus when compared against what should be its bible, the Nature Conservation Act. We have finally seen the introduction of tag-along tours, yet this proposal was first put to government around 10 years ago. How many accidents and deaths could have been avoided? The island’s water quality continues to be degraded due to human activity. Both human waste and chemicals from suncreams affect some of the perched lakes, while human waste and rubbish left in the bush behind camping areas along the beach at Indian Head and elsewhere have become a pollution and health problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130463"></A>
By far the greatest discussion point has been the fate of the dingo population. There are many representatives on my side of the parliament who come from rural areas and who have little love for the dingo. I understand their views. Overwhelmingly, mainland dingoes have interbred with domestic dogs so, with one possible exception, the only remaining pure strain of our native dog exists on Fraser Island. Instead of being concerned about their survival, we have a department engaged in the ruthless and cruel--some would say deliberate--destruction of the species. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130464"></A>
The report released by the acting minister during estimates refers to 97 dingoes being removed from the database because of their known deaths--the report says from a variety of causes. I can inform the House, because I have read and seen nearly all of the autopsy reports, that the causes of death include lethal injection, shot, run over, poisoned, starvation and others. One autopsy lists under possible cause of death ‘rifle-itis’, while another states ‘half an ounce of hot lead’. Labor’s interim report shows happy snaps of a dingo family, dingoes on the beach, dingoes frolicking in the water, a dingo running up the beach with a fish in its mouth. On a normal day, those dingoes would be hazed by rangers--that is, shot with a clay pellet, moving them away from the beach and away from their main food source. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130465"></A>
The battle for Fraser Island is now being fought in the media. We have a state government peddling information, which it still considers credible, that goes back to 1990. A couple of weeks ago we saw a stage-managed tour for journalists. The result? A sanitised, all-is-well-in-paradise image relayed to the general public. By contrast, we have a small but growing group--some islanders, some from the Save the Fraser Island Dingo organisation, Indigenous people and long-term visitors--all dedicated to the island who are systematically ignored, harassed and belittled. In one case there was a legalised home invasion, the circumstances around which, if it happened when we were in government, we would see protesters in the street. It is strange how silent those protectors of our democracy have become. </Hansard-Body>

The Queensland government ignores its responsibilities. That is why I have taken steps to ensure that UNESCO, the organisation charged with overseeing World Heritage listed areas, has been advised of the island’s plight. It is now a matter of whatever it takes. Ted Sorensen and I, and those who want to save Fraser Island, will battle on until we change the government. I table the report.</Hansard-Body>

Mr RYAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Morayfield--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(12.18 pm): I rise to inform the House about a new website that will help Queenslanders access the rebates and concessions on offer from both the Queensland government and the federal government. The new Every Dollar Counts website is a one-stop shop for state and federal government concessions and makes it even easier for people to access the cost-of-living subsidies that they are eligible for. The Every Dollar Counts website is an initiative of the Queensland Labor government and is just another way that this Labor government is helping Queenslanders. Along with its nation-leading $1.3 billion concession program, this Labor government is providing real assistance to Queenslanders who need a helping hand.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130470"></A>
The Every Dollar Counts website hosts a comprehensive guide to concessions, retail discounts, rebates and assistance packages that are available to families, pensioners and Queenslanders. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, Queensland has one of the broadest concession, rebates and discount programs in Australia and, accordingly, this website will help Queenslanders know which concessions and rebates are available to them. For instance, people buying their first home, saving for a rental bond, wanting to save money on their electricity bill, investing in solar panels or visiting some of our great museums, galleries or parks, should visit the Every Dollar Counts website. I encourage all Queenslanders to visit www.qld.gov.au/everydollarcounts or phone 131304 to find out what concessions and assistance are available to them from the Queensland Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130471"></A>
The effects of the global financial crisis are still rippling through our community and this Labor government knows that people are still doing it tough. That is why this government is committed to one of the broadest concession programs in the nation and is also committed to keeping pressure down on cost-of-living issues. People in this House have heard me talk about my passion and commitment to the concept of a safety net, that principle of looking after people who are vulnerable, marginalised and disadvantaged in our community. Governments cannot be all things to all people, but we can certainly provide a helping hand where we can. This is one way that this Queensland Labor government is delivering that helping hand for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130472"></A>
Queenslanders will be interested to hear that there is a broad range of concessions and rebates available to eligible people. In fact, the range of concessions and rebates available to eligible Queenslanders is so extensive that many people will be surprised by the amount of information contained on the Every Dollar Counts website. I would like to run through some of those wonderful rebates and concessions which are available to Queenslanders and are listed on the Every Dollar Counts website. Some of those rebates and concessions were increased in the recent state budget and I would like to touch on them as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130473"></A>
For instance, the increase to the electricity rebate of up to $216 each year for eligible pensioners and seniors is one way that this Queensland Labor government is helping those people with cost-of-living issues. The water rebate has been increased up to $100 each year for eligible pensioners. The council rates rebate has been increased up to $180 each year for eligible pensioners and discounts on car registration fees and public transport fares remain available to those who are eligible for those concessions. The Queensland Labor government also funds the ClimateSmart Home Service, which assists families and all Queenslanders with their electricity bills not only in terms of saving on their power bills but also in terms of making a contribution to saving our environment. There is also the Solar Hot Water Rebate Scheme, which provides up to $1,000 to eligible households to install solar hot-water systems at their premises. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130474"></A>
There are also some home and property rebates available to eligible people. There are bond loans and there is the RentConnect service, which is an outstanding service. I must acknowledge the wonderful contribution made by the RentConnect staff in the Morayfield state electorate. They provide a wonderful service and are providing real assistance to vulnerable people in the Morayfield community. There are also deposit assistance grants and other grants available to those people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130475"></A>
This government is committed to providing support for Queenslanders who need a helping hand, unlike the opposition, which is committed to cuts--cuts to programs, cuts to support services, cuts to infrastructure. They are about making it tougher for people who need a helping hand. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Cystic Fibrosis</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Speech-Start>
</Hansard-Speech-Start>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr FOLEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maryborough--Ind) (12.23 pm): I rise to bring to the attention of the House the tragic disease cystic fibrosis and its impact on everyday Queenslanders. Many years ago, the teenage daughter of some good friends of mine, David and Eileen with whom I worked, passed away from this terrible disease. In more recent times some friends with whom we have been lifelong friends, Dean and Katrina, have a little boy who has cystic fibrosis. Their children, Asher, Samson and Noah, are just fantastic kids and Samson is a ‘life of the party’ little fellow.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130478"></A>
Anyone who has journeyed with a family who has been touched by cystic fibrosis knows full well the terrible impact that it has on that family. Yet Cystic Fibrosis Queensland is proactively delivering preventative health information, support and services, medical equipment, oxygen, counselling for families, respite services and metropolitan and regional health professional education. The work that Cystic Fibrosis Queensland does in this regard saves the Queensland taxpayer and Queensland Health a heck of a lot of money.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130479"></A>
Cystic fibrosis presents a very serious health issue in the community that has a significant impact on Queensland hospitals. This government really needs to pitch in and give urgent attention and support to Cystic Fibrosis Queensland even if for no reason other than the money saved in its own Health budget. Cystic fibrosis, or CF, affects only a small percentage of Queenslanders. However, its impact on the lives of those individuals with the disease, those nearest to them and the health system is very substantial. It is an insidious, debilitating disease and is the most common life-threatening, recessive genetic condition affecting Australian children. There is no cure and the average life expectancy is only 38 years. As I have said, I have seen parents who have lost teenagers and attended their funeral. That has left a lasting impact on my life.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130480"></A>
Every four days a child is born with cystic fibrosis. It is an extremely serious illness that mainly affects the lungs and digestive system. Breathing and digesting food causes significant problems, with young patients requiring constant medication and treatment. Babies, children and young adults who live with cystic fibrosis have to take up to 40 tablets every day just to break down food and every day they can have up to two hours of physiotherapy to help them breathe. For people living with cystic fibrosis, a small cold can develop into a life-threatening chest infection and three weeks of treatment in hospital. Repeated chest infections can permanently damage their lungs, making it harder for them to breathe. At some point in their life, people with cystic fibrosis may need a lung transplant, which is often their only chance of survival. Of course, this places a huge stress on the entire family physically, emotionally and financially. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130481"></A>
Of 4,422,820 Queenslanders, there are currently 740 people living with cystic fibrosis, representing one-quarter of all Australians living with cystic fibrosis. While this only represents 1.6 per cent of the Queensland population, their lifetime care comes at a cost of millions of dollars per person. Frankly, the Queensland government could do a lot more towards funding this organisation. So much of the effort that these parents put in, such as the grind of doing physiotherapy with their children, is a task that they take on gladly to see their children survive but, obviously, it puts a great deal of pressure on those particular families. The best practice treatment and management of cystic fibrosis on a daily basis is crucial to the person’s quality of life and their longevity. I can do nothing other than urge the government to get behind funding this great organisation which, in the end, saves the Health budget millions of dollars and also saves the lives of some of our most vulnerable Queenslanders. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Multicultural Festivals</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

</Hansard-Speech-Start>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs ATTWOOD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Ommaney--ALP) (12.28 pm): This year I have been delighted to be able to represent the Bligh government at a number of multicultural festivals and consultation policy forums. This wide array of festivals has been an exciting time for the diverse cultures we have in Queensland. Just this weekend I travelled to Bundaberg to attend its annual festival. This is the second time I have visited this festival since becoming the Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs 18 months ago. The theme of the festival, peace and harmony, reflected the feelings of thousands of people who attended that day. There was a lot of goodwill and support for the citizenship ceremony conducted that morning. I congratulate the local member, Jack Dempsey, and the Rotary Club of Bundaberg Sunrise on their support for and coordination of this great event. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130484"></A>
Queensland is now well known and respected for its rich multicultural history. Indeed, it is something that we are proud of and celebrate. Queensland is home to people from more than 200 different cultures, all of whom have come here seeking a better life for themselves, their families and their children. Australia’s humble beginnings lay the very foundations that led to the multicultural society that we now live in. From the Chinese who settled in the goldfields in the 1870s to those from European nations who were displaced by war in the early 20th century and the Vietnamese in the 1970s, people from many countries have come for many reasons and created their new homes here. Communities across the state continue to embrace the notion of a fair go for everyone, regardless of where they come from, what language they speak or what religion they follow. The Queensland government welcomes this diversity and is committed to building a fair and equitable society. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130485"></A>
Our multicultural festivals provide an opportunity to build bridges between cultures and increase appreciation of and respect for diversity. I enjoyed the opportunity to attend a number of festivals in South-East Queensland, including the Iraqi festival. This culture has a deep and rich history that dates back to ancient times as Iraq was home to some of the world’s earliest civilisations such as Sumer, Babylon and Assyria. The Vishu festival originates from the state of Kerala in South India and marks the first day of the Malayalam year. The Ipswich Global Fiesta, organised by the Ipswich City Council, celebrates Ipswich’s cultural diversity and increases community engagement in the region. The ethnic youth ministry multicultural fiesta gathered young people from various ethnic communities in the Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane to share in and celebrate the richness of their cultural heritage through food, fellowship and entertainment. The Sinhala and Tamil new year celebrations recognise the contribution of Australia’s oldest migrant groups. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130486"></A>
Such celebrations build bridges within cultures. For young people in particular the festive environment is ideal for connecting with and sharing their cultural heritage with the wider community. We live in a complex world and this makes it especially important that our youth develop a strong sense of belonging and pride in their identity, which of course includes their cultural identity. I congratulate the organisers for their continued efforts so that people from many different backgrounds can be sure that culture remains strong in Queensland while sharing this with the wider community. As I have said, the Queensland government has a strong vision for a fair, equitable and inclusive society. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130487"></A>
I also briefly mention the government’s review on Queensland’s multicultural policy. In October last year, Multicultural Affairs Queensland launched extensive public consultations seeking people’s views on how the state’s multicultural policies can be improved for the benefit of all Queenslanders. This review was about planning for the future of Queensland and deciding what we would like our state to look like. The government has held many community workshops across the state, attended by cultural groups, refugees, migrants, peak community bodies and many non-government service organisations. I have attended workshops in Emerald, Gladstone, Hervey Bay, Bundaberg and the Sunshine Coast and was impressed with the numbers present and the contribution people made to the discussion topics. We held these consultations because we recognise that community input is vital to good government. We know that for policy to be effective it must truly reflect the needs of the people it is meant to support.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130488"></A>
Some of the important issues raised included the recognition of prior qualifications, the underemployment of migrant groups, training and educational opportunities, information about services and strengthening multicultural identities to name but a few. The total number of submissions was outstanding, with 240 submissions received. This review is designed to ensure that the policy continues to be responsive and relevant to the changing needs and demographics of Queensland. I look forward to the ideas raised in the community contributing to a multicultural policy that is bigger, stronger and more inclusive than ever before. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A ID="pgfId-1130501"></A>
Today I introduce the Education and Training Legislation (Skills Queensland) Amendment Bill 2010 into parliament. This bill will establish Skills Queensland, an independent skills commission to lead the state’s skills and workforce development. The bill will also amend the Education (Queensland College of Teachers) Act 2005 to strengthen the child protection measures within the teaching environment. Skills are vital to Queensland’s economic prosperity. For workers, qualifications represent the passport to increased employment and earnings potential. For employers, a skilled workforce is flexible, innovative and productive.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130502"></A>
Queensland’s skills system is a formidable industry sector in its own right. Education and training is now Australia’s largest services exporter and is worth $2.4 billion a year to Queensland’s economy. Queensland’s vocational education and training or VET sector has over 1,140 active training providers, which is more than any other state or territory. Queensland now trains about 45 per cent of the nation’s school based apprentices and trainees. Again, that is more than any other state or territory. A higher percentage of unemployed Queenslanders engaging in the skills system find employment after the completion of their studies than the national average. Despite the strength of Queensland’s VET sector, more can still be done.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130503"></A>
Queensland’s strong population and economic growth over the past decade has meant that maintaining a high participation rate in the skills system has been difficult. The boom years leading up to 2007 stretched our system, with providers struggling to keep up with a growing demand for skills. The global financial crisis presented other challenges to the system as providers struggled to shift their training effort to meet a rapidly changing demand for skills. With the state budget predicting a return to strong growth in the years ahead, it is now time to ensure our system is focused on the future. That is why the Queensland government proposes to establish Skills Queensland, a statutory body to lead reform to Queensland’s skills system to create a more flexible and demand-driven system that meets the needs of industry, communities and the economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130504"></A>
Skills Queensland’s key function will be to advise government on skills and workforce development and skilled migration. It will develop a skills and workforce development investment plan, a five-year plan with a 10-year whole-of-economy outlook that will be renewed annually. This will be the primary way for Skills Queensland to identify priorities, over a five-year period, for investment in skills, qualifications and workforce development. Through the plan, Skills Queensland will be able to recommend how government resources should be allocated to meet the state’s skills development needs and to respond to emerging industry opportunities and regional and global economic factors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130505"></A>
Non-government investment in vocational education and training in Queensland is relatively low compared to other Australian jurisdictions. The government is looking forward to employers taking further responsibility for skilling their workforce. Queensland is on the front foot in meeting this challenge with the recently announced CSG/LNG investment fund. This fund leverages resources dollar for dollar from industry to meet the skills needs of this new and emerging industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130506"></A>
In its first six months, Skills Queensland will focus on developing and implementing industry engagement mechanisms to establish an identity amongst industry stakeholders and support its advisory functions and the development of the inaugural skills and workforce development investment plan. It will also start to look at opportunities to leverage greater contribution from industry. Skills Queensland will have access to strategic purchasing funding held by the government. The funding will be allocated towards the skills and workforce priorities identified by Skills Queensland and will be used to leverage funding from industry through co-investment. Access to the fund will be subject to government approval, taking account of the impact on providers, in particular TAFE institutes, to ensure viability and sustainability into the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130507"></A>
In the future, when the body has established its credentials with industry and government, the funding arrangements may evolve whereby Skills Queensland could be provided its own funding to support its strategic investments and brokerage arrangements with industry. Skills Queensland will be a genuine partnership whereby industry and government can share the challenge of meeting Queensland’s future skill needs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132233"></A>
Skills Queensland will be led by seven industry representatives with direct experience in industry, training or employment sectors, one of whom will be the chair. It will also comprise the directors-general from the employment and training portfolios. Industry representatives bring commercial acumen, an understanding of emerging industries and technologies, supply and demand priorities for skilled labour and economic drivers for business. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130508"></A>
The establishment of Skills Queensland will strengthen industry leadership of and investment in skills and workforce development in Queensland. It will also increase industry confidence in and ownership of our skills system. Government will continue to play a key role in funding, implementing and administering skills and workforce development strategies. However, these activities will be informed, and well informed I believe, by Skills Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130509"></A>
I turn now to the College of Teachers legislation. The bill amends provisions relating to teachers who are convicted of disqualifying offences. Currently, the college must cancel the registration of an approved teacher convicted of a disqualifying offence after 1 January 2006 who is sentenced to imprisonment. That teacher then becomes an excluded person and cannot apply for teacher registration. The teacher cannot appeal the decision to cancel registration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130510"></A>
However, where in a limited number of cases a teacher surrenders their registration before they were convicted of a disqualifying offence and sentenced to an imprisonment order, the person is currently able to reapply to the Queensland College of Teachers for registration. The bill will address this by amending the definition of excluded person to include persons who previously held teacher registration or permission to teach who are convicted of a disqualifying offence after 1 January 2006 and sentenced to an imprisonment order. This means that, even if the person surrendered their registration prior to their conviction for a disqualifying offence, they will be excluded from ever again applying for teacher registration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130511"></A>
The bill will also ensure that the college is notified of the outcome of all investigations started by employing authorities involving an allegation of harm caused or likely to be caused to a child because of the conduct of a teacher. Currently, the employing authority is required to notify the college when it commences this type of investigation and then notify the college if the teacher is dismissed after the investigation or resigns during or after the investigation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130512"></A>
However, the employing authority is not strictly required to notify the college of the outcome of every commenced investigation--for example, if the investigation does not result in the teacher’s dismissal or resignation. This bill amends the act to clarify that, if an employing authority is required to notify the college that an investigation has commenced, it must also then notify the college of the outcome of that investigation. This will ensure that the college is kept well informed about all investigations and can instigate its own investigation or take disciplinary action against the teacher if appropriate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130513"></A>
The bill also amends the act to make minor and technical consequential amendments arising out of the amendments to the act in the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Act 2010. The amendments are supported by the three education sectors. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

In 2008, the Productivity Commission published a comprehensive review of Australia’s consumer policy framework. This review found that Australia had a sound consumer policy and product safety system but highlighted areas in which regulation could be substantially improved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130528"></A>
The shape of the current consumer policy reforms was agreed in broad terms by COAG in October 2008, and further defined through a national cooperative process engaging the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs and officials groups from all jurisdictions. The resulting Australian Consumer Law, or ACL, represents the most significant overhaul of Australia’s consumer laws in 25 years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

The ACL is founded on a well-established core of consumer provisions from the Trade Practices Act 1974. In addition, the ACL captures best-practice approaches to consumer protection by drawing on some of the beneficial consumer provisions that have been independently developed by the states and territories. The ACL will provide to all Australians, consumers and businesses alike the benefits of a national product safety system. Finally, the ACL adopts some aspects of consumer protection entirely new to Australian consumer law, such as the consumer guarantees system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130530"></A>
In a practical sense, the bill applies the ACL as Queensland law through amendments to the Fair Trading Act 1989 and consequential amendments to related acts. The Commonwealth Trade Practices Act will be renamed the Competition and Consumer Act--a name which is much more accessible and reflects the focus of Australia’s main law which regulates markets.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130531"></A>
The implementation of the ACL is a key element of COAG’s seamless national economy reform agenda. Under the terms of the National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy, the Commonwealth and all states and territories have agreed to apply the ACL by 1 January 2011. From 1 January, Queensland and Australian consumers will enjoy the benefits of consistent rights wherever they live, and Queensland businesses will obtain greater efficiencies through a single, simplified national law. The ACL will cover a greater range of consumer transactions and provide a broader range of protections than currently provided through the existing Fair Trading Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130532"></A>
Key features of the ACL include new unfair contract terms provisions, which will allow consumers to challenge potentially unfair terms in contracts and allow the courts to declare unfair terms of contracts to be void. The new consumer guarantees will replace the system of statutory implied conditions and warranties, which is generally not well understood by either consumers or businesses. The consumer guarantees provisions will provide consumers with clearer guidance about their rights to redress when problems occur. They will also make business obligations clearer.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130533"></A>
The ACL’s unsolicited consumer agreement provisions are largely based upon the Bligh government’s family-friendly trading hours as a best-practice provision. The law contains express supplier obligations about the way in which consumers are approached and about the making of agreements, including permitted visiting hours, disclosing the purpose and identity of the supplier, and duties imposed on suppliers to leave premises on request and inform a consumer of their rights to terminate the agreement.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130534"></A>
The law prohibits misleading or deceptive conduct and includes provisions prohibiting people who are operating in trade or commerce from engaging in unconscionable conduct towards consumers or businesses. These prohibitions will operate on the same basis as those currently in the Trade Practices Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130535"></A>
The law will also deliver an improved product safety regime for Queenslanders for consumer goods and product related services. While the Commonwealth government will assume responsibility for implementing permanent bans and safety standards on consumer goods and product related services nationally, states and territories will retain their power to issue interim bans for consumer goods and product related services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130536"></A>
States and territories will also be able to propose permanent bans and new standards if they encounter problems with particular consumer goods and product related services. This new approach will bring more certainty for business and consumers about product safety laws in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130537"></A>
The law also provides for a slightly broader definition of a consumer to that currently in Queensland’s Fair Trading Act. It will provide better cover for consumers purchasing goods not typically used for domestic or household purposes and for some business purchases. The ACL also provides regulators with a broader range of enforcement tools, with potentially higher financial penalties compared to those provided by the Fair Trading Act, enabling a range of proportionate responses to breaches of the law.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130538"></A>
The Australian Consumer Law will strengthen and broaden consumer protection for all Queenslanders. It introduces reforms that will significantly reduce regulatory complexity for businesses and takes Australia further towards a seamless national economy across an increasingly national marketplace. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130539"></A>
The bill will also implement a July 2008 COAG agreement to adopt a nationally consistent approach to the regulation of the private security industry. As part of these reforms, Queensland agreed to introduce mandatory fingerprinting of security providers to improve identity and probity checking. The security industry can be infiltrated by criminal elements, as evidenced through investigations and reports recently completed by the Australian Crime Commission and the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130540"></A>
Fingerprinting improves the initial identification of licensees and has an important role to play in improving probity checks because a more thorough criminal history check can be obtained on licence applicants. Ongoing probity, for the duration of a licence, is also improved as fingerprints can be checked against ‘latent’ prints left at crime scenes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130541"></A>
The amendments will require applicants for a security provider licence to consent to having their fingerprints taken prior to the chief executive issuing a licence. The legislation will also provide for the chief executive to require all current licence holders to be fingerprinted before renewal of their licence.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130542"></A>
The amendments aim to minimise the impact on the privacy of security providers while recognising that security providers occupy positions of trust and are responsible for public safety and the protection of property. The act will also be amended to include terrorism offences in the list of disqualifying offences regardless of where such offences are committed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130543"></A>
The introduction of more stringent identity and probity checks will help build a safer community and better harmonise Australia’s security provider laws. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr NICHOLLS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Clayfield--LNP) (12.50 pm): The Motor Accident Insurance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill principally amends three acts. For some of my colleagues, and I am not sure about the Treasurer’s side, this piece of legislation takes the eye-glazing award of the year. I will certainly try to make it not quite as bad as it would otherwise seem. I want to deal with three major parts of the legislation in turn. The first relates to the Motor Accident Insurance Act. </Hansard-Body>

The changes to the Motor Accident Insurance Act are designed to implement the announcement made by the Treasurer at budget time to ban commissions and inducements paid to third parties. This, we are told, will save motorists in Queensland the grand total of between $20 and $24. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130558"></A>

 </Hansard-Bold>
As the member for Barron River says, every dollar counts. That is certainly the case with this government as it scrimps and scrounges for every dollar and increases taxes mercilessly as it tries to find every dollar in order to get some control of its budget which, I can remind the member for Barron River, is going to be in deficit to the tune of $1.4 billion this year and will be in deficit each and every year over the forward estimates of the budget totalling something like $6.4 billion. As they tax the people of Queensland more and more, the scrimping and scrounging goes on on the Labor side of this House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130560"></A>
The Treasurer dressed up this change as some sort of miraculous announcement stemming from a deep-seated desire on the part of the parliamentary members of the Australian Labor Party to make motoring more affordable for Queensland motorists. What is more, he dressed it up in all the finery of a budget announcement as if it were some sort of magnanimous gesture that comes at the cost of government revenue--almost as though it were a tax cut. The Treasurer and the Labor Party expect that Queensland motorists will thank them and this government for their generosity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130561"></A>
We know that, despite the Treasurer’s efforts to dress it up otherwise, this concession does not come at any cost to the revenue base of Queensland. It is not some form of tax relief able to be met from the abundance and good management of the Queensland exchequer by the Treasurer. We know, Queensland motorists, more importantly, know and Queensland businesses also know that it is another dodge by an increasingly dodgy government. We also know that this Bligh Labor government has not simply abandoned the Queensland motorists; it has actively pursued a policy to drive them into penury and to make motoring almost unaffordable for the average Queenslander. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130562"></A>
Motor vehicle charges and costs affect nearly all Queenslanders. In our decentralised state with its vast distances, motor vehicle costs and charges take on an added importance. They are not a luxury. Quite simply, Queenslanders have to travel further to work, to play, to get to school, to get to the doctor, to see friends and relatives, and the list goes on. In recognition of this, Queensland for many years had no fuel tax and had low rates of registration and transfer duty. But under Labor this has all changed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130563"></A>
It was the Borbidge-Sheldon coalition government that took decisive action to protect Queensland’s tax-free-fuel status after the High Court ruling on franchise and licence fees found them to be unconstitutional. It was the then coalition that took action to ensure motorists were not slugged an extra 8.2c a litre at the petrol pump. I might mention that, at the same time, it was Joan Sheldon as Treasurer who removed the tolls from the Sunshine Motorway in order to make motoring more affordable in that part of South-East Queensland. She was truly a reforming Treasurer. She was someone who had the interests of Queenslanders at heart and actually did something to protect Queensland motorists and not penalise them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130564"></A>
I come back to the costs of motoring. It was Labor, with its undying hatred of the internal combustion engine, that was always on the lookout for a way to scrap the Fuel Subsidy Scheme. The Minister for Main Roads hates motor vehicles. He wants to build roads that no-one can drive on. Why else would he stand up and support--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130565"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I rise to a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I find the member’s comments offensive and ask them to be withdrawn. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130566"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I withdraw. The Minister for Main Roads comes into this place each and every day and extols the virtues of his road-building program but then goes out and taxes the very motorists who would use the roads that he is building. He increases the fees and charges. One has to wonder what his motivation is in doing so. He stands up in here and supports a budget that increases the costs and charges for motorists across Queensland. At the same time, he cuts $250 million from the Main Roads budget this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130567"></A>
I go back to the history of the fuel tax in Queensland. It was Peter Beattie who wanted to do away with it. He instead changed the registration fees payable. He tried it on a number of occasions but the Queensland public and the Queensland motoring public woke up to the pea-and-thimble trick that he was trying to perpetrate on them and forced him to back down. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130568"></A>
There were various other attempts to modify the scheme in subsequent years, culminating in the current Treasurer’s stillborn attempts to introduce a scheme that relied on motorists producing a licence with details either electronically embedded in it or stuck to the back of it with a sticker to claim the discounted amount. This crazy scheme also relied on the retailer having signs with about three different prices on them outside their fuel stations to show the true cost of the fuel so consumers could see whether they were getting the full benefit of the rebate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130569"></A>
If ever we wondered where Ken Henry got the idea for a simple super mining tax from, we do not have to go any further. He rang up the Queensland Treasurer and spoke to him and said, ‘Can you design a super mining tax for me?’ That is where he got the information from. That plan of the Treasurer’s was abandoned after several million dollars had been spent on it. It was cast onto the trash heap of abandoned ideas which is gradually getting more and more full as this Labor government ages. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130570"></A>
Eventually, all pretence at trying to keep the fuel subsidy in place was dropped. After telling the people of Queensland that she would not kick them while they were down and after promising that the government would continue to deliver a fuel subsidy scheme, the Premier and her Treasurer did just the opposite. They did kick Queenslanders while they were down. They effectively introduced a 9.2c a litre fuel tax for all Queensland motorists. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130571"></A>
Three years ago the government increased the transfer duty on motor vehicles across the range. Four cylinders, six cylinders, eight cylinders--it does not matter. Transfer duties increased by between 50 and 100 per cent. The transfer duty on an average six-cylinder car--an ordinary Falcon or Commodore--goes up from $300 to $575. Annual registration fees jumped by between 17 and 23 per cent depending on the engine size. For an average six-cylinder car the cost of registration is now over $800 a year. This year alone the car registration fees will increase by another three per cent--by the rate of inflation. To top it all off, there has been an increase in tolls from 1 July of up to 33 per cent as the government tries to max out the return on the rushed sale of Queensland Motorways. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130572"></A>
Queensland has become the most expensive state in Australia in which to own and operate a family car. It is all down to Anna Bligh and her Labor administration. That is why we have announced a vehicle registration freeze when elected. Queenslanders deserve a tangible sign that their government cares about their everyday costs. A registration freeze is one way of showing that. </Hansard-Body>

Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Before the lunch adjournment I was reflecting on the great motoring rip-off that was being perpetrated on motorists in Queensland by the Labor Party and in particular the increases in charges and costs, whether it be fuel, registration fees or transfer duty. I also want to reflect on some of the comments that have been made about the Treasurer’s proposal to prohibit the payment of inducements in relation to the compulsory third-party insurance scheme by the Motor Trades Association of Queensland, which represents motor dealers--motor dealers who in the main are small businesses, motor dealers who in the main are struggling, motor dealers who in the main employ many thousands of people and motor dealers whom both the Treasurer and I have some sort of knowledge, understanding, background and history with. In its letter to the Treasurer the Motor Trades Association of Queensland said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130576"></A>
The announcement by you to reduce the CTP ceiling by $24 at the expense of dealers and legislate to ban the payment of commissions and other inducements is nothing more than a smokescreen for the government hikes in other statutory charges over the past two years.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1130577"></A>
The organisation goes on to say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130578"></A>
Over the past two years this office has received numerous complaints about the costs of car registrations but has never received a complaint about the cost of CTP, so the cost of collecting statutory charges, including the delivery of CTP on behalf of the government, was never the issue.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1130579"></A>
So that was never the issue in terms of the costs of registering and running a motor vehicle.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130580"></A>
One of the great acts of a scoundrel is to get someone else to pay the freight and then take credit for it, and that is the act of this government with this amendment. The motor industry is not the milch cow which the government thinks it is. Latest figures show that, while record high monthly new vehicle sales results were achieved nationally, Queensland achieved record low monthly results. So nationally there were high figures but Queensland had low figures--in fact, the lowest according to the MTAQ since 2004, with used car sales travelling not much better, with the 2010 average monthly sales at the lowest levels since 2002. So while delivering a small saving to the motorist, small business is being asked in the main to pay the cost. It is no wonder that businesses in Queensland are doing it so hard and no wonder that small and medium enterprises in Queensland have lost faith in this Labor government and its management of the economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130581"></A>
I also have here a response from an average motorist who has written to me, and I am sure many other members have received the same sort of correspondence. He states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130582"></A>
Dear Tim Nicholls</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130583"></A>
Is Andrew Fraser joking? They have found a $20 saving in CTP but they have increased car rego and fuel beyond people’s reach.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1130584"></A>
He goes on to say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130585"></A>
Tell him on behalf of me and fellow taxpayers to go join a circus, because his work is an embarrassment to this state.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1130586"></A>
He goes on to say--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130587"></A>
This saving is the price of one meal for me and my family.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1130588"></A>
That is how the change to the CTP scheme manufactured by the Treasurer is measured by a variety of people.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130589"></A>
What were the alternatives to what has been put forward and what is being considered by the legislation today? We do not know because the report by the Motor Accident Insurance Commission into fees and charges commissioned by the Treasurer was taken to cabinet and is now covered by the shroud of cabinet secrecy. So any alternatives cannot be canvassed or considered and the strength or weakness of the case in relation to the CTP prohibition on inducements and on commissions cannot be measured. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130590"></A>
The CTP scheme relies on CTP insurers offering the insurance at a price within a range set by the commission. It is not something that a true free market sets but is in fact regulated, and that is because of the element of compulsion. Madam Deputy Speaker, neither you nor I, or in fact any motorist obeying the law in Queensland, has a choice with regard to CTP. We have to register a vehicle if we want to drive on a public road. So as a government mandated service it requires a degree of regulation--that takes it out of the free market--and the government via the MAIC sets a ceiling above which an insurer cannot charge and also sets a floor, and it is primarily the ceiling that we are concerned about here.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130591"></A>
In setting that ceiling the MAIC takes into account all of the costs of the CTP scheme, and over time that has come to include the commissions that have been paid to third parties, who predominantly are motor dealers. So in setting the total amount of the insurance levy, the commission gets information and works out what the cost of delivering that service will be. There are also some other provisions in section 12 of the legislation that deal with what the costs and charges are. It is a compulsory scheme--we do not have a chance to opt out of it--and the prices for the insurance and the provision of the service are set by regulation. Therefore, it would seem appropriate that any change, such as that which we are considering here today, that comes about as a result of an inquiry being carried out by a government body should be supported by the inquiry document being released to the public. Indeed, at the briefing on the bill yesterday I asked about that report and I was informed that it had been sent to cabinet as it contains commercial-in-confidence information from the insurers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130592"></A>
So what do we have? All we have here are the statements in the explanatory notes, and I will read them. The explanatory notes state that a review of the scheme recently conducted by the commission ‘identified high policy and acquisition costs associated with the scheme’. But there is no explanation of what that actually means--that is, high policy and acquisition costs associated with the scheme. There is no further information provided. The explanatory notes go on to say--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130593"></A>
It has also contributed to the tendency of insurers over several years to file their premiums ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130594"></A>
It does not say it actually was the cause of it. It says that it has contributed to the tendency, so it does not even mean that it is occurring all of the time. It is a very weak statement out of a report that we cannot see, test and assess. We do not know what the real options and costs will be because they are hidden in cabinet-in-confidence documents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130595"></A>
The question we have to ask is: what else did the report say? Previous reports have been made public, and so should this one. We should know what else that report contained, other than the very scant detail that we have been provided with in the explanatory notes. So my question to the Treasurer in this respect is: will the Treasurer table the report, with any commercially sensitive information deleted, so that Queenslanders can see what the report says? Until that happens, we have to take the government on trust. Unfortunately, that is not a commodity that this government has a lot of.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130596"></A>
When we look at some of the other aspects of what could go into the cost of a compulsory third-party insurance premium, we need to look at section 12 of the act. It includes the insurer’s premium--that is, the cost from the insurance company--and we have discussed that. That is where we are told that there is a tendency for the insurer to file their premiums at the ceiling. However, there is also the statutory insurance scheme levy--that is, the cost of the government actually running the scheme. That is a component of it as well. Then there is the hospital and emergency services levy which funds some component of the running of our public hospitals, because when people are injured in an accident they rely on the public services primarily in those hospitals to treat them immediately after an accident.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130597"></A>
The nominal defendant levy covers people who are injured but who cannot identify the vehicle that caused the injury or where that vehicle is driven in an uninsured or unregistered state. So that provides a safety net for those circumstances. There is also the ubiquitous administration fee. It is interesting to note in the annual report for 2008-09--and I am indebted to the Parliamentary Library’s research note which came out at lunchtime--that the commissioner filed a statement in his report in which he said that he believed that the main factors pushing up premium prices were a downward change in interest rate markets and an increase in claim costs, especially claims for economic loss. The commissioner also stated that it has also been reported that industry sources believe that the current pricing reflected tight margins in CTP.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130598"></A>
So there we have the commissioner in the report, according to the Parliamentary Library research note, identifying the main factors pushing up the premium prices as being a downward charge in the interest rate markets--so as insurers invest the premiums they receive an income from it; as the interest rates goes down, they receive less money so they have to earn a profit and so they push up the price--and an increase in claim costs. So as there are more motorists on the road, there are more accidents and perhaps, because of a tendency to give greater payouts to people who are injured, there has been an increase in the cost of the scheme and an increase in the premiums in order to cover those costs as set. Those premiums are usually calculated by actuaries. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130599"></A>
When we look at some of the functions that are carried out under that scheme, we look at the cost of the Motor Accident Insurance Commission itself. The Motor Accident Insurance Commission was set up to administer this compulsory third-party scheme and it does such things as supervises insurers, establishes and reviews prudential standards, monitors the management of claims and fixes the insurance. It also does a number of other worthwhile things, such as provide funds for rehabilitation, research and education, promotion and, if funds are available, financially contributing towards regular safety and roadworthiness inspections. So there are a whole range of components that go into the Motor Accident Insurance Commission’s cost base that have to be covered by part of the CTP insurance claim under section 12 of the act.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130600"></A>
But we do not know if any of those components have any impact on the increase in the cost of the compulsory third-party scheme and the calculation by the Motor Accident Insurance Commission of the ceiling and the floor for the scheme. We do not know, because the report that the MAIC did into the scheme, on the Treasurer’s instruction, has been shuffled off to cabinet and is now held to be cabinet-in-confidence. I think that is a great pity because, where we have someone saying that these are savings that can be driven out of the private sector, we should also look to see if there are any savings that can be driven out of the public sector. That is, can the public sector do more with less or are they doing everything that they need to do with the right amount of money? We do not know. Maybe it is, maybe it is not, but we have not seen the report so we cannot see whether that is the case or not. We do not know if savings are available to motorists other than this saving that is being proposed in the legislation here today. </Hansard-Body>

This process is shrouded in secrecy and, I have to say, it smacks of government opportunism. One has to wonder why the report has not been made public. I do not believe that the excuse of cabinet-in-confidence because of sensitive information is sufficiently adequate or could not be dealt with in such a way as to provide the details and the information that would be required in order to enable a fair and full assessment of all the costs to be made available.</Hansard-Body>

 I want to turn now to the amendments proposed to the Queensland Competition Authority Act. Let me make it clear to those opposite and anyone else who might try to make mischief out of the debate on this legislation: the LNP has consistently and constantly opposed the rushed and poorly thought through privatisation program promoted and promulgated by Labor in Queensland. We opposed it when the legislation was brought into this place last year. We fought it in last year’s budget debate until four o’clock in the morning, when the government guillotined debate and pushed through the legislation. We oppose it despite the government’s attempts to cloud the issue this morning and we will continue to oppose it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130603"></A>
I will tell members why we oppose it. The privatisation program represents a fundamental failure of the operation of democracy in this state. The ALP did not tell the people before the March 2009 election that privatisation was on its agenda. The LNP categorically supports the right of voters to be informed about these types of decisions at the ballot box before they make their decision. The integrity of and faith in the electoral system requires it. There is the rushed nature of the privatisation, the lack of a consideration of alternatives and the discussion of those alternatives in the public domain. The Premier claims that the alternative to her program is massive service delivery cuts, but that is simply more deceit and so spurious that it is simply unbecoming of a Premier of this state who knows better. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130604"></A>
I heard those claims this morning in relation to a discussion about the duplication of the Gateway Bridge. The duplication of the Gateway Bridge was, in fact, funded entirely out of the operations of the business case for the duplication of the Gateway Bridge. It was funded before the privatisation was coming on and the business case was in place before the privatisation was coming on. So let us not get confused about projects that are going ahead and projects that are not going ahead because of privatisation. Projects like the duplication of the Gateway Bridge were underway before privatisation was coming along. The duplication of the Gateway Bridge was being carried out based on the fact that there was a case that was put forward by QTC and by Treasury that would enable the state to afford to build and deliver it within the confines of the Gateway Motorway company. All the debt that was taken on in relation to that project is securely locked away in the Gateway Motorway company. It is not the debt of the state of Queensland in the sense that it is in a position that it would change if the debt was taken off it. </Hansard-Body>

 (Ms Farmer): Order! I ask members to direct their comments through the chair.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1130610"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Let us not go down that path, because that is not the correct path to go down. There are alternatives to this rushed privatisation. They exist and this government has refused to consider them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130611"></A>
We also oppose privatisation because of the state of the market and the chance that the assets will be sold for less than their full value. We have already seen with the sale of Forestry Plantations Queensland a sale price that was substantially less than that which was achieved by the Victorian government almost exactly a decade ago for a very similar class of assets. We are convinced that this is a fire sale and that this will continue to be the case in the foreseeable future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130612"></A>
The other issue that causes us to oppose this privatisation is that the asset sale is not a long-term solution to the structural problems in Queensland’s budget. The Labor government continues to fail to address the issue of debt and deficit. It fails to control its own expenses growth. As I have indicated earlier, deficits continue over the out years in the budget forecasts. That means quite simply that the Queensland government is spending more than it is earning. Once these assets are sold in an effort to bring the budget back into some form of shape, unless that fundamental flaw is fixed up--unless that structural deficit is addressed--we will find ourselves in exactly the same position in two or three years time, except that the assets will have been sold. So the capital value will not be there and the income from those assets, whether that be by dividends or by way of direct revenue, will not be there. So we have opposed a flawed privatisation agenda and only the election of an LNP government can stop it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130613"></A>
This bill, insofar as it deals with the Queensland Competition Authority, is not about the sale of parts of Queensland Rail; it is about the third-party access regime that applies in Queensland to monopoly assets that impact on productivity in Queensland. It applies not just to railways but to ports and other monopoly services. It applies whether that asset is publicly or privately owned. At the moment in Queensland, there are two services that are currently declared services under the Queensland Competition Authority Act. They are the entire rail transport services provided by Queensland’s intrastate rail network and the coal-handling services at the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130614"></A>
Most people who do not live in the rarefied air of competition policy theory--and I think that is most people--are entitled to be somewhat confused by these amendments and what they mean. In essence, we have here an attempt to resolve a turf war in Queensland’s favour. There has been a review of the competition principles that apply in Queensland to monopoly service providers whether they are publicly or privately owned. Those services can be things such as port facilities, electricity transmission services, railways, water and waste water pipeline services and treatment services. That is one aspect of where we are today. There has also been an application from Asciano, the operator of Pacific National rail services, to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for the Central Queensland coal network--and that is the four networks that make up that Central Queensland coal network--to be declared under the national access regime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130615"></A>
There are two competing regimes in relation to competition and provision of access to monopoly services. Although not specifically related to the sale of Queensland Rail and Queensland Rail assets, it is the case that the changes proposed in this bill have been spurred on by the government’s decision to sell off the QR coal freight business and the Central Queensland coal network. They are not the specific reasons for it, but the sale has brought the problem to a head. There is the review process, which is agreed under COAG, and then the application by Asciano under the national competition principles to have the Queensland service declared. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130616"></A>
If we are going to go into that, it is appropriate to set out what exactly is happening with the sale. QR Ltd is the current owner and operator of all the passenger and freight rail businesses in Queensland. It also owns and maintains the intrastate rail tracks--the internal rail tracks. These separate components of QR’s business are each identified, and the terminology is fairly widely used, as the above-rail and below-rail components of the QR Ltd business. The above-rail is the actual business of carrying passengers and freight and entering into contracts and running, owning and operating rolling stock. Below-rail is the sleepers and rails and all the work that goes into the network services. As I said earlier, those above- and below-rail services are currently declared under the Queensland access regime and that allows third-party access. We have examples of that third-party access with the operation of Pacific National at the moment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130617"></A>
As from 1 July this year a new organisation called QR National has been formed, although, as I understand it, that organisation is not a company but, in fact, a trading name. It is QR Ltd trading as QR National who will own the coal freight and general freight business--that is, the above-rail business of QR Ltd. A wholly owned subsidiary, called QR Network, and that is presumably a proprietary limited company, will effectively own, via a long-term lease, the Central Queensland coal network comprising the Newlands, Goonyella, Blackwater and Moura rail network infrastructure--that is, the below-rail component of the QR Network. We will have QR National running the business of coal and general freight and we will have QR Network, a subsidiary, owning the tracks underneath--a vertically integrated monopoly. What is left is the passenger rail business--that is, the above-rail business of carrying passengers and the passenger and general freight rail network infrastructure, the sleepers and tracks and the network remnants that are not part of the Central Queensland network. Those remnants will be owned by a government owned corporation to be called Queensland Rail. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130618"></A>
So we have those two bodies currently being considered in terms of the proposed asset sales. Once we have our head around that structure we need to deal with the issues of economic rent and monopoly rents. That is where the competition policy and the Queensland Competition Authority Act comes in. Clearly, there is a monopoly provider of services that has the power to act unconscionably in relation to the provision of those services and so must be subject to an access regime under legislation. It would be, I think, entirely natural and understandable if there is only one person who has complete control of something like the freight rail network and owns that network and also owns the business on it to try to favour their own business to maximise their returns and to provide the largest profit possible. It suits them, and it is in their business interests in a lot of ways, to exclude competitors from access to that line. In order to deal with that natural monopoly that applies and the impact that has on the economic development of the state, we have to have an access regime and that access regime is either the Queensland Competition Authority Act access regime or the regime that is set up under part III of the Trade Practices Act.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130619"></A>
The proposed amendments to the Queensland Competition Authority Act relate to the Queensland access regime and, in particular, how Queensland Rail will be regulated by the Queensland Competition Authority. I think it is fair to say that the proposed amendments and the impact of them is significant and they are complex. From a reading of the legislation and the explanatory notes, the government hopes that these amendments will allow the QCA to continue to regulate Queensland Rail rather than the ACCC taking over the state based access regime as a result of any perceived ineffectiveness of the Queensland access regime. This goes back to the comment I made at the beginning of the discussion about this part of the legislation that this is a turf war. This is a turf war over who controls the access regime to the Queensland rail network. That turf war is being fought out between Queensland on the one hand through its legislation and, potentially, the national access regime set under part III of the Trade Practices Act with control ultimately resting with the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission, the ACCC, in Canberra as to who regulates it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130620"></A>
The background to this comes about as a result of the Competition Principles Agreement of 1995. Back in 1995 all Australian state and territory governments signed the Competition Principles Agreement. That agreement required the Commonwealth to establish a national third-party access regime. It established a set of principles to guide the development of third-party access regimes by state and territory governments. Third-party access regimes create a regulatory framework to enable fair and reasonable access by third parties to significant natural monopoly infrastructure facilities such as electricity grids, gas pipelines, rail tracks and port channels. I have mentioned those previously. Access regulation is intended to apply where owners or operators of natural monopoly infrastructure have the potential to exercise undue market power by denying access to their facilities or charging excessive prices to someone who wants to access their facilities thereby hindering or preventing competition within a dependent market. The classic example of that recently has been Telstra. Telstra owns the copper wires and there have been innumerable reports about battles that third-party access seekers--the likes of Optus or any of the other providers of telephony services--have fought in order to gain entry into the market and, in doing so, provide telephone services to consumers at a more competitive price. It is not about the use of the service per se, it is about what it offers at the end of the line. What does it offer at the end of a line? A more competitive service for the consumer or the user of that service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130621"></A>
Establishing a legal right to seek access to services provided by monopoly facilities under reasonable terms and conditions is the objective of an economic regulator such as the QCA or the ACCC charged with enforcing that access regime. They are there to make sure that access can be granted on reasonable terms and conditions; that people are not held out or made uncompetitive by the charges. In Queensland, regulated assets are covered by the act, which is the Queensland Competition Authority Act 1997, which provides a mechanism for governing access and competition. The jurisdiction covers rail services on Queensland’s intrastate rail network, as I have said, and the coal loading facility at Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal. Part 5 of the act is modelled on section 3A of the federal Trade Practices Act 1974. The Queensland government has stated that the proposed amendments that we are discussing today will clarify the existing regulatory processes and safeguards in the regime by providing explicit guidance for ministerial decision making and ensuring that the QCA, as Queensland’s independent economic regulator, is the primary administrator of the Queensland access regime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130622"></A>
However, the underlying intent of the changes seems to me to be in response to an application by Asciano to the National Competition Council to have the Queensland intrastate rail network dealt with under the federal competition regime. Asciano is concerned that the Queensland access regime does not operate to provide it with as much access to the network as it would like. In order to address that issue it is seeking to have the services that are provided in Queensland under our access regime transferred to the jurisdiction of the national regime. That application by Asciano, which was made in May, was made following the government’s decision to privatise the below rail track assets, on which Asciano operates its Pacific National business, in conjunction with the above rail assets. The issue of a vertical monopoly was something very much to the forefront of Asciano’s mind when it came to these sorts of dealings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130623"></A>
There are some differences between the national access regime and the Queensland access regime. I think we need to have a quick look at those to understand some of these changes. Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act establishes the national access regime, as I have indicated, and that provides the third-party access. The national access regime provides three avenues for access to a monopoly provided service. One of those avenues is a declaration by the ACCC that establishes a right for any party to negotiate terms and conditions of access with the declared service provider. In the event that either party is unable or unwilling to come to a commercially acceptable agreement, it provides for arbitration by the ACCC. It is left to the two parties themselves to negotiate the access arrangements. The party providing the access cannot refuse to deal. It opens the door for negotiations. If the negotiations do not work out, then they go to the ACCC and it arbitrates.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130624"></A>
There is a provision in the national access regime so that the provider of a declared service or even an undeclared service--that is, one that has not been declared by the ACCC--can submit a voluntary access undertaking. If that is approved by the ACCC, negotiations for access to the service are guided by the undertaking. So the undertaking sets out the rules under which you can access the service. That is the second way that it can be dealt with under the national access regime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130625"></A>
The third way is a recognition by the national access regime of a state based regime. The ACCC can actually recognise an effective state based regime, and that effective state based regime then operates as the access regime. The effectiveness of a state or territory access regime can be predetermined by making an application to the National Competition Council. That is the basis of the process for access to these third-party services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130626"></A>
There are also amendments to the Trade Practices Act which are currently before the Commonwealth parliament, and those amendments will change the system again to provide that only a certified access regime will be considered effective in the future. So that just adds another layer of complexity to what is already quite a complex set of arrangements in relation to access. In other words, if the National Competition Council regards the Queensland access regime--that is, our current regime under our current legislation--to be ineffective in regulating access to the QR network, the NCC will not certify the regime. If it does not certify our regime, the NCC can declare the service itself--that is, it can take over the operation itself--and the NCC can declare any nationally significant infrastructure, even if it is totally within state borders, and hand over regulation to the ACCC, taking it away from the QCA. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130627"></A>
The principal difference between the unamended Queensland regime and the federal regime is the trigger for intervention. The Queensland regime operates a proactive approach with the government having to identify key assets, make a declaration and provide a regulation for those assets to be considered for competition access regulation. The federal regime operates on a market failure basis so that when the parties have an unresolvable issue with access they can apply to the NCC for arbitration. So the Queensland regime sets out the principles. If you comply with those, you get access. The national regime opens the door for negotiations. If you cannot agree, you go for arbitration to the NCC. So it is quite complex but quite important to get that right and to understand that it also applies to both public and private monopolies. So the issue of ownership is not the thing that enlivens the jurisdiction; it is the issue of the monopoly service provider and whether it meets certain criteria that enlivens the jurisdiction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130628"></A>
There are a number of questions that the NCC asks when certifying a Queensland regime. It rests on the Queensland regime complying with what are called the clause 6 principles, which are incredibly long. I do not intend to go through them all, much to the relief of everyone in the House. </Hansard-Body>

 I hear the member for Toowoomba North, whose interest in trade practices law is well known to all those in the legal profession, and he wants to hear a little bit more about it. I can outline a few of them. They should incorporate the following principles: access to a service provided by means of a facility should be on the basis of terms and conditions agreed between the owner and the person seeking access--there is a blinding glimpse of the obvious if ever there was one; where such agreement cannot be reached, governments should establish a right for persons to negotiate access; there should be an enforcement process; it should include timing to make it certain; if the right lapses it should be clearly set out in the regime; they must use reasonable endeavours to accommodate the requirements of those seeking access; and it need not be on exactly the same terms and conditions as someone else who already has access to the service. You have to take into account: the owner’s legitimate business interests and investment in the facility, so that the owner of the service cannot be forced to give it away; the economic value to the owner of any additional service; the economically efficient operation of a facility; and a variety of other terms and conditions. So they all have to be met and those are the criteria against which the Queensland regime, as amended by this legislation when it passes, will be assessed. There is a certification guide for those criteria, and I can table that for the interest of the House. It is entitled ‘Certification of state and territory access regimes’, which I am sure the Treasurer will find incredibly useful reading. That is the guide upon which the Queensland access regime will be tested. </Hansard-Body>

During the briefing on the bill we were informed that the government took the view that the current access regime already would be considered to be or deemed to be an effective regime by the National Competition Council under the national access principles. I think, however, the Treasurer--and I think he has said it publicly--is of the view that the regime is effective. The question to be asked is: why did the government not apply for certification sooner after the September 2006 COAG meeting, where the decision for each state to apply for certification was taken? Why has it taken four years to bring these amendments forward to the House and apply for certification? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130635"></A>
There are several proposed amendments to the act under this bill for the purposes of strengthening the access regime up to the level of national access regime. We are bringing the Queensland access regime up to the level of the national access regime so that we can keep control here in Queensland. These relate to increasing transparency and reducing the minister’s arbitrary powers, particularly the powers under regulation. They include the removal of the minister’s ability to declare services by regulation for which there were not clear criteria set out in the regulation; the removal of the candidate service requirement for ministerial declaration--as some service providers could have been declared as candidate services before actually being declared; provision of more explicit guidance for matters to be considered by the ministers when making an access code--and they are set out in the legislation and I think there are four or five of those items that need to be considered by the minister; and removal of the ability to exclude by regulation particular services and facilities from the regime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130636"></A>
These amendments simply need to be made in order to strengthen Queensland’s hand to ensure that Queensland keeps the power to regulate Queensland Rail under the Queensland Competition Authority Act. We do not believe that the access regime should be handed over to the ACCC. We believe that the access regime should remain under the control of the Queensland Competition Authority working with a properly structured act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130637"></A>
However, I think there is some opportunity to also move further than has been suggested in the current bill--and this is something worthy of further debate, not of action today. That is, with the increased powers and responsibilities given to the Queensland Competition Authority, we may wish to consider and review the way in which the QCA board is appointed. There may be some opposition there to reconsider the appointment of people to the QCA board potentially on the recommendations of, say, the Economic Development Committee of the parliament or with referral to the Economic Development Committee of parliament rather than by the executive. We might be able to see some improvements in the way people are appointed to the board and the appropriate credentials given to people who sit on that board. Perhaps the Treasurer may be prepared to give some thought to that suggestion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130638"></A>
There are several other amendments to the act designed to streamline the regulatory process. Many of these are uncontroversial. They are supported by both the Queensland Resources Council, which has made submissions on this legislation, and Asciano, which has also made submissions on the legislation. That is in response to the consultation paper issued by Treasury in June. These amendments include the introduction of a pre-expiry review of declarations, which is about providing certainty for investors so that people know that a system is still going to be in place when they come back to invest in it; clarification in the objects clauses so that it is made clear that the regime is intended to apply to significant infrastructure, not just any infrastructure--it has to be significant, not just something that the government feels it may want to regulate; and the introduction of a process for amendment or revocation of an access determination. At the moment, once they are made you are stuck with them; you cannot change them. The amendments also include streamlining the approval process for determinations and undertakings which are given as a result of the operation of the regime; clarification of the application of provisions relating to extensions to a facility--that is, building more on to a declared facility, and not just extending it but actually making it a newer, bigger and better facility on the way through; introduction of a six-month time limit for declaration recommendations to get the QCA to actually make its recommendations to the minister about a declaration; and some other amendments that go to improving the process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130639"></A>
There has also been the introduction of additional provisions relating to the prevention of anticompetitive behaviour by vertically integrated access providers. That is Queensland Rail’s concern. These amendments will allow the QCA to deal with any attempts by access providers to ‘game’ the process and to stall a decision being made by the QCA. Those tactics can lead to a considerable economic loss to the state, where markets can change dramatically in a very short period. For example, if the price for coal suddenly goes through the roof and we do not have economically efficient access to a rail network, the state of Queensland misses out. It is not just the company that misses out. We all miss out, because there is not a competitive network to get the coal from the mines to the ports and, in the case of Dalrymple Bay, to get the coal loaded on to the ships and out of the place. That can apply equally to agricultural products. If the price of a particular agricultural product goes through the roof and we need to move it quickly, we do not want to be stalled for two years waiting for an access undertaking to be developed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130640"></A>
In fact, that is one of the issues that has arisen with Queensland Rail. Work on its access undertaking has been underway for over two years. We still do not have a revised and final access undertaking, which is making life difficult for the authority and probably for the minister, and is not an ideal state of affairs that should be allowed to continue. As I said earlier, effectively through these amendments we are trying to resolve a turf war in favour of access of the Queensland Competition Authority access regime. That is where the amendments ultimately are directed. We can see that because of the Queensland government’s own submission to the National Competition Council, that the regime we have in place, together with the amendments contained in this bill, are sufficient to be declared an effective regime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130641"></A>
I turn to the third part of the legislation, which is the amendment of the transport infrastructure component of the bill. It provides changes to the structure of the QR Network Board. It is about providing that members of the QR Network Board, which establishes the ability to access the rail network and particularly the Central Queensland coal rail network, do not act solely in the interests of their own business, QR National, which also runs a coal freight business on top. This legislation excludes from the position of director of QR Network anyone who is involved in the executive management of QR National. While that is understandable in terms of the policy position, a question that has not been answered in respect of this is why are only members of the executive management of QR National excluded from the board of QR Network? Surely there ought to be some provision in place that ensures that board members of QR National are also not on the board of QR Network, because presumably their obligation is the same, which is to ensure that QR National makes the best return it can if it is a private operation. That is the duty of directors. Other provisions in the legislation relate to arms-length transactions, but we could certainly look at this aspect of the legislation to see if we can strengthen the provisions to prevent any anticompetitive behaviour being entered into in terms of the allocation of space on the network to competitors or to QR National. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130642"></A>
In a vertical monopoly, actions of the board could exclude a competitor. In fact, that is one of the great fears of the federal government, as reflected in the comments made by Minister Albanese and Minister Ferguson in correspondence with the Treasurer and in their public statements, that is, the control by a vertically integrated monopoly and actions taken by a vertically integrated monopoly that would stop proper access to third parties to the network. The Treasurer may be able to address that issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130643"></A>
The bill also affects Queensland Motorways Ltd and entrenches the last round of massive toll rises for the Gateway and Logan motorways. The shadow minister for main roads and transport will discuss these in greater detail. However, I would like to make these comments: firstly, in Queensland only one side of politics has ever removed a toll and that is the conservative side of politics. The Borbidge-Sheldon government removed the toll on the Sunshine Motorway, as I said at the beginning of the debate. The Bjelke-Petersen government duplicated the bridge to Redcliffe and removed the toll on the Hornibrook Bridge. Sir John Chandler, a member of a party that was a forerunner to the Liberal Party in Brisbane, removed the toll on the Story Bridge and the Nicklin government removed the toll on the Walter Taylor Bridge at Indooroopilly.</Hansard-Body>

There is no doubt that tolls and increasing tolls is in Labor’s DNA. With the changes in the bill before the House today, we will see an entrenchment of the tolls and the toll increases on the Gateway and Logan motorways for the foreseeable future. With that, this government cements its reputation as being the party that hits up motorists the most with increased costs and charges. Whether it is increasing fuel prices, increasing rego costs or increasing transfer duty, one thing is unarguable, that is, this government hates the internal combustion engine and anyone who seeks to use it to get around this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130645"></A>
In summary, this bill potentially provides a saving for motorists of up to $24 on the cost of CTP. However, again it demonstrates Labor’s unfriendly attitude to the business sector, particularly motor dealers, and it highlights the hypocrisy of taking more with one hand, as CPI increases in registration fees are grabbed by the government, and giving away someone else’s money with the other. It shows the access regime in Queensland is flawed and needs to be changed if Queensland is to retain its supervisory powers over monopoly infrastructure, whether that infrastructure is privately or publicly owned, and it hypocritically pretends to protect motorists from increased tolls while, at the same time, entrenching the last round of increases of up to 33 per cent in some instances. Because of the savings it potentially offers motorists, because of the need to preserve Queensland’s control of access to the regime and because of the limit, however belated, on future toll increases, we will not be opposing the bill. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms SIMPSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maroochydore--LNP) (3.16 pm): The Motor Accident Insurance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill makes three primary changes and a number of miscellaneous changes. The first change is to the competition legislation to improve third-party access arrangements, particularly with rail, port and other monopoly services, attempting to keep control in Queensland under the Queensland Competition Authority. The second change is to amend compulsory third-party arrangements to ban commissions and the third change proposes to stop increases of more than the CPI on tolls after the asset sale.</Hansard-Body>

Queensland motorists are now the heaviest taxed in Australia, thanks to the waste and mismanagement of this state Labor government. We have seen this state Labor government mislead the people of Queensland and get rid of the petrol tax rebate, resulting in Queenslanders paying about $500 million a year. This came on top of huge hikes in registration charges of about 34 per cent over two years and toll hikes of more than 30 per cent, although that increase is even higher for commercial class vehicles. Over the next few years the cost of a new five-year driver’s licence will double to more than $150, again thanks to the waste and mismanagement of a project that this government said would save people money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130648"></A>
It is pretty rich for a Labor government to tell the private sector to be competitive and pass on savings when it does not know how to do that itself. Essentially, the government wants the insurance sector to be more competitive, cut its costs and pass those savings on to motorists, but we see the complete opposite happening when it comes to how the government runs its own business. It is wantonly abusing the public purse. It does not know how to manage taxpayer money with respect. That has resulted in huge cost hikes. As I said, Queenslanders are now the heaviest taxed motorists in Australia. This bill proposes to cut commissions for compulsory third-party insurance, for a grand total saving of up to $27 for motorists. As I mentioned, Queenslanders now pay hundreds of dollars extra thanks to the government, so it seems like a very small reprieve from the costs that they are paying as a result of this government’s mismanagement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130649"></A>
I will now address the issue of tolls. This legislation seeks to entrench the current costs to be capped at CPI into the future, after the motorway is sold. However, we should not let the public forget what has happened with increases in charges. Unfortunately, an increase in a toll will not come back before the parliament as a regulation that can be potentially disallowed. The government released a gazettal notice on 18 June 2010 that resulted in a significant increase in costs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130650"></A>
The reason the government whacked up the tolls was not so that motorists would get better services and outcomes. If they believed that it was delivering better services and outcomes by collecting more money, wouldn’t they have done some cost-benefit analysis? Wouldn’t they have looked at what the impact would be of people avoiding the tolls in order to protect their hip pocket because people are really struggling? No, there was no cost-benefit analysis done in regard to the impact of people who were going to rat run around the tolls. I asked the question of the main roads minister and he had to admit that the government had done no studies into what the impact would be of people avoiding the tolls. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130651"></A>
I want to tell the story of one owner-driver who is typical of so many others who have contacted me following the huge increase in tolls under this government. The letter states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130652"></A>
I am a owner driver in Brisbane. I have only 1 truck but as I sub contract to a company that deals with freight out of the Port Of Brisbane. Myself as well as 3-400 other drivers are hurting very badly because of the rising of the toll costs. Most of us have gone from paying $2.95 per each way on the gateway to $10.20 each way. The feeling out there with these increase of costs are crippling us. We have gone from making a living down to just surviving. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1130653"></A>
The increase in the tolls has been about 350 per cent for this particular driver. The letter goes on--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130654"></A>
Bligh has just made a decision and that’s it, not thinking about how it is going to hurt the transport industry. I also have approached small and medium sized businesses and they have told me about trying to cover these costs as some customers are dealing with other companies as they are not prepared to pay the tolls to get their freight over the bridge or down thru the logan motorway as they also have gone for most of us from $2.00 to $6-6.40 per pass thru the beacons. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130655"></A>
There are many drivers out there that will be selling their vehicles as they have told me that they won’t be able to go on ... as we have just had enough, as I said with Ms Bligh putting these increases as well as registration and any other cost she can throw at as most of us will fold very soon. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130656"></A>
That is just one letter. It disturbs me that this government that claims to be about looking after the workers has completely forgotten those who are least able to carry those costs. Some of these trucks will be paying smaller trucks that are still caught in the class 4 category and will be paying exactly the same as the very biggest trucks, the B-doubles, but there is no consideration of that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130657"></A>
This government in all that it does is about gouging motorists and gouging the business community but not about cutting its own cloth. These increases are having an impact on people, but the money is not even flowing back into our roads. I heard this morning the main roads minister get up and talk about road programs and warning of potential cuts. He did not mention once that under his watch in this last budget, despite the biggest increase in registration and despite the gouging of motorists with petrol costs, this government has actually cut the roads budget by a quarter of a billion dollars--$250 million has been taken out of the Main Roads budget. So it does not wash when this government says that these increases in charges are about helping the motorists. I think people have had enough of this kind of help, because they are really hurting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130658"></A>
I am going to table an explanation for the increases in the toll classes. For class 1, there has been a 41 per cent increase in fees; for class 2, it is a 31 per cent increase in tolls; for class 3, 96 per cent; and for class 4, 39 per cent. But accumulatively, as I said, some operators have borne a far greater increase. That is why they have said that they will be avoiding the tolls if they can, but some businesses find that very difficult to do and they will find it very difficult to pay those costs. I table that document. </Hansard-Body>

As has been said, this legislation before the parliament is not about assets sales. We have made it very clear that we do not support this Labor government’s proposed sale of Queensland’s assets. We stand against the sale of Queensland Rail, the motorways and the forestry. It is a fire sale and one that is not being done in the best interests of Queensland. This government is in fact selling off the house to pay the grocery bill. It does not have a plan in place to reduce the debt. It is interesting that the government has threatened its own backbenchers that if the privatisation of these assets does not go ahead then they will not get some particular project in their electorate. Every which way you turn, the government has another excuse for which project it says will not go ahead. The government has even blamed current projects and that recurrent costs are dependent upon the assets sales. There has been an inconsistency in the argument of this government about asset sales. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130661"></A>
The legislation before the House has raised issues of competition and these are the matters that we are addressing today, and they would occur regardless of assets sales in Queensland. I want to firstly refer to the warnings of the federal Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Anthony Albanese, and his office about the way this government has gone about the assets sales. Documents obtained under right to information have revealed that the Queensland government has been warned that the sale of QR will be detrimental to the Queensland resources sector. Minister Albanese’s office warned the Bligh government that the sale of QR will ‘result in higher costs for the resources sector and consequently less revenue for government’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130662"></A>
The minister’s office advised the Queensland government that its plan would ‘remove competition for above rail services’--that is, the freight haulage operations. The briefing note from Minister Albanese also warned that ‘while the basis for the sale of an integrated entity would potentially provide the highest upfront payment for a seller and facilitate a quick sale, it would be at the expense of a sound public policy outcome for competition and efficiency of the coal network in Queensland and is likely to reduce Queensland government income from the resources sector over time’. With advice from the federal minister that condemns the sale of Queensland Rail, the question to be asked is: why is Premier Anna Bligh not listening to this advice and going ahead with a sale that is not in Queensland’s best interests? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130663"></A>
The provisions of this legislation do deal with issues of third-party access. I think they have been covered excellently by the shadow Treasurer. These are issues that were on the table prior to assets sales and in fact have been subject to COAG agreements up to four and five years ago in relation to improving the regime even for existing operators in the Queensland network. They are complex provisions. As we understand from the briefing and with regard to recent applications from operators, the intention here is to try to keep control of the access regime within the Queensland jurisdiction under the Queensland Competition Authority, as opposed to seeing that moved into the federal jurisdiction under the ACCC. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130664"></A>
I want to address some of the other provisions in this legislation, particularly in regard to the Transport Infrastructure Act, and to note some of the other measures that are being amended. This legislation is supposed to enhance the governance of the QR Network Board from the QR National Group by requiring the majority of directors of the QR Network Board to be independent of the executive management of the QR National Group. As the shadow Treasurer has outlined, I think there are still some questions to be asked as to whether that is sufficient. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130665"></A>
While the majority of directors of the QR Network Board have to be independent of the executive management, that does not mean that they all have to be. There is in fact still the potential for conflict and there are still issues as to how that is going to be managed practically. I seek the minister’s explanation in that regard. I think there has been some recent case history about subsidiary boards and some of the issues they face with regard to decision making which can have ramifications not only for the customers and the dealings of that entity but also practically for those directors in how they perform their duties. It is not enough just to have this requirement noted in legislation. I think the minister needs to give us an explanation as to how this is going to work practically. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130666"></A>
There are also provisions in this legislation to preserve existing train paths for regularly scheduled passenger and non-coal freight train paths. The legislation also introduces a process by which the chief executive’s consent is required for the reallocation of a preserved train path. I seek an explanation from the minister as to the circumstances that are envisaged that require the reallocation of a train path. Obviously it is envisaged that not all preserved train paths will be set in concrete, so to speak, into the future and that there are circumstances in which they can be changed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130667"></A>
There has been a great deal of concern among existing industry that their difficulties in negotiating access to train paths are currently not being addressed. When we hear that consent to reallocate a train path is required of the chief executive it certainly flags that other changes will be flowing through. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130668"></A>
One of the complaints we constantly hear from the livestock industry is that, while a service is promised, a service is not delivered. They are feeling very much disempowered as to how they effectively address that. When they turn up with their stock and are ready to load and they find that the train is not available, that is completely impractical. They cannot just load them back onto the trucks and send them back to where they came from. That lack of certainty with regard to service delivery and the ongoing changes--sometimes quite arbitrary changes--have made some of these services less and less viable for those who are seeking to access them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130669"></A>
That is a tragedy in this day and age when we want to see rail as an efficient operation that is available for more than just the biggest operators. If all the freight is dumped on our roads the public will realise pretty quickly that that is not to the broader community’s advantage. It is questionable whether there would be enough trucks to carry all of the livestock that are currently carried on trains. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130670"></A>
There is great pressure on this industry to use trucks. The reality is that unless we see certainty of pathways that is more than just lip-service but is practical, has a high standard of service delivery and does not leave people in the lurch the way it has over the last six to 12 months--that is absolutely disgraceful--then this legislation does not mean anything. There has to be a genuine effort to provide a high standard of service delivery to those who are seeking to access rail rather than what we have seen happen to date where people have been left severely disadvantaged when services do not arrive and there seems to be a reallocation of those services to other parts of the network or certainly a lack of concern for investment in the network to ensure that customers have certainty about the way it is delivered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130671"></A>
As has been mentioned, this legislation has some extremely complex issues with regard to competition access. We are not opposing the parts of the legislation pertaining to insurance and tolls. However, we continue to raise our concerns about the policies of this government leading up to this legislation which cannot be addressed through this legislation but still ultimately leave Queenslanders really hurting in their hip pocket. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr EMERSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Indooroopilly--LNP) (3.32 pm): What we see here today is another example of the Bligh government’s appalling management of the state’s finances and the endless rises in the cost of living for Queenslanders that Labor has caused. We will hear Labor MP after Labor MP say how they are helping struggling households by cutting CTP insurance by $24 a year. What they will not be so keen to talk about is the extra $220 a year that they are taking from Queensland motorists in increased taxes, fees and charges. On the one hand they are giving back 45c a day and, on the other hand, they are ripping out of the back pocket of Queensland motorists $220 a year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130673"></A>
This is what Premier Anna Bligh insists is good news for motorists. That is what she told the media--good news for motorists. Let us have a look at some of that good news for motorists from Premier Anna Bligh. The first of Labor’s good news for motorists is that Queensland has now become the most expensive state in Australia in which to own and run a car. Last year, motor vehicle registration rose by 17 per cent. This year it goes up by another three per cent. According to Labor, that is good news for motorists. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130674"></A>
In the past two years alone, revenue collected from motor vehicle registration has risen by 30 per cent from $1.014 billion to an estimated $1.311 billion in 2010-11. Since 1 July it has cost $627 to register a large car in Queensland compared to $178 in Victoria and $246 in Tasmania. Vehicle registration fees now account for 13 per cent of the government’s total tax take and are one of the largest single source tax revenues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130675"></A>
One of the clearest examples of how much Queensland motorists are hurting is how many are late paying their registration fees. Hundreds of thousands of Queenslanders were hit with more than $27 million in late fees for failing to pay their annual vehicle registration bills on time. Motorists paid about 600,000 late payment fees of up to $48 each in the last financial year, funnelling in excess of $73,000 into state government coffers every day. That was a record number of defaults. This controversial fee, initially $40, was introduced by the state government in 2003 and rises with inflation annually. From 1 July it increased to $49 for vehicles and $12 for trailers and recreational ships. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130676"></A>
But Labor’s good news for motorists does not stop at the rise in rego fees. While motorists are paying more, the government is allocating less of its resources to the road network. Spending on roads this year will fall by 6.6 per cent--down more than $232 million--while motorists will pay an extra $50 million in registration fees. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130677"></A>
Let us have a look at some of Labor’s good news for motorists at the petrol bowsers. It is not just registration fees that are increasing the cost of living for Queenslanders. Queensland motorists have gone from paying the lowest petrol prices in Australia to paying the highest in the year since the Bligh government’s fuel tax was introduced. Monitoring by price watchdog FUELtrac and MotorMouth showed Brisbane had the highest average unleaded petrol price of all mainland capitals at $1.27 a litre in July. Let us not forget that this is a fuel tax the Bligh government ruled out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130678"></A>
The goods news Premier said, ‘I will not kick Queensland households when they are down and I will not abolish the petrol subsidy.’ The good news Treasurer said, ‘Make no mistake about it, we will be delivering a fuel subsidy scheme. It will stay in place.’ After the state election the good news team scrapped the fuel subsidy in the 2009-10 budget, costing Queensland motorists an extra 9.1c a litre in fuel. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130679"></A>
So that is Labor’s good news for motorists--paying more for petrol. What about Labor’s good news for motorists crossing the Gateway Bridge? The government has lifted tolls across the Queensland Motorways network--up 30 per cent from $2.95 to $3.85 for a single Gateway Bridge crossing. There might be more Labor goods news ahead because the Bligh government has also developed detailed proposals to charge distance tolls to use major South-East Queensland roads, including charging motorists 12c a kilometre. The government has ruled it out, but can it be believed? It ruled out scrapping the petrol subsidy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130680"></A>
Finally, let us look at Labor’s good news for motorists when they are renewing their driver’s licence. A five-year licence will jump from the current $73.30 to $96 next year and to $152.50 by 2014-15--that is, equal highest cost in Australia. So this is Labor’s good news for motorists: increased registration fees; increased petrol prices; higher road tolls; and more expensive drivers’ licences. For Queenslanders the only good news for motorists will be when we get rid of this incompetent Labor government. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs KIERNAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Isa--ALP) (3.38 pm): I rise to speak briefly to the Motor Accident Insurance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. I say at the outset that I support this bill, which delivers premium savings to motorists. While banning the payment of commissions and other inducements to third parties is necessary to reduce CTP premiums and deliver real competition, the bill makes provision for policyholders to be able to pass on any incentives they receive to registered charities. Some CTP insurers have developed relationships with particular charities, offering donations to these registered charities in exchange for policyholders selecting that particular CTP insurer for the next registration renewal period. This bill allows that relationship to continue. Charities are able to receive vital funds which, in turn, are used to provide worthwhile community services. Importantly, though, these incentives can only be passed on at the request of the policyholder and cannot be charged back to the CTP business or taken into account in determining premiums.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130682"></A>
One registered charity which I am aware of is Scripture Union Queensland. I am aware that this charity relies on inducements from CTP insurers as a valuable funding source for its school chaplaincy program. Scripture Union Queensland is a not-for-profit youth and children’s organisation and the largest employer of school chaplains in Australia, providing spiritual and emotional support to our school communities and a caring and valuable presence for our children. I want to take this opportunity to commend the wonderful work of the school chaplaincy program in schools in my electorate. The Cloncurry chaplaincy service, with new chaplain Jenny Pearce, has now been operating for some six years and I have seen firsthand the support and strong connection the chaplains have with the students and also with the community. The Cloncurry chaplaincy service has also gone from strength to strength because of the strong commitment of its community committee, led by Karen McGee. The annual fundraising dinner is supported strongly by businesses across the community and the community has embraced the chaplaincy service as a valuable service for young people in the town.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130683"></A>
Three schools in Mount Isa benefit from the fantastic work of Mischa Grummitt, who, again, is strongly supported by the school communities of Spinifex Junior, Spinifex Senior and the Barkly Highway State School. Mischa is a great support person for the students. I know that Mischa relates well with the kids and helps them in all manner of ways. He is someone other than staff who can be turned to and is seen as a friend and mentor to many young people. Mischa holds a healthy breakfast morning at both schools throughout the year. Queensland core skills tests are happening for senior students at Spinifex Senior today and tomorrow. Mischa cooked bacon and eggs for brekkie at 7.30 this morning for Spinifex Senior students and will do the same tomorrow. He provides invaluable work, service and friendship to the young people in our community. I commend the government for acknowledging the financial pressures impacting on registered charities and taking action in allowing this small exemption to ensure that these organisations like Scripture Union and our chaplaincy service are not worse off. The reforms are a win for motorists and a win for our registered charities. I commend the bill to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr WATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Everton--ALP) (3.43 pm): After talking to residents of the electorate of Everton at mobile offices and around the electorate generally, there is no doubt that one of the main issues people have raised with me as the year has progressed is the cost-of-living pressure they are experiencing. Rates of unemployment are still relatively low in Queensland, and the government has been doing an excellent job of creating jobs--that is, for about 12 months in a row the government has actually created jobs in Queensland. That is an excellent record and is very largely attributable to the continuation of the government’s building program. Despite this good news in terms of unemployment, there are still undoubtedly many Queenslanders experiencing financial pressure, and that is certainly the case in the electorate of Everton.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130685"></A>
In the last few days the Premier has again recognised this fact and has recommitted the government to taking action to help Queenslanders overcome the financial pressure that many of them are currently experiencing. This bill is one example of the government helping Queenslanders to make ends meet. Among other things, the bill bans commissions on compulsory third-party insurance premiums, and that is expected to equate to a reduction of about $24 per year in those premiums. I have heard a number of opposition members deride this commitment from the government and the action that is taken through this bill. They seem to regard this decrease as a paltry commitment from the government. I do not know about their electorates, but I can assure the House that people in the electorate of Everton welcome any savings they can make, whether they be $24 or $200. This is a good move on behalf of the government. There is no doubt that more can be done in this regard and, as I say, the Premier has said that this is an issue that the government is looking at. There is no doubt, though, that the reduction in compulsory third-party premiums that this bill ushers in is a very good start.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130686"></A>
There are a number of other initiatives that the government currently has underway to assist Queenslanders who are experiencing financial pressure. Probably the one that is becoming best known is the Every Dollar Counts forums that have been held in a number of electorates around Queensland, and I am certainly intending to stage them in the electorate of Everton in the not-too-distant future. The government has done a good job of trying to pool together the various savings and rebates that are available to pensioners, seniors and other groups within our community. Again, this is an example that we are listening to the community and demonstrating that we do understand that people are experiencing financial pain at the moment and the government does have a role to play in helping them overcome that financial pressure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130687"></A>
There is no doubt that the cost-of-living issue is a big one in my electorate, and it is something that I continue to represent to the government on behalf of the residents of Everton. I am very pleased to speak in support of this bill because it is a good example of the government listening to that financial pressure and taking action to alleviate that pressure on Queenslanders. I commend the bill to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (3.46 pm): When a government seeks to get a little mileage from a very broad area, it will try to secure guaranteed income from an area with good continued growth in its returns for very little input. Whatever happens, a government such as the Bligh government will try to maximise its own take and shed a few limited crumbs our way. Such are the lessons! This bill gives a pretty good template for what is going to be delivered by this government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

This bill is more than just a method of removing the commission payable on compulsory third-party insurance; it is really a series of four major steps that flow on from the flawed financial plan put forward by the Treasurer on behalf of this dying Labor government. As has been described by other speakers, those steps are (1) removing the $25 payment of commission and the trailing commission paid by customers for CTP; (2) updating third-party access in that it attempts to align the Queensland Competition Authority Act with national regimes; (3) resetting the rules allowing for price rises for tolls on the Logan and Gateway motorways to be limited to CPI after the government increased the tolls earlier this year so as to make the asset more saleable in this market; and (4) changes to the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 specific to QR National’s corporate governance framework.</Hansard-Body>

A few issues have been raised today about the $25 commission which, when removed, will make compulsory third-party premiums cheaper. This really does need to be cheaper because motor vehicle registration has been progressively ratcheted up as the government has become so desperate for cash and is now at the point where our motor vehicle registration is the most expensive in Australia. Our boats, motorcycles and trucks also have that dubious distinction. There is now also this ridiculous situation where a B-double actually costs more to register than a B-quad, when there is a 40-tonne difference. I wonder whether someone in the department is looking at the maths. However, saving $25 is critical to many households at any time--not just at this time--so this is welcome news to my constituents in Gaven particularly, and I am sure most members will express the same sentiments.</Hansard-Body>

Sadly, many groups that receive income from trailing commissions include school chaplaincies, scripture services in schools and all manner of voluntary community support groups that will now miss out on this trailing income. There is also a further tragedy in that some motor dealers who have staff who exist on these incomes will lose their positions, and for some businesses there will be multiples thereof. I am very sorry to see those individuals lose their jobs at the stroke of a pen to justify a perception that this Labor government may have community interests as its major concern, but I wonder whether it does have a heart for these people. If this is the case, does one wrong deserve another?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130692"></A>
I also note that the minister has stated in his second reading speech that the bill will permit policyholders to direct the payment of an inducement by an insurer to a registered charity, but will prohibit the practice of any type of trailing payments. By ticking the box annually, these charities or research entities may get an ongoing direct donation by the consumer at the time of the compulsory third-party payment. Trailing commissions have been a menace in the mobile phone business area. They have enriched some operators often at the expense of many small or unknowing consumers. So this amendment is to be supported. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130693"></A>
The bill also amends the Queensland Competition Authority Act 1997 and in doing so allows the Queensland government to circumvent the federal competition policy. The bill will--and I quote from the minister’s second reading speech specifically--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130694"></A>
... remove the ability for services to be declared or excluded from coverage by government regulation without the processes contemplated by the broader QCA regime. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130695"></A>
Furthermore, the minister stated that the bill--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130696"></A>
... will ensure there is a single and structured process for determining whether a service should fall within the scope of the third-party access regime. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130697"></A>
Therefore, because the National Competition Council--the NCC--will not consider an application where an effective state regime is already in place, broadly, this change exempts the state from NCC policy and only where nationally significant infrastructure is not included in those items, not state declared, then and only then can the NCC rules apply. The NCC is not removed by the process but is effectively excluded by those changes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130698"></A>
This is not trivial stuff here. We must all remember that pipelines, railway lines, shipping channels and electricity grids are relevant to all of us throughout the nation. We need a regulator and fairness needs to apply to all. There are plenty of examples overseas that are salient. Whilst it is an extreme case, Russia turned off the gas to the Ukraine primarily because it did not like the democratically elected government there. There was also extreme doubt about the validity that both the claim over an outstanding account and the reasonableness of a massive price rise over and above agreed prices was indeed fair. These things occur and sometimes common sense goes out the door. Ask Rio Tinto and BHP about the issue of below-rail assets in Western Australia. The NCC needs to be supported. The state should not need to exempt itself in any situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130699"></A>
I have previously made the point about what happens to markets and exports where there is a denial of third-party access in practical terms. The best example is in the Elk Valley in Canada, where the Teck mining company has been restricted in increasing its volumes and other miners also have been excluded from shipping on the same line after the takeover of Canadian rail by a private consortium. Growth in that market for coal exports has been restricted to two per cent per annum for the last eight years when the global market demanded greater access to coal exports, particularly in the Canadian model. Canadian exports stalled and Australia made up the difference. Clearly, we must not constrain our own ability to build growth in this competitive market. In coal, we have significant global competition from South Africa, South America, Indonesia and central Africa increasingly. We must not underestimate the ability of these markets to overtake us. At present, coal and iron ore have enabled Australia to maintain three per cent annual growth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130700"></A>
Clearly, the bill is focusing on the intrastate rail network of QR, rail transport for specific coal deposits in the Central Queensland coal network and coal handling at the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal. I suspect there are a few others included and also excluded, but the Bligh government thinks that they are not needed because of the lack of linkage to their flawed assets sales program. Asciano’s application to have its access to the Queensland intrastate rail network handled under the federal competition regime is obviously the major reason for this change. The details of the issue relating to the Trade Practices Act 1974 under the federal law have been explained earlier by the shadow minister. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132299"></A>
As has been stated, this act and its amendments are currently before the Commonwealth parliament. In short, these changes will ensure that only a certified access regime will be considered effective in the future and if the National Competition Council regards the Queensland access regime to be ineffective in regulating access to the QR network, then the NCC will not certify that regime. In effect, it then hands over the regulation to the ACCC, removing it from the QCA. The amendments in this bill have an intention of raising the existing regime to the level of the national access regime. In doing so, these changes primarily relate to increasing transparency and reducing the minister’s arbitrary powers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130701"></A>
I relate this change back to the minister’s second reading speech in which he states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130702"></A>
New provisions will reinforce existing obligations on access providers to not unfairly differentiate between access seekers both during negotiations and in the provision of access. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130703"></A>
This problem has come about only because of the Bligh Labor government’s desperation to save itself after blowing all the money on, basically, a nothingness. The minister is now going to enormous lengths to say that he, Treasurer, is going to vigilantly ensure--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130704"></A>
... that monopoly infrastructure providers do not misuse their market power or engage in anticompetitive cost shifting. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130705"></A>
Yet at the same time, after a boost in the offered price for the below-rail coal assets of Queensland Rail, the Bligh Labor government is negotiating with a monopoly of coal companies to purchase this critical asset. It is the filthy lucre that is driving this Treasurer and Labor. Labor is petrified that the national regulator might not agree. It saw what happened in Western Australia when Rio and BHP sought to exclude Fortescue Metals from access to their rail. Labor thinks that this could seriously torpedo its sale and any potential blue sky price for the below-rail asset. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130706"></A>
Currently, fear is ruling Labor’s decisions. All Labor’s decisions are made in an environment of fear because it alone created the crisis that led to this sense of fear. Does Labor really think that having a captive board of QCA Labor stooges will pass the acid test of probity in this matter? Honourable members, fear is a dreadful motive to activate a plan. Good decisions are made in an environment of confidence and prudence, not in a panic. The QCA board will work only if it is truly impartial and fearless. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130707"></A>
Is Labor ready for this? I do not think it is. There is no evidence anywhere else where there are contentious issues. I highlight the dying CMC as it muddles along on its present confused path. Do members know anything of the features of a dying organisation? They are the same as a dying government: resignations, unhappiness, leaks, cost overruns, inability to complete even simple tasks and open disputes of leadership. The changes to the QCA Act are reasonable. Even Asciano supports them. We support these amendments as well, since efficiency and access will improve. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130708"></A>
The third major changes are the changes that prepare QR National for sale, but they are an each-way bet since they make changes that separate the corporate structure into a form that will allow the separation of above-rail and below-rail assets. I say that this is an each-way bet, because the certainty that the Premier and Treasurer talked of when selling QR originally has now changed, because QR National is not only minus the passenger network but also the issue of the above-rail asset appears to have evaporated as well. Why? Because Labor’s core constituency will not support that and Labor thinks that it can get away with selling below rail as it is so different from selling a monopoly toll road that can earn hundreds of dollars every second. The only difference is that road users are private--car owners or truck owners--and in this case the government remains potentially the above-rail owner. Honourable members, these critical state assets--the QR network--are unlocked and these changes are at a once-only price of $5 billion and they are gone. I struggle to believe that, by excluding the freight and above-rail assets of QR National, the consortium will take on the rumoured $1.7 billion of debt. I doubt that it will. Asciano has a legitimate concern about this being an outcome, because it will restrict its overall growth. That is why it has proceeded on its current path. It is considered that the members of this purchasing consortium have form in this market.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130709"></A>
Let us look at the international comparisons of the sale of vertically integrated rail monopolies. The most recent one is the sale of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe, which was purchased for US$25 billion, which is $30 billion Australian in a critical market. It has competitors in 70 per cent of its market and it is roughly comparable in terms of transport. It was purchased by the world’s most successful 20th century--now 21st century--investor, Warren Buffett. Why is QR selling its below-rail assets at 15 per cent of the price of equivalent first-tier railway global assets in a global economy?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130710"></A>
I will give members a clue--because Labor has no idea what it is doing. It understands nothing of business, it understands nothing of what assets should be sold and how to evaluate them. Here today the Premier confused the issues of governing and a government’s right to dispose of a major state asset without the agreement of the public. She failed to understand the difference between second-tier assets and first-tier assets. But critically she failed to understand what must be done with the money received from such a massive decision. She used the example of Suncorp Metway as a non-monopoly financial provider that ended up being sold in part into private hands. Largely it occurred as a result of the collapse of building societies in a credit crunch in Queensland and the merging of the entity that was created by Premier Ryan to improve public access of homeowners to a mortgage with affordable insurance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130711"></A>
These assets are completely different. The sale of rail in the UK and New Zealand was nothing short of a national disaster for both and it will be so here at a critical time of coal market expansion in the global market. The three biggest coalmines at Alpha, operated by Hancock Prospecting, Waratah Coal and a currently unnamed entity will double the state’s output. They will also double the average rail tonnage carried. Honourable members need to remove their blinkers here. If one sectional group owns the critical pipes that carry these assets it will try to limit access so as to raise its own returns on investment and restrict competition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130712"></A>
Currently the public of the state of Queensland is the monopoly owner and we have the ability to grow the market responsibly and control somewhat that growth as it occurs and critically, like a toll road, take a small commission on every tonne mined and transported. This is not market power; this is the concept of mining the market. There is a difference. We must be smart. Just as increasing toll charges for toll roads just in time for their sale, as occurred in this bill, is wrong, it is wrong to jettison the key state national earning asset at a time of almost exponential growth in the export coal market on the network. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130713"></A>
The mining sector in Australia, if people do not realise, earned 40 per cent of all company tax profits in the June quarter but is only 7 per cent of the economy. Overwhelmingly in Queensland that is significant. This bill is an enabler bill that has been introduced purely to address an asset sale that will collapse a government. It has led to the downfall of a first-term federal Labor government. There is no clear statement as to exactly where the money from these asset sales will go, nor is there any message other than fear and panic. The impact of the loss of the AAA credit rating has destroyed much of Labor’s will to go on. These asset sales will do nothing to ease the pain of the last few years, nor restore public confidence in the integrity of Labor governments. Critically, this bill is attached to the Treasurer and it is he to whom the public will attach much of their angst for his role in this debacle. There will be little leeway for penance nor forgiveness. The hostility is, and will be, palpable. It will ultimately destroy much of the critical Labor players’ confidence in themselves and also any legacy they wish to leave as a mark of their time in government. In 1957 the same thing happened as the knives sharpened for those who could be blamed. The bloodletting was awful. It is coming again. History constantly repeats itself. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(4.03 pm): I rise today to contribute to the debate on the Motor Accident Insurance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. The objective of the bill is to reduce delivery and acquisition costs and promote greater price competition within the CTP scheme so as to deliver premium savings to motor vehicle owners throughout Queensland. The bill updates the state’s third-party access regime. It also clarifies and strengthens the regime to reflect the changing nature of investment and competition in regulated infrastructure services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130715"></A>
The main reason for the bill came after a review of the compulsory third-party scheme recently conducted by the Motor Accident Insurance Commission which identified high policy and acquisition costs associated with the scheme. Payment of commissions and other inducements by insurers to motor dealers and insurance brokers has increased significantly over a number of years. This in turn has led to an increase in CTP premiums for Queensland motorists and has prevented many smaller insurance companies from being able to compete with the larger providers. Stopping these types of payments will improve efficiencies in the CTP scheme and deliver much needed savings to motor vehicle owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130716"></A>
The $24 saving will be well received by Queensland motorists. However, Queenslanders are sick and tired of the Bligh Labor government giving with one hand and taking away with the other. I have outlined on many occasions previously in this House the ever-increasing costs of operating a motor vehicle here in Queensland. There was a time when Queensland held the great monicker of being the cheapest state in which to own and operate a motor vehicle. Sadly, this title is long gone and forgotten as we take on the unwanted title of now being the most expensive state in which to own, operate and register a motor vehicle.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130717"></A>
As reported on the <Hansard-Italic>
Brisbane Times</Hansard-Italic>
 website in May 2009, motorists would bear the full impact of this government’s mismanagement of our economy. The website reports--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130718"></A>
The peak motoring body also accuses the state government of being coy about the true impact of rises in vehicle registration already announced by the Bligh government and due to become effective on July 1.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130719"></A>
Car owners will be paying between $45 and $113 more for registration from July 1 ... The increases will net the government $194 million towards a $14 billion shortfall blown in the state budget ... After July 1 it will cost $627 to register a large car in Queensland, compared to $178 in Victoria and $246 in Tasmania. We’re currently the most expensive state or territory in which to register a motor vehicle.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130720"></A>
It is ironic that the Treasurer can stand in this House to espouse the benefits of delivering this saving on CTP insurance, but it is the same Treasurer who has presided over increased fuel costs, licence renewals and overall registration costs. In the past two years under this Bligh Labor government car registration has gone up by a massive 27 per cent. This increase has put further pressure on struggling families, but is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to increased fees and charges that the average family now has to deal with.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130721"></A>
Conversely, one would expect to see an increase in funding to Main Roads. Unfortunately, this is not the case. In this year’s budget, Main Roads’ funding was cut by $250 million. Our car registrations have increased but our road funding has gone down. These moneys should have been reinvested in our roads. How will the extra $24 help families at the fuel bowsers after this government put a 10c per litre fuel tax on all Queenslanders? The Bligh Labor government went to the last election misleading voters that they would not apply a fuel tax and, as we all know, as soon as the election was over fuel went up by 10c a litre. Using that $24 for fuel at an average rate of $1.20 would only buy 20 litres of fuel. That is not much for the average family in my area who has to travel to the opposite side of the M1 daily to drop their children to the state high schools east of the M1 because there is no high school west of the M1. It is not a lot either for motorists who queue on the M1 for up to an hour in peak traffic times just to get to work. Many of them sit in their cars wondering where the increase in fees is being invested. They have been promised for years eight lanes all the way to the New South Wales border, but as the price of registration, fuel and licences goes up, they still sit in traffic on the M1.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130722"></A>
Further to the increased cost in registration and fuel, the hits to the family budget just keep coming. As reported in the <Hansard-Italic>
Brisbane Times</Hansard-Italic>
 on 12 May 2010--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130723"></A>
The price of a new five-year licence will initially rise from $73.30 to $96.05, before escalating again to $152.50 in 2014.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1130724"></A>
That is an overall increase of a massive 108 per cent. The article continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130725"></A>
The cost will be even greater for truck drivers who will need a separate heavy vehicle licence under the new system. The price increase is the latest hit for the state’s drivers, after hefty registration cost increases came into effect last year, while the government scrapped the fuel subsidy.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130726"></A>
Increase after increase has been putting further pressure on struggling families and senior citizens. In addition, Queenslanders have had to cope with the increases in water and electricity charges and additional red tape, making life very difficult for many families to make ends meet. What other surprises and increases does this government have in store for us for the remainder of its term in government? This is a government that has a proven track record of backroom deals and continual spin. How can we trust it not to put prices up next month to try to fill the ever-increasing black hole which is the current Queensland Treasury coffers? This government went bust in a boom. It misled voters at the last election and cannot be trusted not to add further to the burdens it has already placed on working families. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130727"></A>
The LNP has made public our policy to freeze registrations for our entire first term in government. Unlike those opposite, we understand the pressure that these and other increases have put on working families. Labor has lost touch with its core values to support working families. This can clearly be seen by the backlash from voters Labor copped at the polls in the recent federal election. The Premier said today that she is listening to the voters of Queensland and has heard their message. Labor and the Premier are not listening to their calls not to sell off our assets; they are not listening to Queenslanders’ cries for some relief to rising bills. The Premier does not even listen to her own unions, let alone the rest of Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130728"></A>
If the Premier was listening she would not continue with the push to sell off Queenslanders’ assets without their permission. Labor just does not care about Queensland anymore. Its members are drunk on their own power. As an election gets closer and closer, Labor’s days of total disregard for the voting public of Queensland are numbered.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Townsville--ALP)<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(4.09 pm): I am pleased to take part in the debate on the Motor Accident Insurance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. During the budget sittings this year the Treasurer announced that the government intended to amend legislation to ensure that compulsory third-party insurance premiums offered to all Queensland motor vehicle owners is as competitive and, as a subsequence, as affordable as possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130730"></A>
I am pleased to see reforms proposed to the CTP scheme that focus on the underwriting of the business. I recall that a number of years ago government had to bring in scheme reforms to keep CTP premiums affordable. At that time the entitlements of injured people were impacted. It is most appropriate that in a compulsory insurance product like CTP there is a focus on what insurers do and the costs they pass on to motor vehicle owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130731"></A>
Most people would agree with me that at the time of purchasing a new vehicle the customer is not given the option to select a CTP insurer. When they pick up the vehicle, it is registered and the CTP insured, all arranged by the motor dealer. It is only when the new car owner receives the registration papers that they notice who their CTP insurer is. Those customers would also not be aware that, for the simple process undertaken by the motor dealer in nominating a CTP insurer as part of the registration process, the motor vehicle dealer is paid a commission by the CTP insurer. I understand that commission is generally five per cent of the CTP premium, although there have been reports of levels reaching seven per cent. Added to this, though, is the common practice of trailing commissions, which means that the commission continues to be paid on an annual basis to the motor dealer until such time as the owner selects a different insurer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130732"></A>
Equally, the consumer would not be aware that the costs of these commissions and other inducements provided by the insurer to the motor dealer are a cost to the CTP scheme and, ultimately, as a subsequence are borne by all motor vehicle owners in their CTP insurance premiums. I know that some motor dealers are of the opinion that they should receive payment for registering a vehicle for a customer. It is my view that any such payment, if required, should be determined by agreement between the dealer and their customer rather than being funded through the CTP premiums paid by all Queensland motor vehicle owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130733"></A>
I understand that some motor dealers already charge the purchaser an administration fee as a separate charge for registering the vehicle. It is my opinion that this seems to be a more transparent way to show the customer what it is they are paying for and in fact receiving by way of services from motor dealers. When considering the situation in other jurisdictions we find that, other than New South Wales, no state or territory in Australia allows for the payment of commissions on CTP insurance. No state or territory government pays a fee to a motor dealer for registering a vehicle. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130734"></A>
Having access to independent transport is of huge importance to many Queenslanders and, of course, to people in my electorate of Townsville. I am also very aware of the costs associated with owning and running a car and the impact that these have on families who do count every dollar within their family budget. I hope that the charges proposed in this bill will not only provide a reduction in costs for all motor vehicle owners but also provide easier access to information about the way CTP choices are put to new vehicle owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130735"></A>
I commend the Treasurer on implementing these reforms, which will reduce delivery costs in the CTP scheme by banning the payment of these hidden fees that have been subsidised by all motor vehicle owners. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (4.12 pm): I rise today to speak on the Motor Accident Insurance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. As mentioned by previous speakers and as outlined in the explanatory notes, this bill has three significant elements and a number of other minor amendments. Importantly, the bill aims to reduce delivery and acquisition costs and promote greater price competition within the CTP scheme so as to deliver premium savings to motor vehicle owners. It also updates the state’s third-party access regime, contained in part 5 of the Queensland Competition Authority Act 1997. To complement the enhancements to the QCA Act, the bill will also make amendments to the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 which are specific to QR National’s corporate governance framework. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130737"></A>
As mentioned, the bill also makes further amendments to the TI Act in the following areas: it strengthens the existing provisions dealing with priority for regularly scheduled passenger services; it inserts new provisions into the TI Act to preserve existing passenger and non-coal freight train paths; and it enshrines in legislation the government’s rather belated commitment that future toll increases on the Gateway Motorway, the gateway extension motorway and the Logan Motorway of Queensland Motorways Ltd will be limited to the annual consumer price index. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130738"></A>
Other speakers have addressed--and no doubt further speakers will also address--the elements of the bill that pertain to CTP, asset sales and increases to tolls. So I would like to focus my comments on the changes to the Queensland Competition Authority Act, the QCA Act. Competition policy in Queensland has been developed with the assistance of the 1995 competition policy agreement drawn up by COAG. The agreement required the Commonwealth government to assist states and territories in their development of third-party access regimes. As noted in the government’s June consultation paper--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130739"></A>
Third party access regimes create a regulatory framework to enable fair and reasonable access by third parties to significant natural monopoly infrastructure facilities such as electricity grids, gas pipelines, rail tracks and port channels. Access regulation is intended to apply where owners or operators of natural monopoly infrastructure have the potential to exercise market power by denying access to their facilities or charging excessive prices, thereby hindering or preventing competition within a dependent market. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1130740"></A>
As the consultation paper goes on to state, establishing legislation that protects the right to seek access to such services is, therefore, imperative. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130741"></A>
Queensland’s third-party access regime is modelled on part 3A of the Commonwealth Trade Practices Act 1974 and it has been in place for more than a decade. As such, it was based on an environment in which eligible infrastructure facilities were predominantly publicly owned with limited private investment. Accordingly, it was envisaged that third-party access regulation would almost exclusively be applied to publicly owned facilities. Since the nineties there has been an increasing prevalence of private investment in these significant infrastructure facilities. The bill therefore seeks to update and enhance the regime to reflect these changes and provide increased certainty for regulated businesses and their customers. As contained in the explanatory notes, the bill will achieve this by: making it more explicit that the regime only applies to services provided by significant infrastructure facilities; introducing a pre-expiry review to assess whether significant infrastructure should again be declared; being more explicit on the matters the ministers must consider when making an access code; and removing deemed decision for access declarations. The bill, it is suggested by the government, will also improve efficiency through promoting more timely regulatory processes. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1130742"></A>
In making these changes the bill must also make amendments to the TI Act, specifically around the vertically integrated operations of QR National. The original proposals as circulated in the consultation paper earlier this year included that the majority of directors of QR Network’s board must be independent of the executive management of the QR group; that access agreements between QR Network and its related entities must be approved in advance by the QR Network board; and that the directors of QR Network must not approve an access agreement with QR National unless the directors are reasonably satisfied the agreement is at arm’s length. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130743"></A>
It is interesting to note that, unlike the pronounced and now substantiated amendments to the QCA Act, these proposals were not supported by either the Queensland Resources Council or Asciano, a transport company that includes Pacific National rail operation and Patrick ports and stevedoring businesses. In its submission the Queensland Resources Council states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130744"></A>
QRC considers that the proposed amendments to the TIA, in their current form, will not achieve their intended purpose of ensuring ‘the independence of the QR Network Board from the QR Group’. Consistent with past commercial and policy practice, QRC will be looking to the State Government to address specific matters relating to QR National’s vertically integrated structure and consequential perverse ownership incentives, including the extraction of monopoly profits from the supply chain by withholding investment or delaying infrastructure expansions, to be addressed within the network lease agreement between the State and QR National. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1130745"></A>
Asciano was stronger in its objection, stating--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130746"></A>
... there are a number of areas where the amendments are not sufficient to prevent anti competitive behaviour by incumbent monopolists. In particular, the non discrimination and governance controls around QRNetwork are ineffective and the term of the declaration is inadequate. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1130747"></A>
Asciano continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130748"></A>
The corporate governance controls are ineffective. In particular a director of a QRNational company can be a director of QRNetwork and the board of directors of QRNetwork can take into account the interests of a QRNational company in addition to its own interests in making decisions. This governance framework facilitates and encourages QRNetwork to prefer the interests of its related above rail operator over those of third party rail operators. At a minimum there needs to be a majority of independent directors on the QRNetwork board, with independent meaning independent from any QR related companies. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130749"></A>
It appears the government was listening--at least in this instance and perhaps for a change--for the final amendments we see in this legislation will enhance the governance of the QR Network board from the QR National group by requiring the majority of directors of the QR Network board to be independent of the executive management of the QR National group and prevent QR Network directors from approving an access agreement with QR National unless they are reasonably satisfied the agreement is on arm’s lengths terms. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130750"></A>
As I said earlier, establishing legislation that protects the right to seek access to significant natural monopoly infrastructure facilities is imperative. It is also imperative that monopolies such as QR Network are transparent and seen to be independent in their decision making around such access decisions. It appears that this bill may improve our state’s legislative response to these imperatives. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (4.20 pm): I rise to speak to the Motor Accident Insurance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The first part of the bill is the matter about which the Treasurer made significant announcements during the budget, in relation to vehicle owners in the state of Queensland receiving $20 extra a year because of the changes to CTP insurance. Naturally, motor dealers throughout Queensland reacted to that press release. In my electorate, two representatives from a very reputable, family owned company spoke to me and I place on the record their concerns in relation to the changes to the CTP scheme. If you asked any person in Queensland whether they wanted an extra $20 in their pocket, even though that is a relatively small amount of money, they would say, ‘Of course I do’. However, it is important to place on the record the feelings of the motor dealers in relation to the impact on them and on jobs. I quote from an email that I received from those two dealers. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130752"></A>
Please find attached the Treasurer’s Media Release regarding the changes to CTP which I would like to discuss with you. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130753"></A>
The changes have enormous implications to Motor Dealerships state wide. I have had discussions with Suncorp Insurance over the past week and the estimate that the Insurance industry has put on these changes is 10 million dollars which will be taken out of the Qld Motor Vehicle Industry. This in turn means hundreds of jobs will disappear within Motor Dealerships in Qld over the next 3 months as the change comes into effect. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130754"></A>
In our case alone the difference will amount to $125,000, which means 3 staff members. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130755"></A>
The changes amount to nothing more than trying to pull the wool over Queenslander’s eyes. The Government has been increasing their fees over the last few years at astronomical rates, and now expect businesses to drop their fees to make the Government look good. The changes will save a motorist around $20... but cost Queenslander’s hundreds of jobs. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130756"></A>
Subsequent to receiving the email, I met with those dealers. They spoke of the pressures on the motor industry over the past short while. They raised the fact that since the withdrawal from the country of finance companies GMAC and GE, there has been an increase in interest rate charges for floor plan financing. They went on to explain the implications on their ability to employ staff. They said that three of their staff members were directly involved in the organisation of CTP and registration. They have a close relationship with and, indeed, act as an agent for Queensland Transport, and those staff members do that work. I asked whether there was any other benefit to the motor dealerships as a result of a close association with one or other insurance company. They acknowledged that they received ‘a good deal’ on their insurance because of that close relationship. That needs to be put on the record. Certainly in Queensland and in my electorate motor dealers are feeling the pressures because of these changes. It is very difficult to vote against the proposal, simply because in Queensland many families--indeed, most families--are struggling under the increased costs that particularly the state government has imposed on them. </Hansard-Body>

In June I wrote to the Treasurer, asking a number of questions. I asked--</Hansard-Body>

Could you clarify the following matters please? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1130759"></A>
• 	What consultation has occurred with the Motor Traders Association or other representatives of the motor vehicle industry?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1130760"></A>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1130761"></A>
• 	What consideration has been given to the impact of the loss of the benefit to motor traders--ie payment of a commission by insurers for directing CTP cover to them by motor traders? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1130762"></A>
• 	Has a quantitative study been done in relation to potential job losses in the motor industry... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1130763"></A>
• 	Will this change impact on local Departments of Transport offices? Will constituents have to travel to Departmental offices to organise CTP thus offsetting any benefit to consumers? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1130764"></A>
• 	When is it proposed to introduce the bill to Parliament? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130765"></A>
The Treasurer replied, stating--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130766"></A>
... the Queensland Government held concerns as to the cost efficiency of the CTP scheme, as these costs are ultimately borne by motor vehicle owners in the form of higher premiums. In what was envisaged as a competitive premium band model, CTP insurers have in recent times consistently priced at the ceiling set by the scheme’s regulator, the Motor Accident Insurance Commission (the Commission). Of particular concern were the costs associated with the payment of commissions to intermediaries like motor dealers by CTP insurers. Not only has this given rise to higher CTP premiums, it has caused significant barriers for new entrants to the scheme or those insurers wanting to build market share. This also hinders price competition.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130767"></A>
I can assure you that the Government and the Commission in its statutory capacity has had ongoing consultation with CTP insurers throughout the review process and following the budget announcement. Similarly the Commission invited and received a submission from the Motor Trades Association of Queensland (MTAQ) during the review process. Since the budget announcement, there has been further consultation with MTAQ and other stakeholders. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130768"></A>
I acknowledge the potential impact on motor vehicle dealers, however the policy rationale for trailing commissions is especially questionable. The Government considered a range of inputs and decided that there was an overall clear benefit to motor vehicle owners by undertaking these reforms.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130769"></A>
It is worth noting that apart from New South Wales, no other state or territory in Australia allows for the payment of commissions on CTP insurance. No state or territory government pays a fee to motor dealers for registering a vehicle.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1130770"></A>
I acknowledge that point. The Treasurer continued--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130771"></A>
It is not anticipated there will be additional cost or impact to Customer Service Centres operated by the Department of Transport and Main Roads (DTMR). Motor dealers will continue to use existing software for a DTMR interface or current arrangements through Customer Services Centres. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1130772"></A>
The Treasurer then advised that the bill would be introduced during the August sittings. I thank the Treasurer for that fulsome response. However, I need to place on the record the concerns in relation to motor dealers, particularly those of one of the three larger dealerships in my electorate. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130773"></A>
The remainder of the bill predominantly deals with privatisation, which makes it very difficult for those of us who wish to support our communities in relation to any refund on the cost of CTP to oppose the rest of the bill that relates to privatisation. The Treasurer has effectively ensured that, during the second reading, we will perhaps vote for the first part of the bill and then call a division on every clause that relates to the privatisation. Surely that is not an acceptable direction to take, but it is one that the Treasurer has left us no option but to take. Strategically, it might have been a good move on his part to put what is, from the community’s perspective, a palatable part of the legislation at the front of the bill and the privatisation matters at the back of the bill, in the hope that the bill would be passed without objection. However, the reality is that my electorate remains totally opposed to the privatisation of Queensland Rail coal freight. There has been no reduction in their concern or objection. I certainly will not be supporting those parts of the legislation that relate to that privatisation. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr DOWLING </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Redlands--LNP) (4.29 pm): I rise to speak to the Motor Accident Insurance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, which attempts to achieve a number of things. I will limit my comments to the compulsory third-party component of the legislation which I think most of my constituents are more concerned about with the day-to-day running of their household budget. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130775"></A>
The amendment bill seeks to remove the current provision allowing for a commission to be paid by insurers to vendors who, more often than not, are motor dealers who process the compulsory third-party insurance at the point of sale. At the same time, the legislation removes the opportunity of a funding stream used by numerous charities to carry out their work in our community. I recall during my response to the budget on 11 June that this policy had not been thought through, and I said as much to the Treasurer at the time. I remind those opposite of the comments I made on 11 June. I said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130776"></A>
There is another example of the government thinking things up but failing to think them through. The Treasurer announced that there will be a review of compulsory third party insurance so that motorists do not bear the cost of commissions paid to other parties. I highlight to the Treasurer--and I am pleased he is in the House--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1130777"></A>
and still in the House--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130778"></A>
that there are a number of entities who benefit and rely upon those commissions. Let me list some of those beneficiaries. They are organisations such as Rotary clubs, the Autism Association, sporting clubs across the length and breadth of Queensland, chaplaincies, school P&amp;Cs, who actually pick up a trailer from those compulsory third party policies, and who knows how many more. It is not the first time that this government has seen fit to raid the community coffers. They raped and plundered the community gambling fund only recently, and that is so typical. I would like to know what the Treasurer thinks the community organisations will do to try to replace the revenues that they are about to lose. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130779"></A>
That is what I said on 11 June. Now we know--an amendment like so many amendments. You would think that a government with the resources that it has could manage to get a piece of legislation into the House that has been free of Labor spin and not done in undue haste--something diligently prepared by the relevant departments, free to do the work they are capable of doing and need to do without Labor’s incompetence or the ham-fisted approach so typical of this dysfunctional Labor government. This is another example of a Labor government which has no understanding of the decisions it makes and the knock-on effects. While I support any attempt to reduce the costs to Queensland motorists, it is a bit rich when Labor takes the credit for prohibiting CPT commissions but at the same time has been directly responsible for so many more increases for the motoring public.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130780"></A>
The government has been directly responsible for removing the Fuel Subsidy Scheme, increasing fuel costs. It has increased road toll charges up and down our motorways. It has increased vehicle registration. It has increased driver’s licence costs, with more to come. We are now the most expensive state in which to own a motor car. That is in direct contrast to where we used to be--one of the most affordable states to own and operate a motor car. It has increased transfer duty. This is then added to everything else that this government has mismanaged, like power and water--the everyday essentials that most people cannot live without and are locked into a closed market. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130781"></A>
The charitable groups that have been robbed by this new policy are many and varied and include such charities as I mentioned earlier--Rotary Clubs, Autism Queensland, sporting clubs and school chaplaincy. School chaplaincy is one of those great initiatives in our schools and I think it is so undervalued. School chaplaincy is under great threat. A small concession by the Treasurer in allowing a once-only commission to charities is half a step in the right direction. However, it does not replace the ongoing revenue loss for the charity if the purchaser of the CTP fails to deliberately nominate the charity at the time of renewal each year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130782"></A>
This Labor government will again get bruised shoulders from all the backslapping and self-promotion of this generous, benevolent offer by the Treasurer. But the Treasurer is not able to offer this $20 to $24 reduction in CTP insurance because of any government efficiency or any significant improvement in the state’s finances. It is, however, using someone else’s money to manipulate a false discount. It is a fool’s economy that has seen Queensland go bust in a boom. The worst Treasurer in the history of Queensland continues to run Queensland into the ground. We have lost our AAA credit rating--the only state to do that. We have gone from the cheapest to the dearest state in Australia in which to own and operate a vehicle. The people of Queensland cannot afford this continual financial impost at the hands of the Premier and the Treasurer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130783"></A>
This Labor government has lost its way, just the same as the Rudd-Gillard Labor government federally lost its way, just the same as Labor governments across the country have lost their way. Taking hundreds of dollars every quarter out of household budgets and replacing it with a $20 to $24 a year discount annually is a fool’s economy. Only an LNP government will deliver real action. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs PRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nanango--Ind) (4.35 pm): I rise to speak to the Motor Accident Insurance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. I know that I have risen before other people who wanted to speak, but I do not know where they are. So I thank the Deputy Speaker for the opportunity to speak. I will not take up much time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130785"></A>
Like other members in this House, I have been approached by many motor dealers in the Kingaroy and Nanango districts with concerns about this particular bill. It is a feel good bill in some ways because everyone wants an $20 extra in their pocket at any time. Overall, I think a higher price will paid by rural communities and by young workers who want to work in the motor vehicle industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130786"></A>
I also believe that motor dealers are a very easy target, but this will affect them. In one case I think the member for Gladstone said it would cost one dealer $120,000. One dealer in my area will be impacted by a $60,000 loss, which is at least 1 jobs in their business. Although the rest of the state may indeed get $20 back in their pocket every year, some people--possibly their own children--will in fact lose their jobs. In a lot of ways, this is robbing Peter to pay Paul. I would like to read a letter from one of the motor dealers who wrote to me. He wrote--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130787"></A>
The Treasurer announced in the budget CTP reforms with an effective date of 1 October 2010. The reforms will lower the CTP premiums by $24 and prohibit the payment of commissions and other forms of inducements with CTP insurance. The Treasurer also stated a number of CTP insurers pay motor vehicle dealers and others commissions on what is a compulsory product. These costs are ultimately borne by motor vehicle owners in the insurer’s premium pricing. The government will legislate to ban the payment of commissions associated with CTP insurance as of the abovementioned date, and we will also look at other charges now to ensure that these costs do not emerge in other forms. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130788"></A>
I think most people would note that the vehicle costs have risen in all manner of forms. You only have to look at registration. The government reduces the costs in one area but puts them up in others. To think that people are actually going to save $20 is wrong. Somewhere along the line they are going to be penalised, and it will not just be by $20. It will be by considerably more. We have seen continual price rises over the last 12 to 18 months, and they are totally unreasonable overall. I oppose this section of the bill. I know that there will be a lot of people out there who will not like me for doing that. But I believe that any job is worth saving, and most people would not mind paying $20 if they could ensure jobs for their children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130789"></A>
This motor dealer who wrote to me has been a dealer for an awfully long time. He stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130790"></A>
Some important points we would like to raise are the following. Approximately 20 to 25 years ago Queensland Transport registered all vehicles at Queensland Transport offices. This included checking vehicle ID and paperwork. An in-dealership online registration scheme was developed which involved the need for computer software and the training of staff. In agreement to accept liability dealers also sell personalised numberplates for which there is commission. At the time the pay-off to offset the cost to the dealer was to increase commission on CTP from one to five per cent. The loss of the five per cent commission on new CTP business and the one per cent on renewal CTP business will cost the motor vehicle industry millions of dollars. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130791"></A>
Like I said, there will not be many people out there who will have sympathy for motor dealers because they think they do all right anyway. The point is that there will be a greater cost to consumers than the $20 per annum they save on CTP insurance. I will be opposing the first part of the bill. I am not sure whether I am the only one who will oppose that part of the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130792"></A>
I definitely oppose the rest of the bill. It is another sneaky tactic by this government to include possible privatisation issues within bills such as this. I do not think I have left anyone in this House in any doubt about exactly how I feel on the issue of privatisation. I foreshadow here and now that any bill that comes into this House that facilitates in any way, shape or form the sale of public assets will be opposed by me. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130793"></A>
I know this is a deliberate tactic to try to hoodwink the majority of people in the electorate. I can explain this pretty clearly, which I will be doing out there. This government is already thought to be very sneaky. I think this shows that it continues to use those practices. The House is on notice that I will oppose this bill. I definitely do not commend it to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.41 pm): There just are not any surprises left in this world, are there? I rise to fully support the Motor Accident Insurance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. We have heard a lot about cost of living increases in this debate. It is true that, like countries around the world that are also grappling with pressures such as repaying funds used to fight the global financial crisis and responding to the costs of population growth, Queensland is not immune to those pressures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130795"></A>
These are difficult times on a number of levels. I know that it is getting harder for many families to make ends meet. As a government we provide a range of subsidies and rebates to assist the most vulnerable in our communities to ease the burden on their weekly income. We are also on the lookout for new ways to cut costs such as our ClimateSmart Home Service which equips householders to monitor daily electricity use and take control of unnecessary usage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130796"></A>
A review of one of the mandatory costs associated with vehicle ownership, the CTP scheme, revealed that what should be a competitive environment has become less than perfect in a number of ways. Indeed, the review identified that not all motor vehicle owners are benefiting from the price competition on CTP insurance. While we do see advertisements from time to time offering special deals that include a competitive CTP arrangement when insurance products are bundled up by the customer, new car buyers are not only not being offered a competitive price for CTP but the incentives paid to motor vehicle dealers have contributed to a situation where all of the licensed CTP insurers have filed their class 1--that is, for cars and station wagons--premiums at the regulated premium ceiling. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130797"></A>
This means that motorists are paying top price for CTP while motor dealers and insurance companies enjoy the spoils of the arrangement. Clearly, motorists have not been getting the full benefit of competitive CTP premiums which should result from private sector involvement. As I said before, I am aware that insurers offer inducements to some motorists in the form of discounts on other insurance products and the likes of fuel vouchers, but these offers have only benefited selected motor vehicle owners while the remainder continue to pay high premiums. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130798"></A>
It appears that the licensed CTP insurers have put more effort into competing for motor vehicle dealerships as tied agency arrangements than actually competing for customers on premium pricing. The cost of payments to intermediaries like motor dealers and brokers as well as the cost of these additional policyholder inducements has been charged against the CTP scheme and insurers have filed their premiums at the regulated premium ceiling to offset these additional costs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130799"></A>
The reforms contained in this bill appropriately prohibit commissions on what is a compulsory government product and will also stop the cost of inducements to policyholders being charged against the CTP scheme, giving motor vehicle owners a real opportunity to benefit from CTP price competition. I commend the Treasurer for acting and implementing these reforms to provide an environment in which not only will the vehicle owners pay lower delivery costs in their CTP premium but they will benefit from true CTP price competition. I therefore commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(4.45 pm): I rise to speak in the debate on the Motor Accident Insurance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. In the minister’s second reading speech he said that the amendments to the Motor Accident Insurance Act 1994 contained in the bill are the culmination of the government’s commitment in this year’s state budget to deliver a CTP scheme that provides value for money for Queensland’s motor vehicle owners. These reforms to the CTP scheme will deliver a cut to the total registration bill paid by Queenslanders from 1 October this year. </Hansard-Body>

This $24 saving is welcome because $24 is a lot of money to the average battlers out there. However, the cost of drivers’ licences is set to double. Our fuel subsidy has been removed.

They are being hit with whopping bills of $6,000 for leases that in some cases no longer exist. A letter from DERM advises miners that leases will now be paid in advance. Miners now have to make a payment to the environmental authority of $500 for each lease. It was previously $200 for each lease. This has to be paid every year whether or not the lease has been granted. In previous years it was a one-off payment that would last for the term of the lease. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130803"></A>
It gets worse. Incredibly, some miners have been asked to pay the increase in fee backdated to before the new legislation came into effect on 1 January 2009. One miner who owns several leases is facing a fee of $10,000, with more bills rolling in by the day. Not only are they facing these exorbitant bills which are backdated but the miners have also found out that this will not be a one-off fee but a fee that will need to be paid every year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130804"></A>
The environmental authority is immediately activated when a mining lease application is made. The charges are applied at that time. The applications usually take years to be granted. The miners are thus required to pay for leases that they do not own and may not even be granted. These small miners are scrambling to find thousands of dollars to pay for unexpected bills. I call on the minister to investigate this issue. </Hansard-Body>

I have an issue with third-party access. If a driver hits a kangaroo or a pig in our rural or regional areas there is no chance to claim that insurance. I think that needs to be investigated. If the passenger is hurt, that is different. That is something that needs to be looked at. I wanted to bring that to the attention of the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind) (4.49 pm): I rise to make a very brief contribution to the Motor Accident Insurance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, something which I am sure all members will appreciate. I acknowledge that the policy objective of the bill is to reduce delivery and acquisition costs and promote greater price competition within the CTP scheme so as to deliver premium savings to motor vehicle owners of about, as many members have said, $20 to $24. I also acknowledge that the bill amends the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994, which is specific to QR National Ltd’s corporate governance framework.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130808"></A>
The name of this bill is misleading. This is the Motor Accident Insurance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill because the government decided to call it that. By my calculations, 20 pages of this bill are spent on motor accident insurance provisions, 35 pages of this bill are on competition authority and 13 pages of this bill are on transport infrastructure. If that is the case, why did the government not call this bill the ‘Competition Authority and Other Acts Amendment Bill’? I would suggest that the reason that it has not correctly named this bill is that it wants the main focus of the debate to be on the savings, and member after member on the government side has risen and spoken about the $20 to $24 savings that people will get. It is just like a bad trumpet player--they wave the trumpet around to throw the focus off the dud notes. This government wants everyone to focus on the alleged $20 to $24 savings but wants us to forget the jobs that the members for Nanango and Gladstone spoke about. It wants us to forget about the jobs that will be lost in the motor dealerships, especially in rural and regional Queensland. It looks like those job cuts will be heavy and will be significant in those motor dealerships.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130809"></A>
The government also wants us to forget about the 9c per litre extra that we are paying every time we fill up the tank. Every time I drive from the Burnett to this place I fill up the car, and the cheapest fuel is about $1.21. I keep thinking, ‘If only this government, if only this Treasurer and if only this Premier hadn’t added 9c or more a litre, everyone would be better off.’ Once again, that extra charge hits people in rural and regional areas harder than it does people in the south-east corner. Anyone north of Caboolture and those who live in rural and regional areas who have to travel further and obviously use more fuel are hit disproportionately by that tax--effectively an extra tax. The government wants us to forget about the 400 per cent increase in land rents, and we appreciate how much $20 to $24 is. The retirees in Carlyle Gardens village in the Burnett all know the value of a dollar and how much it costs to live and every cent is counted, and they understand that this government is $85 billion in debt. They know that we have to look after our own budgets.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130810"></A>
Many speakers in the opposition have outlined this point, but we are also being asked by this government to forget that two-thirds of the bill, which effectively facilitates and helps the sale of our state’s assets, was not spoken about or addressed by many members of the government. The member for Gaven made the point in his speech that this government is fearful that the regulation in law surrounding the sale of rail and other infrastructure will undermine the sale and the sale price of Queensland Rail. They are not his exact words, but there are provisions in this bill which facilitate and assist in the sale of Queensland state assets. The member for Nanango is opposing the first part of the bill, and I agree. There will be job losses because of the passage of this bill. The sale of our state assets will be facilitated if this bill passes this place. Obviously the pertinent question to ask is: if this bill failed to pass this place, would it hamper or slow down the efforts of this government to sell off and privatise our state assets? I believe that the answer to that question is yes. If this bill failed to pass, it would hamper those sales. For that reason, I am going to oppose this bill. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr HORAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba South--LNP) (4.55 pm): This afternoon we are discussing an important bill in the Motor Accident Insurance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill which covers four major issues--the compulsory third-party insurance premium and how that is paid, keeping motorway tolls within or below CPI, and two issues with regard to the detail of competition policy particularly as it relates to government owned enterprises. First of all I want to address the matter of compulsory third-party insurance. When the budget was brought down, this was the only single item where the government gave anything to the people. Everybody then discovered that it was not a gift from the government to the people; it is actually--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130812"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr O’Brien:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Medical rebates!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130813"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HORAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection. However, what I am saying is that that was one of the major items that it promoted post budget in terms of giving something to the people. We then discovered that it was not coming from the government but rather from motor dealers. If anybody has had a belting from pillar to post, it has been Queensland motorists. This CTP insurance saving of approximately $20 to $24 per registration will provide a small relief to Queensland motorists who are staggering under the heaviest costs in Australia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130814"></A>
The previous system provided motor dealers with a commission for going through the process of CTP when somebody bought a new car. In other words, they were basically doing the work of the government because, if they did not do it, people buying a car would have to go to the motor registry offices and the queues there would have been kilometres long, because the queues there are long enough now anyway. Doing that processing provided some motor dealers with a very modest amount of income, especially for country dealers. There is a dealer in a small township near Toowoomba which got $19,000 to $20,000 per year which helped them employ the receptionist in the office of their dealership. This is not a big dealership and that was an important part of their cash flow in terms of maintaining staff. The whole gamut of dealers--small, medium and large--would receive varying amounts. However, the thing we have to remember about car dealerships is how important they are in the commercial structure of our cities and towns. No matter what the dealership, they are employing salesmen, they are employing mechanics, they are employing service people, they are employing reception staff, they are paying advertising in the local newspaper and they are providing work to many of the associated motor industry businesses in town such as panelbeaters, detailers, windscreen tinting, painting and all the rest of it. It is a huge industry and it is a very important industry in our cities. If those dealerships were taken out, there would be a major problem with unemployment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130815"></A>
So it is important for the economies of our towns that the motor dealerships are recognised for what they do. This amendment takes away something that had been partly a service that they provided, but it was also a payment for providing that service or a commission for providing that service. Also, other people benefited, such as Scripture Union, various sporting clubs and various service clubs. I know that this bill allows those charitable organisations to still be a part of this arrangement, but it depends upon the insurer agreeing to that commission. In other words, the insurer probably has to come up with a percentage to come out of its CTP to pass on. It has to be a system of ticking a box to allow that arrangement to continue as a trailing commission. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130816"></A>
I think the point that should be recognised is the importance of motor dealerships. They will now be suffering a loss of income for something that became part of their normal cash flow. We would do well to remember how many of these motor dealerships relied on this arrangement as a component of paying staff, particularly front-office staff within their dealerships, who in many cases were the ones who processed these compulsory third-party insurance arrangements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130817"></A>
As I said, this amendment will provide a small relief to Queensland motorists, because they are facing absolutely horrendous costs. It is those costs that are hitting motorists and people who operate trucking organisations that are starting to flow on. Not only are the direct costs flowing on; the indirect costs are also flowing on to the rest of our community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130818"></A>
We hear so much about the increased cost of living. Every single matchstick and everything else that comes to Toowoomba comes on the back of a truck. Those trucking operators have to pay more stamp duty, more for fuel, more for registration and more for the tolls. Everything that they do is costing them more. Even the registration for the B-double trailer alone is now around $15,000 per year. So there are massive costs and those costs get passed on to the supermarket, the small business or whoever else is getting that item brought to Toowoomba to be sold. It is the same situation in the capital city, the regional cities and the country areas of Queensland. Those costs that are hitting Queensland motorists are hitting all the freight and trucking companies and are being passed on right down the chain and they are contributing to the increases in the cost of living in the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130819"></A>
If I can coin a phrase from this morning’s TV reality show type stunt that the government wants to put on, let us walk in the shoes of an average Queensland motorist who goes to buy a vehicle. If he wants to buy a modest, second-hand Ford, from the stamp duty increase of a couple of years ago that vehicle will cost him a couple of hundred dollars more. But if he is a tradesman or a rural person who wants to buy a LandCruiser ute to use for his work, that is going to cost him about $2,000 more because of that increase in stamp duty. When he turns the key and finds that the vehicle is only a quarter full of fuel, he then has to go and fill up at the servo and he finds that fuel is around 10c a litre dearer because this government imposed--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130821"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HORAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No, it is 10c a litre dearer because of the fuel tax that the government whacked on--the 8.35c plus the GST. We have heard some figures today that fuel prices in Queensland are now among the dearest in Australia whereas Queensland always had the cheapest fuel in Australia. The cost of fuel in Queensland was always around 9c to 10c a litre less than it was in other states. Now, Queensland’s fuel prices are way up there. So everybody has to fork out a bit more every time they fill up their car. Whether it is a little car or a big vehicle, everyone has to pay more and it is money out of their pockets.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130822"></A>
 If we are walking in the shoes of this Queensland motorist when he goes to pay his registration, which used to be the cheapest in Australia, we will find that it is now the dearest in Australia. If he wants to get the vehicle home and he goes on the Gateway Motorway or the Logan Motorway, he finds that the tolls have gone up again with that big increase that the government put on the tolling system. So all the time it is cost, cost, cost. Not only are motoring costs going up; their electricity, their water, their gas--just about everything they touch--has also gone up. Queenslanders have less money in their pockets, so they are not going to the small businesses. They are not buying the clothes that they used to buy. They are not going to the restaurants where they used to take their family. They are hanging back on buying real estate because they have less money in their pocket. So everything that this government is doing is taking money out of the pockets of people and causing serious problems to our economy. Members should go and talk to small business and ask how things are going. The mismanagement and the waste that has occurred under this government has caused these problems.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130823"></A>
When you have a government drowning in debt--lining up for $85 billion of debt, which will cost the state as a whole around $100 million a week in interest--it has to find ways to pay the interest, let alone the capital. That is why we have had all of these massive increases. How has that debt been accumulated? It has been through years of mismanagement, of not keeping enough money aside within the budget in the boom times to pay for the capital works that the government wants to undertake. It has been accumulated through the government mismanaging the way it manages the state’s finances. The government spent more than it should have and, as a result, it did not have the capital to undertake the capital works. So it has to go out and borrow. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130824"></A>
We have seen the mismanagement of projects like the western corridor recycled water pipeline--a great white elephant, with only about 15 per cent or 20 per cent of its water capacity being utilised--the cost of which blew out by about $1 billion, and Traveston Dam, on which hundreds of millions of dollars were wasted. They are just individual cases of mismanagement and waste. There has also been the overall waste by the government year after year after year. It spent and spent and spent to try to buy its way out of massive problems that came as a result of weak ministers and mismanagement. Then it taxes the people and charges the people to try to handle the massive interest burden that it has built up, let alone make the capital repayments. Of course, that has led to the loss of Queensland’s AAA rating, which amounts to somewhere between $259 million and $280 million a year more in interest penalty payments on top of all the other interest. What would that buy by way of hospitals or schools for our sate? Nevertheless, that is absolutely dead money that has to be found as penalty interest and the government has to pay that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130825"></A>
That is what has forced the government into privatisation. It is not making proper capital payments. Even though the income the government is earning from these assets is probably more than the interest that it would save by selling them off, it is forced by its own financial mismanagement to go into this fire sale of assets, which we have so vehemently opposed and which we will continue to oppose. As we have said, the only way to stop the privatisation will be to vote into office an LNP government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130826"></A>
This bill also addresses competition policy with regard to monopoly service providers. This part of the bill endeavours to maintain the competition oversight of monopoly service providers within Queensland rather than that oversight being forced on the state by the federal government, because they are two regimes that oversight competition within monopoly owned facilities, be they ports, rail, or waste water treatment. As a result, this legislation brings in a system so that where there is a monopoly owned item, such as a rail track, there is a process for seeking to gain access to that facility by other organisations that want to use it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130827"></A>
This bill also addresses the issue of boards and sub-boards within government owned enterprise. For example, that part of Queensland Rail that is a board and which operates the Queensland rail network--the tracks and so forth--does not have the same board as the other segment of Queensland Rail that operates the freight system, QR National. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130828"></A>
The fourth element of this bill relates to the tolls on the motorways. Recently the tolls on the motorways were massively increased by the government by gazettal. That increase was not done by regulation that went through the parliament so that it could have been challenged in the parliament and voted against; it was done by gazettal. That is an unfortunate fact of life. Because it went through that system we did not have the opportunity in this parliament to oppose it and endeavour to stop it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130829"></A>
This bill looks at containing any future increases to CPI or less. At least it would keep them to what might be described as a modest increase but an increase on a far bigger base than previously existed. This is quite a cynical exercise because there is no doubt that that gazettal notice and the increase in the motorway tolls was done to make those motorways more attractive to a buyer as part of the government’s fire sale, as it sold off the motorway tolling franchises, as it sold off our Brisbane Port, as it sold off Queensland forestry and as it sold off the very productive and financially viable coal lines within Queensland Rail. This section of the bill has a sour taste about it, but strictly speaking all this bill is doing is containing the future increases to within CPI. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130830"></A>
We would certainly hope that increases are not always at the level of the CPI. We would like to think that they could be kept a bit below the CPI. People on low and fixed incomes in particular cannot afford the increases that are occurring. This government admitted this morning that its members have not walked in the shoes of ordinary people or talked to ordinary people for the past 10 years, that it has members who have been here since 1998 and even members who have been here for 18 months or six years who do not know how the people are feeling. I can tell those members how people feel because we talk to pensioners and low-income workers. If those opposite were to ask them how they would find the extra 14 per cent to cover the electricity price rise, they would tell them they could not find it. One old pensioner told me the other day that they used to be able to scrimp and scrounge and maybe at the end of the pension period of two weeks they might have $6 left over and be able to buy a Magnum ice-cream or something like that as a bit of a treat. But no more, not since these increases have come in. </Hansard-Body>

 I hear the member for Cook squarking over there. I would like to see him on a pension trying to pay a 14 per cent rise this year in electricity, with a massive increase the year before and the year before that, totalling 54 per cent over a period of three years. That is for the basic need of electricity. When it comes to water, the government took over Seqwater and owns the wholesaling rights and the pipeline distribution rights. It takes the profit from that to try to pay off its debt and the interest. That is not to mention the selling off of the gas arm in Toowoomba which saw about a 300 per cent increase in the price of gas. People on pensions and low incomes cannot afford these massive increases. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130833"></A>
The fact that this increase will be CPI or less at least softens the blow in the future for those people who have been slugged with massive increases on the tollways in a cynical exercise by this government to jack up the potential value of the motorway tolling franchise so it could sell it off as part of a disgraceful and shameful fire sale of our public assets. That fire sale has been forced upon this state by 10 years of mismanagement, of waste, of spending more than was coming in. It has left Queensland with multimillion dollar deficits for the next four or five years and continued payments for generations to come of interest and capital on this massive debt--a debt which is bigger than the debt of New South Wales, with its much larger population. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130834"></A>
This bill addresses these immediate issues of the CPI limit on the tolls and some matters that have to be attended to within the gamut of providing competition so there is proper economic development within the operation of government owned assets that are monopolies, whether or not those particular assets are public or private. I reiterate our total opposition to the privatisation and I say again, in discussing this bill and looking at the issue of the money that goes to people under compulsory third-party premiums, let us not forget the contribution that is made to our economy and to jobs by motor dealerships throughout the length and breadth of Queensland. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr HOOLIHAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 You go back to your seat! There are a couple of aspects to this bill that everyone seems to have overlooked. My understanding comes from having had a couple of careers, one of them working for an insurance company. In those days motorists used to pay only a $2 third-party commission. Then it went to five per cent. Now it is not only paid when one registers a vehicle at the first point of call; it is paid every year, and it is paid every year while people are too lazy to shop around for their third-party insurance. Everyone gets a notice with their registration which says ‘If you want to change your third-party insurer, shop around.’ You have to change it before you pay your registration. That way you can get the cheapest premium. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130840"></A>
The Motor Accident Insurance Commission sets an upper and a lower limit for the cost of third-party insurance. Third-party insurance in Queensland is actually underwritten by private insurers. Does anyone know how many? I am willing to bet no-one does. There are six. While continuing to freeze out other insurance companies by paying trailing insurances they are maintaining their own profit base. Who are the costs ultimately borne by? They are borne by consumers. Bearing in mind that everyone pays their insurance through the Department of Transport and Main Roads, they are the ones who have to enforce any changes. As I said, most people do not shop around to compare their insurance. Does anyone know what the lowest insurance is? I am willing to bet that very few do. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOOLIHAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will take that interjection. It is $337. That in itself will effect a saving. One of the things that will come out of this legislation will be that the CTP insurance scheme will be protected in that if an insurance company is not able to continue to offer that insurance and meet the licensing requirements--and it did happen during the 1970s and 1980s when all insurance companies pulled out and the SGIO at that stage, now Suncorp, were the only third-party insurer--the state will provide that insurance. That will allow underwriting of the policies.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130843"></A>
One of the things that this does is allow competition between the insurance companies and, hopefully, new insurance companies can enter into the market. It does not limit car buyers’ choice in relation to the company that provides the CTP insurance when they buy a vehicle. As I said, hopefully, they will be able to shop around and find out what companies offer the cheapest deal when they go to renew their policy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132113"></A>
The other thing we heard much about was in relation to the access regime regarding particularly rail. Queensland has had an open and fair access regime for over a decade. This provides a legislative framework that governs the economic regulation of significant monopoly infrastructure. That is imposed on Queensland and every state in Australia by the national competition authority. An open access regime will guarantee non-discriminatory access. What a lot of people here may also not know is that Asciano through Pacific National now has about 20 per cent of the rail market in Queensland. It is intended that this change will ensure that they have unfettered access and that it is clear and transparent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132114"></A>
We heard from the member for Gaven about what has happened in Western Australia. I understand that, in that instance, Fortescue Metals has had its access to one particular line blocked, although the Federal Court did allow them to have access to a second line. The bill increases the transparency of the regulatory processes provided for in the regime. Regulatory decisions will now be guided by clear provisions to ensure that the Queensland Competition Authority administers and enforces compliance with the regime including giving the QCA the powers to collect information to monitor compliance with an access undertaking, as the state’s independent economic regulator is best placed to apply the provisions in the regime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132115"></A>
The ability for governments to make unilateral regulations regarding which services may be included or excluded from the regime will be removed. While the government has only made regulations where it has clearly been appropriate to do so, the changes increase certainty for players in the regulatory regime by legislating that coverage will be guided by clear access criteria and extensive involvement of the Queensland Competition Authority. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132116"></A>
In terms of the national competition authority and the Queensland Competition Authority, the national competition authority and the federal government will punish any state that does not offer clear and open competition between monopoly interests including monopoly infrastructure. This act will allow for the reduction in third-party insurance premiums by preventing the payment of trailing commissions. It will also look after the regulatory regime in Queensland. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (5.22 pm), in reply: I thank all members for their contribution to the debate this afternoon. I acknowledge that the bill has the support of both sides of the chamber--not unanimous support around the chamber, but both sides across the chamber. I think it is important to acknowledge that and to place that on the record. At times during the debate one had to wade through the blizzard of bile coming from some of those opposite in order to detect that they were, in fact, supporting the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132118"></A>
This is a bill that delivers on a central commitment of the government. That central commitment is to provide cost of living support to every Queenslander registering a motor vehicle through the policy changes on which we did the hard yards in order to provide a better system that delivers a cut--a real cut--in the costs of registering a motor vehicle in Queensland from 1 October this year. It is a $24 cut, as I announced at budget time. This was a process that I announced in the parliament in March. It is a process that occurred in consultation with industry. Then at budget time, at the conclusion of that review, the decision was to provide for a $24 cut. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132119"></A>
I want to address the point attempting to be made, which is false and which is untrue, by those opposite that this in no way relates to the government. In the first instance, the $20 reduction that arises through the policy changes in the banning of commissions is a result of the policy review that the government undertook. The policy work that the government undertook delivered this result to the people of Queensland--to the motorists of Queensland. We also--but none of them wanted to mention it today because it did not support the falsehood being advanced--have removed the $4 levy surcharge that was the fee to support the funding of the nominal defendant after the HIH levy. For the benefit of the record, let the falsehood not stand that was put forward by those opposite that this in no way related to the government’s efforts or, indeed, to an impact on the government’s finances--quite the opposite. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132120"></A>
As to the notion, however, that the $24 cut that the government has put in place is something that should be decried, as many of those opposite did--unlike the member for Dalrymple, who obviously for once forgot to pick up the script from the Leader of the Opposition’s office when he acknowledged that it was an important contribution--imagine if the government had proposed a $24 increase to CTP in the budget. Imagine if I had, in handing down the budget, proposed a $24 increase. They all would have stood up and, to a man and woman, argued the fact that $24 would break the bank of every single Queenslander. However, on this occasion when we are delivering it back, they seek to decry it. Therefore, they are revealed for practising the most dismal form of politics which is without ideals, without a clue, without any policy appreciation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132121"></A>
Let us also say this. In fact, if any of them had looked up the scheme, they would have noticed something else--that $24 is not where it ends. In anticipation of the reforms we have put in place in the abolition of commissions to promote competition--real price competition so that consumers, Queensland motorists, are the beneficiaries--one of the companies has moved off the ceiling and is, in fact, taking a further $5 off. For all those who thought that $24 was not enough, the good news today is that if people shop around they can get $29 off. The good news about abolishing commissions is that insurance companies who underwrite the scheme now have the wood on them to promote price competition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130853"></A>
I want to address the complete falsehood being advanced by those people who are singing the eulogy of the motor dealers of Queensland and the people who work for them as somehow being of higher virtue than the interests of Queensland consumers. Let me say this: I am the son of a car dealer. In fact, if honourable members drive to Proserpine and they drive down Main Street they will see Fraser Ford proudly still standing there. Yes, my broader family still has a stake in it. I am a Ford man and proud of it. I have always been a Ford man and I have always been a Labor man. The two go together and I also bank with the Commonwealth. All of those members opposite would actually do a lot better if they got on board with the ‘holy trinity’: bank with the Commonwealth, vote Labor and make sure they back the Fords at Bathurst. They can take the tip.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130854"></A>
Let me say this about the commissions: those people who are seeking to say that the right of motor vehicle dealers in this state should continue as is are saying that those motor vehicle dealers--and we heard them quoted--were getting hundreds of thousands of dollars each and every year. That is not a fee for service. That is not because the motor vehicle dealer is getting paid to register a vehicle. That fee is being paid by each and every Queenslander each and every year they renew their CTP, not when they buy a new car but when they register a vehicle. So if people have not bought a car at any time in the last 20 years but in each of the last 20 years they have renewed their registration and paid the CTP, as they should, they are paying the piper. They are paying the motor vehicle dealer who had signed up a commission arrangement with an insurance company. Why would that be the case? Guess what the best business in the CTP scheme is? It is the brand-new customer. That is why the commissions existed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130855"></A>
This is a compulsory product. It is compulsory in this state to have a CTP policy; it is compulsory to have CTP if people register their vehicle. That fundamentally challenges the notion that trailing commissions should be payable by each and every motorist--not those registering the vehicle--not only in the year they register it, but in each and every year. Those fools on the other side who have stood up and advocated for this policy course of action have said that it should be the people of Queensland who register their vehicle each and every year--not the ones who buy new cars--who should contribute to seeing that the motor vehicle dealers across Queensland continue to get paid that fee. </Hansard-Body>

Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is what you have supported, member for Lockyer. To a person, members opposite stood up and said that what is important are the jobs and that motor vehicle dealers rely on it. They are saying that people across Queensland who register their vehicle each and every year should pay a tax in order to subsidise other people’s employment. The problem with the argument is that it is not true. I do not believe it. As someone who grew up closely associated with motor vehicle dealers and who has a great respect for motor vehicle dealers across the state, not for a minute would I begin to pretend that that total rort should be defended. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130858"></A>
Of course, it falls to those opposite to defend what is unquestionably a rort. I make no bones about the fact that this government decided to take it on to benefit Queensland motorists and consumers. Of course, along the way some cosy arrangements with insurance companies have had to take a haircut, but the end result will benefit Queensland motorists. Let us be clear: this bill introduces a key commitment that is the result of hard policy yards done by this government. Those opposite bristle at it because the concept of doing the policy hard yards, of getting in there, rolling up their sleeves and making sure that they can deliver an outcome that is to the benefit of the public, is anathema to them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130859"></A>
I will remark on other parts of the bill, particularly the reforms to the Queensland Competition Authority Act arrangements. For the benefit of the record, I will be clear. These are reforms to the competition arrangements in Queensland that were due by 31 December this year, regardless of any other reason that some people opposite want to advance. The reality is that in February 2006, under the stewardship of then Prime Minister Howard, COAG agreed to a timetable that required reforms to be undertaken in these terms by 31 December 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130860"></A>
For the benefit of the Independent members who sought to come into the chamber today and say once again that this debate on the decisions that this government has taken is about privatisation or asset sales, I say that the fact of the matter is this: if they somewhat miraculously gathered support from across the chamber and defeated this bill today, it would have no impact whatsoever on our ability as a government to carry out what we have said we would do, which is to undertake some divestments in order to support jobs and build the future of Queensland. One Independent member took the prize when she said that she was interested in the jobs of motor vehicle dealers but wants to vote against the whole bill of this government when it is this government that is advancing the very cause of jobs, which is the reason for the decisions we have taken. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130861"></A>
Once again, I will be really clear: the reforms to the competition arrangements were due by 31 December 2010. For the benefit of the House, I will table the extensive documentation from COAG from 2006, from the tories’ favourite Prime Minister, John Howard, which states that that was the timetable.</Hansard-Body>

It is there for the benefit of all members of the House. I am sure that those Independents who like to say that they come in here and judge things on their merits will walk back in here and withdraw their comments, judge the bill on its merits and support the bill. In reality, their reasons for opposing it are not born out by the facts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130864"></A>
The last point in the debate is this: we are undertaking reforms as a state. The reforms that are contained in this bill are about making sure that we have a competition regime that is the best in Australia. Some members of the House were very keen to advance the cause of Asciano, which has been able to gain 20 per cent of the market. It could not do that unless the competition regime in the state was effective. Ipso facto, it is. Ipso facto, that is why, when it released its results the other week, Asciano said it was interested in increasing more of its market share in Queensland. It is why QR is increasing its market share in the Hunter Valley. Let us be clear: the competition regime in Queensland is effective. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130865"></A>
In summing up, the only part of the bill that I want to draw to the attention of the Independent members in particular is that which outlines the arrangements that seek to ensure that any future regular toll increases across the Queensland Motorways network are, in fact, limited to CPI. I place it on the record for the benefit of those Independent members who have said that they are committed to voting against this bill that it will not in any way facilitate any privatisation. However, they will vote against the commitment of this government to ensuring that future regular toll increases under the franchise agreement will be limited to CPI. Again, I place on the record for the benefit of those members of parliament who want to vote against this bill, based on the notion that somehow it will do something that it will not--I remind them and I intone them--that all they will do is support the idea that toll increases should go above CPI. Having dealt with those facts, I am sure that all members of the parliament will support the bill. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A ID="pgfId-1130875"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (5.47 pm): Clause 12 deals with the provisions of inducement for CTP insurance business. We have heard that this legislation effectively ensures that motorists in Queensland receive approximately a $24 saving and that to not pass this legislation would in fact result in an increase in the insurance component of the annual registration of ordinary Queensland motorists, who we have said on a number of occasions in the debate are already being hit by more and more fees and charges. In that sense, this prohibition on the inducement in proposed new section 96 of the legislation is the effective provision that stops the insurance companies from offering an inducement to third parties in order to get them to sign up for their CTP insurance. So this is, in effect, the part that saves motorists at least $24. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130876"></A>
I wish to thank--and I failed to do so when I first addressed the bill--the officers who provided the briefing on Monday. It was relatively late in the piece. Nonetheless, I thank them for their willingness to answer a number of questions. I also record my position that on this one I am with the Treasurer--I am a Ford man. I am also the son of a Ford dealer. There are more things bizarre in this life than you would consider. I suspect that I have been watching the Blue Oval go around Bathurst a few more years than he has.</Hansard-Body>

 Someone said, ‘A lot.’ I have more hair than you, mate.

Clause 15--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130885"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (5.51 pm): Clause 15 is the provision that amends the Queensland Competition Authority Act. We have had a fair bit of debate about that. I want to make it clear for the record that the amendments to the Queensland Competition Authority Act have nothing to do with the sale of any of the assets that are owned by the Queensland government. It is our understanding and our knowledge--and as has been made clear by the Treasurer--that they are as a result of a review of the principles of the national access regime as agreed by governments through the COAG process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130886"></A>
The review and amendments in relation to the Queensland Competition Authority Act are those that are determined and required as a result of interstate agreements. The amendments and the changes that apply and the application of the Queensland Competition Authority Act would apply to either publicly or privately owned significant monopoly infrastructure--that is, they would apply irrespective of ownership. The amendments are designed to facilitate good economic outcomes for the state of Queensland--that is, to benefit the economy as a whole and lead to greater jobs and greater productivity in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130887"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the shadow Treasurer for the contribution. I do want to make a particular point of emphasising this. As I said in the debate, the reforms of the Queensland Competition Authority legislation are undertaken under a COAG requirement that was signed up under the CIRA agreement in 2006. For the benefit of the House, I have tabled the 2006 documentation signed off by COAG, under Prime Minister Howard, that includes the timetable to undertake these reforms by 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130888"></A>
I make the point that these reforms apply equally to infrastructure in public ownership and in private ownership. It relates to infrastructure such as the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal which has long been in private ownership. It also relates to the Central Queensland coal network as is declared in regulation that exists presently. That is important to emphasise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130889"></A>
I also want to make the point that one argument advanced by those opposite during the course of the debate was that this was being undertaken in accordance with a timetable because of Asciano putting views into the public arena. I want to make the point that I announced that the Queensland government would be seeking certification in accordance with this timetable by public statement on 22 April this year. Asciano did not advance its lodgement for declaration as it said that it would until May 2010. The government’s intention was on the public record in April. When did Asciano actually put in an application? That was in May 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130890"></A>
I have every confidence that the regime that we are strengthening here today is, before today and certainly after today, the best, most open, facilitating competition regime in the country. The facts prove it. The competition in the marketplace proves it. The market share that Pacific National has gained proves it. If we look across the way to Western Australia and see the way that infrastructure has worked under federal regulation then I think we see a stark contrast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130891"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the Treasurer for his response. I raise for comment by the Treasurer that it is the case that in the event that our competition regime is not strengthened and is found to not be an effective regime under the provisions of the national access regime then the prospect could be that control of the monopoly service providers in Queensland--whether that be the ports, whether that be the electricity providers, whether that be the railway providers--could potentially be considered to fall under the control of the ACCC or the National Competition Council. These changes strengthen the case for the Queensland access regime to be found to be an effective regime. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.56 pm): I will make a point of clarification and a comment. This clause inserts part 12 relating to transitional and savings provisions for motor accident insurance and other legislation. I am interested that it flows from that to issues in relation to coal freight rail transport infrastructure. It appears to flow seamlessly. I appreciated the Treasurer’s comments to me during the division. I valued that advice and clarification. I want to say thank you for that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130897"></A>
I reaffirm that the people in my electorate would not want me to support--hence my support for the division on the second reading--the part of the legislation that facilities in any way the privatisation of Queensland Rail, particularly coal freight. There are concerns about the impact on jobs, job security and longevity of employment. It is on that basis that I oppose the legislation. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
I thank the member for her comments. The clause that she has brought to the attention of the House relates to a situation--and the reason that it is in this part of the bill--which persists at the moment. That is that it has long been the case that the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and the rail infrastructure has been declared for a third-party access regime in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130899"></A>
What this part of the bill seeks to do is preserve that arrangement beyond the end point that was put in place--that being the end of this year. It seeks to preserve it in those terms. The changes to the regime overall will allow the National Competition Council to draw the conclusion that the regime is effective--and ‘effective’ is a term of law, not a term of art. In declaring it effective, the undertakings and the regimes that exist under that regime are ones which will continue beyond 31 December this year. The alternative here, as the shadow Treasurer pointed out, is that without a regime that is considered to be best practice by the NCC regulation of that infrastructure would in fact pass to the federal regime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130900"></A>
Certainly, at this point in time Asciano has put forward a proposal to seek to have the coal network in Queensland declared under the national regime. The government’s view and my very strong view is that our regime is in fact the best in Australia, and the fact that Asciano has been able to gain market share is the best evidence of that. Asciano’s views about third-party access and competition are particularly circumscribed to the time and place and the market it is talking about. Far be it from me to raise the views that Asciano has put where it does not particularly like the concept of third operators coming into some of the ports where it is incumbent; nevertheless, I make the point that its views are somewhat connected to its own commercial interests. That is perfectly legitimate. I accept that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130901"></A>
My point here for the people of Queensland and for the Queensland economy is that our regime is in fact the best regime in Australia. It is the one that has delivered competition into the network and the amendments here today preserve the arrangements that have long existed for the coal network that have allowed Asciano on to the tracks and preserve once again the arrangements that exist for Dalrymple Bay. Indeed, they also provide the regime into the future in that if another operator wanted to come along to other infrastructure in Queensland and seek to have a third-party access regime put in place they would go through this channel under Queensland’s regime in order to achieve it.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr NICHOLLS</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (6.01 pm): Clause 71 applies to the QML network and it is the clause that effectively reverses a power of the minister to make a declaration notification of tolls under section 93 of the legislation. This is the clause that effectively says that the last declaration made by the minister on 16 June 2010 that increased the toll levels and then capped them for future years is the final declaration notice that can be given. So to support this part of the legislation and to support this component of the legislation is to support putting a cap on the future increases on tolls on the Gateway and Logan motorways. I seek confirmation from the Treasurer that that is the way that is meant to operate.</Hansard-Body>

 (6.03 pm): This is the clause that deals with the arrangements in relation to what will be known as QR Network and is part of the suite of arrangements that ensures that access is maintained at arm’s length from any control that might be able to be exercised by QR National. It was stated by an honourable member earlier that if these changes were not passed it would stand in the way of the proposed sale. My understanding is that--I think the Treasurer has made this point; I just want to confirm it again--irrespective of this legislation passing it would not stand in the way of the proposed sale, irrespective of what one’s views are--and our views are to oppose that sale--in relation to that sale.</Hansard-Body>

Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Voting against this clause will not stop the course of action that this government and indeed this parliament have embarked upon. This clause seeks to provide for future arrangements where QR is a vertically integrated entity into the future. I make the point for the benefit of the House that today as we speak, and indeed through its history, QR has been a vertically integrated entity. That is, throughout its history it has owned the tracks and the trains. Indeed, like many other railways around the world, it has owned the tracks and the trains. In the past it has been vertically integrated. Today it is vertically integrated and it is proposed under the government’s policy position, adopted in December last year, that it will be vertically integrated into the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130913"></A>
This ensures that the composition of the network board does not have a majority of QR executives on it. It also ensures more particularly under proposed section 438H that the directors of the network company do have to ensure that they cannot approve an access agreement--that is, an arrangement with someone seeking to get on the tracks who is not part of the QR group--unless, as the clause says, that board is reasonably satisfied that the agreement is on arm’s length terms. Therefore, it makes explicit and a legal obligation on those directors serving on the network board that they have to be satisfied that recommending and adopting an access arrangement needs to be done at arm’s length. That applies to not only those people seeking to gain access but also QR National--the business itself--in that the arrangements need to be commensurate, allowing obviously for normal commercial arrangements, between those seeking to access the rail network, and that is what this clause makes absolutely clear.</Hansard-Body>

Mr DEMPSEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bundaberg--LNP) (6.07 pm): Today we are asked to support Labor’s proposed amendments to the Child Protection Act 1999. We are being asked to trust a Labor government with the protection and care of Queensland’s most vulnerable and abused children--a responsibility it has had for the best part of the last 20 years. As I begin my speech on the second reading debate I am reminded of a statement made 12 years ago. The then families minister and now Premier said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130932"></A>
For so long child abuse has been a hidden, painful secret in so many people’s lives. It’s time to have the debate.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130933"></A>
As we debate this bill today, everyone should know that, thanks to the Labor government, child abuse is still a painful secret that not even the minister will discuss because of the secretive way in which this government operates around child matters, more concerned with protecting itself from bad press than with protecting children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130934"></A>
It was the same families minister and now Premier who also said in October 1998 that by enshrining the child placement principles in law there can be no return to the policies of the stolen generation. But we know that this government has been responsible for the removal of more Indigenous children from their families than ever before. We know that this Labor government has presided over more deaths of Indigenous children known to Child Safety Services than were examined in the 20-year review of deaths in custody. Most distressing is that we know that this government has no plan to stop this trend. Yet it stands here today to ask us to trust it with proposed legislative changes once again.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130935"></A>
The people of Queensland cannot trust Labor to protect children and to provide families with the support and interventions that they need to get back on track anymore. The people of Queensland cannot trust this minister and this Labor Premier, because they have failed at every turning point when it comes to child safety. I am sadly certain from their failings to date that things will only get worse and that more children will suffer under this Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130936"></A>
I wanted to be able to support the Helping Out Families initiative that has been put forward by Child Safety Services, but this government has given no detail on how it will work or how the money will be spent. We only have to go to the failed One Chance at Childhood policy to show how wrong this Labor government can get it. More concerning is the lack of commitment to early intervention. An amount of $12.5 million a year over four years for this program is a small amount when we remember that the Child Safety Services’ budget has now reached more than $695 million a year. This is a tokenistic investment at best and one that would set the program up for failure because, like dysfunctional families, child safety agencies need stability and they need support. Furthermore, we have been given no detail on how families will be selected or referred. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130937"></A>
Whilst I fully support early intervention strategies, I cannot support this bill. There are too many other factors that make it impossible to support this bill in its current form. I will be moving several amendments in the consideration in detail stage to provide some balance and clear legislative guidance to some of the amendments being proposed in this bill, but I cannot support this bill, which seeks to give substantial unchecked powers to Child Safety Services at the same time as winding back other requirements on child safety officers. This bill is a hollow product of a review that was conducted more than 2 years ago. It is filled with a mass of amendments that have nothing to do with child safety but contaminate the bill even further. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130938"></A>
Before I begin my assessment of the issues raised in this bill, I want to place on record some facts. According to the Child Protection Clearinghouse report, child maltreatment refers to any non-accidental behaviour by parents, caregivers, other adults or older adolescents that is outside the norms of conduct and entails a substantial risk of causing physical or emotional harm to a child or young person. Such behaviours may be intentional or unintentional and can include acts of omission, that is, neglect and commission--that is, abuse. Child maltreatment is commonly divided into five main subtypes: physical abuse, emotional maltreatment, neglect, sexual abuse and the witnessing of family violence. The clearinghouse report of 2009 states that, although there is a broad consensus regarding the different subtypes of maltreatment, disagreement exists about exactly how to define these subtypes. In the absence of universal definitions of child abuse and neglect, different professional fields have developed their own definitions. There are medical and clinical definitions, social service definitions, legal and judicial definitions, and research definitions of child maltreatment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130939"></A>
It was reported by a clearinghouse report in 2006 that the economic cost of child abuse is significant. According to the Productivity Commissioner’s 2008 report on government agencies, in 2006-07 approximately $1.7 billion was spent across Australia on child protection and supported placement services. Further, over the period from 2002-03 to 2006-07, real recurrent expenditure on child protection and out-of-home care services increased in all jurisdictions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130940"></A>
The research also shows that the personal cost of child abuse is pronounced. Child abuse has been associated with a variety of short and long-term negative outcomes, including mental illness, drug and alcohol abuse, physical ailments and criminalities. In fact, the latest child protection partnership report that was tabled here in parliament recently confirms a strong link between youth offending and child abuse, with 65 per cent of child offenders in the youth justice system known to Child Safety Services. It has been documented that a review of relevant literature by Nick Richardson in 2005 reported that approximately 30 per cent of maltreated children go on to maltreat children in some way when they are adults. It is also clear that a failure to properly manage and respond to child abuse and neglect can have significant and devastating implications not only on the victim but also on broader society. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130941"></A>
At this point it is important that I examine child protection services pre 2004 and the CMC inquiry and then post the CMC review from 2004 to 2009 and weigh those services against the track record of this Labor government since the last election in March 2009. This examination will show promise after promise, mistake after mistake and more children being removed and more children known to the department passing away. In 2004 the Crime and Misconduct Commission report stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130942"></A>
During 2003 information came to light, from a number of sources, indicating that the foster care and child protection systems in Queensland, as administered by the Department of Families, had failed many children. The evidence about such failures pointed, in some cases, to systemic failures over many years to prevent children placed in foster care being further abused or neglected. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130943"></A>
It was also reported during the public hearings of the CMC’s inquiry that a Ms Gwenn Murray, an independent consultant appointed by the department of families in June 2003 to audit abuse notifications made against current Queensland foster carers, stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130944"></A>
The Department of Families, I think, is dangerously becoming like one of the children for whom it has a statutory obligation ... that is, it is like a neglected child. Major reforms need to be planned and implemented to ensure the safety and well-being of children and young people. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130945"></A>
In 1997-98 in Queensland there were 17,233 notifications of suspected child abuse or neglect. Of those, 6,323 cases were substantiated. When the Premier and then families minister took over, between July 1999 and June 2000 more than 18,500 notifications of suspected child abuse were made to the families department. Those notifications included 7,935 notifications of neglect, 5,375 notifications of physical abuse, 3,163 cases of emotional abuse and 1,818 notifications of sexual abuse. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130946"></A>
The CMC in its 2003 report found that in 2002-03 in Queensland there were 31,068 notifications of child abuse and neglect. Of the 3,966 children under child protection orders, 3,642 were granted custody or guardianship to the director-general of the department of families. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130947"></A>
Since 1992-93, as at 30 June each year the overall number of Indigenous children in care has remained relatively stable at just under 100,000 children per year while during the same period the number of non-Indigenous children has increased by 67 per cent. Around 45 per cent of children ceasing care each year have also spent between one and six months in continuous out-of-home care. A smaller proportion--between 10 per cent and 15 per cent--have spent five years or more in care. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130948"></A>
Between 2001 and 2003 there had been a significantly higher proportion of children leaving the system after only one month in continuous out-of-home care. For example, in 2000-01, fewer than 500 children spent less than a month in care, but that number rose to more than 1,300 in 2001-2002, which is an increase of 170 per cent. Between 1992-93 and 2002-03, the number of notifications of children in care increased considerably--from 61 to 605 respectively. In 2002-03, about 75 per cent of the notifications investigated were substantiated and 24 per cent of those substantiated notifications were against carers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130949"></A>
Let us now look at this government’s record since the CMC inquiry and the state of child protection. Under this Labor government, children the subject of ongoing intervention through Child Safety Services went from 8,263 in 2008-09 to 10,647. The number of children in out-of-home care has soared from 5,657 in 2005 to 7,093 in 2009. In 2010-11 Child Safety is expected to receive over 101,000 notifications of suspected abuse. This is an almost 10 per cent increase on the previous year that will have a massive impact on the ability of Child Safety Services to deliver services across Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130950"></A>
When we do hear from the government and this minister about child safety all we hear is how large the Child Safety budget is. It is a record $695,894,000. That is all we will hear. Like the record budget, these changes being put forward today will do nothing to change the entrenched closed-shop culture allowed to exist in Child Safety by the secretive Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130951"></A>
Let me now turn to Indigenous children and child protection under Labor. Let me make it very clear that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children make up more than 35 per cent of children in care. This is the shameful record of a Labor government that 10 years ago in this House said sorry to Indigenous people. It has since presided over a record increase in taking their children. Elders and family members still state that there are many of these children who have been ripped from their families, denied access to their traditional culture and denied family and cultural sensitivities. Whilst rates of abuse across Queensland have allegedly fallen according to figures produced by this Labor government, the number and rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children being abused, being removed and being reabused continues to increase. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130952"></A>
Since 1998 we have heard nothing but talk, spin and hollow promises that have delivered nothing but more children in care, more children known to the department dying and more children placed at risk. All this is despite record amounts of money being thrown at Child Safety Services. This year we have seen yet another so-called record budget for Child Safety Services. Yet only a small percentage of this funding goes towards child and family support services. The majority of funds continue to be spent on the ever-growing Child Safety bureaucracy that is a legacy of a long-term Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130953"></A>
This government has nothing to be proud of in its record of closing the gap when it comes to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child abuse. In fact, in the five years since the CMC inquiry the number of Indigenous children on protection orders has increased by 100 per cent to more than 2,600. Since 2004, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children subjected to a resubstantiation within 12 months almost doubled. The most concerning aspect is that this government has taken record numbers of Indigenous children from families in the belief that they are in need of protection, yet we have seen an almost doubling of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children being abused whilst in the care of this state. In 2007-08 alone, more than 100 Indigenous children were abused whilst in the care of this government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130954"></A>
One thing is clear: Bligh and Labor have failed to protect Indigenous children, failed children in care, and failed children and their families upon exiting care. Now all it can offer is more talk, more plans and more empty promises. We cannot keep pretending that the only way forward is to throw more money and more cute catchphrases at child protection. It is time to start empowering and building capacity within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. It is time we embraced the capacity of the non-government community sector in the delivery of child protection services beyond foster care services. We cannot allow 83 per cent of investigations requiring action within 10 days to go unseen. We cannot allow 77 per cent of investigations requiring action within five days to go unanswered. We certainly cannot allow 24 per cent of critical investigations requiring a 24-hour response to go unanswered. </Hansard-Body>

The National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect said the focus must be on early intervention with a whole-of-family approach. Abuse and neglect is very much linked to parental drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence, mental illness and homelessness. NAPCAN CEO Maree Faulkner said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130956"></A>
It is critically important that governments address child abuse through these areas. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130957"></A>
Focus needs to be on primary prevention that supports families and children before abuse happens. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130958"></A>
Professor Dorothy Scott, speaking in the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 on 11 September 2008, said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130959"></A>
Australia’s most vulnerable children, those whose parents use health and welfare services for drug, alcohol or mental health problems, are being put at further risk of neglect and abuse because the agencies pay scant attention to how they effect children’s lives. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130960"></A>
Professor Scott also warned that many agencies choose to ignore the fact that their client is a parent because the needs of children are not considered part of their mission and do not count when it comes to assessing performance. She has said that many agencies see their responsibility to children as beginning and ending with reporting concerns about possible abuse or neglect to the statutory child protection services. When it comes to improving child safety training and staffing, this cannot be done through legislation. It was the University of Queensland’s School of Social Work and Applied Human Services Associate Professor Karen Healy who said that the turnover of front-line protection staff had grown since the 2003 CMC inquiry and compromised service delivery. One of the main reasons for the high turnover and therefore the relative inexperience of the child safety workforce was the narrow focus and high stress of the role. Healy went on to say--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130961"></A>
Queensland is the only state in Australia, and one of the only places in the world, to have narrowed the child protection worker’s role to investigation and risk assessment. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1130962"></A>
Healy concluded--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130963"></A>
Most people who work in child protection services are attracted to this work to make a positive difference to families’ lives. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130964"></A>
Currently in the department of child safety trainee child safety officers are forced out onto the front line within the first few months with no training. Many younger officers enter this role directly from university. The burnout rate of staff is approximately 30 per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130965"></A>
I want to now make comment on some of the specific issues raised through the amendments being proposed here today. The proposed amendments being put forward that change the nature of the principles of child protection seek to divide these principles into paramount principles and then other general principles. In responding to this change, I want to read into the record comments made by PeakCare in its submission to the 2008 review. It was the view of PeakCare that the ‘best interests of the child framework’ reads as a document of principles and does not explicitly evidence mechanisms towards implementation. PeakCare expressed concern about where this framework is to be positioned within the amended Child Protection Act and whether it properly belongs in policy or would be better developed as a practice document.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130966"></A>
PeakCare have submitted, and I agree, that it is not in the best interests of the child to enter the child protection system at all and note that the ‘best interests of the child framework’ neglects to highlight the need for preventative services, diversionary services and family and community support services which ultimately do provide for the best interests of a child. Everyone would agree that the ‘best interests of the child framework’ is heavily dependent upon the ability of the department of child safety here in Queensland to resource services for children and their families. Concern has been expressed by many in the field about Child Safety Queensland’s ability to resource the services that would be necessary in order to move this framework from principles to reality. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130967"></A>
What this Labor government is offering in these amendments to the principles is nothing new. In fact, it will have the opposite effect and continue to exclude families from this process. No amount of changes to the law will stop the growth in the number of children being removed and taken into care under this Labor government. The only way to change the culture of child protection services in Queensland is indeed to change the government of the day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130968"></A>
This bill also seeks to make changes to the definition of harm. The amendments being proposed are more about catching up with every other state and territory that has already recognised cumulative harm. The National Child Protection Clearinghouse’s Leah Bromfield writes--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130969"></A>
Cumulative harm may be caused by an accumulation of a single adverse circumstance or event, or by multiple different circumstances and events. The unremitting daily impact of these experiences on the child can be profound and exponential, and diminish a child’s sense of safety, stability and wellbeing. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130970"></A>
Ms Bromfield notes that families who experience cumulative harm have multiple interlinked problems, for example risk factors such as domestic violence, alcohol and drug and mental health issues; an absence of protective factors; social isolation or exclusion; and enduring parental problems impacting on their capacity to provide adequate care. When it comes to recovery, Ms Bromfield points out that cumulative harm can overwhelm even the most resilient child and particular attention needs to be given to understanding the complexity of the child’s experience.</Hansard-Body>

Mr DEMPSEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 When it comes to dealing with cumulative harm, research from the Clearinghouse shows--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130973"></A>
We need to remain curious about our effectiveness, and constantly review our assessments and planning, in the light of emerging information and the outcomes of our actions. All families are different and there is not a single solution. Good practice may involve trying several strategies or interventions before coming up with an approach that works. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130974"></A>
No changes here today will address the rigid and inflexible approach that this government takes and no changes here today will change the practices of child safety where one size fits all and anything else will not be tolerated. This Labor government has failed today and its ‘remove first, ask questions later’ policy will fail within the cumulative harm changes. Temporary custody orders outlined in this bill are, as I have said, more about protecting Labor’s ‘remove first, ask questions later’ policy. These orders will allow the department to remove a child for three days without making a decision. Surely if a child is removed the department must believe there is evidence that supports abuse allegations and the child is at risk of further abuse and a temporary protection order or protection order is needed. If this Labor government needs three days to decide on an abuse allegation, we have to question the initial removal of the child. This is akin to charging someone with a crime, putting them before the court and then telling the court to hold them in custody for three days while the police gather evidence to prove the person committed the crime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130975"></A>
The changes proposed to case planning will limit case plan reviews to 12 months for long-term guardianship cases and stop further reviews unless requested by the child or guardian. This is a dangerous and unacceptable move that is further evidence of a department that is stretched to the limit and cannot meet its existing obligations. Case plan reviews form an ongoing, regular contact between a child safety officer, the child, the family and guardians. To limit or to stop this practice will place children at risk of further harm and limit any hope of the child exiting the child protection system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130976"></A>
In response to the 2008 review, the CREATE Foundation wrote on proposed changes to case planning that by changing case plan reviews for those aged five years or older from every six to every 12 months the department of child safety is going against an objective of the participation strategy 2006-2009 which is to ‘expand opportunities for children and young people to have a say about the nature and delivery of services to themselves and their peers’. Conducting case plan reviews every 12 months is not expanding opportunities; rather, it is limiting them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130977"></A>
CREATE is continually concerned about low levels of participation that children and young people are reporting. This is reflected in the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian’s most recent review of young people in foster care report, which highlighted that children and young people do not have confidence that if the department of child safety promises them something it will happen, do not think they are listened to and do not have a say in decisions that affect them. It was further submitted that, of the 1,942 children, young people and carers who responded to the commission’s survey, only approximately 40 per cent reported having a case plan. In that same report, when asked if the respondents knew what was in their case plan only 26.9 per cent responded yes. Again, this figure has increased from 18.2 per cent in 2006, but this still means that 73.1 per cent, or 1,419 children and young people, do not know what is in their case plan. Non-government submissions pointed out Child Safety’s website and state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130978"></A>
Case planning is about mapping a way forward for a child or young person. Case plans are goal directed and clearly identify outcomes, key actions and how the progress of the plan will be measured. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1130979"></A>
If children and young people do not know what is in their case plan then they may not know the way forward. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130980"></A>
PeakCare and others wrote of their strenuous disagreement with the principles outlined in this section. If the overriding principle of the legislation is the wellbeing of children, then time frames which are ‘child-centric’ need to be developed and adhered to. The needs of very young children change constantly, as do the circumstances of their families and their carers. Above all, children in care should not drift without some intentional interventions and planning based on thorough, holistic assessment. Thus the legislation needs to enshrine regular and thorough case planning which is based on the age, the development and the needs of the child. There is strong evidence that these plans should be reviewed and updated regularly and should engage all parties who know the child well. Inclusive case planning is essential to prevent drift in the system, itself a form of institutional abuse, and to ensure that children and young people receive the intervention they need to develop normally. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130981"></A>
Many in the non-government sector have urged that plans are reviewed every three months at a minimum. Review at intervals of six months or more is not adequate and enables lengthy periods without children being seen by responsible officers. This is not accountable practice. Linking the timing of review to children’s ages encourages a lack of attention to individual circumstances and the notion that older children are not as vulnerable, which is not the case. As parents and adults, we all know that children have different maturity levels and environmental factors affecting them. That is why I will not be supporting the government’s plans for case planning and will be moving amendments at the committee stage to ensure that case plans are reviewed every three months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130982"></A>
I turn now to transition orders and transitioning from care. The government would want us to support changes to transition-from-care plans by limiting the need to conduct plans to only when a court orders such a plan. Under existing law this should be happening already, yet we know for a fact that transition plans are rarely completed and this lack of preparation often contributes to resubstantiations. These changes are further evidence that the existing Child Safety Services cannot cope with expected workloads. Despite record budgets, it should have allowed for the meeting of service obligations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130983"></A>
In relation to licensee obligations, we have only to look at Labor’s track record and licensing of providers to see a litany of abuse of children in the care of unlicensed providers. Previous evidence produced through questions on notice has shown that children in the care of this Labor government are still being placed in unlicensed out-of-home care centres despite reports of an array of problems. It has been revealed that 72 incidents were recorded in out-of-home care services last financial year, with 51 providers unlicensed at the time of the complaint. These are children who have been removed from their parents or family because of abuse or neglect before being subjected to further problems in the unlicensed homes in which the Bligh Labor government has placed them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130984"></A>
It is disturbing that the number of matters of concern that are recorded continue to rise, despite a tripling in the Child Safety budget. I am even more distressed at the fact that so many service providers without a licence still have children in their care. It is not good enough that 51 service providers failed to meet the 11 standards of care that are set out for service providers. We have heard nothing about what this government is doing to stop the placement of vulnerable children who are at risk of further harm. Surely ensuring that all out-of-home-care service providers meet the grade is non-negotiable. Children in care should be safe from further harm. Whilst masked as some reform to child safety, the bill is really designed to hide past errors in bills that were brought into this House by another minister who is not willing to stand up and correct these changes. This minister is in an unacceptable position as he is amending legislation for the overseeing body responsible for the checks and balances of his own department. It is beyond belief that this minister can talk of amendments when they have nothing to do with his portfolio but make up almost half of the entire bill brought before the House. I will touch briefly on those provisions that are not the responsibility of this minister but are included in the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130985"></A>
In the past 12 months, the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian decreased its staff by 30. At the estimates committee hearing this was attributed to the fact that some temporary and contract staff who had been involved in the drafting of the criminal history bill were no longer employed. However, in the same period the budget for employee expenses increased by $3 million, despite the staff cuts. Following the passage of the criminal history legislation, the revenue from blue cards has been forecast to increase dramatically from $4.678 million to $7.78 million in 12 months. In February this year the government introduced the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill, four months after the member for Hinchinbrook introduced the LNP’s Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill. The government’s bill was aimed at streamlining criminal history screening processes but increased the costs and failed to sufficiently cover particular sectors, such as carers for people with disabilities. The government’s haste to introduce the act left some areas unclear. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130986"></A>
The following are the amendments made in relation to the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian Act. A blue or yellow card-holding volunteer will have to pay a fee when they move from volunteering to paid employment. That is another reporting condition. An amendment will reinstate the screening powers to the CCYPCG to assess the suitability of people to be engaged at the commission itself. One would have thought that this would have been part of the risk management procedures already in place. Members should take into account that a number of commercial interests have never had to have blue cards in the past. When the Premier of the day was asked about this, he stated that the government would have its own risk procedures in place affecting workers at shopping centres, taxidrivers et cetera. However, the commission had not thought to have those people suitably screened. It beggars belief. An amendment will ensure that the commission provides updated advice to the Queensland College of Teachers when a blue card status changes, or police information in relation to people who had blue cards recognised in teacher registration processes. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1130987"></A>
In conclusion, I put on the record my sincere admiration and support for every child safety officer in Queensland who, every day, is expected to do more and more with little or no leadership from this government. This bill is more about protecting Labor’s shocking record on child safety than actually protecting children or helping families. At no time has this government shown any evidence based strategies to support this new initiative. This government has not set tasks or provided any person or organisation with an evaluation process to help create stability in the child care and child safety sectors. By not providing that process, we will return to the time when some great programs fell by the wayside because of this government’s lack of commitment and failure to properly identify the difference between on-ground legislative changes and bureaucratic legislation. The LNP has no faith in the government and no faith in this minister. We cannot support this government or any legislation produced by it regarding child protection, because it says one thing but we know all too well that, in practice, it does not deliver, even though children continue to suffer and the number of children taken from families and placed in dangerous and detrimental situations continues to grow. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs STUCKEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Currumbin--LNP) (7.44 pm): I rise to contribute to the debate on the Child Protection and Other Acts Amendment Bill, which was introduced to the House on 10 June by the Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport, the honourable member for Mansfield. This bill purports to enhance the administration of Queensland’s Child Protection Act 1999, in order to respond more effectively to the individual needs of children at risk and in care, and to supply the legislative foundation for the Helping Out Families initiative. The stated aim of this bill is to enhance the capacity of non-government services to intervene in early intervention strategies by making amendments to statutory services--child abuse investigation and response, and out-of-home care--and non-statutory secondary services--intervention with families with identified problems to prevent child abuse and neglect. Therefore, the amendments contained within this legislation will result in some changes to both statutory and non-statutory secondary services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130989"></A>
The bill also amends the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian Act 2000 in relation to blue cards. The bill makes amendments to a number of other acts: the Disability Services Act 2006, the Family Services Act 1987, the Public Service Act 2008 and consequential amendments to the Juvenile Justice and Other Acts Amendment Act 2009. According to the explanatory notes, proposed changes to the Child Protection Act 1999 will implement the Helping Out Families initiative, improve the operation of court orders, provide a new temporary custody order, recognise the role of suitable person long-term guardians, and extend and clarify the definition of harm. As honourable members have heard from the shadow minister, the honourable member for Bundaberg, the LNP does not support this bill </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

The Minister for Child Safety has proclaimed that since 2004 his government has doubled the workforce and tripled the budget. He seems proud of the fact that his government, the Beattie government, neglected children under its care so disgracefully that it took a CMC inquiry to shame them into action. He wants a pat on the back for finally doing what governments are supposed to--that is, invest in child protection and support families. Despite three reviews of the Child Protection Act under three ministers in the six years since the 2004 CMC Butler inquiry, <Hansard-Italic>
Protecting children: An inquiry into abuse of children in foster care</Hansard-Italic>
, I am sorry to say this legislation is the first real attempt to make any significant changes to the act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130991"></A>
On 14 May 2008, the then minister, Margaret Keech, released a policy paper highlighting a series of proposed amendments to the Child Protection Act 1999. At that time she stated the amendments would ‘improve services, reduce red tape and boost protection for Queensland children’. Members should note the order of the above amendments: improving services and reducing red tape are ahead of boosting children’s protection. It seems that this is the approach adopted by the Labor government in its policy to address child protection. It puts the process first and the children and their families a poor second or third, as is the case here. As honourable members have heard from the shadow minister, in May PeakCare contributed to the 2008 policy paper, which was the same month that the minister launched it, and made this opening statement--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130992"></A>
Overall, PeakCare contends that this policy paper intends to give more power to the Department of Child Safety without the benefit of any increased external scrutiny on its activities or services offered to children and their families in Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1130993"></A>
PeakCare continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130994"></A>
The paramount intention of this policy document appears to be an attempt to make life easier for departmental staff and subject their actions to even more restrictive scrutiny. This appears to be an abuse of power which has not been tolerated in other jurisdictions and should not be tolerated here. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130995"></A>
So be the comments from PeakCare, a very respected organisation. I note the phrase ‘best interest of the child’, which was described by some professionals as being used narrowly in a bureaucratic sense and used extensively to push the government’s One Chance at Childhood and adoption agendas. This has been replaced. This new legislation includes a ‘framework of principles to improve decision making to promote children’s safety, wellbeing and best interests’. All too frequently in recent years the phrase ‘best interest of the child’ was tossed about nonchalantly and activated by a bureaucratic decision made by well-intended but inexperienced departmental workers. I am not convinced, and neither are my LNP colleagues, that this latest change in language will in fact advance an at-risk child’s situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130996"></A>
The minister says that this bill will enable the government’s tertiary child protection system to work hand in hand with the non-government sector in order to better support families before they require statutory intervention. This is another admission of this government’s failing, and not before time. There is much work to be done here as, for way too long, the NGOs and their calls for early intervention programs and support services have gone unanswered. The department of child safety was viewed by many as an investigative bureau, a conveyor belt that processed children suspected of being abused or neglected, ignoring the importance of involving their families wherever possible. Their highly researched recommendations were mostly disregarded and even howled down by members opposite in previous speeches. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130997"></A>
In his second reading speech, the minister listed the key bodies that were consulted in the drafting of this bill. There were a number of these and they include PeakCare Queensland, Foster Care Queensland, CREATE Foundation, QCOSS and the Queensland Aboriginal and Islander Health Council. I wonder how many of the recommendations made by these key organisations were adopted by the government in these proposed amendments. Perhaps the minister would enlighten the House in his reply. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1130998"></A>
Again, in August 2008 PeakCare Queensland provided feedback on the discussion draft. They said--and I believe the shadow minister may have already quoted this--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1130999"></A>
It is not ‘in the best interests’ of children to enter the Child Protection system at all and note that the best interests of the child framework neglects to highlight the need for preventative services, diversionary services and family and community support services which ultimately do provide for the best interests of a child. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1131000"></A>
They continue--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131001"></A>
It is the view of our membership that whilst families may bear the primary responsibility for the upbringing, protection and development of their children, they cannot do so in isolation, without the support of the larger community. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131002"></A>
As honourable members have heard from the shadow minister, the honourable member for Bundaberg, it is way more likely that this legislation has been introduced by the government in an attempt to conceal its dismal failings in the area of child safety. Unsurprisingly, it falls short of expectations and does not wholly embrace the principles and philosophies recommended by experienced professionals in this specialised industry. The shadow minister has indicated that he will be moving several amendments that will provide a series of checks and balances to matters brought before the court regarding temporary custody orders and to ensure that transition from care plans are prepared for all children who are exiting care. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131003"></A>
I would like to mention the Helping Out Families initiative enshrined within this legislation that is targeted primarily at the nought to four year age group. Whilst this is genuinely welcomed--and I repeat that for the minister: it is genuinely welcomed--as an early intervention protection strategy and one that the LNP has been pushing towards for a number of years, the model before us falls well short when one considers the scale of need in our communities. The overall amount of money being allocated to deliver this program is minuscule in comparison to the money spent on tertiary services. Child and family support services represent only about 10 per cent of the budget--$55 million has been allocated over four years to pilot this new early intervention and prevention initiative in Logan, on the Gold Coast and in Beenleigh-Eagleby. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131004"></A>
Queensland is facing a record number of children in care, increasing from 4,950 in 2004 to 7,942 in 2010. Reducing the number of children in care through early intervention and education has been a key policy direction of the LNP and certainly was during my time as shadow minister. Undeniably there is more reporting of suspected and real child abuse, but it is this government’s failed policies and attitude that have stymied the reduction of child abuse in our society. The government’s mantra of ‘child safety is everyone’s business’, stated twice in the minister’s second reading speech, is somehow not cutting through. I do not doubt for a moment that every member in this House abhors child abuse and finds it repugnant in the extreme. I also concur that honourable members would agree that governments have an obligation to protect our most vulnerable--our young. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131005"></A>
A study by the Australian Childhood Foundation published in April 2006 titled <Hansard-Italic>
Out of sight--out of mind</Hansard-Italic>
 found that of the respondents to their survey a percentage viewed child abuse as less concerning than the cost of petrol and problems with public transport and roads. Alarmingly, 31 per cent said they would not believe children’s stories of being abused and 16 per cent did not know whether sex between a 14-year-old and an adult constituted sexual abuse. Attitudes like these must change if we are to make a long-lasting dent in these shocking figures of abuse. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131006"></A>
Child abuse creates enormous personal and physical cost upon those affected, but it also places a huge financial cost on governments as they have to pay for the negative outcomes, as mentioned by the shadow minister, of mental illness, drug and alcohol abuse, depression, medical problems and in some cases criminality. The child protection partnership report confirms a strong link between youth offending and child abuse, with a startling 65 per cent of child offenders in the youth justice system known to Child Safety Services. What further proof do we need? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131007"></A>
A 2009 report <Hansard-Italic>
Mothers and the child protection system</Hansard-Italic>
 was conducted by H Douglas, T Walsh and K Blore and made possible by a grant from the University of Queensland. In their conclusion the authors stated the need for child safety workers to work collaboratively with parents and children, adding that there needs to be much more asking than telling. Amongst the 15 recommendations, which were focused on improving education and communication between immediate stakeholders, recommendation No. 9 was about defining the concept of ‘neglect’ more definitely in legislation and procedures. ‘Neglect’, the report said, should be clearly distinguished from situations where parents are struggling financially and/or are homeless but are otherwise able to care for the child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131008"></A>
The authors reported a disconnect between some services that support mothers and child protection workers. In their executive summary they say--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131009"></A>
Children should and must be protected. However it must be acknowledged that removals of children may no longer be perceived to be necessary if families are appropriately resourced and their issues properly understood. Child protection workers and parents’ advocates both have a crucial role in displacing the mistrust and uncertainty preventing more collaborative and open practices, otherwise it is the child’s interests that ultimately suffer. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131010"></A>
What has been so wrong about the Labor government’s method of achieving its goal of ‘child safety is everyone’s business’ was the omission of parents and families in the equation. Parts of this new legislation are a step in the right direction, such as the Helping Out Families initiative, but others are frightening to say the least. Correspondence I received from the Department of Communities in July stated the Helping Out Families initiative of $55 million spread over four years will provide support services to vulnerable families who have been referred to Child Safety Services but do not require ongoing tertiary intervention. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131011"></A>
The key elements of the initiative are the South-East Regional Intake Service, which commenced on 2 August. It is expected to streamline and simplify the process of reporting concerns to the Department of Communities and to improve the consistency and quality of child protection intake making decisions. Trial sites are to be funded for three Family Support Alliance services. Services in the Beenleigh, Eagleby, Nerang and Logan areas start as of October this year and on the Gold Coast in early 2011. These will be networks of local services to support children, young people and their families. I note these sites are to be trialled. I would ask the minister to outline the criteria for these trials--for example, will services be continued for the four-year period? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131012"></A>
Services to support at-risk families will supposedly include intensive family support, home visiting for new mothers, domestic and family violence, mental health, drug and alcohol, disability and homelessness services. An absence of detailed information leaves people wondering exactly how this will be achieved. It is such a critical part of the whole exercise in reducing the incidence of child abuse that the government must get it right. It cannot afford to fail. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131013"></A>
The minister said in a media release on 2 July that this project would fund practical in-home support, such as assistance with parenting, home management, budgeting and meal preparation as well as visits from health workers. Mothers and their newborn babies will receive up to six visits from nurses from the centre. This all sounds very promising, but what framework is being set up to ensure maximum benefits reach the greatest number of families in need? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131014"></A>
The Queensland Council of Social Service, QCOSS, has welcomed the expenditure but has criticised the government for falling well short of the funding and for the lack of detail included in the budget. QCOSS believes that a community based approach to early intervention and protection that involves consultation with non-government service providers is essential to best reach the people who need them. According to QCOSS, the government has failed to provide detail in the budget of if or when such consultation will occur. Again I ask: where is the detail? How many visits will be made to new mums and so on? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131015"></A>
Amendments to the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian Act 2000 relate to blue cards and yellow cards. What reasonable argument can this government offer as to why there is still no willingness to place a photo ID on these cards? A person cannot even hire a video without photo ID yet they can be entrusted to care for our precious children without it. We heard tonight from the shadow minister that revenue of some $6 million will be forthcoming from the blue card system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131016"></A>
The former police minister, who I note is in the House tonight, gave a very weak excuse that the cost to do this was prohibitive. Let us see exactly what it would cost. Technology today allows for the printing of student photo ID cards at a cost of well under a dollar. Is this too much to pay to increase kids’ protection? Are they not worth that much? Will the minister tell us just how much placing a photo on an ID card would cost? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131017"></A>
This bill addresses the recognition of the importance of long-term guardians. The minister says that long-term guardians are often related family members, but in truth often they are not. Taking into account this government’s poor track record, I have grave concerns that children in foster care will be unfairly targeted for long-term guardianship and adoption when some could be reunited with family if there was more political will to do so through genuine attempts to support at-risk families. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131018"></A>
I do recognise the importance of stability for children when it comes to arrangements. There is no question that this is critical, particularly in reducing the effects of cumulative harm. But most kids still average around four placements during an individual period of care. This legislation would see children in long-term care having their case plans reviewed at 12-month intervals instead of six. Is this because of staffing limitations or because it is best for the child? Or is there such a backlog that this is Labor’s way of reducing the waiting list? What specific steps are being taken to find out whether children are aware that these plans exist? Considering the rapid development needs of young children, 12 months is a very long period between opportunities to actively participate in decisions that affect their future and wellbeing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131019"></A>
The three business days temporary custody order exhibits a ‘remove child first, ask questions later’ policy which is very worrying. I recall a disturbing incident a couple of years ago where a child was flown to the other side of Australia with dad who had served time in prison for armed assault. Unbeknown to the Indigenous mother, the father was contacted by child safety staff, flew from Western Australia and collected the child without the consent of the mother. Is it acceptable to breach guidelines? Was this a really good outcome? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131020"></A>
What effect has there been as a result of the Premier collapsing the department of child safety into one big portfolio of Communities? With the superdepartment, the Department of Communities, absorbing into one entity Child Safety, Housing, Women and, importantly, the Child Guardian, some NGOs have commented that we have lost the independent umpire. Has the Bligh government downgraded the importance of this entity? The LNP finds it unacceptable that the Minister for Child Safety, who is also the Minister for Sport, is amending legislation that deals with the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131021"></A>
And what of the health passports? It is deplorable that almost half of the children under the care of this department have not seen a health professional for a baseline assessment. Labor can come up with as many cute and catchy phrases as it likes, but it cannot escape its failure to curb child abuse. I am pleased to see that the shadow minister is presently conducting his own review of child protection practices on behalf of the LNP. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131022"></A>
In summary, this legislation to reform the processes of the department of child safety is far too little too late. This legislation does finally acknowledge that the government needs to work hand in hand with non-government service providers. This is a positive step in the right direction. However, as I have stated, the LNP does have considerable concerns, as do key NGOs and professionals, that some of the amendments contained within this bill have the potential to create less transparency and accountability, which is why we cannot support it. I have asked a number of questions in my speech. I hope the minister will address them to the best of his ability in his reply. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Nicklin--Ind) (8.04 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on the Child Protection and Other Acts Amendment Bill 2010. I will be supporting the bill. The level of abuse of children in our community distresses me and concerns me greatly when we are supposed to be a well-off and affluent country. Irrespective of the reasons, what is happening in our community is very concerning. We see it regularly. </Hansard-Body>

Ms van LITSENBURG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Redcliffe--ALP) (8.05 pm): I rise to support the Child Protection and Other Acts Amendment Bill 2010. Despite the posturing of the members opposite, it was this Labor government that made changes. It was this Labor government that actually took the first steps to look after children and to protect children. It was this Labor government that spent the money and continues to spend the money to do everything that is needed to protect children and to look after families in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131027"></A>
I am happy that the amendments in this bill will ensure better outcomes for our vulnerable children and their families. This is a big issue in my electorate. For these families to be able to take up the opportunities that this Labor government is providing for all Queenslanders, it is vital that these issues are resolved for them and that families are effectively given the support they need to keep them together. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131028"></A>
I commend our child protection workers and foster carers who do such a great job in keeping children safe. I am also thankful for the funding the Bligh government provides for supporting our vulnerable families through the Redcliffe Community Association, Chameleon Youth Housing, the Youth Space, Mereki and the Uniting Church care services. These organisations have been supporting children, young people and families effectively for many years. Each one of them is a vital link in supporting our families and our children so they can remain as a family unit. Child protection is everyone’s responsibility. The Bligh government is proud to work hand in hand with our foster and kinship carers and our non-government partners to ensure vulnerable children have safe, family-friendly outcomes. </Hansard-Body>

This bill has two main functions which both seek to enhance the administration of the current Child Protection Act 1999 to better respond to the needs of Queensland’s vulnerable children and young people. One of the important functions is to provide a legislative base for the Bligh government’s Helping Out Families initiative. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131030"></A>
I will discuss the important steps that the Bligh government has taken, in line with the federal government, to better protect our children. The Queensland government is currently implementing the National Framework for Protecting Australia’s Children, investing over $2 billion over three years on a range of initiatives to implement the framework. The national framework focuses on the need for an integrated approach to protecting children through prevention and early intervention statutory services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131031"></A>
Under the Helping Out Families initiative, Child Safety will refer a family to a support service that will engage with the family and coordinate all necessary services and supports the family needs to maintain their children safely within the family. The services in my electorate work very well together and I work hand in glove with them when families present in my office. Queensland is working closely with federal, state and territory governments and non-government organisations to achieve a substantial and sustained reduction in child abuse and neglect over time. The framework is being delivered through a series of three-year action plans. The first three-year plan for 2009 to 2012 is aimed at achieving better outcomes for children and families.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131032"></A>
The Bligh government’s $55 million Helping Out Families initiative is aimed at helping families and preventing children and young people having to go into care to keep them safe. The Helping Out Families initiative closely aligns with a number of the framework’s strategic outcomes. The Bligh government has granted ACT for Kids $100,000 to auspice Child Protection Week in Queensland which runs from 5 to 11 September. Child Protection Week provides an opportunity to celebrate the people, partnerships and networks our communities rely on to nurture safe and confident children who are valued by society. ACT for Kids is an organisation with a strong reputation in the north Brisbane area for supporting children to come to terms with abuse and neglect so that they can move on. It is groups like this that work alongside Child Safety within the frameworks to protect our children. In addition to this, the 11 Indigenous family support services to be established across Queensland also support many of the strategic outcomes of the framework.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1131033"></A>
The Child Protection Act 1999 and the bill are also consistent with articles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Many articles of the convention directly relate to children in statutory child protection. For example, article 21 reads that a child temporarily or permanently deprived of his or her family environment or in whose best interest cannot be allowed to remain in that environment shall be entitled to special protection and assistance provided by the state. Article 3 of the convention states that the child’s best interests shall be the primary consideration in all matters. This aligns with the amendments to the paramount principle in the act. The paramount principle for the administration of the act has been strengthened for the safety, wellbeing and best interests of the child.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131034"></A>
The bill will also insert into the act other principles for ensuring the safety, wellbeing and best interests of a child when a decision is made or a power exercised under the act. Principles included demonstrate the preferred way of ensuring a child’s safety and wellbeing is through supporting the child’s family and that if a child does not have a parent who is able and willing to protect them the state is responsible for protecting that child but should only take action that is warranted in the circumstances. This bill has a number of provisions that align with the national framework for protecting Australia’s children and with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131035"></A>
It is good to see that Queensland has taken its place in the world standing up for children. They are our future, so it is vital that we give them the very best start they can get because we need not only well-adjusted but well-educated young people ready to build a better future, and I believe that this bill is a good cornerstone in helping that happen. I commend the minister for acting to ensure there are better safeguards for our children, a helping hand for families who need support and that our legislation aligns with federal legislation and the United Nations convention for the rights of children. I commend this bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs SCOTT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Woodridge--ALP) (8.14 pm): During this debate I have been sitting working in my office listening to the shadow minister and the member for Currumbin speaking very negatively about the department of child safety and the way that we are working cooperatively with a number of our departments. Having been in the Woodridge electorate for a long time, I have seen huge advances and I have seen many families recently who have arrived in my office with very complex issues. The fact that we are able to say that there is no wrong door and we actually wrap services around people is working brilliantly, and I have to commend both our Minister for Child Safety and the Minister for Community Services and Housing and Minister for Women for what is a remarkable change in a department.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131037"></A>
For many years I have dealt with families in the Woodridge electorate--some who have had their children taken into care, some who may be dysfunctional but many who simply have been battling along with disadvantage, having been dealt a tough hand in life. They may not have experienced effective parenting when they were children, possibly left school early with few skills to secure regular work and generally have very complex issues. I also remember a number of years ago discussing with some of my school principals the fact that many littlies start in prep without any skills: they have not been read to, they have no concentration skills, they could not follow instructions, they have had no boundaries to guide them, and often the babysitter is the TV and their diet is lacking in nutritious food.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131038"></A>
With a group of early childhood specialists, including two of our principals, we devised a volunteer mentoring program for young mums because we considered that no government could ever deal with such a large number of families suffering the results of disadvantage and dysfunction. However, with the announcement of the Helping Out Families initiative, our government has made a massive commitment to make a real difference in the lives of so many families in the Logan, Beenleigh and Eagleby areas and parts of the Gold Coast. This bill will assist the department to follow up more effectively when children are at risk and also establish a framework under which the Helping Out Families program will be delivered.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131039"></A>
During the nine years I have served as the member for Woodridge I have seen very significant progress in assisting families and in particular to give children a greater chance at life. Child Safety now has twice the workforce in my local area. There is more stability, child care officers are more mature and I now see fewer families with concerns. The budget has also tripled. Workers are also more aware of our cultural diversity and how to work with these families, many of whom have lived in the most horrific of circumstances in refugee camps in war-torn countries. They have so many obstacles to overcome coming to a country with an entirely different culture and very different methods of parenting.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131040"></A>
The Helping Out Families program has received a commitment of $55 million over four years and is a pilot program which will be rolled out across the state if it achieves the desired outcome of keeping families intact and ensuring parents have the skills and support required to raise their children in the best possible way. The program will commence in my local area on 1 October and will be delivered by a lead agency, Lifeline Community Care, which already has a well-established presence in the area. Other agencies involved will be Youth and Family Service, which will deliver behavioural change services to men involved in domestic violence, and Working Against Violence Support Service, or WAVSS, will continue its counselling and support services to victims of domestic violence, along with parenting advice. Other peak services involved will be the Benevolent Society for the Beenleigh-Eagleby area and the Abused Child Trust or ACT for Kids on the Gold Coast.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131041"></A>
Our Indigenous services will also involve intensive support, with Ganyjuu continuing its recognised entity services as well as expanding to offer support for so many of our Indigenous families. The holistic and intensive support is available to families and mums right from the start of the birth of new babies, with regular visits provided for mothers who require that extra support. Appropriate services will be sourced from local providers to meet the needs of individual families. I have been around long enough to remember when the department of families had Home Makers, who worked with mothers in the home to assist with such activities as parenting, cooking nutritious meals, cleaning, budgeting and all of those practical skills that mothers need in bucketloads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131042"></A>
The legislation will accommodate the requirement of confidentiality in the referral process when a family is referred to the Family Support Alliance organisation without the requirement of the consent of the family. However, when there is referral to other services, the consent of the family will be required and this engagement will be an important aspect of the program. I believe the early intervention of a high level of support to mothers from the time of the birth of a new infant through those early years will result in a huge drop in child safety referrals in years to come. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131043"></A>
I and many workers, including those in our organisations working with families--be they government or non-government, our teachers, hospital workers, our refugee and multicultural groups and, in fact, our whole community--will be the beneficiaries of this program. I thank Minister Phil Reeves and his staff, our previous minister Margaret Keech, our minister for communities, and all of those who worked tirelessly to bring this bill before the House. I have much pleasure in commending the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP) (8.21 pm): Not a day goes by when we are not hearing about men primarily accessing child pornography. Project Argos is almost a household name. I fear that we as a society are almost becoming immune to the revulsion and anger that stems from such revelations. It gets worse. We have reported acts of extreme violence towards children, often by people known to them, often ending in death or severe disabling, permanent injury. These are just the physical acts; the emotional abuse is a massive multiplier of that. We have the extraordinary situation of a major Australian photographer currently defending his actions as art as opposed to abuse. There are plenty of other recent examples that are sub judice at present because of court cases. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131045"></A>
What has gone wrong? What does the future hold for our children, for our children are our future? Rather than immediately joining in and protesting that this is a disproportionate claim, I need to state that the growth in reported child abuse in Australia is currently 6.9 per cent from 2007-08 and has continued through 2008-09 and I presume will continue on. I table that document.</Hansard-Body>

We as a society have failed our children if how we treat our children is used as part of that quantum measure of quality of life. Rather than going through the usual list of scapegoats, I intend in this speech to focus not so much on who is to blame but moreover use the bill and its weaknesses to explain what not to do and what should be done on the basis of evidence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131048"></A>
The outcome of child abuse is another generation of child abusers and victims. For those children who witness domestic violence in the home, 50 per cent of the girls will become victims and 60 per cent of the boys will become abusers. Sons who witness abuse are 10 times as likely to abuse their partners. Eighty per cent of those in prison grew up in violent homes, 26 per cent of those in prison are Indigenous, 90 per cent of Indigenous offenders progress to adult crime and 4.6 times as many Indigenous people are victims of violent crimes than non-Indigenous people. We have 7,000 children in foster care to protect, overwhelmingly due to domestic violence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131049"></A>
It gets worse. In this day and age--2010--Aboriginal women living in rural and remote areas are 45 times as likely to be victims of domestic violence than the non-Aboriginal population. Honourable members, we have a state emergency situation here, yet this bill is focusing on amendments to improve decision making within Child Safety and to promote a Labor approach to early intervention as a kind of fop response to doing something about such a serious problem when we really cannot see Labor making the really hard decisions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131050"></A>
So what is going on out there in urban, semirural and rural communities? It is intergenerational violence, with the cycle of violence increasing. This generational cycle of violence is made worse when a child is living in a violent situation. So as a first step we need to remove the child from the violent environment. Anything less is a threat to a child’s security and survival. The solution must be absolute, not proportionate. It may be permanent and it must be focused on the child, not the government’s and/or the parents’ views. I say this because the opening paragraph of the minister’s second reading speech contained a statement in response to child and adolescent vulnerability and the government’s response that it had ‘doubled the workforce and tripled the Child Safety budget’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131051"></A>
Critically, these are not all output expenditures. Other than a few good statements, there is nothing said in the minister’s second reading speech about inputs. To be fair, there are issues raised about input expenditure, but they seem disproportionately directed at removing children from violent and abusive environments. That is to be supported, but the current approach is only in part sound. A closer inspection seems to suggest something else. Specifically, the bill reduces the requirements of the department to prepare transition-from-care plans until 28 days before the child is due to be returned as directed by a court. All children need transition plans. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131052"></A>
The introduction of a temporary custody order will remove the obligation on the department to notify the parents of the action. This seems opposed to a family focused approach, which this bill purportedly wishes to embrace. In fact, the second key function of this bill was, according to the minister in his second reading speech, the provision of ‘the legislative foundation for this government’s Helping Out Families initiative’. We are either involving families or we are not. As I have demonstrated earlier, one cannot be halfway along the road. It is really all or nothing. Just as children need boundaries, children and parents need certainty when being dealt with. These issues were raised by the member for Woodridge and she talked about what used to happen, which are situations that I know quite well from the past.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131053"></A>
 The minister in his second reading speech went on to highlight the Family Support Allowance and pilot site networks at Logan, Beenleigh, Eagleby and Woodridge and the Gold Coast by 30 January 2011. The minister is allocating $8.5 million for state-wide Indigenous family support organisations. Pilot programs and family support seem to me to be superfluous with regard to families. They are not being considered high on the priority list, for the department feels that they may not, by the looks of things, have a significant role in the resolution of this abuse problem. I say: pilot to what? Does the minister understand that in three years that money could run out and the family support could be gone forever? This has happened in many other projects before. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131054"></A>
If one goes a little further, one sees that the amendments to the assessment care arrangement will remove the rights of one parent to have a say in the child’s removal and care. Often it will be the father who may be willing to provide care for the child but who does not currently live with the child. Yet is it not a fundamental part of the bill that parents are to be included? Would that then not mean that the amendments in this case are incorrect on basic principle, particularly in view of the minister’s known approach as detailed in his second reading speech? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131055"></A>
This is always the problem with anything Labor in government does in the implementation stage. Words do not match the action. Before honourable members start complaining, I point out that this is an area where I have considerable knowledge after 22 years in general practice, 20 years in corrective services running all sorts of programs as a visiting medical officer and many years involved in adoption. Parents are not always one holistic group. Abuse is not always plural within a family. Many families now are single-parent families and there are plenty of variations in between. Additionally, I have highlighted in a much earlier debate on a juvenile justice bill that some children are problematic, but they are very much a product of both family and society at large. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131056"></A>
As adults we are youth obsessed, but increasingly we see children both as a prize or as a burden. All three of these issues are what leads to the bulk of offending behaviour in children subsequently. Parents often have dreadful personal examples in their own lives that are compounded when they have children who are dependent upon them. If the department continues to do nothing at the input end in a substantive way then it will never manage the problem or contain the costs that flow from it. Before those who are poorly informed rush to tell me that nothing can be done, may I say that they are wrong and that there is plenty of evidence to support it. My concern is that Labor has become immersed in the politics of the New Age at the expense of children. I am firmly convinced these New-Age virtues are contrary to core Labor values. I remain confused by the politics that pay lip-service to the issue of families rather than moralise and provoke the kind of sensitivities raised in the surrogacy debate when too many outspoken Labor members chose not to speak on the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131057"></A>
Children need parents--plural. They need stability. They need roots, including a home, maybe a pet, their own bed, a stable school, friends and, above all, they need love. Just as adults find out to their own peril, a life without love is no life at all. Parents need support and it must be in equal measure to any expenditure and effort at the output end. For a child to end up as a foster-child caught in a kind of legal limbo as a chattel of the department of child safety is, for some, too transient, too disconnected, too isolated, too bereft of love to make life worthwhile. It is a miserable outcome and it is all too common. With a doubling of those in foster care in 12 years under Labor, it is a damning indictment on poor policy by the Beattie and now Bligh Labor governments. After 12 years of mismanagement, Labor has not done enough to change these circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131058"></A>
I fully endorse the comments made by both the shadow minister and the member for Currumbin in a previous speech. Labor’s proposal in this bill leaves many children in care unchecked by child safety officers for 12 months. We must note that in contrast to the government’s talk about numbers, these are children we are talking about. They are individuals and they must be considered as such. It is not appropriate to group them as one homogeneous group. They are not. To successfully manage children to achieve a safe result in their own lives we must treat them as a person with a name and a home. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131059"></A>
The minister in his second reading speech placed a heavy emphasis on the output end of the equation. In all fairness, he detailed an elegant series of principles based around safety, wellbeing and doing everything in the interests of the child. These are to be commended. There is a new three-business-day temporary custody order. These concepts are fine. I remain concerned that there appear to be corrections for mistakes made previously by the communities minister. Whilst not a good start, it may be better than nothing at all. When added to the amendments for the changes to court discretionary powers when it declines a further order, that future end date being no more than 28 days after the day of the court’s decision might be a good thing. The minister has explained his and the department’s reasons for doing this. This all leads me to suspect that the department is groaning under the existing time frames, despite the government claiming record spending. Something is wrong. There is a disconnect here between the needs of children, their families and the service delivery of the department. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131060"></A>
I do not doubt the mission statement, nor the commitment of the department, but its capacity has been tested and found to be exhausted far too quickly. The demand side of the equation constantly seems to be blamed. With domestic violence at record levels it is no surprise. What seems to be agreed to is that we will just manage as we have been doing for 12 years. This is not good enough for children and it is just too hard for the staff of the department. I remain very concerned that there is not enough concern about staff morale and staff retention, especially those highly skilled, long-serving staff. This bill offers them nothing beyond building a framework to justify rationing. I share many of their views and, just as in health, I will never support rationing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131061"></A>
This bill also seems to have a money-earning model as part of it--that being attached to the blue card system. I support the blue card. It is a very good idea. The revenue stream increase from $4.7 million to $7.8 million in 12 months just seems a bit rich. The intention of the scheme, as I understood it, was to ensure the safety of children. I never believed, nor can I accept, that there was any idea of going beyond a revenue neutral situation. I believe that should be justified by the minister. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131062"></A>
Rather than go through each of the shadow member’s nine amendments I might just say I support them and the intention of the considered amendments. They will not cost the department any more. They have been discussed with key stakeholders and they have agreed with them. They conform to fundamental legislative principles. As one might expect, this bill is drafted in quite complex terms that reflect much of the difficulty that we as a community have, families share and highly skilled child protection officers have in managing at-risk children and adolescents. I genuinely believe that all have the same desired outcomes for children. Many of these individuals will not have exactly the same beliefs on how best to achieve a predictable, happy and nurturing world for a child and certainly how to avoid the dreadful pitfalls in life that may confront them, but they certainly want to get to the same place for those children when they grow up.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131063"></A>
For those who need a gentle little reminder, the sorts of things that face children in very difficult circumstances that they may not overcome are problems with attachment, physical and mental problems that grossly exceed that of the rest of society, often they have experienced a lot of trauma, they have learning and developmental problems, behavioural problems including eating disorders, they have a much higher incidence of youth suicide--it is five times--teenage pregnancies are considerably higher, there is a strong issue of homelessness and, unfortunately, they have issues of aggression, violence and criminal activity. It is everything we do not wish for a child, especially those whose start in life is far harder than it is for everybody else. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131064"></A>
At this stage I would also like to thank the generous constituents of my seat of Gaven who recently donated to the Pyjama Drive I ran at my electorate office. I know that a number of members participated in the Pyjama Drive and I think everyone collectively would like to thank those who donated. I could not believe the result. The Pyjama Foundation’s national challenge was to provide more than 30,000 children in care with new pyjamas. Our office was inundated with baby suits, toothbrushes, teddy bears, night robes, baby caps, children’s books, hand-knitted jumpers and 100 pairs of pyjamas. We had to stop receiving any more. I was completely overwhelmed by the community’s support for such a worthy cause. I think we would like to thank the Pyjama Foundation and everyone else who was involved in what was a tremendously successful campaign and I think we should do it again. I would like to thank everyone in my electorate and other electorates who opened their hearts to give these children who are in desperate need of love and care the sort of care that they deserve.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131065"></A>
We do need to have a child protection bill that embraces more at the input end and less of a rationing approach at the output end. I do not think this bill delivers on this. There seems to be too much of ‘near enough is good enough’. When dealing with children, if this is the best that the department can come up with when almost 50 per cent of the staff currently have no patient contact, with respect, I would ask them to go back and try a little harder. As a doctor, I do have a higher standard than some, and certainly some might consider that the standards of medical staff are a bit higher than the standards of others. But, unfortunately, when you stoop a little bit below the level that should be expected, you will not get the support that you need to make the bill worthwhile. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(8.38 pm): I think it is fair to say that every time I consider a piece of legislation that impacts upon child protection I weigh up a number of factors: I weigh up the impacts on the family; I weigh up the impacts on the children who come into contact with the department; I weigh up the impacts on my former colleagues within the department of child safety; and I take into consideration our responsibility to provide good government. I suspect the drafters of this bill walked a similar fine line. It is a balancing act in child protection between the rights of the child and the rights and liberties of their parents. I will spend a bit of time addressing some of the concerns around the rights and liberties of individuals other than the children, but from the outset will acknowledge that when asked by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee to provide some information on how this bill aligns with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child the minister did provide substantial information. As has been mentioned by previous speakers, it is consistent with article 3 in particular, which basically puts forward that the child’s best interests are paramount. It also aligns with articles 9, 19 and 20.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131067"></A>
On the other side of the equation, the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee has drawn our attention to a number of clauses that do impinge on the individual’s rights and liberties and challenge natural justice. I will spend a moment looking at just two of those. First of all, clause 31 inserts a new chapter and part that provides for temporary custody orders. The proposed new section 51AF would allow a magistrate to provide a temporary custody order for matters including authorising an officer or a police officer to take a child into, or keep a child in, the chief executive’s custody; authorising a child’s medical examination or treatment; directing a parent not to have contact with a child; and authorising an officer or police officers to enter and search any place to find a child. The explanatory notes do provide information indicating that clause 31 has sufficient regard to the rights and liberties of the parents of a child for whom a temporary custody order is made. It is worth reading into the <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
. The explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131068"></A>
The Bill will introduce a new order, the temporary custody order, which the Court may make for up to three business days and, similar to the temporary assessment order, it may also be made by the Court after a child has been removed and without notice to the parents. The order will only be made when an authorised officer provides the Court with sufficient evidence that a child is at an unacceptable risk of harm and likely to suffer harm if the order is not made and, within the term of the order, the chief executive will decide, and begin taking, appropriate action to meet the child’s care and protection needs. In these circumstances, a temporary custody order for three business days will secure the child’s safety. The parents’ rights will then be preserved in relation to the processes for the actions to be undertaken by the chief executive which may include applying for the child protection order which requires parents to be notified and heard by the Court.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1131069"></A>
It is a fine line between protecting the urgent needs of the child, particularly one who we know is at imminent risk of harm or has been harmed, against that of actually taking the time to speak to the parents and notify the parents. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131070"></A>
Clause 38 amends section 51ZE to allow the chief executive to enter into an assessment care agreement with the consent of only one parent if either it would be impractical to obtain the consent of both parents or the chief executive has made reasonable attempts to obtain the consent of the other parent. During my time in child protection, we often saw issues such as family law court matters play out within the child protection sector. Whenever we see a situation where we are only offering one parent consent along these lines, I am concerned that we are opening ourselves up and making ourselves susceptible to family law matters playing out within the child protection system. I note the words ‘reasonable attempts’ there. I would ask that the minister give some information in his summing-up or during the debate on the clauses as to how ‘reasonable’ is defined. It is possibly not clear enough in this legislation. It would be useful to get some further information on that. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1131071"></A>
Clause 31, as was also identified by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee, impinges upon the natural justice. As I said, it is about providing for a temporary custody order to be made without notice to a child’s parents. Again, it is an alarming situation that we may need to get to that point. However, I do acknowledge that in some instances it is simply necessary in order to protect the child and keep the child safe. There is no doubt that being a child safety officer is a challenging position and they walk this fine line every day. Any support that we can give them as a government to ensure that their job is made easier is a good thing. I have good friends in the department who relate that they continue to be stressed, overworked and outnumbered by bureaucratic layers. It makes us wonder if these amendments are about the rights of the child or, indeed, are just a legislative solution to workload pressures. If it is the latter, if it is a case that the government is not willing to address the inherent issues within the department itself--inherent issues such as the inability of front-line staff to perform their duties--I certainly do not support it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131072"></A>
I turn to what is now considered one of the minister’s main priorities and that is early intervention and prevention. I can only say that I wish it had been a priority for previous ministers, particularly during the CMC review and certainly in the period afterwards. When I joined the department it quickly became evident to everyone to whom we talked that the piece that was missing from the puzzle was an equal and comparable investment in prevention and intervention at the same time as investing in the tertiary intervention and the out-of-home care services. If the two had run in parallel, I do not think we would be in the current situation where we are seeing more and more children entering out-of-home care and more and more children who are unable to be placed with foster-carers winding up in high-end residential facilities and also in temporary facilities such as motels. An investment some eight years ago or even six years ago may have produced a far different result. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131073"></A>
Whilst I am glad to see this change, I am not sure that the proposed solution is the best response. I speak in particular of Helping Out Families and where it talks of establishing a lead Family Support Alliance organisation and a network of service providers at three pilot sites at Logan, Beenleigh and Eagleby in October 2010 and the Gold Coast in 2011. In his second reading speech, the minister said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131074"></A>
Under the Helping Out Families initiative, child safety service centres will refer a family, via their new regional intake service, to a Family Support Alliance organisation. To support this approach, referrals will be made from Child Safety Services to the Family Support Alliance organisation without requiring the family’s consent. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131075"></A>
I am worried that this lead Family Support Alliance organisation is potentially adding yet another layer of bureaucracy, albeit in the non-government sector. I am not questioning the concept of alliances or partnerships. All evidence internationally and certainly interstate and in our own state suggests that alliances and partnerships deliver the best outcomes not only for tertiary intervention but also for prevention and early intervention outcomes for families and children. That is established practice throughout the world and it was certainly what I was working towards both in my role as the zonal planning and partnership officer and as the program manager for that program. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr POWELL:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is interesting that the member says that. The solution may be that the role would better sit out in the non-government sector which may negate the need for this investment in a separate stand-alone organisation. What you could do then is put that investment that we are making into those stand-alone organisations back into the sector itself to increase the funding to alcohol, tobacco and other drug abuse services, maternity services, mental health services and housing in the area. We would only need that small administrative component within the non-government sector to drive the partnerships. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1131079"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr POWELL:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 You still do need someone to take a lead and that lead may come from one of the non-government sector organisations. I refer to the Best Start program in Victoria--and I am not going to say that Victoria has everything right or that Victoria has anything comparable to our state in terms of geographic coverage and so on. However, its Best Start program is about providing a comprehensive, coordinated family service system. Its flier states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131080"></A>
To achieve better outcomes for children and families, we need an integrated system of services that can respond to the emerging needs of children and families in local community settings. To become more effective, service systems need to adopt a family-centred approach to working with families, a partnership approach to working with communities, and a strength-based approach to policy and service development. Better outcomes are also achieved when services are comprehensive and inclusive. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131081"></A>
It goes on to talk about the partnership aspect and it takes a different approach. Rather than creating an organisation to rule over those partnership arrangements, it funds local partnerships, which are basically the cornerstone of its approach. Many benefits are derived from forming broad partnerships that bring together the expertise and experience across a range of government and non-government service providers in areas such as child rearing, early years service delivery, local planning and good practice. This expertise and experience can be used to develop innovative and collaborative responses to improve outcomes for children. It is basically about investing in the existing primary and secondary intervention services in an area and then investing a small amount in providing some form of resource to allow the partnerships to form naturally within those organisations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131082"></A>
We are seeing it across other sectors. We are seeing it in the homelessness sector. It is perhaps something that we could see in the child protection sector instead of setting up another layer of bureaucracy, albeit in the non-government sector. It means that what we are seeing in this approach perhaps smacks of a crisis-driven approach. Again, it does not necessarily suggest that the government is taking an evaluative approach. We have looked at the RAI. We are getting good feedback from the RAI. We are getting better feedback from some of the service provision in the tertiary sector. It would be wise to look at where models are working not only in other states but also internationally and perhaps adopt those rather than try something new. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131083"></A>
This suggests that there has been a bit of chopping and changing of service delivery models in the state, which brings me to Indigenous services. In his second reading speech the minister was making loud noises about the $8.5 million investment in Indigenous services. What he will not tell you is that in the process he is mixing and matching such services and confusing service delivery, perhaps in his drive to squeeze the most out of his dollar. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131084"></A>
My understanding was that that same amount was originally set aside solely for the recognised entity function. We are now hearing that it is also providing family support services. Perhaps there is a call for that, although possibly that would stretch the REs and their ability to respond to the department’s needs. I am particularly concerned that services that currently are delivering both the important RE function and family support services are having the latter ripped off them. They are being given to other services that do not have a cultural connection to a geographic community or family group. They do not have the geographic coverage of an area and they have no established service base. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131085"></A>
I notice that the members for Mulgrave, Townsville and Cook will speak to this bill. I will be interested to know whether they have received the same feedback that we have from Indigenous services in those areas, particularly around Mornington Island, Mount Isa, Cairns, Townsville and the cape. This is not something to crow about. In fact, it is quite alarming, particularly given the inability of this government to stem Indigenous overrepresentation in the system. </Hansard-Body>

As members from both this side and the government side of the House have said, my heart goes out to our front-line child protection staff.

I fear that it continues to shuffle the deck chairs on a sinking <Hansard-Italic>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr PITT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mulgrave--ALP) (8.51 pm): I rise to make a brief contribution to the Child Protection and Other Acts Amendment Bill 2010. The bill before the House makes several amendments to Queensland’s Child Protection Act 1999 that are designed to respond more effectively to the individual needs of children at risk and in care. The Bligh government is committed to ensuring that the needs of our most vulnerable children and young people are met. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131088"></A>
When children and young people cannot safely live at home because they are harmed or at risk of harm and do not have a parent willing or able to provide adequate care of protection for them, it is the responsibility of Child Safety Services to provide them with a safe place to live. For some children, this is home based foster or kinship care. For other children who have more complex needs or who may be subject to longer term child protection orders, their needs may be best met in a residential facility or a small group home. Responses such as these give young people who have been abused or neglected the support they need, a safe place to stay and, we hope, a brighter future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131089"></A>
When Child Safety Services makes any decision relating to a child known to the department, including when and where to place a child who cannot safely live at home, the decision is made in the best interests of the child. The principle that specifies that decisions should be made in the best interests of the child, above all other considerations, is known as the paramount principle. Currently, the Child Protection Act 1999 states that the ‘welfare and best interests of a child are paramount’. This is the guiding principle for the administration of the act. The bill amends the paramount principle to remove the reference to ‘welfare’ and to insert ‘safety’ and ‘wellbeing’ to ensure a more contemporary terminology. The change from ‘welfare’ to ‘wellbeing’ is consistent in amendments to other provisions that refer to welfare. This bill proposes that the paramount principle will now read ‘that the safety, wellbeing and best interests of a child are paramount’.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131090"></A>
One of the key amendments in the bill is the inclusion of a framework for applying the principle that the safety, wellbeing and best interests of a child are paramount. It aims to strike a balance between a child’s right to be safe, their need for a stable living arrangement and the fundamental role families have in raising children. For the first time in the act, the framework puts in place a set of principles for determining the best interests of a child. All persons who are making decisions or exercising powers under the act must consider and balance the principles according to a child’s particular circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131091"></A>
The act also currently operates under the general principle that families have the primary responsibility for the upbringing, protection and development of their children. This bill will further strengthen this by inserting specific general principles that clearly articulate that consideration should be given to placing children, as a first option, with family. Importantly, the principles include recognition that it is in a child’s best interest to have stable living arrangements.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131092"></A>
 This focus on stability is in line with recent research on the developmental needs of children which shows that unstable environments can lead to developmental delays, particularly in young children. It also points to the long-term consequences that may include substance abuse, future offending, suicidal thoughts, school refusal, self-harm and other mental health problems. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131093"></A>
To emphasise the importance of stability in decision making about a child, the bill will also amend the Child Protection Act 1999 so that the Children’s Court must have regard to the child’s need for emotional security and stability before deciding whether to grant a further short-term order or an extension to an existing short-term order. In effect, the officer making the application will have to explain why a more stable option is not being sought and what action is being taken to address the child’s need for stability. For example, is there a good chance to reunifying the child with their family or should the department be considering a long-term guardianship order for the child? It could be that Child Safety Services has reached a point in working with the family where reunification is imminent but further work needs to be done to ensure the child will be safe upon return to their parents. In a case like this, a further short-term order may be appropriate in the best interests of the child.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131094"></A>
The protection of our children is an enormous responsibility and one that I take very seriously. I believe that members from both sides of this House want to put the best interests of our children first. I believe that. I believe it because, as members of parliament, we hear or read about some of the worst elements of our society and the impact that their activities and their choices have on children in our communities. It is not pleasant, but it is the reality. I refer to a statistic that is a couple of years old now, but I certainly remember it. As at 30 September 2008, more than 600 children and young people in Far North Queensland could not live safely at home because one or both of their parents abused or neglected them. I believe it is not possible to be presented with cases such as those I have seen and heard about and statistics like this and not be affected. They are among our most vulnerable members of society and it is important that they are provided with a safe environment and appropriate care. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131095"></A>
It is important that our community can be confident that our child protection system has integrity and is operating effectively and with purpose. It is important that the legislative and statutory framework reflects the weight of issues being experienced by families, child safety workers and, of course, our children. I believe that the bill before the House will contribute to the achievement of these goals and, for this reason, I give it my full support. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs SMITH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burleigh--ALP) (8.56 pm): I also rise to speak briefly on the Child Protection and Other Acts Amendment Bill. This bill provides a clear, concise legislative framework that puts the needs of the child first and enables us to deliver child safety where it counts: on the ground and in the community. The amendments build on the Bligh government’s commitment to child safety by enhancing the administration of the Child Protection Act to respond to the needs of children at risk and already in care. The changes to the act provide a clearer, more concise framework for delivering child safety services. These changes remove ambiguity, enabling prompt decisions and quick actions that may save a life or prevent harm. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131097"></A>
The recognition of the important role of long-term guardians is an important aspect of this bill. Long-term guardians are often family members and represent an important source of stability and consistency in a child’s life. As the current legislation stands, the court may revoke a long-term guardianship order if it is no longer necessary to protect the child. The distress that this can cause a child has been acknowledged, and this bill seeks to rectify this shortcoming by requiring the court to consider the child’s need for emotional security and stability. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131098"></A>
The Helping Out Families initiative relies on secondary services providing family support services to assist families as early as possible to avoid the involvement of the tertiary sector. The initiative includes the establishment of three Family Support Alliance non-government organisations; the referral of families from the Family Support Alliance non-government organisations to new and enhanced intensive family support services and/or domestic and family violence services; universal and targeted health home-visiting services; and more efficient child safety regional intake services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131099"></A>
Information sharing will be an integral part of the success of the initiative, and this bill provides the legislative basis for this information sharing between Child Safety Services and the Family Support Alliance. I am very pleased that my electorate of Burleigh, and indeed the majority of the Gold Coast, is one of the three pilot sites, and I look forward to working with my ministerial colleagues to provide enhanced secondary services. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1131100"></A>
Last year I participated in the ‘stand in my shoes’ initiative at the Mermaid Beach child safety office.

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131101"></A>
I also want to recognise the work done by organisations such as Kalwun within the local Indigenous community. Kalwun’s Aboriginal and Islander Child Care Agency provides a culturally appropriate advocacy, support and protection service. The great work of this organisation was recognised recently when the Bligh government awarded Kalwun $6 million in funding to deliver recognised entity and family support services on the Gold Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131102"></A>
This service will provide cultural advice, intensive family support and early intervention services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families with children who come to the attention of Child Safety Services. The provision of a culturally appropriate child protection and family support service is paramount to the reconciliation process and is a development I am proud to have seen evolve during my time in this House.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131103"></A>
This bill embodies the very values that this government has identified as important, namely, that the decision-making process places a primacy on the safety and wellbeing of children. It is a bill that opens the pathways of communication to enable the efficient sharing of information and provide one of the most important things in a child’s life--stability. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs MENKENS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burdekin--LNP) (9.00 pm): Our children are our future and the family structure is the most important part of any community. But we do seem to be living in an age when many other issues are taking a major focus. During this time we are seeing family structures imploding around us. The tragedy that is occurring is that we are seeing thousands of children in foster care. Families and support services should have the highest importance in any legislative regime. Giving love and care to our children is the most important facet of any community. To be able to bring up a child is a wonderful privilege and a responsibility, but it is not automatically a right which it is often considered to be. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131105"></A>
The subject of child safety is one of the most emotive areas that is often discussed in this House. Measures aimed at the prevention and early intervention to assist in the reduction of the risk of abuse, harm or neglect of children is to be commended. But this particular bill goes nowhere near far enough. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131106"></A>
Firstly, there is an acknowledgement that this is the first attempt to make serious changes to the act since the CMC review. This Labor state government has conducted three reviews of the Child Protection Act under three ministers in the six years since the CMC review. The amendment of legislation is a fundamental tool to address shortcomings of legislation and certain processes. There are occasions, however, when amendment for amendment’s sake will not see an improvement. This, I feel, is one of those occasions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131107"></A>
The department of child safety does have flaws within management and policy. This dysfunctional approach has led to a record number of children living in care. The effectiveness, functionality and culture of a department can be assessed by many indicators. One of these relates to staff turnover, with the department of child safety continuing to have one of the highest staff turnovers in the Queensland Public Service. However, I do want to put on record my total respect for child safety officers. I think they are magnificent people who work under very, very difficult circumstances. They would have one of the most difficult tasks of any of our public servants. However, the staff turnover that is occurring is definitely an indictment on the department, a department that is not giving sufficient in-service training or supplying sufficient support systems to the most important part of their operation--their staff. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131108"></A>
With staff turnover comes a loss of experience and additional pressures being put on to the department. There has been an unfortunate history of a poor culture with ongoing dysfunctional processes. This can lead to knee-jerk reactions without sufficient investigation or review of complex cases. When this occurs, these decisions have a profound impact on families. When the workload is so high that the staff are unable to cover these areas, there are many reasons for this to occur. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131109"></A>
The Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian is of concern because its staff has decreased by 30 within the last 12 months. However, the employees’ expense budget in the same period has increased $3 million, despite these staff cuts. That leaves one a little perplexed when one looks at these figures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131110"></A>
The department of child safety deserves to have stability in staffing and process. The department needs to support staff to a level where they can effectively and comprehensively carry out their duties and functions. Unless there is a commitment for this, it will be too easy for mistakes of the past to permeate back through the department. There needs to be training and mentoring put in place for those designated as child safety and child safety support officers. Within the department of child safety these staff account for 51 per cent of the department, with the remainder performing an administrative role. This level of bureaucracy is one of the highest of any department. However, I note that there is a very important degree of administration within this department. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131111"></A>
It is interesting to note one aspect whilst reviewing the explanatory notes under the policy objectives of changes to the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian Act 2000. Whether it is intentional or not, the first two dot points out of five relate to fee requirements. That of course has become an all too common trait of this government. Additional revenue raising from blue cards will see in excess of an additional $2 million coming into the coffers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131112"></A>
With regard to these particular amendments within the bill, the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian is a body charged with overseeing and monitoring the department of child safety. So it does seem totally inappropriate that the Minister for Child Safety is looking to amend legislation that deals with the commission for children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131113"></A>
The proposed amendments also aim to enhance the capacity of non-government services to intervene earlier and more effectively with at-risk families and to improve outcomes for children in out-of-home care. With this acknowledgement that outsourcing to these non-government services is more effective, it is hoped that commensurate funding is allocated to carry out this very important work undertaken by the non-government services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131114"></A>
These proposed amendments are a reflection of a child protection system that is under extreme pressure to meet existing time frames. This is at a time when the government lays claim to record budget spending. During the estimates committee hearings, the substance behind this record spend was dispelled. Only 9.1 per cent of the allocated budget was targeted at programs specific to prevention and early intervention. Also, there were very worrying trends that saw 80 per cent of notifications which require a response within 10 days were not met, 73 per cent of notifications requiring a response within five days were not met and 18 per cent of crisis notifications requiring a response within 24 hours were not met. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131115"></A>
Also during estimates there was a focus on closing the gap for Indigenous children in abusive situations. It was highlighted that capital works underspent on services to Indigenous communities by $2.766 million in 2009-10. This estimates examination raises the question whether these communities can have any faith in the delivery of services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131116"></A>
Amendments to the assessment care agreement will remove the rights of one parent having a say in the child’s removal and care. Often it will be the father who will be willing to provide for the child but who does not currently live with the child. This opens up a raft of areas that could come into question. I refer to a recent case in which a father had a clean case history but was unable to gain access to his children. It took months and months for this to happen. I am very happy to see that this has happened. But the repercussions and ramifications to the rest of the family who were fighting for this to happen are totally wrong. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131117"></A>
With regard to the proposed amendments, it needs to be stated that there are a number of aspects that are not relevant to child safety. Instead, they are remedial in nature, as the explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131118"></A>
During implementation, a number of drafting anomalies were identified which require legislative amendment. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131119"></A>
The history of this goes back to this government being obsessed with having a perceived ascendancy over the LNP’s Disability Services (Criminal History) Bill, which was introduced by the member for Hinchinbrook, the shadow minister for disability services. In February this year the government, through the Minister for Community Services, introduced the Criminal History Screening Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The aim was to streamline criminal history screening processes. But, in fact, we have seen an increase in cost and a failure to sufficiently cover certain sectors. One of these is in relation to carers of people with a disability. There needs to now be an admission that in the rush anomalies occurred. It should rightfully fall back to the Minister for Community Services to acknowledge this and structure these amendments within her own department. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131120"></A>
In the amendments to the Child Protection Act relating to case planning and working with families there is an adjustment that supposedly enhances the department’s ability to work with families and facilitate children’s long-term stability and wellbeing. This is providing that, in relation to children subject to long-term guardianship orders, contact is made with the child or young person each 12 months. This Labor proposal will leave many children in care unchecked for this period. One cannot really label this move an enhancement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131121"></A>
The 2008 <Hansard-Italic>
Views of young people in foster care</Hansard-Italic>
 report highlighted that children and young people do not have confidence that if the department of child safety promises them something it will happen. They also do not feel that they are listened to or have a say in decisions that affect them. This is often a troubled sector to work with, but there does need to be an improvement in the departmental support culture. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131122"></A>
The ability to work with families is also in question with regard to the introduction of temporary custody orders. The Children’s Court will be empowered to make a temporary custody order for up to three business days while the department decides on the appropriate action to meet the child’s protection and care needs. The temporary custody order is necessary to protect the child in the interim. It may also be made by the court after a child has been removed and without notice to the parents. The removal of the obligation on the department to notify the parents of the action raises the question whether this is a more family focused approach. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131123"></A>
In conclusion, there is a raft of changes needed to enable the department of child safety to fully perform this vital function. The amendment of the present legislation is but part of that. I certainly support the shadow minister for child safety’s comments that the functionality of the department of child safety needs to be addressed in the first instance. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (9.12 pm): I rise this evening to contribute to the Child Protection and Other Acts Amendment Bill 2010. As pointed out in the explanatory notes, the proposed amendments aim to enhance the capacity of non-government services to intervene earlier and more effectively with at-risk families and to improve outcomes for children in out-of-home care. Queensland’s child protection system is comprised of: statutory services such as child abuse investigation and response and out-of-home care; non-statutory secondary services such as intervention with families with identified problems to prevent child abuse and neglect; and non-statutory primary services, including universal prevention services available to all families such as parenting programs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131125"></A>
The proposed amendments will target both the statutory and non-statutory secondary services. The department has identified the Helping Out Families initiative to provide the right type of support, through non-statutory secondary services, to vulnerable children, young people and their families as early as possible. The intention of this legislation is to ensure children and young people have the opportunity to remain in a stable, functioning family environment without the need to enter the statutory child protection system before they can receive support. Unfortunately, although this may look good on paper, it falls short in delivering on the objectives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131126"></A>
This is just another example of the government’s continued smoke-and-mirrors play book. The purpose of this legislation is to make it look like the Bligh government is doing something when it comes to early intervention when in reality it is doing little. The minister first needs to have a good, hard look at the way his department is run. The closed shop mentality is crippling the department’s ability to make any improvements. It has had more than 12 years to fix the system and this is just another ploy to make it look like it actually cares about Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131127"></A>
Furthermore, the bill also seeks to amend the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian Act. This commission oversees and monitors the department of child safety. The minister seeks to amend the legislation that deals with the commission for children. The Liberal National Party finds it totally unacceptable that the Minister for Child Safety is trying to do this. The commission is meant to act as an independent body to monitor the performance of his department. What is the minister trying to hide by doing this? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131128"></A>
The amendments to the legislation give more and more power to the minister’s department that already has the reputation of being ruthless and cutthroat in its dealings with those concerned. The department is in desperate need of an overhaul in the way it deals with cases. This legislation does not look at the problem within the department; it just seeks to give it more power. Minister Reeves and his department are the problem, not the legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131129"></A>
Labor’s history of duckshoving and smoke and mirrors is easily seen by its recent track record with the portfolio of child safety. It has been a long six years since children and families welcomed the CMC review into child safety, but since then Labor has conducted and spent money on three further reviews of the Child Protection Act, and in that six years has changed the minister three times. The money that has been spent on these three reviews could have been better spent on making the lives of many children better. But as we see time and time again, this government has a habit of wasting Queensland taxpayers’ money on review after review. Generally the recommendations are ignored and never implemented.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131130"></A>
The department of child safety is one shining example of this Bligh Labor government’s red tape choked departments. It is no wonder the department has problems when 49 per cent of all people employed by the department are for administrative purposes. The department ranks as one of the most bureaucratic of all Public Service departments in Queensland. We should have more people at the front line, not pen-pushing behind a desk. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131131"></A>
Yet the department’s record gets worse. The department of child safety has one of the highest staff turnovers of any department. I suspect that it is probably the same reason that we see such a high turnover in Queensland Health. Workplace bullying and intimidation, no respect or respite for front-line workers and issues which continue to go unresolved serve only to exacerbate the frustrated, overworked staff who work in this department.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131132"></A>
The amendments proposed by the shadow minister for child safety, the member for Bundaberg, provide a series of checks and balances to matters brought before the court regarding temporary custody orders and ensure that transition-from-care plans are prepared for all children who are exiting care. The government’s amendments on paper may claim to improve decision making within Child Safety and promote Labor’s answers to early intervention, but it is the way in which the department is being run and the closed shop mentality that is crippling the department’s ability to move forward.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131133"></A>
Of further concern to the Liberal National Party is that this bill seeks to amend the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian--a body that is charged with overseeing and monitoring the department already and one that is additionally overseen by the Social Development Committee. It is totally unacceptable that the Minister for Child Safety is amending legislation that deals with the commission for children.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131134"></A>
It is time the Bligh Labor government looked at fixing the problem it has within its departments rather than trying to make amendments to legislation to cover up the fact that the problem is deep within Labor’s core. No amount of spin will fool the Queensland voters now. The Liberal National Party does not support this legislation. This toxic Labor government is on notice and the voting public cannot wait for the opportunity to throw them out. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.17 pm): I rise to support the Child Protection and Other Acts Amendment Bill and congratulate the current Minister for Child Safety, Phil Reeves, and the previous minister, Margaret Keech, for listening and acting on the needs of foster carers to protect children in their loving care. It is totally shocking and extremely sad that there continues to be a large number of children who are neglected and abused in their home of birth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131136"></A>
In my former role as parliamentary secretary to the minister for child safety I met many wonderful foster-parents, grandparents and kinship carers who show their absolute devotion to children who, for one reason or another, are put into their care. Many have fostered many children at various stages of their young lives over the years and continue to provide a warm, welcoming and loving environment for them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131137"></A>
I begin my speech about the legislative changes by outlining the process involved in relation to child protection services. When children are not able to remain living at home it is the responsibility of the Department of Communities’ Child Safety Services to provide them with safe placements and support in out-of-home care. The Children’s Court will make an order that will meet the care and protection needs of the child in the least intrusive way. Different types of child protection orders include short-term custody orders to a member of the child’s family or the chief executive, short-term guardianship orders to the chief executive or long-term guardianship orders to a member of the child’s family or a suitable person or to the chief executive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131138"></A>
This bill introduces two new child protection orders--a transition order and a temporary custody order. Currently when a child is subject to a child protection order and the department applies for a subsequent short-term order but this subsequent order is declined by the court, it may create immediate difficulties for the child. Under the current provisions of the Child Protection Act, the child may return to live with their parents on the day of the court’s decision. The child, particularly a young child, who may have been with a carer for a significant period may have formed strong attachments to the carer’s family. Moving suddenly and unexpectedly from their carer arrangements can be extremely traumatic and destabilising for the child.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131139"></A>
The amendment will give the court a discretionary power when it declines a further order to set a future end date for this existing order. This future end date may be up to 28 days after the court’s decision. The intent of the order is to allow for the gradual transition of the child to the care of their parents in a way that supports the child, reduces disruption and distress for the child and is in the best interests of the child, and in a way that minimises disruption and trauma to the child. It is important that Child Safety Services has sufficient ability to plan for children to return to their birth parents where a court does not grant a new child protection order, particularly where children have been in foster care for significant periods of time.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131140"></A>
I want to highlight the importance of transition orders by sharing the experience of my constituents--a loving couple who are some of our valued and incredibly dedicated foster carers. I am proud to have worked closely with successive child safety ministers to address and respond to this couple’s issues and ensure that much of the trauma and heartache they have experienced is not repeated in the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131141"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Reeves:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 They were decent people too, and you represented them very well.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131142"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs ATTWOOD:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 They certainly were. For reasons members would be aware of, I will not name my constituents but I can assure the House that they are true heroes and 100 per cent dedicated to the best interests and wellbeing of the children in their care. This couple began caring for a sibling group in late 2004 and this placement continued until the short-term custody child protection orders were due to expire in mid-2007--a period of over 2 years. The department applied to extend these then child protection orders by a further two years. However, this extension was not granted by the Children’s Court. Currently, when a court does decline to extend an existing order or does not grant a new order, the children technically should return to their birth parents the day of the court decision. However, as demonstrated in my constituents’ case, this can sometimes be an incredibly traumatic experience for both the children and their foster carers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131143"></A>
For my constituents, it was particularly heartbreaking. As members can imagine, the attachments formed after 2 pivotal years in these children’s lives were strong. The effect of the court’s decision meant that those attachments were, in part, severed on that day. If the court at that time had the discretionary power to set an end date not more than 28 days into the future of the existing orders, such as being proposed in these amendments, then much of the heartache experienced in this situation could have been avoided. The heartache experienced was compounded in this situation as, after the children were returned to their mother’s care for a period of a few months, the department was able to gather sufficient evidence to meet the statutory threshold for intervention once again.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131144"></A>
I am happy to report to the House that these children were returned to the care of these carers and are now subject to long-term guardianship orders until the children reach 18 years of age. They continue to thrive in a loving, caring environment. I have seen these children at local events with their foster-parents and have noted the change for the better in their behaviours and their physical and psychological condition. There is, however, no hiding from the fact that much of this pursuant trauma was unavoidable. Enabling the Children’s Court to set future transition orders is vitally important in recognising the stability of care that is often afforded by foster and kinship-carers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131145"></A>
Recent research on the developmental needs of children shows that an unstable environment can lead to developmental delays, particularly in young children. It also points to long-term consequences that may include substance abuse, future offending, suicidal thoughts, school refusal, self-harm and other mental health problems. This focus on stability afforded by these orders is in line with a number of other amendments that are currently under consideration by the House in this bill. The Child Protection Act currently provides for a court to grant a temporary assessment order for up to three days which enables the department to assess a child to determine if they are a child in need of protection. The bill includes the introduction of a temporary custody order. The order applies when a child is at immediate risk of harm and the department has already formed the view that the child is in need of protection and there is no need to conduct an assessment. The court may order the temporary custody order for up to three business days.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131146"></A>
The intent of the temporary custody order is to provide immediate protection for the child while the department decides on the most appropriate action to meet the child’s ongoing protection and care needs and starts taking that action. The temporary custody order may be extended for an extra day beyond the three business days if the department will use the extra day to apply for a child protection order. The bill will also amend the current time frame for temporary assessment orders from the current three days to three business days to be consistent with the new temporary custody order. The bill amends section 67 to allow the court to make an order on adjournment of a hearing for a child protection order that an authorised officer or police officer may have contact with the child with enter and search powers. The intent of the order is to allow the department to monitor the safety of the child when the court does not make a custody order or orders the child to be placed in the care of a relative.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131147"></A>
The safety and wellbeing of the child is paramount, and this must always be so. This must be the uppermost consideration of all concerned where the child’s safety is in doubt. I know what my constituent family had experienced and I know about their greatest fears in relation to the children they cared for. These changes will go a long way towards addressing their concerns, and I welcome this amendment bill. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Burnett--Ind) (9.26 pm): The fact that this government has failed to make Child Safety a stand-alone portfolio is proof that this government is not taking the protection of Queensland children seriously. It is an absolute insult that we have a minister responsible for child safety who is also the Minister for Sport. Where does our Premier get the idea that this minister, with two responsibilities, can successfully run the most important portfolio in this government? This minister has made a complete mess of the Sport portfolio--and who can forget the Gold Coast Indy?--and he has made a complete mess of this portfolio as well. The only reason he has got away with this mess is that we have a less than courageous opposition that has not properly held this government to account and a less than courageous media contingent which has run a mile--</Hansard-Body>

Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I refer to the Child Protection and Other Acts Amendment Bill. It does not matter how good the legislation that we see in this parliament today is, that is, the Child Protection and Other Acts Amendment Bill. On-the-ground, underqualified, overworked and in some cases dishonest child safety officers are a law unto themselves, causing more harm by their out of control, irresponsible and often illegal actions than the parents who are allegedly assaulting their children. It is my experience that this child safety department is in deep crisis and needs another royal commission to shake things up and kick-start some vital reform.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131151"></A>
A number of child safety issues have been brought to my attention in the course of my duties as a member of parliament. Three stand out--nay, four stand out. I can talk about three of them as long as I do not identify the people or the children associated with those matters because they are not sub judice. The matter has just recently become sub judice only after the police indicated that they would charge a parent three hours after that person--</Hansard-Body>

Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I have formed my opinions of the child safety department based on my conversations with my constituents, former staff and serving staff. While I applaud some individual child safety officers, the consistency in performance and bad decision making on behalf of some managers of Child Safety is breathtaking and sad. It is sad because the children and families are suffering because of, quite frankly, the behaviour of child safety officers who are completely out of their depth and out of control. The behaviour that I have witnessed and experienced disregards basic civil rights and disregards the natural justice of children and their parents.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131160"></A>
I can give members a case that is not sub judice. I referred a matter in December two years ago through a question on notice. It was not to this minister; it was a different matter. The matter related to the circumstances of a five-year-old child and I discreetly brought that to the minister’s attention on a number of occasions during eight months. The child had been placed in the custody of her grandparents for three years after she was allegedly sexually assaulted as a two-year-old while in the care of her biological father who was allegedly under the influence of illicit drugs at the time of the assault. The minister, against the wishes of the grandparents--and the provision is in this legislation--ordered that the child be taken from a loving and safe Queensland home three days before Christmas and placed back in the care of her New South Wales based biological father who may or may not have been still using illicit drugs. I asked that the minister let the five-year-old child spend Christmas with her grandparents and review her department’s decision using information from the independent commission for young people, the teachers from the therapeutic preschool which specialised in caring for victims of assault, and the Queensland and New South Wales police force. The background was that the father had an alleged criminal history and a continuing use of illicit drugs. The child safety department failed to insist on independent and comprehensive drug testing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131161"></A>
There were recommendations from an independent body specialising in counselling for sexual assault that were ignored by the child safety department. The common theme throughout the history of my dealings with Child Safety in Bundaberg is this ignoring of and disregard for independent reports. The commission for young people recommendations and assessments were ignored and then it was noted that, by transferring this child from Queensland to New South Wales, we had no commission for young people or an independent community visitor in New South Wales. So the child was being taken back to a place where there was less care. Of course, the grandparents accepted the removal. That is one case where I considered that the judgement of the child safety department officers and managers was at fault and severely lacking.</Hansard-Body>

In continuing with the letter that I wrote to the former child safety minister, I want to comment on the quality of the management at the particular time of the department of child safety. I informed the minister that I was visited by a child safety manager very quickly after that. This person seemed more concerned that I had actually gone to the minister rather than him.

<A ID="pgfId-1131176"></A>
While finally I understand in a free liberal democratic society it is the right of anyone to dress or groom themselves in a manner that they see fit to express their personality and individuality, I am very concerned by the unusual grooming of your regional manager. Police, prison, ambulance officers and school teachers are just some public servants who are expected to maintain a professional appearance and I was wondering if your child safety officers were expected to uphold the same standards. The facial piercings, accompanying metal studs and corkscrew metal on both the left and right eyebrows--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr O’BRIEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I rise to a point of order. The standing orders are quite specific, particularly standing order 35, about the prevention of the identification of a child under a child safety order. The honourable member is providing a great deal of detail to this House so that it threatens that that child could be identified. In a small community like Bundaberg, the level of detail that the member is providing is sufficient so that the child that he is speaking about here tonight can be identified by that community. The member is contravening the standing order and endangering the safety of that child and he should be asked to sit down. </Hansard-Body>

 I went on to make the point that I did not consider what I saw as professional attire and an appropriate form of presentation for a senior public servant in charge of an important regional government department, especially Child Safety. I wrote to the minister--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131185"></A>
I am concerned that the manager’s chosen form of eccentric personal grooming and presentation may also be intimidating, frightening and even traumatic for the fragile and abused children he is meant to interview and protect as part of his normal work duties. I could understand his choice of appearance if you confirm for me that he was involved in a police undercover operation involving outlaw motorcycle gangs or he had part-time work as an entertainer at the circus, but given that 70 to 80 per cent of communication between adults and humans, and probably more in young people, is via the sense of sight I would respectfully ask that you insist that the same dress standards which apply to police, prison, ambulance officers and school teachers also apply to child safety officers. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

That obviously was not the case in Bundaberg. I can understand the shame of the people opposite who would not want me to talk about matters like that--that this government hires people with those sorts of attitudes and dress standards. The minister says in his second reading speech--</Hansard-Body>

Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The child safety minister says in his second reading speech--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131193"></A>
Child safety is everyone’s business and the Bligh government is committed to protecting Queensland’s most vulnerable children and young people. That is why since 2004 this government has doubled the workforce and tripled the Child Safety budget. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131194"></A>
There are a couple of issues that I would like to take up with the child safety minister. First of all, I agree wholeheartedly that child safety is everyone’s business, except that I do not believe the message has properly got out to his staff. In relation to the budget and staff, I have been told that the average job turnover for a child safety officer is seven months. I stand to be corrected. I invite the minister to provide the official figure. I can, however, say confidently that with the department of child safety there has been a casualisation of the workforce. Budget and staffing figures that I got from the library said that the total of full-time equivalent child safety officers in June 2005 was 1,936. Of that, approximately 1,200 were permanent, 668 were temporary and 61 were casual. The number of non-permanent staff was well over 700 officers. I think that is an unhealthy casualisation of a professional service. We need to have greater retention of personnel and look at a system that encourages more full-time employment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131195"></A>
I have spoken to a child safety solicitor and he has some advice for this chamber. He says that he is not the only practitioner who thinks it is a good idea and necessary to have a child protection act to protect children. He agrees that child safety officers are going beyond their powers, misusing their powers and acting outside the act. He says that a 22-year-old uni student or someone with a biblical studies degree from Oakland, California cannot possibly have the life experience necessary or any other adequate qualifications to determine what is a good or bad parent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131196"></A>
He says that Legal Aid does not adequately fund solicitors to respond to child protection matters and therefore, because no-one takes them to task, Child Safety is running wild and parents are being unfairly treated. Child Safety is creating a new stolen generation, he alleges. He says that if Child Safety was made liable for costs or actual consequences, the unwarranted and absurd cases would quickly disappear. He says that if they had qualified legal officers in Child Safety they would not run the absurd cases and that, because they do not have legal officers in Child Safety, they run the case until trial without referral to legal practitioners. He says that a few days before the trial they brief Crown Law who are not prepared or properly briefed to prosecute the cases, costing taxpayers thousands of dollars.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131197"></A>
This solicitor also states that Child Safety bullies the parents. If they complain or criticise the department, the officers take it out on them by discontinuing contact or charging them with frivolous charges. They have to basically admit they are guilty before the officers will let them get their kids back. I believe that is a fact, that clinical assessments by supposedly independent parties are being passed back to Child Safety and they are using the information they get in those clinical assessments to label people as sex offenders. The solicitor went on to say that he could basically telephone Child Safety and advise them whatever he wanted about anyone he wanted and they would unleash a great and powerful act upon that person. The person would not have a great deal of hope of defending the matter without a very large and costly fight that virtually destroyed their family. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131198"></A>
This legislation gives increased powers to child safety officers. The evidence before me and presented to me by legal professionals is that child safety officers are abusing their powers. Queensland parents and children are being harmed by the uncontrolled and irresponsible use of power. Until we have a proper independent investigation into the manner in which child safety officers are operating, I cannot in good conscience support this legislation. The existing act is okay. It will work fine if the government public servants follow the rules. </Hansard-Body>

Mr O’BRIEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cook--ALP) (9.50 pm): One thing is for certain: the protection of children in this state will not be improved by the member for Burnett acting as judge and jury on such complicated and serious matters. For him to come in here and pretend to be judge and jury on what are complicated and serious matters--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131201"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I rise to a point of order. I find those comments offensive and I ask that they be withdrawn. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131202"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr O’BRIEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I withdraw. Child safety is a difficult and complicated matter and it should be dealt with by people with serious and reasonable minds. Child protection is particularly difficult in my electorate of Cook and as such I take a keen and active interest in new policies and procedures that will impact on my constituents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131203"></A>
The changes to the Child Protection Act highlight the important role that Child Safety plays in our communities. I acknowledge the changes, particularly those that will improve service delivery to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I would firstly like to note the significant work occurring to reform Indigenous child protection in Queensland. The Department of Communities is currently introducing new reforms for at-risk Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children who come to the attention of the child protection system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131204"></A>
Early intervention and prevention is one of the key focuses of this government. An amount of $8.5 million has been allocated to establish family support service hubs located across the department’s seven regions. These new support services are targeted at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families who require extra support to keep their child safe. The family support service response will be coordinated early for vulnerable families to reduce risk factors that might lead to the child requiring statutory child protection intervention. An additional $8.5 million will continue to be provided for recognised entities’ statutory functions to ensure that they can continue to fulfil their role providing cultural advice when it is not safe for Indigenous children to stay at home. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131205"></A>
These services are designed to actively participate in the decisions made by Child Safety regarding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people throughout each phase of the child protection system. This revised service delivery model will further address the delivery of culturally appropriate and representative child protection services for Queensland’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and their families. The amendments to the Child Protection Act will enable greater partnership between government and non-government organisations to improve outcomes for Queensland’s children and young people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131206"></A>
The amendments also include greater provisions to work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers before their children are born. This bill includes an amendment to extend the obligation to consult with recognised entities to include decisions about unborn Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. Consistent with the current provisions of the Child Protection Act regarding unborn children, such action can only occur with the pregnant woman’s consent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131207"></A>
The bill also includes an amendment to the definition of ‘relevant information’ for the purpose of information sharing. This amendment will enable government prescribed entities and service providers to share information about unborn children with each other. Currently, they can only share information with the department. The intent of the amendment is that broader information sharing may result in prescribed entities and service providers identifying that the department should be notified of the risk to an unborn child.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131208"></A>
Keeping Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children safe and connected to their kin and culture is a priority for the Bligh government. The priorities articulated by the Indigenous Child Placement Principle detail the opportunities that should be provided for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children placed in out-of-home care in order that they are able to be raised by their own kin and within their own communities. It is a legislative responsibility for Child Safety workers in Queensland to follow this principle. Under the act, Child Safety workers must consider the hierarchy of possible placement options, involvement of recognised entities in the placement decision, retention of family and community relationships and the commitment of non-Indigenous carers. The hierarchy of possible placement requires a particular order of priority to be considered when placing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. If it is safe, children should be able to remain within their families. The second preference is for placement within their communities. The third option is for placement with another Indigenous person compatible with the child’s community. The fourth option is placement with other Indigenous people and, finally, if none of the other options is possible, placement should be with a non-Indigenous carer committed to maintaining the child’s connection with his or her family, community and culture. In all cases, the child’s safety, welfare and best interests remain the No. 1 consideration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131209"></A>
A number of initiatives have been undertaken to implement the child placement principle and improve outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. These include development of a draft state-wide policy for consultation with stakeholders which focuses on strengthening working relationships between local Indigenous services and Child Safety Services centres, cross-cultural training for Child Safety Services staff throughout the Foundation Studies in Culture--Indigenous Engagement, revisions to the Child Safety practice manual and data collection system to enable practitioners to record information necessary to evidence the implementation of the principle and development of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Placement Principle information sheet to inform staff of the principle and related processes. Furthermore, this government is investing more than $45 million over four years to establish safe house services in 11 remote Indigenous communities so that children remain connected with their communities. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131213"></A>
As I said, the department continues to take up the many challenges identified with implementing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Placement Principle and is committed to ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care remain connected to their families and communities. The Bligh government remains committed to ensuring better outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and their families. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr DICKSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Buderim--LNP) (9.58 pm): I rise to speak on behalf of the poor ratepayers of Queensland. In 2007 this Labor government forced council amalgamations upon the ratepayers. At the time, Premier Peter Beattie also told this House--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131220"></A>
By March next year they will be part of the 72 new councils that will provide for our new system of local government--stronger local government--to deal with Queensland’s growth. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1131221"></A>
Where is the evidence to suggest the councils are now more financially viable and that they are getting stronger as a result of this amalgamation? A case in point is the Sunshine Coast Regional Council amalgamation. Noosa, Maroochy and Caloundra councils were forced to amalgamate. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131222"></A>
The current Bligh Labor government has reneged on its promise to meet all the costs of amalgamation; in this case, $13.9 million. Now the ratepayers are being belted with a raft of increased fees and charges, and an increase in their household rates, in order to make up for the Labor government shortfall. On 23 April, the media quoted Mayor Bob Abbot as saying ‘... the state government decision not to pay out the $13.9 million in amalgamation costs does not help the situation.’ Amalgamation was supposed to make local government more effective and sustainable. In June 2010, the Sunshine Coast Regional Council met and voted, although not unanimously, for the latest increase in household rates. It introduced a new levy, it reduced a discount, it increased other levies and, at the end of the day, it claimed it had kept the rates increase to 4.8 per cent. While that might be true of the general rate component of the rates notice, it is a play on words and absolute smoke and mirrors from the Sunshine Coast Regional Council. When people get their bill, what do they do? They look at the bottom line. I can tell the House that on the Sunshine Coast I personally know of bottom-line rates increases of 27 per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131223"></A>
We are also seeing the engineered debacle of the council and its offspring, Unitywater. The council does not know if it is Unitywater’s parent, guardian, uncle, aunt or distant cousin twice removed. Ratepayers are being ripped off because amalgamations have failed to give them better value from their councils. We also need to take into account increases in the price of power, rego and licence fees. Then we get down to the sale of assets, which is what has really hurt the people of Queensland and is about to come home to roost at the next rate rise in June next year. That is when ratepayers will really get stitched up, because water will go up by another 25 per cent and we can pick a number as to how much power will go up by. Can members guess who gets all of the credit for this? It is Labor. Labor keeps giving the people of Queensland rate increases and power price increases, and then it sells them out just to finish the job off. There will be nothing left. However, one thing I can guarantee is that our state election will have the same outcome as the federal election. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms CROFT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Broadwater--ALP) (10.01 pm): Last week I had the opportunity to visit Coombabah State School for its annual junior sports day, which I thoroughly enjoyed. It was a day of great colour with students proudly wearing their new house coloured T-shirts, a day of great support with a great turnout of parents, grandparents and carers, and a day of fun. Each time I visit Coombabah State School I am inspired by the great work of our teachers, teacher aides, school administration staff, cleaners, groundsmen and volunteers who all work so hard to ensure Coombabah primary is a great state school that achieves great results. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131226"></A>
Tonight I would like to share with the House some of Coombabah State School’s recent achievements. At the Gold Coast Special Eisteddfod, 15 students came third in the group dance and 17 students came second in the group song. At the Gold Coast Eisteddfod, the junior choir took out third place and the senior orchestra, competing for the first time in three years, was awarded honours. The string quartet was comprised of four year 6 and 7 students who played together for the first time and received honours. The junior band, which has played together for only six months, received a highly commended award. The recorder band received a highly commended for the third year in a row. The senior band, made up of 16 students, performed an ensemble and played well for a primary school band.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1131227"></A>
Congratulations go to the following students and teams selected to compete at the forthcoming regional athletics championships: Danielle Maxwell in shot-put, Ezra Tuitapa-Isacc for shot-put, Olivia Hadley for high jump, the 10 and 11 years boys relay team and the 10 and 11 years girls relay team. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1131228"></A>
A dedicated and committed teaching staff is, indeed, one of the important elements to creating the great learning environment that is so evident at Coombabah State School.

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131229"></A>
The dynamic and proactive Coombabah State School P&amp;C continues to fully support the teaching and learning of all students under the guidance of its president, Pania Crawford, and her excellent volunteers. I am advised that the P&amp;C has recently supported some students who gained regional representation: in Australian Rules, Dane Watmuff; girls soccer, Tyla Phillips; netball, Olivia Hadley; and boys touch football, Darnell Tawhi-Amopiu.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131230"></A>
Recently the P&amp;C was successful in obtaining a Gambling Community Benefit Fund grant of $25,000 for a sustainable urban living project based on the principles of aquaponics. The sustainable urban living project will be managed by students in the special education program and will become an integral part of the school’s science program. This project, undertaken by the P&amp;C and the school, supports this year’s Year of Environmental Sustainability declaration by Education Queensland and teaches students to care for the environment, science and creating sustainable living.</Hansard-Body>

Dr ROBINSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cleveland--LNP) (10.04 pm): Thornlands State School on South Street, Thornlands, is a thriving school with approximately 600 students in the primary school and 100 students in the full-day preschool. The school is proud of its long tradition in servicing the educational needs of the district and encourages students to take a keen interest in sport, the environment and cultural activities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131235"></A>
Thornlands State School was officially opened on 15 October 1910. The first teacher, Miss M Fielding, was appointed on 24 October. On 1 November the first student was enrolled. By the end of that week, a total of 14 children had been enrolled and 100 years of state government education in Thornlands had begun. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131236"></A>
On 16 and 17 October 2010, a weekend of celebrations will take place at Thornlands State School to commemorate the official opening of the school in 1910 and to showcase 100 years of education at Thornlands. In that time, the school has been well served by various principals, teachers, staff and P&amp;Cs. Many thousands of students have been successfully educated at the school. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131237"></A>
Mr Bradley French is the acting principal and Jan Burton and Jane Barnett are the deputy principals. P&amp;C president, Mark Spreadborough, and the P&amp;C Association Centenary Committee have invited all past and present students, parents, staff and members of the community to participate in the celebrations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131238"></A>
The school is situated in a pleasant natural environment and children are encouraged to care for the native plants and animals. The school considers itself fortunate to be in a koala zone and regularly has visits from koalas, as well as other wildlife. The abundance of native trees and shrubs ensures that the school is also home to a wide range of native birds, including lorikeets and parrots. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131239"></A>
The school’s facilities and amenities have been expanded over the century. The school’s oval provides facilities for many healthy activities such as football, cricket, tennis and swimming, to name a few. Situated near the oval is a versatile multipurpose hall that readily accommodates all students. During lunchtimes, students are able to use the hall for various teacher-led activities, including games, discos and the famous Thornlands Idol. I have had the good luck of being able to participate in the more recent practice of Thornlands Idol. Young dancing and singing talent are displayed, with judges looking for the X factor. After-hours, the hall is utilised by various sporting and community groups. The library is open daily to all students and children are encouraged to borrow from the stock held. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131240"></A>
I look forward to the celebrations that start earlier than the big weekend. The program starts with a launch, ‘Back to Thornlands’, then a centenary concert, open day and the finale weekend of the school reunion and showcase, gala dinner/dance and family picnic day to cap things off. My congratulations to the Thornlands State School community. May your next 100 years be even more prosperous and significant. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs SMITH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burleigh--ALP) (10.07 pm): Recently I attended a Princess Party and, by the end of the night, even I felt like a princess. The Lifehouse Project is a community project that was incorporated to assist young people at risk and the Princess Party is an event to encourage potentially at-risk young women, aged 14-18 years, to value and respect themselves, have confidence and reach their dreams. The girls at the Princess Party were from a variety of backgrounds, but had been nominated by their schools, school based youth health nurses, counsellors, family members and even self-referral. The day was an opportunity for them to be inspired by others, to help build their self-esteem and be assured that they were loved and respected.</Hansard-Body>

 Carly Crutchfield appeared on the show. Carly was a motivational speaker for the Princess Party and she spoke with the girls from the heart. As I looked around the room I saw that they could relate to her. She may now be a millionaire, but they could see that her early teen years were not unlike their own.</Hansard-Body>

Five hundred under-age girls at a function at Jupiters Hotel on the Gold Coast sounds like a recipe for disaster, but it was just the opposite. I congratulate Mr Stuart Wing, the CEO of Jupiters Hotel and Casino, for taking a leap of faith and sanctioning the Princess Party at his hotel. I think even his staff thought he had rocks in his head, but his faith in the girls and the organisers was justified. While security staff were strategically placed, they were highly visible and the safety of the girls was paramount. No-one got in without a pass and no-one got out without a parent or carer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131245"></A>
I acknowledge the enormous contribution of Ruth Knight to this event. Ruth has faced her own challenges but now puts all her energy into instilling in young women their self-worth. There are so many people involved in this event it is impossible to mention them all. However, I would like to acknowledge a number of those people who made the whole event possible. </Hansard-Body>

Evolve Make-Up, a Gold Coast based company, provided 75 hairdressers and make-up artists during the afternoon to help girls with their hair and make-up in preparation for the formal dinner in the evening. There was a donation of 500 individually wrapped flowers--one for each girl as she entered the dining room--and a number of young men were on hand to escort each girl to her table. A beautiful two-course dinner and entertainment was provided that included a former member of the Ten Tenors, Scott Fields. Scott brought a tear to the eye of those present when he singled out a young woman with cerebral palsy and sang to her. She was delighted!</Hansard-Body>

No-one knows what the future holds for these young women. But, with the support of so many mentors and sponsors, I hope they can be inspired and see that there are many people in the community who care about them. I particularly like the following verse from the book of Proverbs, ‘She is clothed with strength and dignity, and she laughs without fear of the future.’ What more could we want for our young women of the future? <Hansard-Speech-End>

I was trying to bring a human touch to the debate and talked about a particular individual in my electorate. I gave all of the information. In the sneaky way that so often happens on the other side of the House, as I completed my three minutes the member for Keppel suggested that I had in fact written a letter on behalf of a supposed constituent. That was far from the truth. In fact, I am very happy to table the letter to me, the letter to the minister, the letter from the minister and then the letter back from the constituent today, just to put paid to that argument. </Hansard-Body>

It was interesting that the member for Keppel, when challenged, was not able to bring himself to turn around to look me in the eye to see whether or not that was indeed the case. Anyway, that is the sort of thing we can expect on that side of the House. </Hansard-Body>

We heard today a wonderful announcement: 20 years down the track, we are going to have trains doing 320 kilometres an hour et cetera and we are going to be buying trains with toilets on them! I ask the Premier to speak to her minister to get the facts. We already have trains with toilets on them. They are already in service on the Gold Coast, and thank goodness for that because quite often when people hop on the trains and head to the Gold Coast what do they find when they get to the stations on the Gold Coast? The train station is closed and there are no toilet facilities available to them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131253"></A>
So we have an issue with the Gold Coast trains. The minister says to my constituent, ‘Yes, indeed, we are trying to fix the problem on the Gold Coast.’ But we all know that, no, they are not trying to fix the problem on the Gold Coast. The minister says, ‘There is no room to put any more trains on the Gold Coast line.’ We now know that that is not the case. We now know that, as we speak, it is possible to put additional trains on the Gold Coast line in peak hour. Currently in peak hour we have 19 trains on the Gold Coast line heading into Brisbane. We now know that it is possible to get up to 23 trains on the Gold Coast line per hour over the peak period. That is four additional trains in the peak period. We have been told a mistruth in this House to say that it is not possible. We now know that it is possible. </Hansard-Body>

Redcliffe Electorate, Bowls Day for Cancer</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Ms van LITSENBURG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Redcliffe--ALP) (10.13 pm): In conjunction with Daffodil Day, the Redcliffe RSL women’s bowls club held their ‘Bowls day for cancer’ to raise money for the Redcliffe Hospital Foundation’s cancer research program. The Redcliffe Hospital Foundation is developing an education and research facility in conjunction with the GP superclinic and the University of Queensland, which is collaborating to have trainee doctors, nurses and allied health professionals trained at the Redcliffe Hospital. Around 12 teams competed in the challenge, which was followed by a lunch. They raised $1,100 for cancer research which the RSL traditionally matches, so they will be able to donate $2,200.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131257"></A>
Boris Chern, the head of oncology services at Redcliffe Hospital, has instigated some research but is keen to expand it to improve outcomes for all cancer sufferers. The statistics are frightening. Currently one in two people, female or male, will contract cancer at some time in their life. Recent research has made important gains and, because of this, the five-year survival rate for invasive cancer is 70 per cent for women and 65 per cent for men. This has improved about 15 per cent since the 1980s.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131258"></A>
Recent breakthroughs have delivered outcomes such as a vaccine for cervical cancer and drug combinations that have improved people’s survival rates and lessened the side effects of chemotherapy. Continued targeted research can produce incremental improvements in these results. Daffodil Day and local fundraisers such as the RSL women’s bowls day are a vital link in that chain. Without support from these areas, the Cancer Council would have great difficulty in funding research programs. Because of each community’s generosity in donating to support research, cumulative improvements in the survival rate for invasive cancer and fewer side effects from drugs are continuing around the state, the country and the world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131259"></A>
The Bligh government has consistently increased funding for health because we understand the importance in the community of good health care and health outcomes, especially with cancer, which devastates not only the lives of sufferers but also their whole families. Our support for cancer research is in line with the Bligh government’s Toward Q2 initiatives to have a healthier community. Healthy communities are strong communities, and healthy and strong communities are those that support each other during times of difficulty. Only the Bligh Labor government is continually pushing the boundaries to ensure that Queenslanders not only are amongst the longest living people in the world but also are the healthiest and that they have cutting-edge cancer services and other medical services. </Hansard-Body>

Minimum Waste Collection Charge</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr BLEIJIE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kawana--LNP) (10.16 pm): I rise this evening to address the issue of the recent minimum waste collection charge increases that have been passed on to ratepayers in my electorate in the recent rate notifications by the Sunshine Coast Regional Council. The charge relates to those residents, many of them senior, who reside in community title schemes in the former Caloundra city council area. These residents have banded together to fight the charge because they have had enough of governments of all levels attacking their standard or living. The recent history of this charge can only be described as tumultuous at best. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131263"></A>
For the financial year 2008-09, there was a modest levy of $25 charged to each ratepayer in the complex. There was no charge in 2009-10 and now for this financial year the charge has been increased to $151.30 per resident--an increase of some 600 per cent in just two years. Most astonishingly, that is more than the Labor state government’s charges.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131264"></A>
Currently many unit complexes have a shared bin system, whereby council is only required to collect on average 10 bins put out from a potential 40 bins per complex, saving the council valuable time and money. I have written to council, a copy of which letter I table, to highlight the inequity in this system which charges each resident for an individual service that they actually do not receive. </Hansard-Body>

It also suggested that, because no charge was imposed on ratepayers in 2009-10 in southern premises, council was out of pocket $1.2 million and that the $151.30 imposed on southern residents this year would still leave council out of pocket. Council’s blunder and budget black hole imposition will be subsidised by the ratepayer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131269"></A>
People are already under an enormous strain from cost-of-living expenses. Under the mismanagement of this incompetent Labor state government we have seen electricity prices spiral out of control, registration go up, fuel prices go up and now water prices go up--just to name a few. Now rates and levies and charges are just another form of tax on residents who are struggling to make ends meet, and the people who are hardest hit are those on fixed incomes such as pensioners.</Hansard-Body>

In the same article the Sunshine Coast Regional Council deputy mayor said that the advantages are not apparent at this point in time. He said that an additional $14 million a year had to be found over the next few years to fix the council’s financial woes.</Hansard-Body>

We heard today the Premier of Queensland stand in this place and finally admit that the state Labor government has not been listening to Queenslanders for the past 12 years. But now it is sending all its Labor state members out to listen to people. The LNP has been listening to the people of Queensland. We will help reduce the cost burden that each and every Queenslander has due to a state Labor government. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WETTENHALL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Barron River--ALP) (10.19 pm): One of the fastest growing areas in the Barron River electorate is in the Freshwater Valley, including the suburb of Redlynch and a number of major new residential estates in the area. In fact, the population has grown from 1,164 in 2001 to 2,520 in 2008, at an average annual rate of just under 12 per cent compared with an annual average growth rate of just under four per cent for the electorate as a whole. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131277"></A>
Typically, residents of the valley are working families with school-age children or younger children who will benefit from early childhood and kindergarten services. The demand for new services and infrastructure generated by population growth is the central challenge for our government. I am pleased to say that we are meeting that challenge in Redlynch. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131278"></A>
Nowhere is the foresight and good planning more evident than in new education facilities in the valley. This is true in both the government and Catholic education sector. In addition to creating a new multimillion dollar state P-12 college at Redlynch, our government has also invested heavily in the development of St Andrew’s Catholic College, located just a short distance away. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131279"></A>
Recently, I had the pleasure of officially opening stage 9 at St Andrew’s comprising 13 new general learning areas, modifications to the middle and senior libraries and various other extensions enabled by a $4.5 million contribution by the state government. In July 2008 I opened stages 7 and 8, which received more than $6.4 million from the state government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131280"></A>
Our investment is not limited to expanding schools. Last year, I also took part in the official opening of a new $1.8 million multipurpose sporting field and courts on land owned by St Andrew’s. In partnership with the Cairns Regional Council and the school, the state government pioneered a new approach to developing sporting facilities that benefits students but means they are available for community use as well. This model is now embedded in the new sport and recreation infrastructure program. This year, our government will boost participation levels in sport with a further $175,000 grant for the installation of lighting at these first-class sporting facilities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131281"></A>
Complementing these developments, St Andrew’s has been chosen as the location for a new federally funded 75-place long-day-care centre. Meeting a 2009 election commitment, our government will contribute $450,000 towards the construction of the centre to include a dedicated kindergarten room from which a sessional kindergarten program will be delivered by a qualified teacher for up to 48 children. I congratulate foundation principal, Laurette Graham, and everyone else who has supported the development of St Andrew’s Catholic College and whose faith, energy and vision have helped create a wonderful community asset. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind) (10.21 pm): Today I have been provided with information from a medical professional that an outbreak of an antibiotic resistant bug has occurred at the Bundaberg Base Hospital’s medical ward. Half that ward has been isolated. There is a clean-up process in place.  The antibiotic resistant bug is called vancomycin resistant entrococci or VRE. A medical website which was supplied to me by the Parliamentary Library states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131284"></A>
In 1986, the first VRE strains appeared in Europe and, in 1989, the first case of VRE was reported in the United States. Between 1989 and 1993, the percentage of enterococcal tests that were positive for VRE in the United States rose from 0.3 percent to 7.9 percent. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1131285"></A>
The website also states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131286"></A>
Enterococcal infections that result in human disease can be fatal, particularly those caused by strains of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE). During 2004, VRE caused about one of every three infections in hospital intensive-care units, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131287"></A>
This medical professional is concerned for patient safety and staff wellbeing. That is why they have asked that I raise this issue in this place. Unfortunately, this government has a long history of cover-ups and has been more concerned with adverse media headlines rather than adverse patient and staff wellbeing. I call on the health minister to explain what he is doing to help solve this problem which has been caused by a number of pre-existing conditions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131288"></A>
The hospital budget is in crisis. There is not enough money to even meet normal running costs. That was confirmed last week on ABC Radio by a senior VMO. Health managers Beth Norton and Kevin Hegerty have called extraordinary meetings with senior medical staff and managers from Bundaberg in Hervey Bay and laid down the law that budgets must be cut back. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131289"></A>
The new department of emergency medicine that the health minister bragged about this morning will not come with extra fully funded nursing positions. The medical managers are being told they will have to staff the new department of emergency medicine from the existing nursing pool. There will be no increase in job numbers. They will be robbing Peter to pay Paul. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131290"></A>
I am told that over the years there has been a cutback in the number of cleaners at the Bundaberg Base Hospital and that the cleaners who are employed are run off their feet. The extraordinary workload on nurses and doctors increases the possibility of cross infection with patients and the existence of VRE. This all led to a situation where it is understandable that the Bundaberg Base Hospital has an outbreak of VRE--a bug which is normally found in much bigger capital city hospitals. This is also another reason why Bundaberg’s old hospital must be replaced with a new hospital in a new location with double the budget, double the doctors, double the nurses and double the beds. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr KILBURN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Chatsworth--ALP) (10.24 pm): I recently attended the Carina Leagues Club outstanding junior player grants awards. The Carina Leagues Club gave out money to four outstanding young Queenslanders who live in the Chatsworth electorate. They were Daniel Butcher, Tianna Mangakahia, Daniel Rolley and Max Goode. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131293"></A>
Daniel Butcher who plays for the Carina Leagues Redsox Baseball Club has represented Queensland in 2009 at the Little League China Tour as well as the national youth championships in January this year. He has also been selected for representative duties over the past few years and is well respected in the youth baseball fraternity for his ability and easygoing nature. He was recognised by Baseball Queensland recently when he was offered only one of four under 14 age group places in the Queensland baseball academy’s elite athletes program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131294"></A>
Max Goode is 17 years old and plays for the Carina Leagues Warriors Water Polo Club. He has recently competed in the Queensland schoolboy championships in Brisbane and was selected in the Queensland schoolboy team which competed in the Australian schoolboy championships in New South Wales. Queensland played for the bronze medal, defeating Western Australia 22 to six with Max scoring eight goals on his own. Max was then selected in 2010 Australian Schoolboys Water Polo Team which will tour the United Kingdom, the United States of America and New Zealand in December this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131295"></A>
Tianna aged 15 years plays for the Southern Districts Basketball Association. She has captained the Queensland under 16 girls second national championship team. She captained the under 16 Spartans who were the state champions. She has played every age group at a representative level. She has also been selected to play the under 17 Pacific Coast Slam in 2011 and has been selected in the Australian under 17 women’s squad. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131296"></A>
Last but not least is Daniel Rolley. At the grand age of 10, Daniel participates in the Balmoral Little Athletics Club and has been doing so for five years. He is the club age champion, junior track champion in the under 6s, under 7s, under 8s, under 9s and under 10s. He is the Queensland record holder for the 400 metres and 800 metres in the under 10 boys age group. He has set Queensland’s best time in the 400 metres of 1.03 minutes and in the 800 metres of 2.23 minutes. This year he won the Gold Coast marathon for the juniors. He ran a full marathon at the grand age of 10. What a future. </Hansard-Body>
