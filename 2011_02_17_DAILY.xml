 Honourable members, I have ordered that a ruling regarding a complaint by the member for Gaven against the Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading of deliberately misleading the House be circulated. I have decided not to refer the matter to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee. I seek leave to have the statement incorporated in the parliamentary record. </Hansard-Body>

SPEAKER’S RULING--ALLEGED DELIBERATELY MISLEADING THE HOUSE</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002127"></A>
On 25 November 2010, the Member for Gaven wrote to me alleging that the Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading had misled the House on 23 and 25 November 2010.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002128"></A>
The member’s complaint was that the Minister misled the House as to the member’s position on hotel trading hours. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002129"></A>
In accordance with Standing Order 269(5) on 26 November 2010, I wrote to the Minister, enclosing a copy of the member’s allegations and requested a response.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002130"></A>
On 23 December 2010, the Minister provided a letter of response. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002131"></A>
The Minister’s response quoted the member for Gaven’s comments in Hansard and argued that from those comments a reasonable person would conclude that the member was in favour of a reduction of trading hours. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002132"></A>
For the benefit of the House, I table a copy of the correspondence in this matter.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002133"></A>
It is well established that are three elements to be established when it is alleged that a member has committed the contempt of deliberately misleading the House:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1002134"></A>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1002135"></A>
•	secondly, it must be established that the member making the statement knew at the time the statement was made that it was incorrect; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1002136"></A>
•	thirdly, in making it, the member must have intended to mislead the House.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002137"></A>
There is always a danger that a member, in referring to an earlier speech by another member, will misrepresent that member’s comments.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002138"></A>
It is clear that a misrepresentation can constitute a deliberate misleading of the House and a contempt only if all the elements described above can be established.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002139"></A>
In this case, I do not believe that any of the elements have been sufficiently been made out. Furthermore, I consider it unlikely that further investigation by the IEPPC would adduce such evidence.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002140"></A>
I have, therefore, decided not to refer the matter to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

 Honourable members, I have ordered that a ruling regarding a complaint by the Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland against the member for Cleveland of deliberately misleading the House be circulated.

SPEAKER’S RULING--ALLEGED DELIBERATELY MISLEADING THE HOUSE</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002208"></A>
On 21 October 2010, the Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland wrote to me alleging that the Member for Cleveland had deliberately misled the House on two occasions in debate on 5 August 2010 deliberately misled the House.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002209"></A>
The Minister’s complaint was that the member purposefully took his quoted him out of context and consequently misrepresented him and misled the House. He asserts the use of the quote was misleading in the context of the issue of whether the over fishing of snapper requires government action. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002210"></A>
In accordance with Standing Order 269(5) on 25 November 2010 I wrote to the Member for Cleveland, enclosing a copy of the member’s allegations and requested a response.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002211"></A>
On 17 December 2010, the member provided a detailed letter of response. The member asserts that the context of his speech was of overall fish stock sustainability and the need for green zones, not the specific snapper context, and therefore submits that his quote of the Minister was in context.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

SPEAKER’S RULING--ALLEGED DELIBERATELY MISLEADING THE HOUSE</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002169"></A>
On 28 October 2010, the Member for Mermaid Beach wrote to me alleging that the Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading had deliberately misled the House on 27 October 2010.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002170"></A>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002171"></A>
In accordance with Standing Order 269(5) on 24 November 2010, I wrote to the Minister, enclosing a copy of the member’s allegations and requested a response.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

On 23 December 2010, the Minister provided a letter of response. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002173"></A>
The Minister asserts that his comments in the House were intended to correct the member’s implication that the government owned racing assets but concedes that he did not achieve his intent in that he was unable to finish his sentence due to interjections.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002174"></A>
The Minister states that, in hindsight, he appreciates that he should have clarified this matter when the member rose on a matter of privilege on 27 October 2010. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I find that the Minister has adequately explained his inaccurate statement. Furthermore, I consider it unlikely that further investigation by the IEPPC would adduce evidence that would make out the third element of intent. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002182"></A>
I have, therefore, decided not to refer the matter to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002183"></A>
In doing so, however, I remind the Minister of the importance of the accuracy of statements made in the House and the requirement to correct the parliamentary record as soon as possible after becoming aware of an incorrect statement.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002184"></A>
In this particular instance, this could have been when the Hansard transcript of the Minister’s comments became available, though certainly no later than when the Member for Mermaid Waters raised the matter as a matter of privilege.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002185"></A>
I take the opportunity to remind all members in a similar fashion. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, on 26 October 2010 I received correspondence from the member for Burdekin relating to statements made by the Minister for Community Services and Housing during estimates committee hearings regarding the pending closure of the Women’s Infolink Service. The member for Burdekin alleges that the minister deliberately mislead the House in relation to these statements.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998669"></A>
In accordance with Standing Order 269(5) I sought a response from the minister. The minister challenges a number of the member’s assertions in her response. I do not intend to canvass the details of the claims and counterclaims. Suffice to say that there is considerable examination of fact required to determine the matter.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998678"></A>
Accordingly, I have decided to refer the matter to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee. In doing so, I emphasise that I have formed no view as to whether there has, in fact, been a breach of privilege but rather that there are sufficient issues in play to warrant the further attention of the House via the committee. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.35 am): I lay upon the table of the House the public report of ministerial expenses for the period 1 July 2010 to 31 December 2010. This report shows that ministerial expenditure has remained reasonable and that fiscal responsibility remains a key priority of our government. When compared to the same period in 2009 overall expenditure has increased by $449,267 or 2.73 per cent. The major areas where expenditure has increased, when compared to the same period in the previous year, are an increase in total salary costs as a result of enterprise bargaining and an additional FBT charge in 2010-11 relating to 2009-10. Total administration costs, including depreciation, have increased overall by $91,000 or 1.64 per cent due to increases in building services and ICT costs but these have been offset in part by decreases in media services, domestic travel, overseas travel and photocopy charges. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998912"></A>
In terms of my own office, when compared to the same period in the previous year total expenditure has increased by $67,792 or 2.74 per cent. Increased expenditure of $113,309 occurred in salary costs related to enterprise bargaining increases and an additional FBT charge in 2010-11 relating to 2009-10. Total administrative costs, including depreciation, decreased overall by $45,517, with decreases in my office of media services, overseas travel and telephone costs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999013"></A>
I believe that this report clearly shows that ministerial expenditure is being maintained at reasonable levels in what have been tough economic times and I seek leave to table the document. </Hansard-Body>

(9.37 am): In these last two months our state has been through some terrible times and the rebuilding effort will rightly take much of our resources and efforts in the months ahead. But it is equally important to remember that our government was already building tomorrow’s Queensland, building a stronger Queensland, before these disasters struck and we are determined to maintain those efforts. </Hansard-Body>

Our record $17 billion capital building program means that projects continue to deliver jobs and real results all over our state. In that respect I am happy to report to the House that the first of two massive tunnel boring machines working on the Airport Link project is due today to break through into the enormous purpose-built Kedron caverns. This breakthrough is an important milestone for this massive project and it marks the halfway point of the tunnel boring machine’s two and a half kilometre journey underground from Kalinga Park to Lutwyche. Since its launch from Kalinga Park in July, Australia’s largest tunnel boring machine, known as Rocksy, has already excavated around 1,200 metres of tunnel. This is quite an achievement when one considers that this time last year these two 36,000 tonne machines were still in pieces yet to be assembled.Working around the clock, seven days a week, Rocksy and sister TBM Sandy, have progressed at rates of up to 110 metres a week. As these impressive machines dig the tunnels, they then line them with concrete segments as they go, considerably speeding up the construction process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002520"></A>
A total of 11,000 precast concrete segments have been used, and Rocksy and Sandy have excavated more than 2.2 kilometres. That means that 300,000 cubic metres of spoil have been generated and transported to Nudgee Road via a two-kilometre spoil conveyor. This is good news for the residents of the north side, with the conveyor eliminating almost 80,000 truck movements from the local streets, especially around the Clayfield area. The journey from Kalinga Park to Wooloowin has taken Rocksy underneath Kalinga and Melrose parks and under local streets in Clayfield and Wooloowin. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002525"></A>
I would like to congratulate the 22 workers from Rocksy’s tunnelling team. Tunnelling is a difficult and dangerous job, and the team is to be commended on its safe performance in the tunnels to date. Over nine kilometres of tunnelling have been completed across the project and almost 15 million hours have been worked. The projects have surpassed their expected employment-generating capacity, with jobs now totalling 3,600.</Hansard-Body>

By the middle of next year, Airport Link will provide six extra traffic lanes between Bowen Hills and Kedron and four additional lanes from Kedron to Toombul. Motorists will then be able to bypass up to 18 sets of traffic lights between the CBD and the airport, one of our major destinations. The Northern Busway, a major public transport project, will provide for 47,000 bus passenger trips every day by 2016--more than five times the current number of bus trips. These are just some of the congestion-busting solutions that we are providing for South-East Queensland as we build a stronger state. </Hansard-Body>

During the floods and again in the aftermath of Cyclone Yasi, not-for-profit organisations were on the front line, coordinating emergency assistance for thousands of families--blankets, toys and meals--or just being a reassuring voice. We all know what a terrific job our community groups have done in responding to the needs of others. Many from both sides of the chamber spoke about them in the motion debated in the House earlier this week. </A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1002537"></A>
What is less publicised is that many of these groups have themselves been directly impacted by floods. As is so often the case, not-for-profit organisations are often so busy looking after others that their own needs come second. Our government is determined to ensure that these community groups get the assistance they need to get back on their feet. That is why I wrote to the federal government requesting the activation of NDRRA funding for charitable businesses and not-for-profit organisations. I am pleased to advise the House today that this request has been agreed to and that NGOs in both flood and cyclone affected parts of Queensland will now be eligible to apply for category C grants of up to $25,000--in a similar category to small businesses and primary producers. In addition, charities and not-for-profit organisations will also be eligible under category C for concessional interest rate loans of up to $100,000 to help them get back on track. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002539"></A>
I have spoken to a number of people in this particular circumstance. I recall visiting the member for Toowoomba North in Toowoomba, where the mayor and I spoke to people from the Kath Dickson Family Centre whose centre was affected. They had lost a number of their toys and books and the equipment they use for running playgroups. Given that they run playgroups right down into the Lockyer Valley, I think everybody who knows their work would commend them for it. This is just one example of an organisation that will be able to benefit from these funds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002540"></A>
I hope that these funds will go some way to giving back what these organisations give out to us all so often. I ask members of the House to draw this to the attention of relevant non-government not-for-profit groups in their own electorates. </Hansard-Body>

Many will be reliving traumatic and terrifying events when they recount their personal stories to the commission. These are Queenslanders who have lost loved ones and lost homes and they are Queenslanders who come from communities that have been torn apart. </A></Hansard-Body>

Making submissions or providing evidence may be a prospect that, for some people, is simply too overwhelming on their own. That is why I am pleased to advise today that the Department of Communities will provide $300,000 to Lifeline to provide face-to-face support services to people who seek to appear before the inquiry or who are involved in the inquiry’s community consultation process. This will include help for those people who seek it to prepare submissions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002550"></A>
Lifeline has been chosen to deliver this vital service because it is independent of government, because it has a well-deserved reputation in local communities of providing support to people who need it when they need it most and because it is already working in many of the affected communities. In fact, Lifeline counsellors have already been out and about in disaster affected communities around Queensland, counselling and providing support. Six Lifeline counsellors will be deployed in Ipswich over this weekend, five will be deployed in the Lockyer Valley and two will be deployed in Dalby. This comes on top of thousands of contacts already made by phone and outreach visits into the affected communities over the past month. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1002551"></A>
Leading Queensland to recovery following unprecedented natural disasters is without doubt a very big job. Our government is committed to being there and helping until the job is done. That includes making sure that people have the emotional and social support they need at every stage of the process. Our recovery will be measured not only by rebuilt buildings but also by communities, families and lives that are restored to wellbeing. We hope that this service will help in some cases for those people who need it. </Hansard-Body>

(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (9.46 am): Yesterday I outlined to the House the economic and fiscal pain we can expect from the summer’s floods and Cyclone Yasi. These are disasters that will take years, not mere weeks or months, to recover from. The government’s message to all, however, is clear: Queensland remains open for business. </Hansard-Body>

Not only will our traditional strengths of mining and agriculture recover and recover at pace; new industries--the industries of the future--will also continue to blossom over time. To that end, today I can announce that Queensland has secured a major new investment with a new solar equipment manufacturing facility to be built on the Gold Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002562"></A>
Eco-Kinetics, a leader in solar manufacturing in this country, will build a cutting-edge manufacturing facility that could well be the first of its scale in Australia. The facility will produce locally assembled photovoltaic modules and manufacturing mounting kits that will help feed society’s growing hunger for solar technology. Eco-Kinetics will build the facility at Stapylton, with support through the Queensland Investment Incentive Scheme. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002563"></A>
We have a clear interest in supporting alternative energy industries. The government has long supported solar as a critical power source for the present and the future. Secondly, this is an investment that will see real jobs growth. Eco-Kinetics believes that this will create 244 full-time jobs between now and 2015. That is the government in action, securing new investment and new jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002564"></A>
Our action today stands in contrast to a report this morning which takes a somewhat arbitrary look at the state’s fiscal settings. The report itself acknowledges that its assessment is made as at 30 June last year--before the dividends of our fiscal reform program had been received. As outlined in last month’s midyear fiscal and economic review, the government’s balance sheet restructuring has seen projected debt reduced by $10 billion. Given the report’s selected time frame, it fails to incorporate this benefit. A proper contemporary assessment would. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002565"></A>
I do not accept the report’s conclusions on tax competitiveness. The midyear review also detailed that Queensland’s tax per capita is $2,136--$500 below the average of the other states, which tax $2,636 per capita. The independent Commonwealth Grants Commission’s last assessment concluded that our taxation burden was below the national average. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002566"></A>
The government acknowledges that out state was hit harder than any other state by the global financial crisis and has since been dealt the twin blows of the summer floods and Cyclone Yasi. There are challenges, and we are determined to meet them head-on. But make no mistake: Queensland’s economic and fiscal fundamentals are strong and our future is bright. We said that we would prioritise jobs, investment and our building program and invest in new industries like solar. That is exactly what we are doing today--just like we said we would. </Hansard-Body>

The Building Services Authority--the mighty Building Services Authority--announced last week that it is conducting 17 seminars and shopping centre information booths to help homeowners and tradespeople rebuild homes. The seminars and information booths are in flood damaged cities and towns including Ipswich, Gatton, Emerald, Rockhampton, Dalby and Brisbane. The seminars will give information about when repair work should start, choosing a licensed contractor, the importance of homeowners signing contracts and of home warranty insurance, dealing with asbestos, and building planning and approvals. Similar BSA seminars will be announced for Far North Queensland and other centres in the near future. </Hansard-Body>

A $20 million high school is being built at Murrumba Downs, a primary school at Bundilla and a primary school at Mango Hill--both funded under the $1.1 billion public-private partnership project. All three are currently in the late planning or early construction phases. They will provide students and families in these areas with more options for a world-class education. In addition, the Mer Island campus of Tagai State College is being relocated to a greenfield site on Mer Island.

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002640"></A>
These new schools are in addition to the eight new and relocated schools open for the first day of the 2011 school year.

(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Infrastructure and Planning) (9.54 pm): Plainly the first priority of this government is to rebuild Queensland in the wake of recent natural disasters.

So I am pleased to announce that the draft terms of reference for Adani Mining’s Carmichael coalmine and rail project have been released for public comment. This project is the fifth coalmining project proposed for the Galilee Basin, which is the last undeveloped coal resource in Queensland and is likely to become the state’s largest coal-producing region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002668"></A>
Projects previously announced include Kevin’s Corner and Alpha Coal by Hancock Prospecting, South Galilee Coal by AMCI and Alpha Coal Pty Ltd, and Galilee Coal by Waratah Coal Pty Ltd. Together, these projects and the associated rail and port infrastructure facilities involve capital expenditure of $33 billion. This is great news for the economy and jobs creation, with the potential for 20,000 new jobs during construction and approximately 10,000 operational jobs. This is a massive part of the Coordinator-General’s program of projects under assessment, now totalling $57.8 billion--38,100 estimated construction jobs and 18,600 ongoing jobs, mainly in regional Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002674"></A>
The Bligh government will also help to prepare the community for this growth. We will develop a Galilee Basin economic and social impact study which will be used by state government agencies, local councils and other organisations to help the region prepare and manage the impact of these projects. We are also working on plans for common user water and power infrastructure to deliver these essential services to the Galilee Basin. The development of the Galilee Basin as a major centre for coalmining, processing and exporting is important to the future economic prosperity of Queensland, and it puts us firmly back on the track to economic recovery. </Hansard-Body>

In November last year the Bligh government made a commitment to increase the enforcement capability and to focus resources through the creation of a one-stop LNG enforcement unit. Today we are delivering on that commitment. I am pleased to advise the House that Mr Andrew Brier has been appointed to establish and have overall management responsibility for this new unit, which will comprise multidisciplinary specialists tasked with monitoring this emerging growth industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002687"></A>
Mr Brier will be in charge of developing strategic compliance plans that include proactive and spot investigations, as well as monitoring the compliance reporting required of the industry. The unit will also investigate formal complaints from landholders and lead prosecutions where investigations provide evidence of wrongdoing. The unit includes environmental and groundwater experts, who will form part of the team monitoring environmental impacts, water quality and pressures, and will ensure environmental authority conditions are strictly adhered to. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002691"></A>
This team will also work closely with the Queensland Water Commission in monitoring bores across the Surat region. Additional petroleum and gas safety inspectors also form part of the team. They have the important task of making sure this industry operates safely, both for its own workers and for the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002693"></A>
Our mining registrars are also a valuable support to landholders and will be called on to ensure industry meets its land access obligations. They also will be available to help resolve impasses in access and compensation negotiations as an alternative to the matter being taken to court. The team is backed by the full policy and operational machinery of supporting departments, including DERM and DEEDI. In short, this team is equipped with the power and the resources to make sure this emerging industry adheres to its legislative and moral obligations to the Queensland community. </Hansard-Body>

Despite the floods and cyclone, the majority of our big projects are on time, on track and on target. The Bruce Highway upgrade between Sankeys Road and Traveston Road is on track for completion in June next year. The Douglas Arterial duplication in Townsville is on schedule. The Townsville Port Access Road will be up and running at the end of next year as planned. The Griffith Arterial Road and the intersection upgrade of Mains and Kessels roads is still scheduled for completion by June 2014.

Main Roads has embarked on the biggest reconstruction job in its history.

Today I can announce that a study has been completed on the Fitzroy River flood plain. I commend the members for Keppel and Rockhampton for being the driving force behind this study. It could not have come at a better time. For the first time, we are asking the community to look at the formal options on the table.

Our port is crucial to Queensland’s economy. Port Connect alone will generate more than 800 jobs and support thousands more for decades to come. Port Connect will see a four-lane extension and a duplication of the motorway all the way through to Port Drive. It has always been our hope to deliver a full four-lane upgrade, and now we are able to do it for significantly less money than first forecast. It is about value for money and it is about planning for and managing growth in Queensland, even in the toughest of times. </Hansard-Body>

Right now, teams of rangers are out in the water in the Great Barrier Reef working with scientists from CSIRO, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and other research partners conducting reef health surveys across the area hit by Cyclone Yasi. Around 350 sites will be inspected to look at coral damage and marine health.

This morning I am advised that the first series of surveys, conducted this week, has already found damage to coral reefs and, in some places, green algae covering the coral.

Very importantly, in the discrete communities there is a massive housing build underway. In its first year, the Remote Indigenous Land and Infrastructure Program Office has made major strides through much needed township-wide land surveying and town planning schemes. In fact, currently 13 land use planning schemes are underway. The program office is also on target with Main Roads to deliver draft road network surveys--in fact to be available in March--for Aurukun, Doomadgee, Napranum, Mornington Island, Pormpuraaw, Woorabinda and Wujul Wujul.

With much of Queensland recovering from the recent floods and cyclones, we need all hands on deck to get back on track.

South-West Queensland already boasts attractions such as the Cosmos Centre and the Charleville Bilby Experience, and these products can be built upon and promoted. As with other regions in Queensland, one of the challenges facing the south-west region is to turn around the incorrect perception that all of Queensland is a disaster zone.

Under CoastConnect, public transport will become more reliable--buses will have their own space in the transport network; it will be more rapid, with significant travel time savings, making the bus a more attractive option than the private car; it will be more comfortable, with new bus stations being built at Maroochydore, Kawana, Currimundi and Caloundra and improvements being made to more than 70 bus stops; and it will be more accessible, with additional stops, more accessible locations and feeder bus services to main transport routes.</Hansard-Body>

I thank the Sunshine Coast community for its valuable input into shaping this plan. Government has listened. Throughout the development of CoastConnect we have incorporated community feedback in a number of ways, including minimising impacts on Alexandra Parade and Aerodrome Road, as the member for Maroochydore sought for us to do, increasing car parks and fast-tracking the Maroochydore bus station. Over $13 billion has been allocated to boost public transport and cycling infrastructure on the Sunshine Coast over the next 20 years as part of the South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program.

Asbestos experts have also been deployed in Far North Queensland to help residents, employers and councils manage the risks posed by asbestos during the clean-up. A special hotline--1800177717--has also been set up to provide advice about asbestos safety. These initiatives are designed to assist flood and cyclone affected communities and are part of the Bligh government’s commitment to helping victims recover from these disasters as quickly as possible. </Hansard-Body>

As many members have commented during the week, while these disasters have caused devastation across Queensland, the Queensland spirit has been strengthened and the response of individuals and communities has been courageous and heroic. </A></Hansard-Body>

The Premier has previously announced that Queensland Week this year will be extended--it will run from 4 June to 13 June--and will be dedicated to the heroes and everyday volunteers of the disasters and recovery. Events will be held across Queensland to recognise these individuals and, given the significance of these ceremonies and their importance to communities, members of parliament should be able to be in their electorates to participate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006165"></A>
Therefore, I wish to advise the House that the budget sitting week, which was scheduled to occur at the same time as Queensland Week, will be postponed by one week to commence on Tuesday, 14 June. The government considered the option of rescheduling budget week to be a week earlier than Queensland Week. However, that would have meant that the House would sit for the regional parliament in Mackay and that that sitting week would be immediately followed by budget week. This was considered to be impracticable with respect to prebudget planning. A memo outlining the revised sitting dates for the first part of 2011 will be distributed to members shortly. </Hansard-Body>

Unfortunately, in my speech I referred to these people as people who often do the wrong thing. I was wrong. The people I named are the volunteer leaders at the drop-in centre and not clients of the centre. I apologise to these people for this mistake. </A></Hansard-Body>

Tourism plays an important role in regional Queensland, with potential economic, social and environmental benefits if managed correctly. Grey nomads make up a specific niche market that caters towards older travellers, and this market is only likely to increase as Australia’s population ages. Although grey nomads appear to spend less per day than other tourists, they tend to take longer holidays and spend time in regional areas. For some small rural and regional communities, grey nomads are likely to be very important tourists.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006213"></A>
In order to manage and grow this tourism market, the committee made a number of recommendations, including the Queensland government offering marketing support to local councils to help council officers develop their skills marketing to this group, making available grant funding to regional tourism organisations outside South-East Queensland for the purpose of marketing attractions to grey nomads and investigating the benefits of employing grey nomads in social service areas such as child protection and community corrections.</Hansard-Body>

 (10.30 am): My first question without notice is to the Premier. Yesterday the Premier was asked to release all documents provided to state cabinet, along with the minutes of the meeting relating to the briefing on 18 October 2010 by the Bureau of Meteorology warning of multiple natural disasters. The Premier responded stating, ‘I do not see any problem with that being made public.’ Will the Premier now publicly release for Queenslanders the minutes and the cabinet documents as she undertook to do yesterday? </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1006304"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I am happy to advise the House that the material that was presented by the Bureau of Meteorology to cabinet on 18 October was posted on my website at six o’clock this morning and has now been available for about five hours. As I indicated yesterday, the material is made up extensively of Bureau of Meteorology website material. In fact, everything that was presented to the cabinet was already available either on the Bureau of Meteorology site or on other weather sites, with the exception of one document which is listed as ‘embargoed’ and it was released the following week by the bureau. It was presented to the cabinet while it was still being refined and on 26 October it was put on the website. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006308"></A>
What was the conclusion of the bureau’s presentation? The conclusion was that we could ‘expect with some degree of confidence a fairly active cyclone season and a continuation of the above-average rains and associated flooding’. We were advised that we could expect up to six cyclones. What did I do with that information? I issued a press release on the same day in which I said that the bureau had told cabinet ministers that Queensland could experience up to six cyclones and well above average rainfalls. I went on to say that we had not seen predictions for up to six cyclones since the 1970s, that there was a 75 per cent chance we would experience much higher than average rainfall and that we were actively heeding those warnings. I table that for the benefit of the House.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006311"></A>
I then held a press conference on this issue which was attended by all media outlets. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006313"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, and I secretly told an entire media gallery that the last time these sorts of weather patterns were observed was in the mid-1970s and that the bureau was warning not only of a higher risk of cyclones but of a significantly higher risk of intense levels of rainfall and monsoonal activity right across the coast coming down as far as the south-east. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006315"></A>
What happened? What did the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
, the national broadsheet, report on page 3 the next day? It reported, secretly on page 3, that Australians along the coastline faced a summer of double the number of tropical cyclones, heavy rainfall and warm wet conditions. You could find the same in other newspapers--on the front page of the <Hansard-Italic>
Queensland Times</Hansard-Italic>
, ‘Be warned. Huge flood is overdue’; the <Hansard-Italic>
Cairns Post</Hansard-Italic>
, ‘Prepare for the worst’; the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
, ‘Braced for stormy time’; and the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
, ‘State on full alert for storm season’. Every one of them were quoting me, quoting the bureau and quoting the material that had been provided to the cabinet. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006323"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. What we have seen in these unprecedented floods that took rivers to unprecedented and record highs right across the south-east and right across other parts of the state is that buildings have been located in less than desirable places. This is not the only one. You will find that councils have done the same thing. You will find schools and buildings where, frankly, governments of all political persuasions in the last 40 years have forgotten some of the lessons of 1974 and forgotten some of the lessons of the floods in regional Queensland prior to 1974.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006324"></A>
What is the challenge for us as a government, as a community and as a state? It is to learn those lessons and to remember them. That is one of the reasons we have a commission of inquiry and it is one of the reasons we are setting up a Queensland Reconstruction Authority--so that any lessons that need to be learned can be learned. Mr Speaker, the clock was not on but I think I have said as much as needs to be said. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006330"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. The honourable member, along with I think about 11 other members of the House, today celebrates the 10th anniversary of her election as a member of parliament in 2001, so I congratulate the 2001 members who are here. It has been a decade of great achievement by them. A number of them were cruelly referred to in their first term as ‘oncers’ and they are still sitting here 10 years later, so well done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006331"></A>
As I said earlier this morning, as we rebuild and recover from these disasters, one of the challenges will be to ensure that we do not take our eye off the ball when it comes to the other responsibilities and the other priorities of our government. We are a government that is absolutely committed to the power of education to transform lives, and nowhere in the education system is that more true than in the early years of education. For a range of historical reasons, the last 50 years of the last century saw Queensland underinvest in those early childhood years, particularly in comparison to other states and, in some cases, councils and local governments in other states of Australia. We are determined to overcome that legacy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137833"></A>
That is why we made a $321 million election commitment to build 240 new kindergartens right across the state. We are now rolling those out. Fourteen new services opened for the 2011 school year and three more are scheduled to open this year, building on the six last year. I am very pleased to advise that the program is now starting to ramp up and the latest 28 services have been approved. I table that list for the benefit of the House.</Hansard-Body>

I am sure the whip will be pleased to know that both Highland Reserve State School and Mount Warren Park, which are both in her electorate, will be homes to two new kindergartens in the 2012 year. All of these services are in areas of high demand: from Cairns to the Gold Coast and in places like Mackay, Rockhampton, Bundaberg, Gladstone, Bribie Island, Beaudesert, Springfield, Logan and Bowen. These are all places which have not had the services that families there need and we are going to rectify it. We are going to rectify it because we understand that investment in early childhood education is an investment in our children but it is also an investment in the long-term prosperity and strength of our economy and state. Dollars spent in this area repay taxpayers over and over and over again for many decades to come. We are determined to continue to roll out those kindergarten services. </Hansard-Body>

Natural Disasters, Legal Costs</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Premier. I refer the Premier to the mounting legal costs for government departments and agencies as they prepare to defend themselves for government decisions relating to the floods. Will the Premier give an undertaking to publicly release monthly updates on the internal and external legal costs incurred by each department and agency, along with the names of legal firms and practitioners engaged? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008725"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. Our government has established a commission of inquiry. I should point out that we established it four days after the Brisbane River peaked so I think it is probably one of the fastest established commissions of inquiry in our state’s history. We established that commission of inquiry because we share the questions of Queenslanders and we believe that they are entitled to answers to their questions. It is absolutely imperative to the safety and wellbeing of our state and the people who we represent here in this chambers that we ask those questions; not only ask those questions but also provide a forum with this inquiry that has all the powers necessary to get the answers to those questions. We understand that that can only be done with the full confidence of the public by a commission of inquiry with all the powers necessary to seek that information. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008726"></A>
In doing so, yes, government agencies will be called by the commission to present evidence. So they should be. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Local governments will be required to do the same. So they should be. There is no way that the commission of inquiry can do its work unless government agencies fully cooperate with it. Does that mean that some public servants will have to collate material for the inquiry? Of course it does. That is a good purpose; that is something that they should be doing. Does it mean that legal advice will be sought where appropriate? Of course it does. In every commission of inquiry ever held by either side of politics in Queensland every single time the full legal costs to government have been disclosed, and of course they will be on this occasion. Equally, it will be entirely evident which barristers or lawyers or firms are representing government because they will be at the inquiry. Some of them might be wearing bags over their heads or maybe secretly talking to the commission, but I do not expect so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008729"></A>
This is a deeply serious business. There are people who have lost their lives, people who have lost loved ones and people who have been through a deeply traumatic event who want answers to some of these questions. They need to have absolute confidence that this commission of inquiry will do its job and do it fairly, impartially and rigorously. I have absolute confidence in the people we have appointed. I have absolute confidence in their impartiality and their ability. I can give absolute confidence to the public that every single government agency over which I and our government have control will fully and totally cooperate with anything that the commission requires. That means giving evidence, that means providing documents, that means assisting in any way that we are requested to do so. Will all of the costs of that be made public? Of course they will be. They always have been.</Hansard-Body>

Mr O’BRIEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is also to the Premier. Could the Premier update the House on the policy of governing the state from the regions and the Premier’s excellent choice for the next region to benefit from this strategy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008734"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Cook. I believe that I have made an excellent choice in deciding that next week we will take the lessons from governing from Townsville to the wonderful city of Cairns. For four days next week I will be governing from Far North Queensland. I will be based in an office in the CBD of Cairns. I will be meeting with people from the Cairns city and the Cairns region. I think everybody knows that since the GFC Cairns has been one of the areas that has struggled to get back on its feet. Its tourism industry has been hit hard and its construction and property investment industry is still reeling. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008735"></A>
I have spent a lot of time with the business community in Cairns but far too often because of my obligations to be in other parts of Queensland I am in there for maybe a day and then out again. The opportunity to totally immerse myself by living and working in Cairns will give me the same chance that I believe I had in Townsville to really get a much deeper understanding and I look forward to the chance to do that. It will also, given all of the terrible misfortunes that have occurred in those towns to the south of Cairns, in the Cassowary Coast and Hinchinbrook regions, give me a chance to be located close to those places and to travel into them and spend a bit more time with the people and the mayor of that area than I have been able to do to date because of things like my parliamentary commitments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008736"></A>
I look forward to joining with the member for Cook and the other Cairns members. I know that a number of members have already made it their business to get a list of not only people who they are keen to get through my door to talk about their issues and concerns but also people who have actually got some good ideas and solutions that they would like to see the government pick up. I am very much looking forward to being there next week. I expect that it will be a busy time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008737"></A>
I should also note on behalf of all of the House that just as we have this week marked the devastation caused by Mother Nature across our state, it seems that few places in Australia are escaping the wrath of weather. As people who live in or love North Queensland, our thoughts today are with the people of Darwin and the Northern Territory as they battle their own stormy weather. Thankfully Cyclone Carlos does seem to have gone off the coast but not without battering the city of Darwin. There are many homes in Darwin that are today reported as inundated. Those of us who have been out to flooded cities and towns across Queensland know the heartbreak and the devastation and I will certainly be conveying that on behalf of Queensland to the chief minister, Paul Henderson, and his team and offering whatever assistance we can as they go through their own version of these events.</Hansard-Body>

Mr NICHOLLS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I refer the Treasurer to the most recent damning economic report, this time by the Centre for Independent Studies on state taxes, borrowings and spending--fiscal management. Given this report rates Labor’s fiscal management of Queensland as stone cold motherless last, will the Treasurer tell Queenslanders how he rates his own performance?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008745"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am aware of the study from the CIS. I am entirely sure that it is a centre and having looked through it I can call it a study; I am just not so sure that I would give it the moniker of being independent. The reality of this report is that it goes through the statements from the states as at 30 June last year. As I said in my address to the parliament earlier this morning, by using the arbitrary date of 30 June last year that just so happens to not include the significant dividends from the balance sheet restructuring that we have undertaken. The midyear update that the government has already released shows that our projected debt levels are, in fact, $10 billion lower than was projected at budget time. The challenge here for the report in its independence is that it is only out by a factor of $10 billion, but other than that I do accept its findings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008746"></A>
The reality is that this government made very clear decisions about what we would do in order to prioritise an infrastructure program and a capital works program to keep people in jobs, to keep regions moving and to keep industries moving through the global financial crisis. Yes, that put a great deal of stress on our balance sheet. Those facts are clear. But equally this government, while having the courage to make that decision, had the courage to put in place a program in order to balance that entry, in order to divest those things to ensure that the balance sheet had a position of strength and is returning to strength. The midyear update details that by a factor of, as I said, around $10 billion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008747"></A>
While this report takes a point-in-time analysis, I might say that I would look forward to the report from the centre for studies on 30 June next year. I presume at that time it will independently incorporate the facts of the matter, and that is what has been achieved over the last six months. Of course, what we do not know in this context is anything that the opposition would have done during this time because all it has been interested in doing for the last two years of this parliament is to oppose and to criticise without ever proposing and putting forward a policy. What have we seen so far as we look to rebuild the state’s economy? Have we seen any positive endorsement of Queensland business by those opposite? No, we have not. What we have seen is yet again a continuation of its campaign to talk down Queensland and our economy. Right now we need to stand above the politics. We need to rise above it. It is in everyone’s interests in this parliament and around the state to join together to advocate for the interests of Queenslanders, not to take a report which, as I detailed earlier today before question time, has a massive gap in its analysis. What we should be seeing from the opposition instead is a bit of positivity and a bit of proposing, not just criticism and opposing. </Hansard-Body>

Natural Disasters, Recovery Assistance</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008787"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs ATTWOOD:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development. Can the Treasurer update the House on assistance available to manufacturers and small businesses affected by the floods? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008789"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Mount Ommaney for her question and, indeed, for her strong advocacy for the businesses of her electorate. Her electorate, like mine, was significantly impacted by the floods. I know that a great deal of both the member’s residential and business community were massively affected by the floods. She contacted me in the immediate aftermath of the flood event on behalf of her local businesses. We were able to send out teams of people from the department of economic development and innovation in order to provide on-the-ground assistance out of the back of a van to businesses to ensure that they were able to access assistance. I thank the member for Mount Ommaney for her advocacy on their behalf. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008791"></A>
We now see more than 30 local government areas in which assistance is being provided to small businesses, including $5,000 immediate recovery grants plus a further $20,000 available in concessional loan arrangements. That is there to help small businesses, which are vital employers in the state, get up and running. That is a key mechanism to ensure that we keep small business moving. It is the engine room of employment. It is the engine room of any economy, and Queensland is no different. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008792"></A>
Manufacturing in particular has seen an impact from both the flood and the cyclone around the state, most particularly from the flood. Together with QMI Solutions, which has a well regarded reputation around the state and enjoys the support of both sides of the House, we will be conducting a range of clinics across the state, starting next Wednesday on Brisbane’s south side, to help out those businesses in the south-west corridor. We will be providing practical help about overcoming supply chain constraints, about equipment shortages and those things which can be a challenge for businesses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008795"></A>
We have also launched a new program to get the rest of Australia to help support Queensland. I encourage all members to log on to the Queensland government website. It is www.qld.gov.au/backinbusiness. Through social media, we are out there putting forward Queensland business to the rest of the country and, indeed, the world. We have prominent Queenslanders like the Young Australian of the Year, Jessica Watson, the Governor-General, Lydia Pearson and Pamela Easton and ‘king’ Wally Lewis, who are all providing testimonials through social media to encourage people to use Queensland businesses, holiday in Queensland, make a choice to access Queensland produce and to provide their support in their normal, everyday life. I encourage all members to log on to the site and circulate it through their own channels so we can get this campaign up in the social media through Facebook and other methods to ensure that all of Australia and, indeed, the people around the world, who have done so much to help out Queensland to date, can continue to help by making the simple choice of buying Queensland first, putting Queensland first. That is to the benefit of business. That is going to be to the benefit of the economy and to the benefit of all Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DOWLING:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to today’s report by The Centre for Independent Studies that specifically states that Queensland ‘is not in as strong a position to deal with the aftermath of the recent flood disaster as it would have been several years ago’. Given this independent finding, could the Treasurer advise to what extent economic mismanagement and squandering of the state’s finances will hinder the speed and the scale of recovery from the floods? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008807"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the shadow minister for his question and congratulate him on his appointment to the front bench. It seems that one of the qualifying criteria for joining the front bench of the LNP is to be a global financial crisis denier. The reality, of course, is that there was something that happened over the last couple of years. Yes, it was a global financial crisis. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition missed it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition completely missed it during the election campaign. At the end of last year he said that it happened a year later than it did, such was his denial of it. Of course, we have seen the member for Redlands rocket on to the front bench because he obviously has the rocket scientist approach to denying the global financial crisis. Of course there was a global financial crisis. No-one here or outside is denying that except for those on that side of the chamber. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008808"></A>
What happened is this. We took a view about prioritising the building program and we made decisions in order to position the state for an economic recovery. As I said, what was occurring yesterday? As I detailed yesterday, we saw business investment growing for two quarters--at a rate above the nation in the September quarter. Business was coming back. What have we seen? We have seen 18 months of jobs growth. We positioned this economy ready for a recovery. It was building towards the end of last year and building into this year, and what has occurred since then? Yes, there has been an intervening event over the Christmas period. That, of course, was going to knock the state back down. That report may well say that, but I cannot find an economy in the world that is in the same position that it was two and a half years ago before the global financial crisis. If the honourable member can say that no economy suffered any impact from the global financial crisis whatsoever, I would be glad to hear about it. I am sure he can ring the ‘centre for non-independent studies’ and get them to send him a note about what might have happened. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008809"></A>
However, as we have said many times before, yes, Queensland was impacted by the global financial crisis. We did take a big hit. We are the second most trade exposed economy in the nation. Of course it was going to impact on us more so than in other places around Australia and indeed around the world. What did this government do? It put in place a program to recover. That recovery was underway. The evidence about that is clear. I am equally confident that by this year’s end, according to the forecasts we have seen, this is an economy that will be hitting capacity constraints rather than suffering from a lack of demand. That is because we are going to see the sort of investment decisions that we have seen come home and build strength in the economy. We are going to see a reconstruction effort add to that. The Queensland economy deserves the support of the opposition and the LNP, not a campaign to talk it down. </Hansard-Body>

 Before I go any further I just want to assure the House that, further to my statement yesterday, we now have 25 day labour QBuild people and two qualified asbestos aid contractors on site at Tully Heads and Hull Heads to assist in the clean-up. That shows the advantage of having a day labour workforce. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008821"></A>
I thank the honourable member for her question and her interest in this matter coming from a cyclone affected area herself. I must congratulate the members in Townsville on the efforts that they put in during that cyclone recently. Having been there a couple of days later, I know it was a pretty horrific experience. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008823"></A>
One thing to take away from the experience is that the majority of buildings in North Queensland withstood this damage. So the advice for people to stay in their homes was, in fact, the best advice, especially if their home was built after 1980. That message went out very loudly and clearly and it turned out to be the right one because there has been no loss of life. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The fact that all of the buildings there survived proves that they are cyclone proof. The new buildings that were constructed under BER are included in that. Some of those are not suitable to be made into shelters. An $500 extra per square metre is what it costs to strengthen these buildings. I contend that we ought to be looking at the best possible options of how to do that, instead of going around and saying, ‘We’re going to build evacuation centres from Bundaberg through to the Torres Strait with money that we do not have.’ What an idiotic proposition that is. We saw the opposition leader up in North Queensland promising that the other day, but guess what? The members opposite are in here today asking about the budget. That seems of little interest to them when they go out big-noting themselves and talking about evacuation centres. It does not seem to matter that the money must come from somewhere. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>

Mr CRIPPS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Public Works. Yesterday the minister was asked if the government had delivered on its promise following Cyclone Larry to develop a construction timetable to build cyclone shelters within 100 days of the 2006 state election. The minister canvassed a number of issues, concluding that the government was now considering ‘whether we want to squander money on evacuation centres’ but did not commit to release the timetable. Will the minister now commit to publicly release, for the information of all Queenslanders, the promised 100-day timetable to build cyclone shelters in Queensland communities vulnerable to cyclones? </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1011441"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I think I just answered that question, but let us go through it again. The decision that was taken following Larry--and a promise was made--was that we would deliver, as part of our building program, the strengthening of buildings, and that has already happened. That has already happened, and within 100 days--I have a letter here somewhere that I wrote to the previous Premier that I will table that outlined exactly what we did in that regard. </Hansard-Body>

 He is doing a little bit better than his predecessor; that is true. The bottom line is that I did not say that the government was looking at this. I gave an opinion yesterday. I actually said that I had not discussed it with the Premier, but my view was that the common-sense approach that we ought to take to this is to have a look at the buildings that are there, evaluate with the emergency services people exactly what happened and see what we can make out of those buildings that are there. That is part of the promise that we made. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

The Commonwealth government did not want to come to the party in the BER stuff--fair enough. Had they been buildings that we built then they would have fitted into that mould--no problem.

I want to know what the budget allocation is for it. I want to know how much it is going to cost. You made the promise, not me. I want to know how much. The opposition leader was in Townsville last week promising this. I want to know how much it will cost. What I am offering, as a different point of view, is to look at the infrastructure that is there and strengthen it where need be--add toilets and showers to those buildings, for example. Do we need to go and talk to the private operators of the Earlville shopping centre and upgrade that somehow to make an evacuation centre out of it? There has been another crisis here, and we should learn from it. </Hansard-Body>

 I thank the honourable member for the question. Today is SchoolAid relief day right across not just Queensland but also Australia, led by non-government charitable organisation SchoolAid, which links a number of agencies encouraging support to staff and students of schools in disaster and related emergent circumstances. Indeed, after Cyclone Larry SchoolAid, through its initiatives, raised approximately $170,000 to assist the schools in Far North Queensland in response to that cyclone. </Hansard-Body>

This morning I had the privilege of attending Brisbane State High School to open a conference about spinal injury and raising awareness about spinal injury and to introduce internationally renowned Rick Hansen, whom the Premier spoke of in parliament on Tuesday, who at the age of 15 suffered a debilitating spinal injury and who has done remarkable things. There I discovered that Brisbane State High School has embraced the voluntary program of supporting schools and students through the relief day. A day or so ago the students there raised a significant sum of money to contribute to the Premier’s disaster relief fund. Today they joined with me in observing a minute’s silence, which is the second way in which schools are being invited to participate. Further, they had lowered the Australian, Queensland and ATSI flags to half-mast as a sign of respect for those families and those people who have lost loved ones in these disaster. That is happening right across Australia today. </Hansard-Body>

It is illustrating the breadth of community support for what is happening here in Queensland. That has happened on a number of other fronts. An 80-year-old lady in Sydney, because she had no money, sent three rugs that she had knitted to be given to schools for their first aid room for students. A lady in Stanthorpe went down to the local shop and purchased back-to-school gear, put it in her car and drove from Stanthorpe here to Brisbane to give it to OneSteel Pty Ltd to donate to schools. Tony Schreiber from one school--he does not want to be mentioned but I will mention him--filled up his car, drove to Condamine and delivered a load of gear to the Condamine school. He organised aircraft to do drops at a number of schools that were flood isolated. That is an illustration of what the community is doing. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1011488"></A>
In 2008, the minister himself reiterated this pledge ‘to hold annual summits at the end of the cyclone season’. Why did Labor, after Ms Bligh became Premier, cancel these vital summits in 2009 and 2010? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011490"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The summits were not cancelled. In fact, last year--I cannot recall the exact date--I think it was held in Townsville. It was jointly held on the last occasion with the Local Government Association of Queensland. The original commitment was to hold those conferences immediately following the cyclone season. I made a decision, in consultation with the department, that it would be far better to conduct those forums prior to the seasons, particularly gaining the experience of what had happened the year before. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011492"></A>
I do not have the date with me, but I can assure the member that a conference was held within the last 12 to 18 months and additional conferences will be held. The last one I attended was in fact I think up in the Burdekin region. That was held in cooperation with the local governments. A whole range of issues affecting emergency services personnel in responding to disasters were discussed. Indeed, local government has been the foundation of our disaster management system. That was a key focus at that particular conference. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011493"></A>
The member has raised issues about preparation for the cyclone season. I might just talk a little bit more about that, because local governments are in fact the foundation of our cyclone response. As I have indicated, since I have been minister there have been two of these forums held--and I will get those dates and locations to the member. I can assure the member that, following the briefing that was given to cabinet in October last year, there have been extensive preparations undertaken by state government departments, local governments and emergency services agencies to prepare for these disasters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011494"></A>
As the Premier has indicated, she secretly held a media conference to advise Queenslanders of what preparations had been undertaken and secretly put out a media statement advising that directors-general and ministers had been advised to make sure that their departments were ready. In fact, Emergency Management Queensland, in a very sneaky move, went around North Queensland and put up massive billboards advising people to prepare for the cyclone season. Every single year--</Hansard-Body>

Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It was a cunning plan. They did it in the middle of the night. They put these billboards up reminding people to be very careful and to seriously remind them about the need to prepare for cyclone season. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011497"></A>
Every single year the disaster management agencies and local authorities meet not just at this annual forum--and I will get the dates to the member--but also at workshops conducted by Emergency Management Queensland. Preparations are made to ensure that communities are prepared. Extensive media campaigns are undertaken. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Rural Fire Brigades</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<A ID="pgfId-1011546"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOOLIHAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is also to the Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services. Could the minister advise the House of any initiatives that are helping to enhance the great work done by rural fire brigades across the state? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011548"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Keppel for his question and acknowledge the great support that he provides to his local rural fire brigades. I particularly acknowledge that the brigades in the areas of the member for Keppel and the member for Rockhampton fought some of the worst fires in history in the Rockhampton region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011549"></A>
Many members might be surprised to know that the volunteers in our rural fire brigades actually play a very active role in responding to storm, cyclones and floods. The skills and expertise that rural fire brigade members have are transferable to helping respond and recover from not just fires or fighting fires but also responding to disaster events. For example, during the recent cyclone and floods I met up with many rural fire members. In Ingham I stayed at the same hotel as a large group of rural fire volunteers who were operating chainsaw teams to clear debris and support evacuation centres and the like. Those volunteers play a very important role in supporting all of the other emergency service agencies in responding to all types of disasters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011550"></A>
We have 34,000 volunteers in the rural fire brigades across Queensland. Around 10,700 of them are actually qualified as firefighters and many others support those activities. As I have said, as well as firefighting they do a range of support activities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011551"></A>
The number of rural firefighters has grown by more than 700 from December 2009 to December 2010. Today, the government is very pleased to announce the reallocation of some funding that was originally allocated to support what was expected to be a very severe bushfire season this year. We all know that we had one of the worst bushfire seasons on record in 2009. We expected a similar season this year. Because of all the rain it has not happened. Money that was allocated to support those operations--and a lot of additional money was allocated to aerial operations et cetera--has now been reallocated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011552"></A>
Of that, half a million dollars will go to station upgrades, $250,000 for additional equipment, $150,000 for GPS units to assist local identification of water supplies et cetera and around $50,000 for station wear uniforms. The rural brigades obviously get their protective equipment supplied but the station wear for formal occasions, which is very important to them, is being rolled out and the service will continue to do that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011553"></A>
In terms of the equipment they may purchase and upgrades to station amenities it may include solar systems, tanks, training rooms, new equipment such as generator kits, stand pipes, portable water dams, reversing cameras for fire appliances. All these pieces of equipment and upgrades will be available under this $900,000 plus program which has been reallocated from the allocation for fighting the fire season this year. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOPPER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland. I refer the minister to the milk price war between Coles and Woolworths and its likely impact on the sustainability of milk production and family farms in Queensland. Can the minister inform the House what actions he has personally taken to ensure that the supermarket turf war does not further harm the Queensland dairy industry which is already suffering greatly from the impact of recent floods and cyclone damage? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011559"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MULHERIN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. This is an issue that the member for Condamine and I are at one on. I have met with the Queensland Dairymen’s Organisation regarding this issue. The pricing of milk is a commercial issue. It is not generally government business since deregulation, but I am concerned about the likely impacts that it will have on our dairy farmers. Since deregulation I think there are about 600 producers producing 500 million litres of milk for Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011561"></A>
The price cuts for generic brand milk is driving more and more people away from the processor brands to the generic brands. This enables the larger supermarkets to put leverage on the processors. That is passed on to the milk producers, the dairy farmers. Over the last nine years we have seen about a 25 per cent shift away from the processed brands to the generic brands. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011562"></A>
Woolworths and Coles are saying that they will not be forcing the reduced price back on to the processor and the milk producer, the dairy farmer. This is really not the case. For example, under some of the contracts that dairy farmers have with Pauls the price is linked to the processor’s brand. As there is a shift more away from the processor’s brand that will drive the price down. Over time my concern is that we will have a situation where more and more people will move to the generic brand. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011563"></A>
What we need is a very transparent process. I understand there is also a Senate inquiry in relation to this matter. I have written to the federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry concerning the issues that I have raised this morning. I am waiting on a response from him. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1011567"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WETTENHALL:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships. Would the minister inform the House of any progress on fulfilling the Bligh government’s commitment to deliver land justice for the people of Mona Mona? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011569"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BOYLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I put on record that the member for Barron River has relentlessly pursued the resolution for the people of Mona Mona and their wish to be connected for all time to the future of the Mona Mona Reserve. It is spectacularly beautiful country, situated as it is adjacent to the World Heritage listed Wet Tropics area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011572"></A>
It was during the 2006 election campaign that the member for Barron River first brought Mona Mona’s interests to the fore, and the Bligh government committed to reexamining the future land tenure of this site. A proposal was developed, but it was not agreed. So in 2009 the Bligh government committed to getting the Mona Mona land sorted out once and for all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011573"></A>
Mona Mona itself has had a varied history. It was established as a Seventh-day Adventist Church mission in 1913. In 1957 it was re-gazetted by the Bjelke-Petersen regime for the purpose of building the Flaggy Creek hydroelectric dam. That led to the mission closing in 1962, with residents moving on to the communities of Hope Vale, Yarrabah, Palm Island and elsewhere. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011574"></A>
While the dam was never built and many people had moved out, a strong connection was retained to this beautiful place with its cultural significance. Over the past two years there has been extensive consultation with the Mona Mona people to ensure decisions about the future of this land reflected the best interests of all concerned. It has been critical throughout this process to ensure that the proposed lease conserves the social, cultural and environmental values and assets of the land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011575"></A>
I am pleased to report to the House that on 12 December a 30-year lease agreement was signed with Mona Mona Bulmba Aboriginal Corporation. I was especially delighted to be part of the celebrations alongside the member for Barron River that were led by chairman Andy Duffin and the Mona Mona elders and the Mona Mona Bulmba Aboriginal Corporation. They were huge celebrations of great emotional depth and significance to the people of Mona Mona. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011579"></A>
We have delivered nearly 1,600 hectares of land back to the people of Mona Mona. I am very pleased to report that the Mona Mona lease was then formally registered in the titles office on 31 January 2011. Most importantly, this outcome will ensure that elders and young people can maintain their sense of country and their sense of belonging now and for future generations. A new and significant chapter for Mona Mona people has begun.</Hansard-Body>

I refer the minister to his answer given to the member for Keppel and also correspondence I have received from valued community member Mr Hank Repard, who served for 27 years in the military before founding, joining and becoming the group leader of the SES at Woodgate and then he and his wife Pam becoming highly qualified members of the Rural Fire Service.

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011626"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Can the minister explain why qualifications gained while volunteering in either the SES or the RFS are not automatically recognised and interchangeable between both emergency Queensland services? Will the minister agree that if qualifications gained in the RFS were also recognised automatically in the SES it would strengthen both groups and stop the loss of good people who get sick of duplication, unnecessary red tape and waste?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011628"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am happy to look at that particular issue. I do not know the particular qualifications that the member is talking about, but, as most members in this chamber are aware, we have had nationally consistent accreditation of training courses in this country for many years. I would hope that, whether it be the Rural Fire Service or the SES or indeed any other organisation that is using nationally accredited modules and competencies, they would be transferable between agencies. So I do undertake to follow that issue up, because I think that is an important issue. If people are trained to use a chainsaw in the SES, they should be able to use it in the rural fire brigade. So I will follow that through.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011631"></A>
On that issue of training, both the Rural Fire Service and the SES commit a considerable amount of their resourcing each year to training of our volunteers. It is important to have people appropriately trained and appropriately accredited due to workplace health and safety requirements, not just for the operators but also for the people who might be nearby when those operations are taking place. I thank the member for the question and I will follow that up. I would hope that the transferability between both of those agencies is achievable. In fact, I know many members of the SES who are also members of the rural fire brigade, and we would hope that that consistency applies.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011633"></A>
I might just follow on from the question that the member for Noosa asked. With his first question to me as the shadow minister for emergency services, it is really disappointing that he got it so wrong. I would have hoped that he would have tried to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor--who got a lot of things wrong as well, but he did try hard to get the facts. I had to come into this chamber on many occasions to correct the record, because anything that came out of the mouth of the member for Mirani on emergency services issues needed to be very closely scrutinised to get to the truth.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011637"></A>
For the benefit of the member for Noosa, I put on the record that following that commitment I became minister in 2007. In April 2008 the Natural Disaster Summit--Building Resilient Communities was held in Townsville which emergency services agencies and councils attended. In 2009 the Natural Disaster Summit--Building Community Resilience Through Collaboration in partnership with the Local Government Association of Queensland was held in June in Emerald which I attended. In 2010 the Natural Disaster Summit--Disasters Just Happen But Building Community Resilience Does Not was held on 4 June in the Burdekin, as I indicated. That commitment that was given by former Premier Beattie has been continued with. In fact, that process has been strengthened by developing the program in consultation with the Local Government Association of Queensland, which is a very strong partner in responding to emergencies across the state.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011645"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LAWLOR:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. Just last week of course cabinet meet at Airlie Beach in the beautiful electorate of Whitsunday, and that is a good example of one of the problems that we have with tourism after these weather events. In Airlie Beach the weather was absolutely perfect, the sun was shining and there was a light breeze. But people were cancelling their holidays, and that is what we have to combat--the perception that Queensland generally is a disaster area. I stayed an extra day and met with many tourism operators and there was a common complaint against the media because of the idea that they wanted to persist with the description that it was ‘cyclone alley’. As one of the tourism operators explained to me, there has been no damage from a cyclone in Airlie Beach since 1970, so one could say that it is one of the safest areas of the state when it comes to any property damage.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011647"></A>
Following the cyclones and floods the Queensland tourism industry is back in business. Indeed, most tourism destinations have never been out of business. Resilient and resourceful operators across the state are ready to welcome visitors. Most operators affected by the floods and cyclones were back in business within just a few days, and I pay tribute to their determination and hard work to achieve this. To assist, the Bligh and Gillard governments have jointly committed $10 million in emergency funding to spread the message that Queensland is open for business and ready to welcome visitors. Further to this, Tourism Queensland has launched a five-year global incentive travel strategy aimed at putting Queensland on the map as one of the world’s top travel destinations. The strategy was launched at the Asia-Pacific incentives meetings and events convention in Melbourne this week to an audience of the world’s top incentive travel planners. The Asia-Pacific incentives meetings and events convention is a premiere meetings and incentives event for the Asia-Pacific region and it draws event planners from all around the world to discover the latest ideas, to network and to do business.</Hansard-Body>

 Incentive travel is one of the most lucrative travel markets based on unique experiences that are used as rewards for companies’ top-performing staff. I hear the shadow minister say, ‘How much funding?’ He verballed Daniel Gschwind yesterday. I have actually spoken to Daniel Gschwind, who rang me, and you should talk to him about the furphy that you put around about him demanding $50 million.</Hansard-Body>

CityCat Terminals</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr EMERSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Premier. I refer the Premier to the damage caused to CityCat terminals in my electorate, including the major terminal at the University of Queensland, resulting from the floods caused by the release of water from Wivenhoe Dam. Will the Premier publicly release for Queenslanders all documents forwarded to the federal government seeking a special circumstance ruling that would immediately release funding for the Brisbane City Council to rebuild these vital CityCat terminals?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011673"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I answered a very similar question yesterday, and I am sorry that he was not listening. I have not sent documents. What I have done is met personally with the Prime Minister and, as a result of that meeting, established a working party between federal Treasury officials and state Treasury officials, and done so for a very good reason. There is no precedent for these sorts of facilities to be included in natural disaster relief arrangements, so we have to work through what sorts of facilities would be included in any definition of a change, what the implications of that would be, what the costs would be et cetera.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011675"></A>
Those discussions have been entered into by the Commonwealth with a great deal of goodwill and we are systematically working our way through them. I, however, do share the shadow minister’s concern about the CityCat terminals. They are a very important part of the public transport network of our capital city and, like him, I want to see them up and running as soon as possible. To that end, this is a good example--and I think we have waived the anticipation rule so I can talk about this--of how the Queensland Reconstruction Authority could actually help make that happen faster. Without the Reconstruction Authority and the powers available to it--and I think there are some seven CityCat terminals that are inoperable--the city council would have to submit to the department of environment, to the department of resource management and to the department of transport seven separate applications for seven separate approvals in seven separate environments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011685"></A>
Under this legislation they could present a plan, we could declare each of those as reconstruction areas and require decisions to be made within a dedicated time frame for each of them. This is an opportunity, I accept, for the city council. Each of these CityCat terminals has been developed over a number of years. This is a unique opportunity for them to look at everything that they have learned about what makes a good CityCat terminal over the past 15 years and rebuild to a higher and better standard that is more uniform and that will add something to the aesthetics of the cityscape. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011687"></A>
I certainly want to see the CityCats back and operational. I understand just how important they are not only to the city council but to everyone who lives in the city and to everyone who visits it, because without them it puts more pressure on our bus and other public transport systems, including rail. I can reassure the House that the work that is being done is serious work. As I said, it is work that is being done in a spirit of goodwill and cooperation and I think a little patience would not hurt. </Hansard-Body>

That the bill be now read a second time.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018611"></A>
The Fair Trading Inspectors Bill 2011 represents the Bligh government’s ongoing commitment to a fairer and safer Queensland by protecting consumers and promoting a competitive, fair and informed marketplace. The bill does this by providing a stand-alone act which provides harmonised and consolidated inspectorate provisions for investigating, monitoring, and enforcing compliance with fair trading legislation. These inspectorate provisions deal with the appointment, powers and responsibilities of Office of Fair Trading inspectors, as well as offences relating to their exercise of power. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018612"></A>
Effectively, the bill establishes that there is a spectrum of enforcement powers available to the Office of Fair Trading, ranging from least to most intrusive, relative to the seriousness of the potential breach. It is not intended, for example, that search and entry provisions be used to settle a dispute over a refund between a trader and a consumer. On the other hand, where there are serious and systemic breaches afoot, the bill provides for immediate and substantial powers that can protect consumers from suffering substantial losses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018613"></A>
The bill implements recommendations made by two separate reviews, the first being a 2002 internal review of the Fair Trading Act 1989, with the second being a 2007 review of the then Department of Tourism, Fair Trading and Wine Industry Development by the former Service Delivery and Performance Commission. Both reviews identified that there were inconsistencies in the inspectorate provisions contained in fair trading legislation, and that there was no substantive reason for the inconsistencies. Additionally, the bill is consistent with moves at the state and federal level to harmonise legislative provisions, creating an environment in which inspectors and traders alike are left in no doubt as to what enforcement actions are possible and appropriate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018614"></A>
The bill provides common inspectorate provisions for the following acts, which are referred to in the bill as ‘primary acts’: Funeral Benefit Business Act 1982, Introduction Agents Act 2001, Land Sales Act 1984, Manufactured Homes (Residential Parks) Act 2003, Residential Services (Accreditation) Act 2002, Retirement Villages Act 1999, Second-hand Dealers and Pawnbrokers Act 2003, Security Providers Act 1993, Tourism Services Act 2003, Travel Agents Act 1988.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018615"></A>
The bill will also apply to the proposed new acts which repeal and split the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000 into industry-specific acts. As members would recall, on 24 November last year I introduced the Agents Financial Administration Bill, the Commercial Agents Bill, the Motor Dealers and Chattel Auctioneers Bill and the Property Agents Bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018616"></A>
The bill represents a harmonisation and consolidation of the inspectorate provisions contained in fair trading legislation and has been drafted using the most recent precedent provisions developed by the Office of the Queensland Parliamentary Counsel. These precedent provisions have been developed to have sufficient regard to fundamental legislative principles. This is an acknowledgement of how critical it is to ensure that inspectorate provisions are exercised appropriately and with sufficient regard to the severity of the situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018617"></A>
Members should note that the Office of Fair Trading does not merely investigate and prosecute breaches of legislation. It also proactively monitors and ensures compliance with the legislation, for instance, by conducting spot checks and requesting information and documents from traders. In fact, in 2009-10 the Office of Fair Trading monitored over 11,870 entities for compliance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018618"></A>
The bill therefore contains powers to enter and search places, obtain documents and information, obtain offence related and monitoring warrants, and seize and forfeit evidence. These powers essentially continue those currently available to Office of Fair Trading inspectors across fair trading legislation. The bill also introduces a new power for inspectors to stop vehicles, which is naturally required if inspectors are to be able to search vehicles. The power to stop and search vehicles is necessary as vehicles are just as likely to contain evidence as places, particularly for itinerant traders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018619"></A>
In order to strike an appropriate balance between generic enforcement provisions and specialisation, a schedule to the bill contains provisions which modify the common provisions in the body of the bill for certain primary acts. Finally, the bill repeals the inspectorate provisions in the primary acts and makes the necessary consequential amendments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018620"></A>
By addressing inconsistencies and providing a stand-alone act dealing with the appointment and powers of inspectors, the bill should improve the enforcement and compliance activities of the Office of Fair Trading. The Fair Trading Inspectors Bill 2011 represents the Bligh government’s ongoing commitment to protecting consumers and promoting a competitive, fair and informed marketplace. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110217_113734" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL">Mr DOWLING </A></Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Redlands--LNP) (11.37 am): Today I rise to speak to the Queensland Reconstruction Authority bill 2011. This bill seeks to amend six acts: the Building Act 1975, the Disaster Management Act 2003, the Integrity Act 2009, the Land Valuation Act 2010, the Public Service Act 2008 and the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971. I am not entirely clear why the amendment to the Building Act 1975 has been proposed. Could it be because of the impossible deadlines that were set only some six months ago in relation to the pool fencing legislation--something that was echoed here in this House? I am also not sure--and when you read it, it is ambiguous to a point--whether this amendment applies immediately right across the state. Obviously, these questions will come out in the course of the consideration in detail. Why would the amendment relate to communities that have not been affected--areas like mine, for instance? Redland City was unaffected by flood. This pool safety initiative was heralded by the government as a must-do thing to preserve life at all costs. The Redland community has not been affected in any way, shape or form by the floods other than through their generosity. Why would that community be in this deferred plan for pool compliance. It also begs the question about communities like the Gold Coast, which was not affected, and the Sunshine Coast, which was largely not affected. It throws up some questions and I suggest to the House that it could relate to the impossible deadlines that were set back then and the lack of a capacity for communities to comply. </Hansard-Body>
<DIV>

</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018675"></A>
The second amendments I have questions about--and, again, it is probably more about the process--are the amendments to the Land Valuation Act from a UCV to a site based valuation. Again, I believe there were some impossible deadlines and that that is primarily why these amendments have been included with this bill. I would also question again why it involves communities like Redlands, the Gold Coast and a number of other communities around Queensland which were not affected, which had no flood issues and which had no properties involved. Why has it been moved out unnecessarily for these councils? These councils rely upon these valuations to determine their rate base, their strategy and their budget. It raises questions about the broad, sweeping nature of some of the conditions within this legislation as well as some of the more specific ones.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018680"></A>
The LNP will be supporting this bill because the bill is an essential step towards restoring Queensland’s flood affected communities--or at least that is the intent. While it is not a perfect bill and it is not a response without risk, it is a response. More importantly, we have a responsibility to our communities. They need the reassurance of this parliament that the recovery effort is underway and is being done in a cohesive and bipartisan way. As outlined by the Leader of the Opposition during his condolence motion, we have a higher responsibility now, in the period post the floods and during the recovery, to ensure that no-one is left behind. I recognise that the Premier spoke about this in her second reading speech, when she said that our message to Queensland is that no part of Queensland will be forgotten. That is important as we go forward, so I recognise that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018681"></A>
Communities that have been through this trauma need to know that we will rebuild and we will protect them. They need to believe that lessons are being learned from the floods and the cyclones, and they need that bipartisan commitment that we will assist them. In the last couple of days we have spoken in this House about the grief that has struck at the heart of our communities and our state. We have heard harrowing recollections and we have saluted the courage and bravery of everyday Queenslanders who have made us proud. We now need to show action. We need to make a start on building a better Queensland--a stronger Queensland and stronger communities--from the debris and the wreckage. This bill is an effort in that direction. It is one step and it must be accompanied by the commitment of this government to listen to criticism, to improve on its performance, to measure its achievements and to learn from its failings.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018682"></A>
The commission of inquiry is underway and its first report is due in August. Under this legislation, the authority has no role in the hindsight issues of floods and cyclones. Its job is to rebuild; it is not to provide blame nor exoneration. That is rightfully the role of the commission. It was, however, of concern to me when reading the explanatory notes to this bill that one of the authority’s functions will be the ‘possible implementation’ of the commission’s recommendations. If we do not learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it. Answers are needed and answers will come. When they do, our communities deserve to hear them and they deserve a response to them. The implementation of the recommendations of the commission will be core to that response.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018683"></A>
A recovery effort does not need escape clauses. It needs the government to front up to its responsibilities. There is no point in having a commission if the government intends to ignore its findings. I am pre-empting the findings, but I believe that an issue that will be spoken about is advance warnings. When I travelled through some of the west country, through Cecil Plains and that area, I heard from farmers, locals and business operators that the river warning systems along those rivers are inadequate in some areas and non-existent in others. That advance warning system is critical if we are to do anything towards preserving life and making communities immune to flood. Those types of issues need to be addressed in the creeks, waterways and rivers right across Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018686"></A>
There will be questions about the management of Wivenhoe, both generally and on the day. I suspect there will even be questions about how the Wivenhoe management strategy has been able to change post the flood as compared to pre the flood. There will be questions about insurance--how this government manages its own insurance issues and how insurance companies behave and perform within our community. There will be questions about flood immunity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018687"></A>
The flood mitigation measures will have to be implemented quickly, in time for next summer. The first findings of the commission will be released in August, in a preliminary report. That leaves very little time for the authority to act to implement any strategies. I also note that the authority has been given the responsibility for facilitating flood mitigation. While it is necessary, it is of concern that these responsibilities have been so freely and happily handed over to the authority.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018688"></A>
While this is a time for compassion, support, recovery and rebuilding, it is not a time for the government to escape responsibility for its neglect. Floods are not a new occurrence in this state of Queensland. The devastation wrought in the last few months is not an opportunity for a handover of forgotten responsibilities. Previous disasters have brought torrents of promise and commitments. Unfortunately, we have seen many of those discarded with the debris, forgotten soon after the houses were rebuilt and the communities were re-established. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018689"></A>
The aftermath of Cyclone Larry is a case in point. So much that should have been learned from Larry has again been shown up in Cyclone Yasi to the detriment of Queensland communities. The greatest result this bill can deliver is effective assistance and rebuilding. The worst is a jungle of bureaucracy, buck-passing and conflict between levels of government and departments. My fear is that the layers of bureaucracy already evident in this legislation will slow down the process, will divert resources from those in need and will make the rebuilding a saga to be endured rather than a process to be enjoyed. This is part of the reason that a separate ministry for recovery and reconstruction is required. The priority for the state is the reconstruction, and that needs the dedication of a minister who can concentrate solely on the important task--someone who can be devoted to ensuring communities and individuals get back on their feet. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018691"></A>
The priority for this state will be to act as quickly as possible and to keep the bureaucratic impositions and processes to a minimum. The factor in this is cooperation between the levels of government, yet the authority has overriding powers in the legislation. While the need is evident, my hope is that those powers will be used cooperatively and not confrontationally.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018692"></A>
Our councils have been battered; they have been as battered as the communities they represent. They deserve the support of the government and not the Big Brother approach of dictating directives. The government has a record of telling communities what is best for them instead of listening to the voices of the communities. This is a good opportunity for the government to change its approach and start listening to what our communities need. Never has it been more evident than in the accolades given to local authorities the length and breadth of Queensland because of the way their mayors and councillors stepped up to the plate and worked in partnership with the emergency services and police and delivered on the ground. I think they have demonstrated that they have the capacity and the ability and that they are willing, so they should be very involved in that process. Instead of sidelining communities and decisions which affect them, it is time the government realised and learned from the experience and common sense that those people possess. Their input is to be valued.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018722"></A>
The legislation before us gives the minister a number of powers of oversight and intervention. There is a great onus on the responsible minister to utilise those powers wisely without being political. The communities that will emerge from the rebuilding need to be a sign of the respect and consideration that is owed to their residents. The rebuilding is not a memorialisation of government or the Premier; it is a chance to give our communities the best possible future and to provide them with a safer place to live, better infrastructure and economic re-establishment. The economy in smaller communities particularly is essential. If we do not get those businesses functioning, if we do not get those men on the land spending and investing in their communities, those communities will cease to exist. There are towns that are reeling and will continue to reel from the disaster. These areas urgently need infrastructure and services to ensure their continued viability. They need to have attention paid to the social impact on an equal par with the economic impact. Without restoration of the heart of these communities the economic lifeblood will also drain away. The response to these disasters needs to be quick and effective. It cannot be a hastily put together job that fails to fulfil its brief. It cannot be a drawn-out process that would allow the damage to accrue and fester. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018725"></A>
Under this legislation the powers of the authority will be quite wide ranging. There are a number of interventions that can be undertaken. Land can be declared as acquisition land. This rightfully allows the owners to remain on the land until a later time but the owner cannot dispose of the land to any other entity. While the value of the land will be compensated to the owner there have to be questions raised over the effect that such a declaration will have on the value of the land such as the time at which it is done and who the entity will pass on to. There are questions about what will occur when the authority disbands. Will the particular department or local authority still pay for that property? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018726"></A>
Several of the clauses are breaches of fundamental legislative principles justified by the fact that they are required to effectively and safely rebuild communities. However, provisions such as entry to land are necessary to ensure full and proper knowledge of the facts. Others such as the power to require information from any person, a penalty-accompanied measure, have an obvious basis but also raise concerns over the limitations of its use. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018727"></A>
Putting into effect the strategic priorities of the board is essential if these priorities best serve the communities. If political interference weighs heavily in the process it will be to the detriment of all. While those who are affected by the disaster need our support and attention we must be vigilant that in assisting those people other people are not disadvantaged. The paramount considerations in the rebuilding should be cooperation, teamwork and compassion. That is a solid foundation for the future. As long as those principles are kept at the forefront of operations the bill will serve our community well. If they are forgotten, lost in the process or overlooked for expediency’s sake then the community will lose all over again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018728"></A>
Instances of profound tragedy still haunt our state. The disaster experienced in Grantham, Toowoomba, Murphys Creek and Withcott, in isolation an event so filled with grief and hurt, is one particular tragic piece of the overall picture of loss and sorrow. Our thanks and gratitude go to those who have demonstrated the spirit of Queensland. Our sympathy and our thoughts go to those who have lost so much. Our hopes and optimism go towards the rebuilding that will occur throughout the community and our state. The experiences will ensure that we forget neither the people nor the lessons. We need to ensure that advance warnings are better and more accurate. We need to include rural communities and farmers as a priority. We need to ensure that employment and economy are at the forefront of any recovery. We need to ensure that waste is minimised. We need to ensure that red tape is cut. We need to rebuild the economy. We need to rebuild infrastructure. We need to rebuild community. Tragically Labor has a pedigree of waste, mismanagement and debt. We need to learn from the past or we are deemed to relive it at our peril. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(11.54 am): In rising to contribute to the bill before the House, which, as previous speakers from the opposition have indicated, is a bill that the LNP will be supporting, we will be asking some questions. Whilst the bill might not be perfect, it goes a fair way to putting processes in place that will be necessary to ensure proper recovery from the flooding events that we have seen and also after the quite significant devastation caused by Cyclone Yasi. </Hansard-Body>

The impacts of the floods we saw around Queensland were many and varied. As I indicated in this House on a previous occasion during the condolence motion, there were some areas of Queensland where the flood level did not exceed the levels in the 1990s, in some areas it exceeded 1974 and in other areas it did not, and the same for 1976 and 1956. Depending on where one is in Queensland, there are various markers, not only physical markers but markers that are burned in the psychology of those communities, of the flood that they always refer back to. There is no doubt that it was a major flooding event. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018736"></A>
Later on I will make some comments about the language that was used to describe the flooding event which in itself I think probably caused people in some areas to become more concerned than they needed to be. As far as my electorate was concerned, there was a significant impact in some parts but the majority of people were not personally physically affected. That is also true across Queensland. The greatest majority of Queenslanders were not personally physically affected. There was a small minority of people in my electorate, as there was a small minority of people in Queensland, who were very deeply and personally affected because of the loss of life and the inundation of their homes and businesses that they have worked so hard for. It is also fair to say that, as a consequence of the fact that people know so many people and images were being beamed into our homes on a 24/7 basis, just about every Queenslander was indirectly affected. In many ways a lot of those Queenslanders became so personally traumatised by those images that it will have a profound and long-term effect on them. The same effect will be present in relation to Cyclone Yasi. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018737"></A>
In my electorate it is true to say that people had their homes flooded. They will recover. There will be ongoing scarring for many of those people. A lot of those people accept the fact they will have a flood every now and again. They are fortunate enough to have insurance or fortunate enough that they have put in place contingencies such as raising their home so that the property loss will be mitigated as a consequence. We have had significant property inundation. Small businesses have been inundated. The biggest impact in my electorate has been on the infrastructure--the roads and railway lines. I will come to the impact on sporting infrastructure in some of our communities in a moment. They are areas that people have concerns about in relation to the short, medium and long-term recovery. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018738"></A>
The dairy industry in my electorate was profoundly affected because there were supply issues. Many of those people were cut off. Trucks to pick up their milk were not able to reach them. In some cases they had to dispose of 20,000 to 30,000 litres of milk. Not only that, there is a significant animal welfare issue. As anyone involved in the dairy industry knows, it is not a matter of not milking your cows for a couple of days. If you do not milk your cows for a couple of days it has a significant impact on their capacity to be able to produce at a high level in that lactation cycle but also there can be a real issue in regard to mastitis in those animals. So there is an animal welfare issue for those farmers and that concerned them very much. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018739"></A>
There was a major impact on the cotton industry in my electorate. I have mentioned severe soil degradation in the past around Cecil Plains that has had a major financial impact on those farmers. If it is good enough for the government to declare category D assistance in Cyclone Yasi affected areas--which were absolutely devastated, no doubt about that--there are farmers in my area who are similarly equally affected financially with hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars of exposure and I would encourage the government to look towards their inclusion in that category.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023421"></A>
The grain industry has been very much affected as well. People have lost not just the winter crop but also the summer crops; they lost one summer crop and then replanted and lost another summer crop. In a drought people lose a lot but they lose it over a long period; it is a slow bleed. In a flood all of that which they have worked so hard to actually preserve can be destroyed virtually overnight. That applies also in the case of livestock in many cases. People may have actually kept them throughout the drought and then severe wet weather conditions can have quite a fatal effect on those animals. There are a lot of issues there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023424"></A>
Fruit and vegetables in my area have been impacted. Believe it or not, that impact has come from the speculation of high prices. As soon as people start to talk about the supply chain being affected and high prices, the prices actually go up. One of the vegie growers at Stanthorpe said to me the other day that they are actually getting less for their fruit and vegies on farm than they were before the floods. We have to understand that sometimes those who market beyond the farm take advantage of the disaster to skim something off the top. We have to be very aware of that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023425"></A>
A moment ago I mentioned the impact on sporting facilities. This is a major concern in my electorate. Looking at Warwick, for example, there is the Condamine flood plain. In many ways, that particular area, which does inundate in times of flood as it did this time, is put to good use. The Warwick Hockey Association is wondering how this recovery process is going to affect it. It is a wonderful organisation of volunteers, a magnificent local sporting club which has spawned previous Olympians like Lee Bodimeade. Back in the nineties that club was able to garner state government assistance, it loaned funds from the council and it was able to use a fair degree of its own finances to lay down a wonderful artificial surface. Only two years ago that surface needed to be replaced. Again, assistance from the state government was given as well as a loan from the council, which the club will pay back over a period. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023428"></A>
That surface is now two years old. The minister is very much aware of this. The other day I went and had a look at that magnificent surface. The club is devastated by what the Condamine River has done. The waters got underneath the surface and it has rolled up like a huge caterpillar. Honourable members would not believe the power of nature. A thousand of the strongest men would not be able to do what nature did in this case. The river has probably rolled up 70 tonnes of sand in there as well. Just the disposal of that surface is a major problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023429"></A>
It is a wonderful sporting club which put down its new surface only a couple of years ago. It had planned to pay that off over a period of time with the inevitability it would have to resurface some 10 years or so down the track. Now it is in the terrible situation of having to meet its obligations for the existing surface not knowing whether it will be able to fund a replacement surface. Of course, it will probably only have a few months to make decisions because it will start to lose players. The organisation, which is a part of the Warwick culture, could fold and that would be a major concern. I say to the minister--and I hope to speak with him at some stage--that there are these exceptional areas. I know that there probably is a limit on funds, but this is an organisation that is more than capable of standing on its own two feet. We have to do everything we possibly can to assist it in the future. I also went to the Warwick Cowboys rugby league the other day. Despite its level of damage and exposure, it has shown a great degree of resilience. That club suffered damage to its facility as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023430"></A>
Another organisation in my electorate which has been significantly affected is the Southern Downs Steam Railway Association, a marvellous group of volunteers who have refurbished their own steam locomotive. They have also refurbished some carriages for Queensland Rail. They include an extraordinary range of skilled tradesmen and volunteers. It is a magnificent organisation and has been very financially viable. It is a non-profit organisation that runs steam railway trips for people. A lot of people travel on these steam trains from Brisbane and Ipswich down to the wine country, to Wallangarra and sometimes west to Goondiwindi. They also use the rail up towards Clifton and beyond. They have also been given the right to lease a small piece of rail line near Allora. That organisation has been dramatically impacted because it now cannot run even though it has bookings. If those lines are not open for it to use--and there have been some small rock slides south to Wallangarra; we know that there is a limit to the resources available to Queensland Rail--it may not be able to continue beyond April this year. That has been a labour of love that has continued for the best part of 15 years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023434"></A>
This is the impact which is floating at the moment below the surface in many of our communities in Queensland. I am not sure how the flood recovery organisation is going to be able to deal with those sorts of things, but there is capacity to be able to declare an area or a particular impact in a community. I am not sure how the bill’s declaration of areas will impact my electorate, but I do encourage that this does happen in the areas of greatest need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023435"></A>
The Queensland economy is also a significant worry. This statutory authority is going to put a lot of its efforts into dealing with community and economic infrastructure, which is going to be important for jobs and getting Queensland up and going as well. Over the last 24 to 48 hours we have heard a lot from the government about how we address this impression around the world that Queensland is somehow closed for business when indeed it is open for business. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023436"></A>
I go back to what we saw during the flooding events. Not only the media but also government ministers and the Premier were actually talking about Queensland being three-quarters covered by floodwaters. That oversimplifies and overdramatises the reality of the situation. At that stage most of the tourism areas of Queensland were still open for business, whether it be Cairns, Townsville, the Sunshine Coast or the Gold Coast. Is it any wonder that this impression was built up around the world? We have to be very careful about the language being used and the way that language is being reported. Once people start to say that an area as large as Europe was affected, that seeds in the minds of people all over the world. An area as large as Europe--that is a multiplicity, that is scores of countries. People do not have a realistic perspective of what that actually means in the context of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023438"></A>
A lot of the flooding in areas such as the western part of my electorate was across vast levels of farmland. It isolates farmhouses and that is bad enough. A lot of those people are very resilient. Only a couple of days ago I talked in this parliament about farming families west of Goondiwindi who have been cut off, by and large, since the end of September. They are resilient; they are able to deal with that. That is also included in there as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023441"></A>
However, when using this sort of language we have to be careful to say, ‘Yes, it covers a vast area of Queensland, but at the same time there is a lot of Queensland which continues to be open for business.’ The language was being used at that particular time but no thought was given to its psychological impact in the minds of people not only in Queensland but also interstate and overseas, which the government is now madly scrambling to try to correct. Whether it likes it or not, that actually sets the scene and creates the context in which a lot of people who might want to visit our country or do business judge what is happening here. I think that is a classic example of how we have to be very careful about the perceptions we build as we go along. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023442"></A>
We have also heard the Treasurer carrying on in this place about the fact that we did not have the funds because of the global financial crisis. Let us revisit that crisis. This government predicted that it was going to lose $14 billion across the forward estimates as a consequence. It did not lose that at all. It did not lose near that. Once again, the government is taking it out there, using that as a shield and a veil and now tries to offer that as a reason for being unable to deal with this. It cannot blame other parts of Australia who might be saying, ‘Our governments insure, our governments re-insure.’ Queensland did not. What we saw from the Treasurer only recently when he was asked about this was very instructive. He said, ‘We did not think we would bother about it. We checked the market soundings. It was not good, but we knew the Commonwealth would come in and bail us out to the tune of three-quarters of the money that was owing.’ People in the other states who are levy payers are not going to be very happy about that when their own governments in South Australia, Victoria or Western Australia, which also has cyclones, or New South Wales or Tasmania actually re-insure their assets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023443"></A>
If the government makes a decision not to re-insure, that is a matter for it. However, it should do what governments in Queensland have always done until this Labor government came to power in the mid-1990s and that is make sure there is enough money in contingency to allow for it. We had no money in contingency, no insurance and no re-insurance. The government cannot blame people for wondering where all the money has gone. Where did the $34 billion in unforeseen revenue, which was accrued by this government between 2000 and 2008, go? It just went up in smoke. Some of that should have been put away in contingency as well. If it does not want to insure, it has to put the money in contingency, and that is what this government has not done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023479"></A>
This authority has a very important role to play as it goes forward. It has an important role to play in rebuilding and strengthening communities for the future. It has an important role to play in making sure that we do learn the lessons of the past. I mentioned the other day in this place that, after the 1893 floods, which in my electorate are still considered to be the largest floods, there were communities in my electorate which were moved a very small distance--sometimes just a few hundred metres--to take them out of flood prone areas. That, by and large, was a positive move. This Reconstruction Authority needs to consider that, and I am sure that it will with regard to areas where we have seen the most traumatic impact of these particular flooding events, because future generations will not praise us if we do not take that step now. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023482"></A>
I know there is an extraordinary emotional connection. We have seen that in this place over the last few days from members of parliament who have stood up and said, ‘We are going to rebuild. We are going to do this.’ That is all fine. I understand that particular emotion. But what we also have to do is make sure that we inject an amount of common sense in how we go forward with regard to taking ourselves and people out of harm’s way. That can be done compassionately and that can be done properly. There is a very small window of opportunity, because we know that, with the effluxion of time, what often happens is that we tend to forget those lessons and we tend to think, ‘That is not as serious now as it seemed to be a little while ago.’</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023483"></A>
We have to re-engineer infrastructure to make sure that we are not just rebuilding it in the same substandard way or in the same place where it was damaged. We need to re-engineer the infrastructure in a better way and in better positions, whether it is roads or railway lines or other infrastructure. That is extremely important, because what this flooding event has taught us, and in many ways what Cyclone Yasi has taught us, is that infrastructure has let us down because we have too many eggs in one basket. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023484"></A>
It is important that we have a sunset clause in this legislation, and we do have that. There are a couple of issues that I specifically want to raise. One is the suspension of land valuations until 30 June. I do not know how this will have an impact. It does not make sense to me, because most of those valuations today are done on a desktop. We have very few site inspections anymore; they are done on a desktop. I would hope that the government is not concerned about what has been a significant drop in valuations or property sales in recent times out there. The government has framed its budget, framed its midyear review, based on previous property values insofar as crown rent is concerned and also insofar as land tax is concerned. So if the government puts it off till 30 June, that will allow it to frame the budget on what will inevitably be higher valuations than what we would see before 30 June. I hope that is not some sort of excuse the government is using. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023486"></A>
We need to look at the Q100 levels as well. I understand that there is some significant concern at the moment from within the property industry in Queensland that this is something that has to be addressed, because they need clarity with regard to what can be built, with regard to new development applications and also with regard to what can be rebuilt. It is very, very important, and I understand that a number of councils around South-East Queensland have those concerns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023489"></A>
We now see the suspension of pool fencing laws. We have all received emails from people in what they now describe as the ‘pool fencing inspection industry’. I do not like that term. We create regulations and a whole industry comes up around them. Nevertheless, it was deemed to be important enough a few months ago. We now have people who have skilled themselves and set up businesses. They are now concerned that they are going to be impacted upon in a major way, that they are going to lose their jobs and lose their homes. There is also the issue of safety of children in Queensland which was the primary motivator. Those things need to be addressed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023490"></A>
With regard to the suspension of deeming in this legislation, I implore that that not be used as an excuse for some sort of turgid dragging of the feet when it comes to consideration of development applications, because sometimes those things can be hidden behind the veil of flood. They have to be used properly and they have to be used appropriately. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023491"></A>
Similarly with the acquisition of land, we have to make sure that that does not impact upon people with regard to the use of their property as collateral when it comes to the purchase of other investments or the purchase of other property. I think the acquisition provisions are a good idea, but we have to make sure that people are properly compensated when the property is acquired and that it does not have an impact on collateral. </Hansard-Body>

There are a range of issues I should touch on, including the major contamination in my electorate with regard to the trickle hose upstream of Texas. This is a task beyond the council, and the government should move to help out as much as it possibly can. </Hansard-Body>

 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (12.14 pm): I congratulate the government and particularly the Premier on this legislation that we see before the House today. It demonstrates a determination to face up to the issues arising out of the floods in terms of infrastructure damage immediately and with great resolve. The legislation that we see here gives to the government the power necessary to facilitate cooperation, coordination and prioritisation where it is needed. </Hansard-Body>

At the outset, however, I thank the Premier for her announcement this morning which did not relate to infrastructure as such but related to assistance to community groups, non-government organisations and the like, which up until now were not eligible to receive a government grant or loan similar to businesses or farmers. That is a great move forward and will be appreciated by many organisations throughout Queensland which have been affected by the floods. The Premier did indicate the brief meeting she had in Ruthven Street, Toowoomba, with representatives of the Kath Dickson organisation, who are principally involved in child care. They will benefit, no doubt, from this, as will an organisation like 4DDB, which is a community radio station that was flooded out as well. I am very grateful to the Premier for advocating with the Prime Minister the extension of the scheme to cover these types of organisations so that they will be on the same footing, as I said, as businesses, farmers and, indeed, sporting associations and clubs as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023504"></A>
With respect to the legislation before us today, I just want to mention a smattering, if you like, of examples of the infrastructure damage that was sustained in my electorate, my city and my region. If I can start with the most dramatic damage, I suppose, particularly to state government assets, and that was with respect to the rail damage on the Toowoomba range. This rail line was built in 1867 and, to a large extent, the route has not changed much since that time. Some of the original tunnels, I believe, are still in use. It has been, obviously, a vital link from the Port of Brisbane to the Darling Downs and South-West Queensland. It extends from Brisbane right out to Charleville, Quilpie and so on. It is absolutely important. In the other direction, it goes to Warwick, Dirranbandi and places of that nature. Its importance should be readily appreciated, and it certainly is by me. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023508"></A>
The Treasurer travelled to Toowoomba, along with the Minister for Transport, whose responsibilities include QR. With them, I visited the damage sustained at or near Spring Bluff, just below the Toowoomba range, just below my electorate and in the electorate of my friend the member for Lockyer. We saw there an example of great damage done to the railway line, to the bridges, to the culverts, to the tunnels et cetera. It was estimated at that stage by QR personnel that the work involved would take about six months to repair to enable the track to be used again for normal purposes. But, with the effort that is being applied and the resources that are being applied by way of contracting Thiess, the work will be done within three months. I think that has now been shortened somewhat as well to a date in early April. It is pleasing that that massive work can be completed within that time. I congratulate all those involved, all those who have already done a considerable amount of work and all those who will be involved in the work yet to be undertaken. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023541"></A>
In the meantime, we have seen a tremendous impact in terms of the usage of the Warrego Highway and the range crossing. Those goods that were normally transported by rail are now being transported by road, principally on the roads that I mentioned. That is creating a huge impost on the road system. I have spoken repeatedly in here, as have other members, about the very poor state of the Warrego Highway over the last five to 10 years, but particularly in recent times. The floods have made it a mess. Now we have the extra load on it that would otherwise have been--</Hansard-Body>

Mr SHINE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from my friend. One of the immediate solutions is for critical work to be done on the range crossing and the Warrego Highway. A lot of that has been done in recent times. I am sure the honourable member would agree with me when I say that, to me as a layperson, the work being done between Withcott and Helidon at the moment seems to be of much higher quality than the patchwork that was done before. I note that the honourable member nods in agreement. That is pleasing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023545"></A>
I am not familiar with what is happening between Toowoomba and Oakey in the electorate of Condamine. No doubt the member for Condamine will make some comment about that later. If there is any good to come from the terrible events starting on 10 January this year it has been to bring the focus of the nation onto the range crossing and Warrego Highway issues. We do hope, through our advocacy in here and the advocacy of others in other places, that what we have been after and, I believe, have been justly entitled to for a long time with respect to the range crossing and the Warrego Highway will be achieved. Let us wait and see. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023546"></A>
The honourable member for Lockyer would agree that the rail link is of vital economic importance as well. He would be aware, as the House may be aware, that about eight years ago a study was done on a Gowrie-Grandchester rail link. A new railway line was proposed to be built across the Toowoomba range. It would more or less proceed in a straight line rather than follow all of the ridges as it does at the moment. In those days it was supposed to be a $1 billion project. One can only imagine what it would be worth today. The events that we have just seen highlight, in my view, the need for closer attention to be paid to that project, taking into account the additional change since eight or 10 years ago which is the opening up of the Surat Basin. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023550"></A>
The damage done to the railway near the electorate of Toowoomba North in the electorate of Lockyer coming up the range was, I am advised by QR, 262 individual sites where damage has been found, comprising major and minor wash-outs, major landslips, drainage blockages and damage and destroyed structures such as bridges. To its credit, Queensland Rail has mobilised all available employees. It has contracted Thiess and smaller operators including earthmovers and trucking companies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023552"></A>
The Toowoomba range corridor is a vital piece of infrastructure for our community and for our local businesses, but the work associated with getting it back on track will exceed, according to QR, $50 million. That is a lot of money. That is what one project is costing. Work has to be done on the Rosewood-Toowoomba track. Work has to be done elsewhere along the rail line, particularly between Toowoomba and Oakey and west of Oakey as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023553"></A>
I am advised that Queensland Rail has engaged Thiess to undertake restoration work at six major sites--the replacement of Kings Bridge plus five other landslips at Spring Bluff, Ripper Creek and Rangeview. As of 11 February this year, on-site there are 150 Queensland Rail personnel, Thiess contractors, 12 excavators, two graders, several dozers and 45 trucks to handle flood rock. We can see that, notwithstanding what has happened in North Queensland since with Cyclone Yasi, a great deal of commitment in terms of labour and capital has been made to fixing up what is the major economic obstacle that we have to overcome in and around Toowoomba. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023558"></A>
As I mentioned before, the major problem for us at the height of the trouble which started on 10 January was the closure of the range crossing which is part of the Warrego Highway. Toowoomba was isolated for the best part of a week. Clearly the presence of a second range crossing would have obviated that problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023560"></A>
Within Toowoomba itself the bridges crossing Gowrie Creek, in my electorate at least, were damaged in one way or another, including those at Griffith Street, North Street, Jelicoe Street and Bridge Street. The Bridge Street bridge is still half closed. The Jelicoe Street bridge is fully closed. The Griffith Street and North Street bridges have reopened. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023562"></A>
Of great concern to me is the fact that there was an article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Chronicle</Hansard-Italic>
 about a week ago indicating that council felt that it would take about 12 months to fix up or rebuild the Jelicoe Street bridge. It is disappointing if that is the case. I have expressed my concerns about that to the Toowoomba Regional Council. If there is anything that the government can do to hasten the replacement of that bridge well within that 12-month period I would be very supportive of it. I would hope that the powers given under this bill may well facilitate progress in that regard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023564"></A>
What has also been mentioned in the press in Toowoomba in recent times is where the tragedy involving the Rice family occurred, at the corner of Kitchener and James streets, and the fact that reconstruction there should take into account flood mitigation. I suspect that the problem with flood mitigation along East Creek is more substantial than what might happen at that intersection. That call has been made. I repeat it here. I ask the Minister for Main Roads to take note of that issue. James Street is part of the Warrego Highway and a federal government responsibility, but Mains Roads--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023571"></A>
Also of great concern to me is fact that the Hampton to Esk Road is down. I have been told by the Toowoomba Regional Council that it will cost at least half a million dollars to repair a huge wash-out on that road. That is an important access road between the Brisbane Valley and the Darling Downs and Toowoomba in particular. Again, this legislation hopefully might facilitate the repair of that roadway at an earlier time. There are many other rural roads that come within the area of Toowoomba Regional Council--too many to go through on this occasion. But no doubt the council is compiling its list of roads and other assets that need to be replaced. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023575"></A>
On top of the state and council assets, we as a community suffered considerably in terms of private property and business losses. An article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 of 12 February set out at least three or four businesses in Toowoomba which were suffering as a result of the floods. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023604"></A>
One business was a long way away at Picnic Point, which is 710 metres above sea level. The problem there, given that it was a cafe and restaurant, was the lack of tourism and the lack of business. That has been repeated downtown in Russell Street with a family business called Wings Over the Downs owned by Mr Rob Mercer. That was also repeated at a business called The Boogie Shack owned by Lynette Bannister which is a place where one buys milkshakes and burgers. Most of the business there was from tourists, and they have dried up completely. So it is not just Cairns, the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast that are suffering from a lack of tourism; it is places like Toowoomba and the west. In that regard, I thank the Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading for the work that he has done recently to ensure that considerable money has been given to the organisation that deals with the promotion of tourism in Toowoomba, Toowoomba and Golden West Tourism. I am sure that will be of great help in promoting tourism in our area as well. My friend the member for Waterford heads a committee which recently released a report relating to grey nomads, and obviously Toowoomba and the west are centres very relevant in that regard.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1023615"></A>
There were numerous other businesses and industries affected, one of which was Allied Mills which used to be Defiance flour. That is still closed even though it employs dozens of workers. Many businesses in Dent Street, Prescott Street, Ruthven Street, Chalk Drive and Gowrie Creek are still shut and the people who worked there are unemployed or off work as a result. That is an indication of the extent of the effect of the floods in Toowoomba. This bill of course gives the Premier and the government extensive powers to prioritise the work that needs to be done on a state-wide basis to coordinate and manage the rebuilding and to distribute financial assistance, things which I believe are necessary and worthy powers. I again congratulate the government and the Premier on the work that has been done in that regard. </Hansard-Body>

He just left that blank, because he thought that there was a guarantee that at some stage in the next 12 months or whatever I would have to use that. It is still in the computer, but I am sure that at some time or other either of the premiers probably would have wished that I could have furnished them with that. So I do apologise for any issues of embarrassment I have caused you or my colleagues or anybody else over that period of time.</Hansard-Body>

I want to pay tribute to a number of people, first of all to my family--a great Labor family. I wish they were here today. I wish my dad was still here today. But 13 years ago we were all together and we celebrated that moment. I was talking to my son last night. He was 14 then. He is now a journalist with AAP in Cairns. My other son, who is a journalist in Rockhampton, was 11 at that time. My wife has done a wonderful job in looking after those boys. I have spent very little time with them during that period of time. Evan reminds me that I went into local politics when he was six months old and Christopher was not even born. This job is a difficult job when you spend so much time away. So to my wife Judy I say thankyou. You have always been there for me and it has been great, and I look forward to getting under your feet in retirement. To my mother--she is of course the matriarch of the family and just salt of the earth--and to my brothers Steven, Peter, Mark and my sister Christine, I thank them similarly. They are very harsh critics from time to time when we sit around our lunch table every Saturday when we meet with my mum. We have a robust discussion. We do not all see eye to eye in the Schwarten household; that might surprise some people. But they are a great family to me. They have provided enormous support to me and it has been a terrific journey with them.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1023637"></A>
I also thank my parliamentary colleagues. There are very few of them left from the 1989 days. There is Judy. We have been mates ever since we came here in 1989, and we are the last of them. I have seen them all come and go during that period of time. Some have wanted to go. I went for a while--involuntarily, I have to tell you! I experienced a break in my career I guess. Some called it a sabbatical; I called it bloody hell actually. It was terrible! So I do know that dreadful, gut-wrenching feeling of losing an election. There is nothing quite like it and I do not recommend it to anybody. You only go out of this place two ways--either you retire or somebody throws you out, and I am glad that I am going on my own terms at a time of my own choosing. Very few get the privilege of doing that, and I am deeply honoured to be able to do that.</Hansard-Body>

All of those people who have come in today and who are sitting in the public gallery have worked with me during parts of that time, and many of them could tell a story about me I guess. We started off on day one with Cheryl Packer and at that stage Peter Johnson was working in the show society in Toowoomba driving up and down. Then Lindsay came on board and ‘Father Jack’ John Luttreral. My very dear friends Lynne and Esmae came on next--the ‘golden girls’ as they are colloquially called by these young cheeky imps beside me here. I would never dare say such a thing! But it was a great team to start with--it really was--and we hit the ground running. Some of you stayed longer than others, but all of you went at a time of your choosing.</Hansard-Body>

Of course Emma started with me on the first day and she was a young single girl then. Since then she has been married and had a couple of kids. I used to say when Kate worked with me we went from the nursery to the infirmary. Well, now it is pretty well the infirmary! Burgess, my old mate from a long time back, has stepped into the breach in that regard and there is Glen who is driving me. We had Blake Westlake of course who nearly killed me over the years driving out to the airport. I do not know whether I nearly killed him or he nearly killed me, but he stuck loyally to me. Glen still gets me to the airport on time and Jordy answers the phone. It has been a great group of people. I am just sorry that Cheryl Packer is not here. She will not be speaking to me when she comes back because I let her know by text this morning that this is what I was going to do and she said, ‘Thanks for telling me on my holidays.’ She would have said a lot more if she had been around!</Hansard-Body>

Right from day one Mal Grierson was the acting DG, and we have been together ever sense. I want to thank Mal for the great job that he has done in Public Works. Mal repaid me for getting Racing by getting IT over. I thought I would put one over him and said, ‘We’re going to get Racing,’ and he said, ‘I have just had this talk to the people over at Treasury and I have had a talk to so-and-so and I think we should really have the IT stuff over here.’ Actually, he started his career over at CITEC. So it has been a great ride, mate. I do not think in the history of Queensland there is anything that comes close to 13 years of the same DG and the same minister. I just want to say that about Natalie MacDonald, too, as the Housing DG. </Hansard-Body>

I guess I had the best of both worlds. I held a position where I could help people--among the poorest of our people. You cannot get much better than that as a Labor bloke. I think the stuff we did in Housing was absolutely terrific. We started off with no money from the federal government and we had to make do. I think we have created the best housing department in Australia with the best policies, the most efficiency and the most--what is the word--</Hansard-Body>

 Yes. I want to also thank Graham Cuthbert from Master Builders. We have had a great relationship with Master Builders. They are a great organisation. They speak from the heart and the head. They are not frightened to have a go on behalf of their members. They know that the industry is a very important cornerstone in this state and they play their professional role. The friendship that I have had with Graham I am sure will continue. </Hansard-Body>

It is similarly the case with Ian Jennings over at the BSA. I got that from Judy Spence; it was Judy who did all the hard yards in that regard for me. So when I came along most of that work had been done. I used to sit next to her in those days with mountains of letters from the BSA. Along came ‘Jenno’, of course, and he took to it like a terrier to a rat. ‘Mr Fixit’ himself was going out to people who used to abuse him--and they still do, apparently. I do not know how he does it, but I thank him for his leadership there also. That has been great. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026580"></A>
I think we got the best reforms. I will never forget the day that I banned builders. I rang Master Builders after the event and copped a tirade for not consulting them. Then I said, ‘If we had waited for you blokes to consult all of your members, we would never have done it,’ because it is pretty hard for an organisation to agree to ban their members. But they got in and supported that, and that has been a really valuable tool in managing the building industry in this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026581"></A>
I have been so privileged to indulge in that passion of building. It has been great fortune. I want to thank both Premiers--both the previous one and the current one--for giving me that opportunity, because the construction industry, where I started my working life, is an absolute passion of mine. I believe in it and I see and feel the effects of it. Every time I go into a job and I see the young blokes who are working in it, I absolutely continue to be mesmerised by it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026583"></A>
I see Greg Quinn, who has just arrived. He could tell a very good story about the first time we met and the cordial relationship with Master Builders and the building reforms. We were heading out to the airport and I said, ‘Get in the car and come with me.’ We had a blazing row the entire way out there and when we got out there Quinny said, ‘How do I get back?’ I said, ‘You go back in the car.’ He said, ‘Oh, I thought that would be the end of it.’ We have been mates ever since also. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1026586"></A>
I do not want to prolong this much longer, but it is good to see Rose, Stephan and the McGuire brothers. They have been very solid mates of mine during this time in a world in which you do not get many mates. I have a basic philosophy about mates: friendship is a chain of gold; the mates you have are the ones you hold. I still have mates that I started school with, and each of these people here today I still regard as a mate. </Hansard-Body>

As I say, it has been a wonderful, wonderful experience. My son the journo said to me, ‘It doesn’t get any better than this--going at your own time, at your own pace, happy about it and delighted to have made a contribution,’ as I have. I intend to work as hard as I can to ensure that we retain government in Queensland. I not only think it is possible; I think it is crucial. I see the quality of what is over the other side and--</Hansard-Body>

I have enjoyed this not just for the contribution we have made during that period and for all of those people who have done it with me, but also for the people I have met along the way. I have met people who are absolutely dirt poor and people who are billionaires. I have met good and bad in both and it is what continues to motivate us.</Hansard-Body>

 To my dear old mate, Judy: thanks again for all your support and friendship during our cabinet days. I am sorry that Terry Mackenroth is not here. They used to call us the ‘terrific trio’. We used to call ourselves that, anyway. When we would go to community cabinet meetings we would go and have a drink and have a meal and all the rest of it. But time moves on and there is a whole bunch of talent in this room that is going to fill this seat. I am glad that I am not going to make that decision; that has all passed me now, too, thank God. But thanks, everybody. Thanks for turning out here today. I will have more to say about the locals of Rockhampton if I get a chance at a valedictory later as a member of parliament. But I leave with my head held high and a smile on my face, and I am looking forward to having a beer this afternoon. </Hansard-Body>

 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships) (12.47 pm), by leave: Last night I announced to the people of Cairns that I will not be contesting the next state election, due in early 2012.

This is indeed how I wish to finish up my political years: by concentrating on the city I love.

While being conscious of this, I now also announce that I will tender my resignation from cabinet to the Premier effective Monday, 21 February. I have been honoured indeed to have served in a range of portfolios over the past seven years. Much as I care and have so much more I would like to do in my present portfolios of Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships, I think it better that I stand down and provide an opportunity for a younger person with the best years of their political life still ahead. Over these years I have been well supported by members of the Labor caucus, by hardworking, marvellous staff--both in Brisbane and in Cairns--and by my family, my children in particular, Charlotte, Jake and Rachel. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1026611"></A>
Without hesitation I express my admiration for the mayors, councillors, CEOs and staff of Queensland’s 73 councils. I particularly recognise the enduring leadership of the local government sector provided by the LGAQ, so ably led by president Paul Bell and executive director Greg Hallam. I have been so warmed to see the progress being made by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. They are on the move towards a much better life in their own country. I will remain a strong supporter of our first Australians and advocate for them not only for their own sake but because their success now and in the years ahead will make Australia better for us all.</Hansard-Body>

 (Mount Ommaney--ALP) (2.30 pm): I rise to support the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill which will set up the mechanism to coordinate rebuilding after the devastating floods and cyclones of January and February 2011. The Premier will become Minister for Reconstruction and will have responsibility for overseeing the Reconstruction Authority. The authority will have wide-reaching powers and have a board chaired by Major General Mick Slater which will report directly to her. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1031709"></A>
The recent floods and cyclones have turned Queensland upside down and the next challenge is to rebuild to ensure that we are much stronger and better prepared in the future. We all have lessons to learn from our experiences. An essential part of the bill is that the authority have wide-ranging powers to ensure the job is done efficiently and in a timely manner. The minister’s power under the act will include: the declaration of designated reconstruction areas where rebuilding can be fast-tracked; the ability to intervene in regulatory or approval processes to get things moving; independent planning powers to slash red tape and begin rebuilding as soon as possible; and the ability to actually undertake reconstruction or development works as soon as possible.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031710"></A>
It is important that the authority works together cooperatively with local government to ensure timely completion of the projects. It will have a dedicated North Queensland office to ensure that there is a local presence in relation to devastation caused by Cyclone Yasi. No-one knows their area better than the local community and they will be able to provide guidance and information to the authority in this way. The Premier’s message is, ‘No-one and no part of Queensland will be forgotten.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031713"></A>
As explained in the state parliament’s condolence debate earlier this week, there were many devastated communities right across Queensland, including within my own electorate of Mount Ommaney. Every elected member in the state parliament was somehow affected directly by the flood and/or provided assistance to those electorates that were underwater or devastated by Cyclone Yasi. As families, individuals, businesses, farms and communities begin to piece their lives back together, the Premier and the state government are committed to be there standing beside them to help them rise again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031716"></A>
In the week before Christmas 2010, I sent out my final email news for the year telling residents that there was more rain and storms to come and providing them with some information about preparation for the bad conditions ahead. Little did I know at the time how bad the conditions would become. In my local area, there was a sequence of events which occurred early on Tuesday, 11 January. There was continued constant heavy rain and flood warnings as some residents prepared for the possible flooding of their homes. The day before, Jindalee residents lost their water supply and efforts were made to restore broken pipes through Urban Utilities. Some families evacuated to friends or relatives. People rang my office for flood maps; however, there was difficulty accessing the council website because of the large numbers of people trying to get information. There was a rush for sandbags at the Brisbane City Council depot in Darra which created traffic congestion and queues of people. The depot quickly ran out of sandbags. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031723"></A>
Community groups emailed and telephoned my office asking how they could help. Many people rang the electorate office to ask if they should evacuate. They were told not to take any chances and to stay safe. The elderly in nursing homes were evacuated and the disabled were contacted by their service providers and were assisted to evacuate where necessary. The electorate office printed out 1974 flood maps to advise local people if they were vulnerable. The police began evacuating people as water was encroaching on their properties. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031724"></A>
On Wednesday, power was cut and homes became flooded. Some were completely inundated and boats were used by the police to assist those people who were stranded. My electorate office was advising people to get to evacuation centres and was ringing the SES to assist them. I was visiting people and contacting people in need. Local roads and the Centenary Motorway and Jindalee Bridge were cut. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031725"></A>
On Thursday, staff from my electorate office were sent home as the roads leading to the shopping centre entrance were becoming flooded. That day, I prepared a flyer with recovery and emergency contact information to be doorknocked to the flood affected and distributed to other properties. On Friday, people were in shock and were distressed as they panic shopped. Large numbers of people were ringing to ask about power, food and shelter. The BCC website was again on and off, with large numbers of people trying to access the site for information. I started doorknocking flood affected residents as the waters receded and the clean-up began.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031727"></A>
These are some of the issues which came to light. Residents in the Centenary area advised that they had no warning and that their areas were not published on the council’s list of ‘suburbs likely to be affected by flooding’. Therefore, some of those people who did not experience the ’74 floods did not realise their properties would be affected. In a state of distress, other people froze in disbelief not knowing what to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031729"></A>
Many people were of the belief that with the Wivenhoe Dam a repeat of the ’74 flood would be avoided. People whose homes were completely inundated did not know where to start or how they were going to get the funds to start again. Some people were waiting for the insurance companies to assess the damage before taking the walls down. I contacted insurance companies to get a clearance for them to start getting rid of caked on mud. Some injuries had occurred as people cleaned out the rubbish from their home. People asked for tetanus shots and I asked the Minister for Communities to provide that service in the recovery centres. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031730"></A>
After the clean-up, residents were keen to get their power restored so that they could start rebuilding. They were advised to get an electrical contractor to inspect their home for safety before a clearance could be provided to Energex. People asked if there was a way that they could access their superannuation in advance to cover the cost of rebuilding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031731"></A>
Landlords who were cleaning up their rental properties wanted to know if the government was going to provide help to them. They stated that there would need to be more rental properties available for people to live in. Those more at risk of foreclosure are considered to be the investors who will lose their rental income stream and will not be able to afford to make the mortgage payments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031732"></A>
People were advised about the recovery centres which were set up the weekend of the flood and the types of assistance that would be available. Some people wanted to know if the water was contaminated and what to do about houses that appeared unoccupied. Community leaders asked if there was any assistance for community clubs and sporting clubs which had been flood affected. Working couples who could not get insurance were not eligible for government assistance because the income test precluded them. They wanted to start repairing the damage and move back in but had no ready funds. Some community groups did not fit into the category of small business to be eligible for assistance; neither did they entirely fit into the category of not-for-profit groups because of the rental income they received from the hire of their facilities. The Premier announced assistance for these groups this morning in parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031733"></A>
Residents in units administered by a body corporate had concerns about whose responsibility it was to take out flood insurance for the complex. Depression has started to set in, with some families in a state of flux and uncertainty after the clean-up. About 75 per cent of people I spoke to did not have flood insurance or did not know whether they were covered by their policy. People have paid insurance premiums for most of their lives but they have been told that they will get nothing. Some people said that they could not get coverage because of their location. Others said that they could not afford the premium they were asking because of their location--$3,500 a year. These people will be up for considerable expense to get back into their homes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031771"></A>
Bowls clubs and other community sporting clubs act as a central hub for a large number of local groups such as the RSL, Meals on Wheels, Probus, Seniors and the like. Unless work is done to restore these flood damaged clubs, the community cannot work effectively to assist people they care for or provide support to club members in need. People who are flood affected need to have the support of people around them. </Hansard-Body>

Some of the clubs in my area that need some funds to start rebuilding are the Oxley Bowls Club, which received more than two metres of floodwater inside the buildings and on the greens; the Ukranian Centre, which was almost totally inundated; the Carrington Boat Club, which was totally inundated and its moorings were lost; the Centenary Rowing Club, which was covered by floodwater over 1 times its height and the pontoon was lost to raging waters--over the past few years $800,000 of government grants have been put into this facility to get it up and running; the Jindalee Bowls Club, which was totally inundated and the car park area severely damaged by subsidence; the Jindalee Jaguars Football Club, which was totally inundated; Centenary Little Athletics, which lost all of its valuable equipment; the Jindalee Golf Club, which had over a metre of water in the clubhouse and its course was totally inundated; the McLeod Golf Club, where the building was unscathed, however the entire course and pumping station was destroyed; the Jindalee pool, which was totally inundated; and most of the child-care centres in the area which were flooded or had families who were affected by flooding. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031773"></A>
Some of the reconstruction of these facilities will need to be done in stages due to massive costs of up to $1 million in at least one of them. All of these clubs support other community organisations and it is important that the rebuild starts immediately. This and assisting those residents who do not have any other way financially of getting back into their devastated homes are the priorities in my electorate of Mount Ommaney and a great place to start in rebuilding Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031774"></A>
The Centenary Motorway, particularly high-congestion hot-spot areas such as Sumners Road, continues to be high in priority on my list for the area. I commend the work of QBuild, which worked extremely hard to repair flooded classrooms at Oxley and Jindalee state schools. Their work on the prep classrooms, including removing the asbestos roofs at my request, the school hall at Jindalee and the prep building at Corinda State School was a massive task but was completed without fuss and without disruption to school operations. Businesses in Sumner Park and Seventeen Mile Rocks were devastated. Availability of trades and materials in the short term will be tight as costs rise. The impact of new resource projects and infrastructure is still unknown in many parts of Queensland, but any impact on projects affects job prospects and therefore the ability of Queenslanders to rebuild. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031775"></A>
Analysis by the National Australia Bank shows that the short-term impact on the economy will reduce GDP by one per cent due to lost production. This GDP loss, however, would be restored through spending on rebuilding vital infrastructure, restocking and repairs. The destruction caused by the recent floods and Queensland disasters may provide short-term work opportunities for some sectors of this industry, but there is still concern about the medium- and long-term prospects. These are challenging times for our economy and our labour market. Queensland is now undertaking an extensive rebuilding program which will mean more work and more Queensland jobs throughout 2011. Notwithstanding the enormity of the task, I praise the Premier for her drive and determination to get Queensland powering again as quickly as possible after our massive losses. I commend the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011 to the House.</Hansard-Body>

(2.43 pm): I rise to speak to the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill. I note that the opposition has indicated it will not be opposing the bill. In part we have arrived at that conclusion because we are taking the government at its word that the role of the authority will be to coordinate and manage the rebuilding and recovery of affected communities, including the repair and rebuilding of community infrastructure and other property. We have taken the government at its word that it will coordinate and cooperate with the existing local authorities, state instrumentalities, NGOs and federal agencies. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1031782"></A>
I say very bluntly that I have never seen circumstances in which the answer to the problem is just a new bureaucracy. In fact, there are considerable warnings to the government to avoid becoming embroiled in just another bureaucracy. In particular what springs to my mind is the failed Queensland Water Commission, which principally filled roles that should rightly have been carried out by local water authorities and state government agencies and which simply ended in an expensive bureaucratic mess. Queensland needs the objectives as outlined by the government implemented effectively. That is why we are working with the government’s preferred model. I hope it gets it right. The objectives as described in the notes to the bill are--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1031783"></A>
... to plan and facilitate an effective and coordinated program of reconstruction of community infrastructure and other property. The Authority will have the specific function of facilitating flood mitigation and ensuring the protection, rebuilding and recovery of disaster-affected communities is carried out effectively, efficiently and appropriately. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031784"></A>
We support those objectives, but they must be delivered as stated--effectively, efficiently and appropriately. Of course, the task before this authority is enormous as we are looking at unusual circumstances. We have communities such as those in the Lockyer and Toowoomba that were subject to flash flooding, we have communities in Brisbane that were subject to river inundation, and we have the communities in North Queensland that were affected by cyclone. The challenge to this authority goes way beyond what we could possibly have imagined following the likes of Cyclone Larry or the reconstruction of Darwin after Cyclone Tracy where the task was much more contained both geographically and in terms of the nature of the disaster threat. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031785"></A>
I commence by making comments about the communities for which I have responsibility to represent. I use the word ‘communities’, plural, deliberately because with the January 2011 natural disasters we were cut into multiple communities. I indicate at the outset that I will write to the authority and request that they visit the Moggill electorate. There are particular challenges here for disaster planning. We are large urban communities within the City of Brisbane. It is by far the largest land area of any constituency in Brisbane. We are vulnerable to an array of natural disasters and as a consequence of most, if not all, of them access will be cut, as it has been many times in the past, given that there is only a single road in and out--Moggill Road. Community infrastructure is extremely limited. For example, there is no hospital. The only police station is the one at Karana Downs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031786"></A>
I will be writing to the authority. As far as I know, during the flood crisis Brisbane’s largest constituency was not visited by a single government minister or parliamentary secretary. I will be requesting on this occasion that the authority actually visit and talk to local residents. I will be asking it to look at four things, in particular the extreme vulnerability of access on Moggill Road to these very large metropolitan communities. I understand that I have a role in ensuring local residents’ expectations are realistic. When it was brought up at a recent public meeting that we should be seeking an all-weather access road it was my responsibility to ensure that people understood that this may not be realistic, that the money involved in making Moggill Road flood-free at each of the points that are subject regularly to inundation was not likely to be forthcoming. People need a reality check. However, the current access for in excess of 30,000 people involves one very average-quality road that is simply in part a two-lane road and highly vulnerable to be cut by floodwaters, flash floods, any cyclonic or rain event, bushfire, smoke or man-made disaster such as, God forbid, a petrol tanker explosion or the like. Given the size of the community, how we improve access is well within the scope of the authority. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031787"></A>
Secondly, I will be asking it to look at and hopefully make recommendations in relation to three river crossings that are the only connection between this large area and the other side of the Brisbane River around Ipswich. They are Colleges Crossing, Moggill Ferry and Mount Crosby Weir. Whilst the case for a bridge at the Moggill Ferry is weak because most of the proponents see it as an alternative route to Brisbane without realising that most of that route between Moggill and the city of Brisbane comprises substandard roads that are already well above capacity and have no capacity to serve as an alternative route or to take additional traffic, Colleges Crossing is a different kettle of fish.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031819"></A>
Unlike the community of Moggill and Bellbowrie, the community of Karana Downs, Mount Crosby, Karalee and surrounding areas is essentially a single community divided in two by the Brisbane River. People live on one side and work on the other. The shops are on the Karalee side. Many of the people on the Karalee side attend Mount Crosby State School, one of the state’s largest primary schools. Many Karana Downs residents work in places like Amberley. The government provided high school for this area of Mount Crosby and Karana Downs is, in fact, in Ipswich as are many of the private schools. The crossings go under with the least whiff of additional water. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031824"></A>
Interestingly, I note that this issue of access was raised in the media this week. I have been corresponding with the minister to ensure that the government is aware how important this connection is and to explain the reasons for the need to upgrade it, not necessarily in the first instance to a full flood-proof bridge--I do understand the financial constraints on the state at this time. However, this major Brisbane-Ipswich road link needs to remain open to traffic when events such as planned releases of water from Wivenhoe Dam, for example, take place. Interestingly, in my correspondence as recently as November last year, the government was completely dismissive of my suggestion that we look seriously at upgrading this vital access crossing. That dismissiveness did not appear to come across in the minister’s comments this week on ABC Radio, and I hope that heralds a more open mind. The third crossing, Mount Crosby Weir, is a little local road that can sometimes stay open when Colleges Crossing is inundated. However, when I contacted Seqwater for information, for some time it did not even appear to be aware that it was one of its assets.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031828"></A>
Since I have been the representative, the large community of Moggill-Bellbowrie has been isolated on many occasions by an array of different events. The shopping centre, supermarket, medical centres and community facilities all in the Birkin Road precinct are in a low-lying area which is subject to heavy inundation during a flood. They cannot be relied on to function during any future disasters. I think the authorities should look at this situation, particularly where such a large metropolitan community is regularly cut off from the rest of Brisbane and has its main community resources under threat of inundation. It will be months before this community can even see a supermarket service restored. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031830"></A>
Other matters that the authority needs to look at include that of local and state government acquisition of high flood-risk properties. I think there are a few cases where this is necessary. However, as was illustrated in the Lockyer Valley, there are two types of flood threat to properties that the authority should consider. Properties, for example, in Kilkivan Avenue at Kenomre are subject to severe inundation whenever either Moggill Creek or the Brisbane River floods. This has happened on a number of occasions in recent years. Some of these householders have been seriously flooded twice in the last three years alone. Properties subject to this sort of inundation with any major rain event, even where it is not accompanied by flooding of the Brisbane River, should be considered for voluntary acquisition by the authority. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031833"></A>
The other issue that the authority needs to look at--and I am sure it is going to come up again and again across the state, particularly in the cyclone prone north--is the vulnerability of power supplies. One of the major problems that we confronted in this area was the loss of power for lengthy periods and, with it, information, refrigeration and the like. The issue around the Birkin Road area of Bellbowrie appears to be even a little more difficult than that around Moggill Creek in that the properties are very low lying and will be flooded any time the Brisbane River breaks its banks. However, they are not quite so exposed to the risk of flash flood. In the present environment they will be very difficult, if not impossible, to sell. I know that bank valuations have been so severely impacted that rebuilding is nearly impossible for some owners. When the valuation is hit, people cannot borrow money against it to rebuild. The authority will need to arrive at a set of criteria that could be applied to voluntary property acquisition. In my view houses subject to frequent inundation are an obvious decision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031836"></A>
Hopefully, Brisbane River floods will continue to be rare events, but I think it is now evident that we will see further Brisbane River floods perhaps two to three times in a century. Interestingly, as a former resident of Fig Tree Pocket, one factor that was significant for many Brisbane residents was that they were victims of the great myth--and I note the member for Mount Ommaney mentioned this as well--that the Brisbane River could not flood after the construction of Wivenhoe Dam. When I bought my home in that flood prone area and I expressed some reservations about the fact that it had been inundated in 1974, it was certainly said to me by many people that such properties would not flood again. It is now apparent that Wivenhoe may well be reducing the frequency and perhaps the height of Brisbane River floods, but it will in no way eliminate their possibility. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031837"></A>
As the authority seeks to achieve its goal of improving the disaster proofing of different communities I will emphasise that the only thing we can be sure of with future disasters is that we must expect the unexpected. The authority needs to be forward thinking. When I was at school we learnt a little ditty called the <Hansard-Italic>
Arkansas Traveller</Hansard-Italic>
. It went something like this. An old man sat on the porch of his shack as the rain bucketed down, flooding through a hole in his roof. The Arkansas traveller saw him as he was passing by and said to him words to the effect, ‘For goodness’ sake, man, why don’t you fix the hole in your roof? Your house is flooding.’ The resident looked up at the traveller in disbelief and said, ‘I can’t fix it now. It’s raining.’ So the traveller, not deterred, said, ‘What you should do is on the next fine sunny day get up on your roof and fix it.’ The resident looked at the traveller as though he was an idiot and said, ‘My roof doesn’t leak when it doesn’t rain.’ That is pretty much how Queensland has been run for the last 10 years. We waited until we were running out of water in a drought before we thought about spending billions in a panic to bring water supply infrastructure on line just in time for the next flooding wet cycle. We held back water despite widespread authoritative predictions that we were entering a dramatic wet La Nina. We held Wivenhoe Dam at or above 100 per cent and only after the city was flooded did we decide to release a quarter of the city’s drinking water. We decided to release it after the city had flooded, not before. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031840"></A>
Having been a resident of Darwin, I know how well people in North Queensland and in the cyclone belt are aware and plan for the known risks of cyclones. Yet in spending hundreds of millions of dollars on school building projects, including around 100 in ‘cyclone alley’, nobody in the government thought to build them to cyclone shelter standard, despite shelters having been promised after Cyclone Larry just a few years ago. Of course, it adds insult to injury when we hear ministers in this place say that these building projects should be used as cyclone shelters anyway, despite not being built to cyclone shelter standard. Also, because of the maladministration of these funds, many of these buildings do not even have walls. I do not think I would like to be in a cyclone shelter without walls. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031841"></A>
It must be a very difficult way to govern when you are only able to look backwards and not forwards. Interestingly and instructively, the $3 million allocated to the Mount Crosby State School, one of the large communities of some 12,000 or more people that was completely cut off, was not enough to buy a school hall that was actually enclosed by walls. So we saw another lost opportunity to provide the relevant community infrastructure that this very vulnerable community needs and that would be suitable for multiple purposes.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1031843"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I rise to a point of order. The member is misleading the House. The Mount Crosby State School wanted to spend $6 million when there was only $3 million available from the federal government. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Dr FLEGG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 How good would it be for the people of Mount Crosby and Karana Downs to actually complete the walls of the $3 million hall so that it could be used in disaster relief work. Sadly, that is not going to be the case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034875"></A>
The government is a genius in hindsight. It recently decided to release the drinking water component of Wivenhoe Dam but only after Brisbane was flooded, not before. Yesterday the government announced that it would reconsider its policy of not taking insurance or reinsurance. The problem is that disaster has already happened. We cannot afford to see this same sort of thinking that led to the construction of some of Queensland’s most expensive ever infrastructure for water supply such that it came on-stream after a drought, not when it was needed during a drought. Good governments plan ahead. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034879"></A>
If the next disaster is assumed to be the same as the last one, then we are doomed to make the same mistakes, responding to what has passed, not to what may or will happen in the future. Preparedness in Brisbane and the south-east appears to me to have been dramatically less than in the cyclone belt. The next natural disaster to strike the City of Brisbane--and let us hope that it is many, many years hence--could well be a cyclone. A cyclone crossing the coast has been recorded as far south as Coolangatta. Given the unpredictable paths of cyclones, at some time in the future a cyclone will hit the Brisbane area. It may well be in the very distant future--let us hope so. But it is a very real risk that needs to be factored into future planning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034881"></A>
It is a frightening prospect in an area with millions of people. In a flood we move people to higher ground, but a cyclone, however, could leave a large proportion of buildings--perhaps as high as 50 per cent--seriously damaged or destroyed. It would not be at all clear to residents of Brisbane where safety is to be found. Attempts to move to higher ground to avoid the storm surge would create chaotic circumstances and panic on our roads. Hurricane Katrina in the US is an obvious example of what can happen when these sorts of disasters hit highly populated areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034882"></A>
I have frequently been concerned about the risk of bushfire, particularly in the hillier, heavily vegetated outer suburban areas of Brisbane and South-East Queensland. Access, particularly in places like Upper Brookfield, is so tenuous that early warning and very well-planned individual bushfire responses would be critical. In fact, I identify bushfire as the highest level threat to human life throughout my area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034885"></A>
One of the key issues to be confronted by the Reconstruction Authority will be how much money is available to it. The budget for projects will be critical, particularly in their objective not to automatically replace like for like infrastructure but to consider the relocation or building of alternative natural disaster resistant infrastructure. This is an enormous task and could only realistically be approached with the possibility of having a substantial budget available for projects. It will require the authority to look ahead at the array of possible threats, not just to look back as though they are simply responding to what we have just seen--and this is a vital point. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034886"></A>
The LNP want desperately to see Queensland rebuilt. We want to see it not just patched up but rebuilt bigger, better and safer. We certainly want to see it better prepared. As LNP members, many of us representing flood and cyclone ravaged parts of Queensland, we have enormous goodwill towards the Reconstruction Authority. Whilst it is described as being an independent statutory body, clearly ministers and the government have enormous involvement. We cannot afford for the authority to lose its way or be hijacked. The members of the board have impressive and distinguished careers and have displayed great capability in their areas of expertise. We look forward to working with them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034887"></A>
Resourcing and funding will be so critical that without them the objectives of the authority can never be achieved. Queensland has seen enormous wealth during the boom that preceded the financial crisis, but we never squirrelled anything away. We never saved, pardon the pun, for a rainy day. Financial management has impaired the financial capability of the state today to respond. </Hansard-Body>

The Reconstruction Authority actually has a special function of facilitating flood mitigation and ensuring the protection, rebuilding and recovery in disaster affected communities. This is really important in our areas. This has to be looked at with clear thinking, but it has to be done quickly and it has to be done with community consultation. The people of Grantham are at the moment wondering whether they can rebuild on their blocks of land and what they can do on their blocks of land. This is something that has to be handled appropriately but it also has to be handled very quickly. Some of the older generation are saying, ‘No, we do not want to rebuild there.’ Some of the younger generation are saying, ‘Yes, of course we want to rebuild there. This is our community.’ So let us have this discussion quickly. Let us make sure the authority gets on the ground and talks to the people of Grantham and Murphys Creek and Postmans Ridge, places that have been dramatically affected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034899"></A>
I spoke with the infrastructure minister the other day. He has advised me that they are looking at some of the higher land around Grantham as being an opportunity to make some higher blocks available if people wish to build there. But it is always going to be a difficult situation with people giving over their land or selling their land. I have seen some figures where the Brisbane City Council had made an offer to buy back some flood prone areas, but a very small percentage of these flood prone blocks were taken up. It is a difficult situation--what is the market value and what else can you buy? This is something the Queensland Reconstruction Authority has to look at. How will they manage that? How will that sort of thing be managed appropriately? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034901"></A>
In some areas, the old Queenslanders did manage these floods fairly well. In my area, most of the houses that were on six-foot stumps or two-metre piers actually did survive fairly well. Houses that were on one-metre piers did not survive anywhere near as well. The reason for that was that the volumes of water that could flow underneath the higher houses were nowhere near as damaging. Some people still had water in their houses and the houses were damaged slightly, but they were nowhere near as damaged as others. Unfortunately, we now have this attitude of building low brick houses on slabs. Some houses are built on high pads, even metre-high pads, but that still did not protect them too much. My son Luke’s mate, Paul, has a brick house in Grantham and it went about 1 metres underwater. It is very difficult to lift up a brick house. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034903"></A>
I was speaking to an older gentleman in Grantham and I said to him, ‘What are you going to do? You have a brand-new brick house here. If the Reconstruction Authority advises you to lift it up, what are you going to do?’ His response was almost immediate and pretty logical I thought, too. He said, ‘I will just build a fire escape.’ I said, ‘Yeah?’ He said, ‘A fire escape in reverse. I’ll have a ladder up to the ceiling, whether up to the attic on the inside or just outside a window on the outside wall.’ When you think about it, it is fairly logical. You have fire escapes to come down out of buildings; you could have flood escapes to go up out of buildings. He said, ‘I can’t afford to build a new house, but I can afford to replace cupboards.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034905"></A>
Those are the sorts of logical things that we have to do in consultation with the community. The community has a vast amount of knowledge out there of what goes on. We will have to look at some of those areas of Postmans Ridge and Murphys Creek, where some of the smaller lifestyle blocks of land have unfortunately shown not to have an appropriate house site on them. Some of those blocks of land actually had brick houses on them that were totally washed away. That is something that the Reconstruction Authority will have to look at. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034908"></A>
We as a government will have to be compassionate about this. This might only be a one in 150-year flood or a one in a 200-year flood. I do not know. When the hydrology studies are completed, that is the sort of data we need to accurately work out what is going to happen. Also, it is totally inappropriate to try to tell people what to do, but they have to have accurate flood heights. They have to have accurate data that shows them what the flood heights are.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034909"></A>
May I make a suggestion here through you, Madam Speaker. Instead of having that airy-fairy sustainability document that has to be part of every land sale, we should actually have appropriate flood height data that goes with every land sale. We should flick the sustainability document and replace it with a flood height document. That would make a lot more sense, to replace the sustainability document with a danger document, or an emergency services document--whether it be outlining the bushfire risk or the flood height risk or whatever. The sustainability document is really a buyer beware document, because a lot of people do not know how old their air conditioner is or what sort of insulation is in their ceilings. But, really, that is never going to be life threatening to them. What is going to be life threatening to them is if their house burns down or if their house gets flooded or swept away. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037624"></A>
Surely there should be some type of appropriate data to show the purchaser of a property that the land they are looking to purchase would go under 1 metres of water in a one-in-100-year flood or in a one-in-200-year flood. That is the sort of thing they should know. How many times have we heard an old fella say, ‘I wouldn’t have built that house down there. Don’t know why those people did that’? Along comes a flood and what happens? They get 1 metres of water through their house. Locals have this information, but new people to an area do not know. This is totally appropriate to provide.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037625"></A>
I have even wondered whether a flood marker post should be at each village so that people can see the flood heights. Gatton actually has one. On the railway bridge it has a ’74 flood height marker. Unfortunately, the water this time went about 12 inches over the ’74 flood height twice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037626"></A>
That is the sort of data that I think it is imperative that people have. Unfortunately, a lot of people in the lower socioeconomic group buy these blocks of land because they are a bit cheaper in the lower ends of town. Let us give them a break. Let us not punish them for their lack of local knowledge. They think they are doing the right thing. They see a nice little house for $250,000 and buy it. They are punished eventually because they end up with problems. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037628"></A>
The Bischofs, a lovely family in Forest Hill, have one of the lower houses in their street. Unfortunately, they have had water up past the windows. When the Premier visited the area, the question they asked was whether assistance would be made available to lift up the house. A lot of houses around them have been lifted up since the ’74 flood. They bought this house without realising that the water could come up quite that high. They did not know anyone in the street to ask and were probably a bit shy to ask. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037629"></A>
Supplying flood height data is one way we can realistically assist people. I am sure the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning would be interested in that. In New South Wales, flood height data has to be supplied to people purchasing land. That is the sort of thing that would assist people. Since we are in a dry area, why do we not throw in some bushfire data as well? Those are probably two of the most pertinent pieces of data to people purchasing property. Let us be realistic about this. Let us improve the situation. </Hansard-Body>

I have spoken to the member for Ipswich, the Minister for Transport, about the railway line. The member for Toowoomba North earlier mentioned the railway line. Railway lines are important in this. I had a meeting with an engineer about the railway line. I invited a couple of the elders of the little village of Forest Hill--a town of about 300 people. The railway line is acting as a levee. I invited four people to the meeting and 40 turned up. They were accusing me of not inviting them. I said, ‘Hang on, this was supposed to be a private meeting.’ They were saying, ‘Why weren’t we invited?’ I said, ‘Because I only wanted a couple of elders to give me some local knowledge.’ Forty people turned up. They were well meaning and wanted information. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037633"></A>
When the water rushed through the levee of the railway line, the town water level dropped two feet in about 20 minutes. Those sorts of things have to be looked at. I have spoken to engineers and I have spoken to the minister about this. I know that it is important that we get this railway line rebuilt and operating, but let us do something about improving the viability of it. It has not worried us for the last 10 years, but the floods will come again. Let us work with the councils, the railways and DERM to make sure the appropriate data is available so that when the railway line is built again it does not act as a levee. That is really important. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037634"></A>
In two places I saw that this had happened--Murphys Creek and Grantham. The railway line fence was washed both ways. The wave of water hit the fence and folded it over one way and then the wave hit the railway line and the high bank and it came back and folded another part of the fence the other way. Because the railway lines have been there for 140 or 150 years, many communities are very accepting of the railway. They want to see the trains start again. I was told that the community of Forest Hill quite likes the trains and wants to see the trains running again, but they want to improve the flow of water underneath the railway line so that it does not create any angst in the town. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037635"></A>
That is the sort of data available. Because of the El Niño events over the last number of years we have moved away from undertaking appropriate management of our creeks, streams and rivers. I spoke to the Premier about this when she was in the Lockyer Valley. Wherever there is a man-made structure--wherever there is a weir or railway bridge or whatever--we have all the data about the bed height when that structure was originally put in. Let us clean out those weirs and creek beds to that level. We have the data on that. If the bed was two metres lower than it is now, that is capacity the creek does not have because the man-made structure has allowed the sand, silt or trash to bank up behind it. At the moment, if someone wanted to do that they would have to undertake an environmental study. Thousands of dollars would be tied up in that. Most of the small contractors, who might own a truck and a couple of machines, would look at that and say, ‘I might get $10,000 worth of material out of here but it will cost $8,000 or $10,000 to get an environmental report, and that might say that I cannot go ahead.’ We have to be realistic. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037636"></A>
The man-made structures have created the blockage. They have caused material to build up behind them. Let us allow contractors, with appropriate documentation, to do this work. It will actually bring some money back to the government because there will be a royalty on the soil or sand that is taken out. Let us do the common-sense things that are easy. That is what this Reconstruction Authority hopefully will come up with. Some of these common-sense things are easy to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037639"></A>
This might show the government how we can get rid of some of the red tape that exists. That is hopefully where this will lead to. We seem to be overly bureaucratic when it comes to a lot of our processes. These are the sorts of things that we want to see happen. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037640"></A>
We support the bill and the need for speed to make things happen. I am sure that things will happen appropriately. I encourage the government to make sure that the Queensland Reconstruction Authority works with local members and local councils. That is what we really want it to do. People need information about what they can do. I encourage the Reconstruction Authority to get back to the people on the ground and tell them what they can do and how they can do it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040837"></A>
I am sure that the member for Hinchinbrook and the member who represents the people of Mossman want to know what people can do. They want to know what they have to build and how they have to build it in order to get on with their lives. Apparently it is a magnificent spot. Let us give them that advantage. It is the same in Grantham and Murphys Creek and Postmans Ridge. Let us tell them what they have to build, how they have to build it or where they have to build it--set some parameters--and let them get on with their lives because that is what they want to do. This will take a couple of years. I can fully understand that. I do support the authority and the bill. I will be making an appointment to talk to the authority very shortly. </Hansard-Body>

(3.18 pm): In the face of unprecedented loss of life and destruction of property caused by the recent natural disasters, I agree with the Premier who said that the task before us is greater than any we have faced. I accept that she has brought this legislation, the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011, before this place to spearhead the work needed to help our state rebuild and recover from the forces of nature. The three actions of this bill will be to scope, to coordinate and to cut through red tape. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1037678"></A>
For the majority of my contribution today I am going to focus on some of the red tape that my constituents have encountered. I am glad that this government has identified that red tape or unnecessary bureaucratic waste as being one of the major barriers that stands in the way of swift recovery and rebuilding. We all want to see this state get back on its feet again. Throughout this speech, as I have mentioned, I am going to give practical examples of red tape my constituents are battling with. Mr Stuart Johnstone, who contacted my office today, is a primary producer and the owner of Johnstone Products located at 156 Capricornia Drive in Baffle Creek. Stuart’s property was affected and he was advised by QRAA that he would be eligible for financial assistance.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137805"></A>
However, the governing body, DEEDI, has overruled that and determined that Stuart does not fit into the flood zones. Quite understandably, Mr Johnstone is furious as he has just spent $9,000 on repairing his equipment. This morning he had to sack two employees because he will need to pay the $9,000 overdraft back to the bank. He is also annoyed that the Baffle Creek management group keeps coming to him about his dams. He has told them to go away, although he used different language, as he is no longer, according to DEEDI, within the flood boundaries involved with Baffle Creek. It appears that DEEDI has only selected some pockets of Baffle Creek, so it appears as though the email from Ravi Chandra from the Premier’s office contained false and misleading information. I am going to raise this issue with the Parliamentary Secretary for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Trade, Michael Choi, after he kindly agreed to meet with me today. However, I believe it would certainly lessen the burden of the Reconstruction Authority if these matters were dealt with. I table a letter that I have just written that I am going to send to the Premier today on behalf of Mr Johnstone and I hope that this matter can be dealt with.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1040802"></A>
As I said, I certainly hope that the burden of the Reconstruction Authority is lessened. One way it can be lessened is if the insurance companies of Queensland were a little bit less legalistic and more compassionate in their decision making so that people are able to go about the business of rebuilding and reconstructing Queensland. I have paid a compliment to an insurance company in this place, as have other members as well. We were contacted by representatives of Suncorp very early on in the piece, and I have to pay a compliment again to the Suncorp insurance company which has displayed a lot of common sense, decency and compassion. Its actions, however, are in stark contrast to another insurance company which I am going to name--Allianz--which has decided not to honour a policy of a lady I met on New Year’s Day at East Bundaberg amid the mud and the stench of the flood.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137801"></A>
Miss Jenny Shaw has five children. She paid over $100 per month for at least three years to Allianz insurance for flood insurance, so she has paid around $3,600 in premiums on her modest home in East Bundaberg and now she finds that Allianz has refused to pay her for flood damage to a maximum of $50,000. I will table the documentation that Miss Shaw received from Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1040783"></A>
Miss Jenny Shaw is an Aussie battler. She has had to fight for everything that she has received in this world. She was devastated after the flood. She is devastated by the decision of Allianz to refuse her claim. The actions of Allianz may very well be legally correct with its hydrologists and experts, but as far as being ethically or morally correct it is a long way off the mark. In support of Miss Shaw and her five children, I urge all Queenslanders to cancel their insurance policies with Allianz and to sign up with insurance companies that have shown love, respect and compassion for Queensland natural disaster victims. Allianz deserves to be strongly condemned for its actions and dealings with Miss Shaw.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1037704"></A>
I also want to bring to the attention of this chamber another issue from a constituent of mine, a retired water engineer by the name of Rod Coleridge. He wrote--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037707"></A>
Western Society now runs on debt ... this is going to make recovery very difficult.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037708"></A>
I also remind this place that this wise piece of advice can also be applied to Queensland. Our state’s record debt and the financial management which caused it are also going to make recovery very difficult. The bleeding obvious from a state finances perspective is that we were in big trouble before Yasi hit and the Christmas flooding disaster. We spent more than we earnt. We lost our AAA credit rating. We were forced into a fire sale of our state assets. We were $85 billion in debt and counting, and we are in even bigger trouble after the natural disasters. Forecasted economic growth is down by 2.25 per cent from 3.25 per cent to one per cent. There is $5 billion in damages from the flood and $800 million from Cyclone Yasi. While we need to be positive with our actions, we also cannot be delusional. We have to assess the situation in a very stark, clear, prudent manner.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037711"></A>
The first thing we would do in the recovery of Queensland is to start with a different mindset. It is different. We did things differently before the natural disasters and now we are going to do things differently again. In order to increase the chances of recovery, first of all we need to stop spending more than we earn. We need to stop borrowing. The red tape that the Premier talked about in her speech is not an orphan. We know who its parents are. If the government and the Premier were to be completely honest in their assessment of the challenges we face, they would have to take ownership or credit for the creation of the red tape that this legislation will be used to fight against. This bill is proof and acknowledgement that we have too much red tape and bureaucratic waste in Queensland. I hope this bill is also proof that this government is sincere about an attitude change in undertaking a battle against red tape in that it has created this mechanism to fight red tape, because if it is, on behalf of the people of the Burnett, then it will have my full support.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037712"></A>
Even before our flood and cyclones the issue of red tape waste had been on my mind and on the mind of my constituents, especially with the introduction of the new Wide Bay development plan which is made up of a lot of extra red tape. I assume that the clauses in this bill will be able to take on the extra red tape that the Wide Bay development plan and other development plans within different regions of Queensland will impose. If not, ultimately it leads to higher housing prices and higher rebuilding costs and, quite frankly, it puts homeownership out of the reach of young people. If we are going to rebuild and recover, we are going to have to keep housing prices as affordable and as low as possible.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037716"></A>
Most people are aware of the fact that government red tape--or, in many cases, green tape, as is becoming more and more common--is creating a shortage of housing land and is one of the main reasons why homes are becoming so expensive. There has been wide community discussion and condemnation of the state government Wide Bay development plan and I ask the Premier and Treasurer to carefully consider the submissions--the alterations--made by my community regarding the inadequacies of the current plan. I particularly mention the submissions on behalf of the Isis Chamber of Commerce by Wayne Sweeney, a draftsperson there, in consultation with the business owners and the community of Isis. It has put in a very comprehensive submission and I ask that the Premier and this authority look at those submissions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040770"></A>
During a break in a briefing on the Wide Bay draft plan I had a light-hearted chat with a Bundaberg regional councillor. While we discussed the red tape and the Wide Bay development plan and buildings, he confided in me that during an overseas holiday to visit some family in Italy last year he confessed to having one of those historical moments while standing in Rome’s Colosseum. I have never been there, but I could imagine walking in and feeling the atmosphere of the great building and while thinking about the life and death struggles, the human tragedy, the courage and the rise and fall of civilisations which occurred there of being overwhelmed by the weight of history. After the councillor shared this experience with me, I then said, ‘And as a councillor I know what else you were thinking about.’ He was not quite sure what my point was, so I continued, ‘You were also thinking, “Imagine the development application for this place.”’</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040777"></A>
Before our natural disasters, our Australian civilisation and society was in danger of crumbling--like the ruins of ancient Rome--because of unnecessary, convoluted and costly government rules. After our natural disasters, that danger has increased 1,000-fold. Our potential for greatness as a nation, as a state and as a region is being undermined by red tape and bureaucratic waste that workers, pensioners, ratepayers, home builders, businesses and developers fight with every day. After this series of natural disasters, it is not our greatness as a nation but our chance for survival that depends on our ability to get rid of red tape. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037757"></A>
I know of one recent major regional development company whose cost for up-front headworks charges was $1.6 million. That figure was reduced to $600,000 and went ahead only because a very hard-nosed CEO of the company wanting to carry out the development threatened to go public and expose the exorbitant council bill presented to him. I have feelings for that council as well, because we have to remember that this state government also removed its subsidies for capital works and vital, major pieces of infrastructure like sewerage works and the like. So the councils then have to pass on the hole in their budget to the end consumers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037758"></A>
I know that those excessive charges are not only found in local government. Yesterday, I took a delegation of local constituents and spoke about the problems that they have with a new layer of red tape--wetland declarations--which will guarantee to add tens of thousands of dollars to the cost of developing in regional coastal areas. That is tens of thousands of dollars to the costs of farming in our coastal areas. Once again, that will be a piece of red tape that this legislation will have to battle. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037759"></A>
So it appears that, although we applaud the legislation for its red tape cutting powers, already this government is out there on the other hand creating more red tape. It is like having Superwoman in charge of the red tape fight on the one hand and sprinkling kryptonite on her muesli with the other. We are competing against countries in this world and states within this country that understand the lessons of history and have kept government red tape and bureaucratic waste in check. In China, a fast-rail link just happens. I wonder if that leap into their future would have been possible if the Chinese had had to deal with Queensland red tape and bureaucratic waste. </Hansard-Body>

In the <Hansard-Italic>
Herald Sun</Hansard-Italic>
 on 4 February this year, Alan Moran wrote--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037763"></A>
Last week, the think-tank Demographia released price data for detached housing in 325 housing markets in seven countries. Prices in Melbourne and the rest of Australia were, except for land-starved Hong Kong, the highest among the countries examined. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037764"></A>
The analysis showed that to buy the average Australian house in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or Perth required 7.1 years of the average household’s income (nine years for Melbourne). For comparable US cities, it is 3.3 years, and in Britain, where houses are smaller, 5.1 years. For the sample of 82 world cities with populations over one million, Melbourne’s house prices are the 79th highest (Sydney’s are 81st). </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037765"></A>
The only problem I have with this article is that it did not examine Brisbane or Queensland house prices, but I can imagine that we are in a similar league. The article states further--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037767"></A>
Demographia demonstrated that government planning restraints creating a scarcity of housing land were the overwhelming cause of Australia’s high prices. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037768"></A>
Self-proclaimed housing experts have denied that high housing prices in Australia result from our planning and regulatory system. Some have said high prices in Australian capital cities are seen in all seaside cities.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037769"></A>
Yet house prices in US coastal cities like Houston and Tampa are a third of Melbourne’s. Inland Bendigo’s house prices are actually double those of Houston, the world’s space research centre. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037770"></A>
Some said high Australian house prices stem from low interest rates making them more affordable. Yet interest rates are far lower in Britain, the US and Canada, but houses are cheaper. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037771"></A>
Others blamed high house prices on demand pressures from immigration. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037772"></A>
But low house prices in cities like Houston, Dallas and Atlanta are accompanied by far higher immigration levels than in Australian cities. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1037773"></A>
The Demographia analysis shows the high Australian house costs are overwhelmingly caused by the high costs of land. For a block on the Melbourne outskirts planning regulations, on my reckoning, add $80,000 to the cost of a new house. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037774"></A>
Within the Bundaberg regional area and the Burnett area the UDIA has estimated that to develop a building block will cost between $25,000 and $30,000 in state government charges and local government charges whereas those charges, I believe, are capped to around $5,000 in the western suburbs of Melbourne. So we as a state are now going to compete very strongly with the rest of Australia for development money. People might decide just to walk away from Queensland if the red tape becomes too expensive and too hard. They will go. So we need to be able to create, for example, special economic zones. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037775"></A>
I talked about this issue in parliament this morning when I gave a notice a motion. I do not want to pre-empt any particular debate on that motion, except to say that we need special economic zones. Childers wants a special economic zone. Childers is a region that produces in Australia the most tomatoes, the most avocados and the most stone fruit under a single netting. If those businesses are going to be able to rebuild and develop, they need to have special economic incentives. For example, we need to be able to get rid of payroll tax. Andrew Philip, the managing director of SP Exports, who wants to build, has said, ‘You’re supposed to be paying a tax if you are making a profit. We are definitely not making a profit but we are still paying payroll tax.’ This is a holistic approach to developing this state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037780"></A>
In the brief time that I have left to me, I would like to commend Major General Mick Slater and the military for their contribution to the rebuilding. Major General Slater is on the board and also chairs the board of this Reconstruction Authority. As I have said before in this place, my only criticism is that there is not enough military. I believe it is in the national interest to have a significantly increased military. I think there were 1,500 military people--Army lads and lasses--helping out. I would have liked to have seen a lot more on that initial recovery work but I understand that, because of the small size of our military, we are constrained in a national sense in responding to these disasters and to contributing to the reconstruction. If you put together the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, they would half fill the MCG--just about 50,000 people in total. That is a very small number of people. We should have far greater members in the Defence Force. We should be looking at doubling those Defence Force numbers not only for our national protection but also from the point of view that they play a vital role in the reconstruction of our community after natural disasters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037781"></A>
We cannot afford to have any waste or red tape in order to dig ourselves out of the financial mess, the social mess that we are in. We cannot afford to do things the way we did before the flood. We need a new mindset where we do not accept waste or bureaucratic red tape. I join with the Premier, the opposition and other Independents in supporting this legislation. </Hansard-Body>

This bill delivers on Premier Anna Bligh’s promise to rebuild Queensland in the wake of the devastating floods and cyclones during December and January. We have witnessed devastation on an unprecedented scale and each of us have been touched in some way by the devastation and the tragic personal and community loss. The graphic images of tragedy, heartache, devastation and destruction that Queensland has been subjected to will not be forgotten. Massive expanses of floodwaters have consumed whole cities and communities. Whatever way you want to look at it, three-quarters of our state was affected one way or another. </A></Hansard-Body>

While we know that the floods hit mainly our cities and communities along major rivers, we also know that many communities were isolated and are still isolated by floodwaters and that this situation will remain in some instances for many weeks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043996"></A>
Whatever we think of the modern media, right across the state, the country and the world we witnessed once calm creeks turn into wild killers, tossing trees, homes and vehicles around as if they were feathers and consuming almost everything in their paths. We had a cyclone so frightening that it lifted houses from their slabs. We saw human tragedy which reduced us to tears for the pain and the loss felt by those who saw loved ones swept away in the raging waters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043997"></A>
But out of tragedy rose the Queensland spirit, the determination to not let freaks of nature beat us--real Queensland courage, real Queenslanders struggling to cope with the devastation but turning up day after day to help others they believed to be much worse off. They turned out in their thousands to lend a helping hand, to offer a shoulder to cry on or to just be there. As the Premier and my colleagues have said, rebuilding Queensland will take time and effort from each and every one of us. There will be more tears, I am sure. There will also be more stories and displays of selfless human efforts, and there will be success and there will be rejoicing. The recovery effort will require massive resources and a massive and sustained effort. I know that we the government and our fellow Queenslanders are up for the task. We cannot fail. We must rebuild those communities devastated by floods and cyclones and help those Queenslanders--our Queenslanders--who have lost so much, including loved ones, to rebuild their shattered lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043998"></A>
I am certainly proud to be part of a government that has been so involved in the way that it has to this point in time. We will continue to be a key player, working in partnership for the recovery and rebuilding efforts right across the state. We can have confidence in Major General Mick Slater and the authority he heads. We know we can have confidence in our councils which are at the coalface and the people they serve. Our councils have demonstrated so clearly to us in these past months what they are capable of.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043999"></A>
We have done it all before, albeit on a smaller scale. Queenslanders do not balk at the challenge and this is the biggest we will probably ever face. The task is daunting, rebuilding and repairing infrastructure in flood and cyclone affected communities across the state. There is little doubt about the scale of the job ahead of us. The authority will be responsible for developing and implementing a state-wide plan for rebuilding and reconnecting communities across the state. Its role will be to work with local governments and communities to ensure the unique characteristics of each community are not lost. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044001"></A>
While my electorate escaped the full force of Cyclone Yasi, many of my communities, despite the fact that they were hundreds of kilometres from where Yasi made landfall, now know something about preparation for a cyclone and what destruction it can bring. When it passed over us, its damage had already been done but it left indelibly etched in everyone’s mind the thought--and most possibly the fear--of what might have been and what had occurred to our cousins on the coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044002"></A>
Our government is a government for all Queenslanders. I have said this in this House and I will keep saying it in this House: being a member of this government and being from a far-flung electorate, I as the state member for the seat of Mount Isa do not ever feel at all isolated from my colleagues or from the people I work with right across Queensland. I am absolutely certain that under the leadership of Premier Anna Bligh we know we are up to the task of rebuilding this state. As I said, I have no doubts about that. On that note, I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

 (Bulimba--ALP) (3.44 pm): I rise to speak to the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011. It has been a sobering week in this House, listening to the stories from all members of how their electorates were affected by the recent natural disasters. These stories have of course been most extremely poignant when told by the members whose constituencies have been completely overwhelmed and who have no idea when or whether they will be able to live in their own homes and communities again. Up until this week, most of us have been used to being slowly drip-fed the stories through the media--the horror images on TV every night, the gut-wrenching stories in the newspapers and on the radio. However, in the last couple of days, we have heard the personal stories--the far, far too many specific incidents of devastation. We have heard those stories one after another until they are now in a huge pile in our heads. I know for me, although I thought I understood, I have never been more aware than now of the magnitude of the damage right across the state. This magnitude is of course why it is so critically important that we pass this Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill as soon as possible--today. </Hansard-Body>

It is clear that these communities need us to make life as easy as possible for them, to cut the red tape. There is no human reason at least why they cannot return to normality as soon as possible. Unfortunately for many, soon is not a realistic word. Many of us have felt powerless to help or make a physical difference in any way. We are not police officers, we are not emergency services personnel, we do not drive the trucks to clear away rubbish, we are not builders who can put houses back together again, we cannot build new roads. However, what we do do and what we can do is make laws that are right for our community. What is clear from this week and previously is that there are still so many stories to come about the fallout from the natural disasters--things we do not even know about yet. However, there are also the smaller scale stories which could never rival those of the devastation of whole communities but which nevertheless have huge impacts on local communities. </Hansard-Body>

 The Premier referred to one of these matters only this morning in the context of the proposed Queensland Reconstruction Authority when she talked about the plight of the CityCat terminals in Brisbane. The CityCats service an enormous number of commuters across Brisbane and provide a necessary, reliable and even enjoyable alternative to buses and trains for people living, studying, working and playing at numerous points along the river. In my own electorate of Bulimba where there was fortunately limited impact from the floods on dwellings, the much broader impacts of those floods were around public transport--and this was about the CityCats. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044016"></A>
We rely on the CityCats. They are a big part of our life. They make life easier. They help reduce traffic congestion. For some, they are the difference between a 20-minute river commute to work and a two-hour car ride. Our terminals and jetties were not so badly damaged but, nevertheless, due to the work that needed to be undertaken to ensure the river was safe, the Apollo Road, Bulimba, Hawthorne and Norman Park ferry terminals and the iconic Bulimba to Teneriffe cross-river ferry were closed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044019"></A>
I knew the fallout from the suspension of the CityCat services was going to be huge, and huge it was. The residents of my local area are good people, they are patient and they are pragmatic about why it might take awhile for such an essential service to be restored, but the disruption has been enormous. Cars have been sitting in traffic on Riding, Hawthorne and Wynnum roads for twice the time they normally would, with enormous resulting congestion on suburban streets. Despite the state government’s immediate funding for additional bus services, those services were already too full before 7.30 in the morning and were leaving commuters stranded. Children were not getting to school on time. Workers were hours late for work. The stress on people’s daily lives was enormous. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044020"></A>
 I really have to thank the transport minister again for her attentiveness to these issues when I raised them with her--issues which I am sure were being repeated in many other places. She responded immediately and was able to provide additional bus routes within days. Local residents were elated, and if she arrived in my electorate today I know she would get more than a few handshakes for making such a difference so quickly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044021"></A>
Again, we are lucky in our area. On Monday of this week, all of our local ferry services were restored, along with 11 others, including importantly most of the major destination terminals for our area--that is, Riverside and South Bank. Commuters returned to them in droves and you could feel the stress palpably lifting. This was a huge thing for a local community. Effective public transport is one of the most important elements of a functioning and happy community. When it is dramatically disrupted, life cannot be quite normal. For those numerous communities along the river which unfortunately have had their ferry terminals destroyed, this sense of functioning normally could be a long way away. That is why it is so important that we have a mechanism which expedites the rebuilding of the seven ferry terminals that are still out of action.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044022"></A>
The Premier referred this morning to the fact that since the terminals started being built 15 years ago much has been learnt about how to make them fit best with their purpose. If we are rebuilding we should use those learnings to build the most effective river transport options. Under normal circumstances the necessary approvals for this number of terminals could take just too long for a community to bear without significant stress. The Reconstruction Authority can fix this. There are hundreds, possibly thousands, of reasons that the Reconstruction Authority is so necessary. The rebuilding of the CityCat terminals is just one of these and one the residents of my electorate, including myself, know too well. I am positive they would join with me in supporting this important bill and I commend the bill to the House.</Hansard-Body>

(3.49 pm): In the sombre aftermath of the condolence motion we stand with a weighty responsibility, to ensure the rebuilding of Queensland does not suffer the mistakes of previous infrastructure programs flowing from crises. A voice of reason is not a silent voice. It is about being willing to ask the questions and demand the answers in the search for better solutions and improved delivery. With the mammoth task at hand, it is clear that rebuilding Queensland requires a far smarter approach than the disastrous execution of the South-East Queensland drought response, with its bungled $9 million water grid. No-one wants to see repeated the mistakes that still burden this state economically. The salesmanship of the water grid was slick but the delivery and the cost blowouts were not. That is one of the reasons Queenslanders are paying the price today through our water bills and the state of the budget. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1046945"></A>
There are lessons to be learned from the crisis Brisbane faced of the threat, ironically, of running out of water. At that time this parliament enacted powers in order to urgently build drought response infrastructure. The then Premier, as Treasurer and infrastructure minister, presided over most of these powers and infrastructure delivery. The powers were sold to the public as being urgent and necessary due to the short time frame and the need for coordination. The principles were correct; the execution was not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046946"></A>
There were some significant powers in relation to acquisition of land and approvals for construction. They were accompanied, though, by very poor strategic planning of the projects, scoping and cost management issues. The result was the bungled water grid, a $9 billion network of assets built without a business plan--except for a very small section--and cost blowouts of hundreds of millions of dollars. There is a pattern here that we do not want to see repeated now that Queensland faces the aftermath of yet more crises and this parliament is being asked to pass laws with very strong powers and another government body to respond and implement. We are supporting this bill because we want to see the promised outcomes of better coordination and delivery so that affected Queenslanders can get on with their lives, but we rightly do it with reservations as it has to be done differently to the government’s track record in recent years. Queenslanders deserve that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046947"></A>
It is a cruel irony that Queenslanders answered the call to prepare their houses as they faced floods and cyclones, but the government of Queensland failed to do the same for this state when it came to its own economic preparedness. The poor execution and cost control of the water grid and other infrastructure projects, as well as the overall mismanagement of the budget, combined to ironically leave this state in the worst situation in the face of natural disasters. To lose a AAA credit rating off the back of the best years of prosperity and record income is inexcusable. It meant that when the flooding rains and stormy weather came there was no money saved for a rainy day, only an $84 billion anchor around our collective feet. Our beautiful Queensland, of vibrant resources and enviable lifestyle, had been left economically exposed and vulnerable, like a cardboard house on a flood plain. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046948"></A>
A new Centre for Independent Studies analysis rates the Queensland Labor government’s financial management as the worst in the country. LNP shadow Treasurer Tim Nicholls rightly quoted this analysis today because it needs to be said. Queensland is last of all of the states in terms of spending, taxation and debt management. As he said, this report highlights a history of Labor mismanagement and incompetence which left Queensland in a vulnerable financial position before the floods and cyclone hit. Queensland, once the state that had the strongest budget position in Australia, once a state that carried no net debt, has seen this all change as a result of substantial deterioration in recent years which led to us being the only state to lose its AAA credit rating in the global financial crisis. That is worth hundreds of millions of dollars in additional interest payments. Thus, I do not want to hear government members feigning indignation if we demand accountability in the delivery of the rebuild. We support the rebuild. We want to see it done right. We want this to be about building the future for Queensland, not leaving a legacy that is a burden for future Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046949"></A>
In the lead-up to this bill being tabled this week, I sought advice from the Department of Transport and Main Roads about how the proposed authority would interact with that department, what the operational relationship would be and how they envisaged this would work. They were still to be briefed at that stage and could not answer that specific question. However, hopefully it will be clear within the corridors of power by now how these operational arrangements will be worked out. It is absolutely vital that there is clear role definition and empowerment for timely and wise decision making. It is vital that any new structure aids, not hinders, the work that needs to be undertaken. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046950"></A>
There is opportunity as well to tackle some of the big issues, not just put a bandaid on the big issues. There is an opportunity also, as natural disaster relief and recovery funding becomes available, to ensure that major issues with road networks, and freight networks in particular, in relation to flood immunity are addressed. It was somewhat disturbing to hear that the federal government was looking at rolling back projects that would have given greater flood immunity here in Queensland. I am calling on the federal and state governments to revisit the decision to re-order their priorities. We need to see a state network of roads that has greater flood immunity, not less flood immunity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046951"></A>
There is a very powerful lesson to be learned from the state being cut in half at Rockhampton recently. That is devastating not just for a handful of businesses but for all of North Queensland which is cut off from the south by road. Then, of course, the rail was cut at different times. That impacted on a wide range of businesses and people. That is still being felt, even though the floodwaters have receded. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046952"></A>
I welcome the fact that the Yeppen flood study and the Fitzroy study have been released today. We look forward to looking at those options that are on the table. It is vital that there is a cost-effective way of improving the flood immunity of that highway and other critical networks. The freight network of this state is our economic lifeline. When people start to run out of milk and food and cannot do business, they start to realise how vital it is that freight networks operate. I take this opportunity to say that it is time for that freight network to be given proper status. It must have priority in regard to upgrades and flood immunity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046953"></A>
I understand that there is still quite an amount of money not yet spent out of the natural disaster relief and recovery fund from last year’s floods. A couple of weeks ago it was estimated that $2.5 billion had been allocated and there was still a residual amount to be spent before Cyclone Yasi came along. As I understand from the last briefing, there is $4.5 billion in total for the road and rail network, though no doubt those figures will be updated as more information becomes available. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046954"></A>
I pay tribute to the hardworking transport crews who are out there in the thick of the crisis but also in the immediate aftermath. I drove between Bundaberg and Rocky recently. It is always quite an experience seeing the Bruce Highway after a lot of rain, but one would have to say that the potholes were caverns. What we hear complained about most in regard to the National Highway being a national disgrace is correct. It is time that this National Highway was finally properly funded. There is no doubt that basic maintenance funds have not been provided. There has to be urgent attention to ensure we see proper maintenance and upgrades of many critical sections of this road. What a shame that so much money was spent on pink batts which could have instead been spent on nation-building infrastructure. This is such a project and one that I would urge this state government and the federal government to pay attention to. I hear a lot about it as I am moving about the state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046985"></A>
I pay tribute to those crews that I saw undertaking the immediate repair work that had to be done as I was getting out on the road. It is hot and hard work. As we know, the weather has been steamy. It has not been pleasant weather in which to do a hard labouring job. However, they were among the many crews who were out there trying to restore our road network to allow people to get on with their lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046986"></A>
There are some issues that we need to raise with regard to communication during the height of the various disasters. We appreciate that the extent of the flooding throughout the state meant that some of the systems in place were overwhelmed. There is an opportunity to review this. It needs to be done with rigour and honesty to ensure that the communication networks, particularly for motorists, are as accurate as possible and that appropriate signage is put in place in those areas where floodwaters cross roads. For example, I heard a number of cases where B-doubles found themselves on particular routes and the ‘road closed’ signs were situated at locations where they had no hope in hell of turning their trucks around safely. We need to take heed of those learnings from quite a number of communities where this issue of communication, of improved signage and getting accurate information out to people in a timely way is so vital. We also know there was a meltdown with the phone lines and the website and that this was an issue. Certainly we support there being an appropriate review of these systems so that they can be more robust in future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137796"></A>
As I said, we have heard many reports of outstanding work done by volunteers and also state agents and state public servants. However, a complaint was circulated to me and many other members of parliament, which I will table. I note that in the heat of these issues there can be things that break down and do not go as well. I table the email from Gary Briggs from the Darling Downs. He has some quite heated feelings that there were examples where more consideration needed to be given to local knowledge. He speaks of cases where motorists were not seeking to drive in flooded waters and were not seeking to take risks but simply needed to look after their stock, and authorities need to take some consideration of their needs. I will table that. I have written to the minister on that issue as I understand this was quite a serious complaint.</Hansard-Body>

Overall, as we know, this is a big state. Most people did the right thing and they worked cooperatively. Where there are problems, they need to be worked through to ensure that people are not only able to safely and reasonably get on with their lives but also be protected where there are real and very present dangers on our roads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046995"></A>
There are many lessons to be learnt from the infrastructure that needs to be upgraded, the maintenance task and certainly cooperation with local government, which has a significant part of that rebuild on its plate. Local governments have a very small rate base but, in fact, have a very significant task at hand. We support any moves to assist them in the rollout of the timely provision of funds so that they can get their communities moving again. The issues with day labour and including that within the natural disaster relief funding has already been mentioned. If councils do not have contracting arrangements with external groups they currently are penalised because they have to use their own local labour who would be pulled off work they otherwise have to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046997"></A>
We will certainly be keen to work with communities on the many and vast issues that will arise across the state and provide our support for the rebuild. However, as I said, it must be a rebuild that is done with accountability. Where there is red tape that does not serve the purpose and it needs to be cut, let it be cut. If that red tape is a process that does not serve the general systems of government, then there is an opportunity to say that other systems that might be bogging down the normal processes need to also be overhauled. There must be clarity about the relationships of how this new authority operates. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046998"></A>
We support the legislation but we want to ensure that Queensland does not experience once again the failure of timely and appropriate spending with good scoping of projects which has left such a burden of debt. There is an opportunity to get it right this time. We want to see that Queenslanders do have a rebuild where the right decisions are made and that they are involved in the rebuild of their lives and livelihoods. </Hansard-Body>

The necessity of this bill is self-evident; it is essential to the enormous talk of rebuilding this state. What is also self-evident is the need for this to be done well and with a minimal waste of funds and resources. The real and unavoidable cost of recovery is in the billions of dollars. This is a heavy burden for a state that has had to sell off its assets to stay financially viable. We cannot afford for bureaucracy to choke the reconstruction effort before it begins. </A></Hansard-Body>

The urgency of getting our primary producers--bananas and sugar in Tully and Cardwell; livestock and agricultural in the Tablelands, Burdekin and Charters Towers--and businesses back on their feet in as short a time as possible cannot be overstated. The current vulnerability of small rural communities decimated by the floods or obliterated by winds cannot be overlooked. The failure of one of these communities is the failure of the authority and it will be judged harshly by rural communities of Queensland, who are sick of being neglected and burdened by red tape and bureaucracy. It is important that rural towns do not collapse under pointless bureaucratic delays to funding and infrastructure. These towns have suffered to the extreme and deserve better than to be passed over because they do not fall within local government boundaries. This has already happened with the rural resilience package announced by the Premier yesterday. Cattle properties in the Charters Towers Regional Council area such as Maryan Vale, Reedy Brook Station, Chudleigh Park, Craigs Pocket, Valley of Lagoons, Lamonds Lagoon and many more were directly in the path of what the Bureau of Meteorology has classified as the very destructive winds of Cyclone Yasi. It is vital to remember that the winds that hit the region were the same strength as the winds that destroyed Innisfail when Cyclone Larry went through in 2006. These stations have sustained enormous damage over vast areas. The magnitude of the clean-up is not even fully known, but early reports suggest that the bill for primary producers in the area could run into tens of millions of dollars.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137791"></A>
The Charters Towers Regional Council area was not included in the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements launched by the state and federal governments. It is very important that it is included because properties in the top end of the Charters Towers Regional Council area were hit by category 4 destructive winds. There is absolute devastation throughout that region. I table this copy showing where that cyclone went through. It clearly shows that the northern end of the Charters Towers Regional Council area copped category 4 winds but has not received that financial assistance and support. I hope that this situation is rectified and resolved urgently. The support for these people is an important issue, and there is no support for these people who have been severely smashed. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1137793"></A>
I understand that efforts are being made to rectify the oversight of these stations and that the geographical zones requiring assistance are being identified. However, it is an example of the desperate need for detailed information to be gathered from the ground to ensure accurate and efficient allocations of funds and resources. Commonsense and compassion must be the guiding principles of the reconstruction operation. The implementation of this legislation must be transparent, accountable and competent. Already we are seeing red tape and bureaucracy hampering efforts of local people in Far North Queensland to lend a hand. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047022"></A>
The BlazeAid organisation is trying to arrange a base camp at the Mount Garnet showgrounds to provide assistance to farmers in the southern Tablelands and northern Charters Towers shires who have been stranded by Cyclone Yasi. However, they are unable to do that because the dongers on the showgrounds do not comply with regulations introduced by the department of resources last year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050181"></A>
There are families who are isolated on properties that have suffered massive damage to infrastructure and they need urgent assistance. One station owner was told that he could not clear his road because his chainsaw licence had expired days previously. This is exactly the type of bureaucratic nonsense that we need to be addressing swiftly and decisively. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050184"></A>
There needs to be a practical, hands-on approach and a suspension of the excessive and unreasonable bureaucracy that has hounded recovery efforts in the past. The bill provides the authority with the power to override local government authorities. This power needs to be handled with consideration given to the superb efforts that many councils have put into disaster management so far. Local councils have the on-the-ground knowledge and local connections that are essential to the success of Queensland’s reconstruction. They have worked tirelessly coordinating the response to these disasters and have faced daily the tragedy and gut-wrenching realities of loss and heartache in their shires and regions. It would be a further tragedy for these councils to be railroaded and sidelined by outsiders who feel they can gauge the needs of these communities better than those who live and work there. The task requires cooperation, and this needs to be focused, rather than the overriding powers of the authority. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050188"></A>
I would like to raise the issue of the Gregory Development Road. It is an inland highway, stretching from Mount Garnet right down to Clermont. This inland highway is a vital link for the north and south. I have brought up before--and many local authorities have brought up--the importance of having this road fully sealed, upgraded and flood proofed. When the coast was cut off for more than six days, word got out that there was an inland highway stretching from Charters Towers right through to Mount Garnet where trucks could get their supplies backwards and forwards. When they realised this was open, it became a convoy of vehicles. We have been pushing for this for many years. There has been money allocated to it, but it is too slow in coming. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050192"></A>
I will name a few creeks that need to be built up and upgraded to flood proof this region--Hann Creek, Lolworth Creek, Fletcher Creek, Basalt River, Sandy Creek, Stockyard Creek, Snake Creek, Clarke River and other low-lying areas but only just a few. If we can raise those bridges three or four metres, that is all that would be needed and we would never have to suffer the result of the roads being cut off for long periods of time. We would have that inland highway and we would be able to get the goods, fruit and vegetables, tourism and transport to-and-fro without having the issue of it being cut off. That really needs to be looked at. The authority needs to look at this very intently. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050202"></A>
Another issue is in relation to Telstra and the mobile phone towers. This is another issue that the authority needs to look at closely. When the power goes out, then there is no power to those towers to provide the telecommunications network. As an example, when the power went out at Ravenshoe--it is bad enough when the power is out for five days, let alone having your telecommunications out for five days--one business owner in the town was smart enough to realise, before Telstra did, that the place needed a generator. So he provided his own generator which gave telecommunications back to the region. That was so simple, but that area suffered without telecommunications. Do you know what it is like for Ergon Energy to try to get into these places that have been smashed to smithereens from the cyclone? They are unable to get access and they have no communications. This issue definitely must be resolved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050205"></A>
Also, another issue is the evacuation centres and the importance of having evacuation centres. I believe that the authority needs to investigate this. Mount Garnet, which is a community of nearly 1,000 people, had no evacuation centre. It is not that they did not have a place to go but there was no appropriate evacuation centre to go to that could withstand category 3 or 4 winds that were going to come through. I believe that the council and the authority need to work very closely and find ways of getting funding to build these evacuation centres, because cyclones are not going to stop coming. They are going to keep coming. We have cyclones zooming past us all the time in North Queensland, but we have never had one of this magnitude. They will come back, and we need to be very prepared for them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050207"></A>
I wanted to bring all of those issues to the attention of the House. Later on down the track we will be hearing much more, but I hope that the authority takes note of what I have just said. </Hansard-Body>

 (Indooroopilly--LNP) (4.14 pm): I rise to speak on the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011. The bill establishes a new independent statutory authority to coordinate reconstruction of infrastructure and community recovery in areas impacted by the 2010-11 floods and Cyclone Yasi. This has been an extraordinary, devastating and heartbreaking time for our state, and the authority is needed. It has been given far-reaching powers. I acknowledge that the chair of the authority, Major General Mick Slater, has said that some of its significant powers would only be used as a last resort. The authority will advise on the ‘possible implementation’ of the recommendations of the commission of inquiry into the floods, including future flood mitigation, land use and the regulation of planning. We need to ensure that there is an effective and quick implementation of these measures and recommendations from the commission of inquiry before next summer. </Hansard-Body>

That inquiry is of the utmost importance to my community. There are many key issues that it will examine and be possibly implemented by this authority, key issues that have the utmost importance to my community and the people who were impacted by the floods--particularly the management of the Wivenhoe Dam and its flood mitigation strategy. Serious questions have been raised about that management. Andrew Dragun, the Adjunct Professor for the Australian Rivers Institute at Griffith University, said that it was unbelievable the flood mitigation capacity had not already been boosted when warning lights had been flashing since June last year. Heavy rains last year saw dam levels rise quickly well above 90 per cent, with warnings of potential flooding to come. </Hansard-Body>

 They sat back and let the waters rise. They relied on a manual and just let it happen. Only this week, after the floods, they are saying, ‘Let’s release 25 per cent of the capacity.’ They are doing that only after the floods. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr EMERSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As I was saying, unfortunately the Labor side did nothing during this process. Only after Brisbane gets flooded do they decide to release 25 per cent of the dam’s capacity. The horse has truly bolted, but for the people in my electorate and in other areas of Brisbane they suffered from the flooding because Labor once again did nothing. They look backwards; they are not good at looking forward. They cannot plan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050229"></A>
As I was saying about Andrew Dragun, heavy rains last year saw dam levels rise quickly well above 90 per cent, with warnings of potential flooding to come. Seqwater argued that the manual had ‘served us well’. The manual does not seem to differentiate between El Nino and La Nina. The rules make no allowance for rain outlook, which seems ridiculous. If you are looking at flood mitigation, surely you would be having a look at the circumstances. But once again the manual does not look at what rains are happening or what the forecasts are in terms of its strategy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050231"></A>
The decision this week to release 25 per cent of the drinking capacity of Wivenhoe Dam is an admission that releases were not properly planned before the January deluge. Let me turn to what Andrew Dragun said in an article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 on the 19th--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050233"></A>
Since last October the Wivenhoe operator has had three warnings. On October 13 the dam reached 126 per cent of capacity, on October 21 it reached 111 per cent, and on December 29 it reached 123 per cent. In each case the operator reduced the water level only to 100 per cent. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050263"></A>
The dam level was 106 per cent on the morning of Friday, 7 January. That is the Friday before the week of the floods. It reached 148 per cent on the morning of Monday, 10 January due to limited weekend releases. Over that weekend the dam increased by more than 40 per cent of its capacity but there were only limited releases. This is in the lead-up to the floods that swamped Brisbane and affected 3,500 homes in my electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050264"></A>
Experts reportedly concluded that this seriously comprised the dam’s ability to store additional run-off. The dam reached 190 per cent by Tuesday when its operators made huge and unprecedented releases to prevent the system collapsing. The <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 reported that more than 80 per cent of the flood in the Brisbane River at its peak was the direct result of a critically urgent release from the Wivenhoe Dam of almost one-third of its capacity. It was forced to do that because they did not release the water sufficiently over the previous weekend. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050265"></A>
That meant that a rain event that may have been comfortably managed by the dam if its flood compartment had been lower turned into a major flood that devastated thousands of homes. It is important that these questions about Wivenhoe Dam are answered. There are many, many people in my electorate who believe that the floodwater into their homes was caused by the mismanagement of Wivenhoe Dam. The inquiry must look at that and, of course, any recommendations of the inquiry must be implemented. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050266"></A>
There is also immense confusion over insurance. This needs to be clarified. Homeowners must take responsibility for their own decisions. But those homeowners also trusted flood maps and official assurances of low risk. Some clearly took out insurance in the belief that they were covered but have subsequently discovered that they were not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050267"></A>
This morning I heard a story of someone I saw at Fig Tree Pocket whose house was inundated. The day after the floods he said to me, ‘We have had damage but we have insurance. We will be right.’ I have subsequently learnt now that his insurance company is still not saying that it will pay out. That is a person who felt that he had done all the right things--had his house covered by taking out insurance--but unfortunately he may not get that insurance. The confusion here is that the wording is not simple. The wording is not straightforward. The wording is confusing. It needs to be resolved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050268"></A>
The authority will have responsibility for rebuilding. The sad thing about that is that this government, which is setting up this authority, has a record of failing to deliver on rebuilding and keeping promises. Its record is appalling. Safeguards promised by this government after Cyclone Larry have not been delivered. That is a perfect example of what the people of Brisbane have to look forward to. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050270"></A>
The Labor Party promised dedicated shelters for every community. They were supposed to be built as evacuation shelters after Cyclone Larry. The list of promises that emerged after Cyclone Larry and the subsequent Cyclone Summit remain largely shelved or dismissed. Only three cyclone shelters have been completed in five years.  Inertia sets in. This government makes the promises, but its record shows that it fails to deliver or breaks those promises. That is its track record. It makes promises, fails to deliver or breaks those promises. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050273"></A>
The Minister for Public Works now appears to be walking away from that promise completely. The reality is that he and Labor walked away from it as soon as the promise was made. That is what Labor does every time. It is good with the spin, it is good with the promises, but it cannot deliver, cannot plan and breaks promises. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050274"></A>
Let me turn to the flood levy. Andrew Fraser, the Treasurer, may wish to take the lead from the Minister for Public Works and Ms Boyle and also resign because he is probably the worst Treasurer--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050276"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr EMERSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The Treasurer should take the lead of the two ministers today and resign as well because is undoubtedly the worst Treasurer this state has ever seen. There is no doubt about that. He is the one who has lost our AAA credit rating. He has given us record debt. I have seen lots of Treasurers in my time and I can tell those opposite that he has the track record to show how appalling he is. He is appalling. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050278"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr EMERSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 You know that is the case. He is the one delivering the cost of living increases. It is interesting to note that those opposite are not listening to their own constituents when they say, ‘Why are we facing higher costs of living? Why are we in debt? Why are we in deficit? Why are we the only state to lose our AAA credit rating?’ It is because of the Treasurer. He is the worst Treasurer this state has ever seen. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050279"></A>
The people know it. I wish Labor knew it. Those opposite know it, but they will not admit it. He is the one who sold them out. He is the one who is going to cost them at the next election because of cost of living pressures, because of debt, because of deficit, because he has destroyed our economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050280"></A>
The Treasurer told ABC radio, ‘A new tax won’t help the flood recovery.’ Then a week later what did he say? He said he supports Julia Gillard’s new tax--the flood levy. One week he says, ‘A new tax won’t help the flood recovery.’ The next week he says, ‘Oh, no, it is okay; we welcome that tax by Julia Gillard.’ That is because the Treasurer puts his mates in Canberra in Labor ahead of Queenslanders. That is what he is concerned about--his mates in Labor, not about Queenslanders. ‘A new tax won’t help the flood recovery,’ he says and then changes his mind. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050281"></A>
Costs of living increases do not help the recovery, but he keeps delivering those. So much economic damage was done before the flood by this Treasurer, by this Labor government, by this appalling administration. It is the enemy of small business. It is the enemy of jobs. It is the enemy of the economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050282"></A>
Yesterday’s report from the Centre for Independent Studies further backed that up. What did it say? It said, ‘Queensland has been graded at the bottom of the Australian league table for financial management and can no longer lay claim to being the low tax state.’ It has not been the low tax state for some time. That used to be our cherished record--the low tax state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050283"></A>
The member for Hervey Bay would remember when we were the low tax state. The member for Morayfield probably remembers. It was before Labor got in. He remembers when we were the low tax state. We have not been for a while under Labor. </Hansard-Body>

 I feel sorry for the minister that she has a headache from the taxes that Labor keeps putting up. She is clearly concerned about the fact that Labor keeps putting more taxes on.

<A ID="pgfId-1050298"></A>
Let us go back to the Centre for Independent Studies. The analysis from the centre concludes that while Queensland once had the nation’s strongest balance sheet and until recently carried no net debt, that has changed as a result of the substantial deterioration in recent years leading to Queensland being the only state to lose its AAA credit rating through the global financial crisis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053773"></A>
Robert Carling, the author of that report, wrote in today’s <Hansard-Italic>

... Queensland have increased more taxes than they have reduced.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1053777"></A>
Queensland, despite its tax hikes, has recorded the biggest increases in debt and other financial liabilities, which helps to explain why it is the only state to have lost the prized triple-A credit rating during the global crisis.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Queensland’s fiscal predicament makes the cost of floods and cyclones more difficult for the Bligh Government to handle than if its budget management had prudently left more in reserve for contingencies such as these.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053782"></A>
That is what everyone in the community knows. They know that the meanness of the means test is because there is no money left in the bank, that this lot on the other side sent us broke in a boom, that they failed to bank the dollars and there is nothing left for contingencies like this flood. That is why the means test is so mean--because of Labor’s appalling mismanagement of our economy.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053789"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr EMERSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I was saying before the member for Keppel interjected, there is a lack of a separate ministry to oversee the reconstruction. The assumption of the portfolio by the Premier does not seem to give any accordance to the attention required of this job. It is going to be a massive job. It is an important job for the 3,500 people in my electorate whose homes were affected, the families in those homes and those people across Queensland who were affected, both those hit by the floods and those hit by the cyclone. It is a huge job. It is a priority for this state and it should be the focus of a dedicated minister. In the past we have seen this government fail to deliver on its promises or quickly break them. It needs a dedicated minister to ensure these promises are delivered and that the reconstruction does occur. Queenslanders can only hope that the authority performs better than this government with its appalling record of failure to plan and failure to deliver and an ongoing record of broken promises.</Hansard-Body>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110217_163215" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Algester--ALP) (Minister for Community Services and Housing and Minister for Women) (4.32 pm): With so many Queenslanders affected by natural disasters, it is so critical that our recovery is quick, that it is coordinated and that it is enduring, and the recovery and reconstruction are well underway. There has been an army of workers right around the state from our Public Works officers, our Department of Communities staff in the housing area and the SES workers who are checking damaged and devastated properties. That work is well underway. The planning for the reconstruction is well underway, but it is so important that the Premier has shown the leadership to set up a ministry for reconstruction that she will responsible for and to bring this bill into the House so quickly to establish the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. </A></Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053803"></A>
The public can be very confident in the fact that the recovery--the reconstruction--is well on track and well underway. Many hundreds, in fact thousands, of people around our state are experiencing their darkest days. Many people each day are living with great anxiety and uncertainty. Many people are worrying about how they are going to get through the next day and the next week, how they are going to pay for the school trip for their kids, how they are going to pay for food. It is that desperate for many families, and that is why our recovery has included so much financial support and assistance to people around the state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053805"></A>
This authority will have primary responsibility for planning, coordinating and facilitating reconstruction and recovery in disaster affected areas. One of the chief concerns for Queenslanders right around the state--and I have visited many communities in the last month or so--is getting their lives back in order by having a home in their own community, and that is certainly one of the responsibilities I have taken on as Minister for Housing. While we in this state are a very resilient and, in many cases, self-reliant people, we certainly do need assistance. I pick up on a point that the member for Indooroopilly made about means testing. Remember Cyclone Sid, member for Indooroopilly? Who was the minister for communities or families at that time? It was Kev Lingard. What did he have to say about financial assistance when Cyclone Sid hit North Queensland, particularly Townsville, in 1998? He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1053812"></A>
Disaster relief is available to people on low incomes who have suffered loss resulting from ex-Cyclone Sid. The Disaster Relief Assistance Scheme is a means tested initiative which is jointly funded by the state and Commonwealth governments.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053814"></A>
That was in 1998, when Cyclone Sid devastated Townsville and the minister was Kev Lingard. It was a means tested scheme. It has been in place for decades. Your mob did nothing to change it. That is part of the financial assistance package. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053815"></A>
But there are other sources of financial support for families. An average family--two adults and three kids--can walk out of a recovery centre with around $11,000, and that is not means tested. Why this concerns me so much is that people need confidence that help is available, and all that people like the member for Indooroopilly do is undermine that confidence and cause more anxiety and more fear. A family of two adults and three kids can either call the community recovery line or go to a community recovery centre and walk out with about $11,000 to be deposited in their account. That is the nature of the financial support that is available. There are three main sources--Centrelink, state provided funds and the Premier’s relief fund.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053816"></A>
It is irresponsible to keep touting this notion that people are not getting help. Let me give members some of the data. Over 47,000 people have received financial assistance through payments administered by my department--47,000 people. Many people have also been put up in motels and temporary accommodation, and who is picking up the tab for that? The government. That is what we do when our mates are in strife. That is what we do when our communities are in their darkest days. We give them the assistance they need. The more you keep going on about this lack of support, the more it undermines that confidence. Some people still say, ‘I didn’t know help was available.’ Do you know why some people do not know that help is available? Because they hear the ravings of your mob telling them it is not available. I urge all opposite to understand the assistance that is available. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053817"></A>
This recovery is very much an emotional recovery. We can talk about the need for bridges and roads and housing and hospitals, and many of us are planning and getting that in place. But we must also remember that people are suffering emotionally. People are in great anguish and despair, and all that people like the member for Indooroopilly are doing is fuelling that anger, fuelling that frustration, fuelling that despair and causing a lot of harm. People need to get on with their lives and rebuild their lives, and that is what this side of the House is doing. That is what this government, led by a very capable and compassionate leader, is doing, and the Reconstruction Authority is part of this recovery process.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053818"></A>
I want to inform members of the House that for communities that have been devastated, like those in the Lockyer--Grantham and others--housing is already in those places. Temporary housing and factory built housing has already been delivered to communities like Emerald and Grantham. I was in Grantham last week. I thank the member for Lockyer for the work that he is doing out there because he is not fuelling fear. But many of his colleagues are. He is being a responsible community leader. It was really pleasing to see and to hand over keys for that demountable housing in Grantham. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053822"></A>
It was really encouraging and heartening to look across the road and see the school. The schoolkids were playing. They were cajoling and pushing and shoving like all kids do, but they were there--and there are more kids at that school this year than there were last year. I understand that that school is at full attendance. Frankly, I was surprised by that because I know that many families have had to leave that community for the time being. But we are on the case. We are working with the council. We are working across our government agencies to get more housing in that community. We are looking at buying land. We are looking at putting temporary housing there so that those families can get their lives back in order and regain some sort of normality as soon as possible.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057064"></A>
We will be continuing that effort in North Queensland. Those small communities that the member for Hinchinbrook is supporting so well need support. I have been talking to Curtis Pitt and others. I will be making a trip there as soon as possible to see firsthand the needs for housing there but already, as soon as we can, we are delivering housing. Tomorrow, there will be more housing in some of those communities in North Queensland. I know from talking to Mayor Bill Shannon, the member for Hinchinbrook and others that it is so important that people not have an exodus from those communities, but that they stay in those communities, support those communities and help the recovery of those communities. Our focus is very much on working very quickly to allow people to return to those communities and have a secure and affordable roof over their heads. To achieve all of this it will be critical for the Queensland Reconstruction Authority to coordinate activities across all levels of government, including our great efforts with local government, and for all government agencies to work as closely together as possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057066"></A>
The public can have confidence that the Premier will lead Queensland through a period where we reconstruct resilient and stronger communities in Queensland. As I have said, the public can have confidence that this recovery is well underway. As the Premier said it very clearly herself, we have to put people first here. We have to put those communities first. We have to put the politics last and the red tape last. </Hansard-Body>

I rise to speak in support of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011. The main purpose of the bill is to be achieved by establishing the Queensland Reconstruction Authority to coordinate and manage the rebuilding and recovery of affected communities, including the repair and rebuilding of community infrastructure and other property; to work closely with affected communities to ensure that each community’s needs are recognised in the rebuilding and the recovery of the communities; and to develop an arrangement for sharing data across all levels of government to ensure the effective and efficient exchange of information to facilitate flood mitigation for affected communities and that the protection, rebuilding and recovery of affected communities is effectively carried out and is appropriate, having regard to the nature of the disaster event. </Hansard-Body>

The scale of damage in my electorate is small compared to that of others, but it is devastating to these who were impacted. On 11 January, water released from the North Pine Dam combined with heavy rain and a king tide caused local flash flooding, with reports of water rising to the second level of one home in just three hours. Along the North Pine River below the dam wall 10 homes were severely damaged. In fact, some of them were completely washed away. Another 65 properties were damaged in some way. Fortunately, the community worked together and there was no loss of life. Houses are condemned and there are people who have lost everything. Community groups like our fabulous pony club have been devastated and businesses have lost equipment, tools and infrastructure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057076"></A>
Of course, this devastation has been repeated over and over again across our state. But owing to the size of the area, residents feel that their issues were not highlighted or reported on as larger, more obviously affected areas were and that their plight has been made public only due to the actions of their residents association. Indeed, as their representative I found it difficult to get official reports of damage and relied on friends and contacts in the area for updates. I see the Reconstruction Authority as being a way to make sure that that does not happen again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057077"></A>
I know that help and assistance is available for all Queenslanders and the formation of the Reconstruction Authority will give confidence to all communities that they are recognised and will receive assistance through a centralised process reporting to the Premier and we will see Queensland not just restored but transformed. </Hansard-Body>

 (Hinchinbrook--LNP) (4.43 pm): I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill. The Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill proposes to establish the Queensland Reconstruction Authority to coordinate the reconstruction and recovery of the state of Queensland following the record floods in December 2010 and January 2011 and Tropical Cyclone Yasi in February 2011. In view of the scale of devastation caused by the record floods and by Cyclone Yasi, the Queensland Reconstruction Authority will be established as a new independent statutory authority to manage and coordinate the program of infrastructure reconstruction and recovery within disaster affected communities. The authority will include a dedicated North Queensland office with responsibility for reconstruction and recovery following Tropical Cyclone Yasi. Honourable members will understand and forgive me for being particularly interested in this part of the bill.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1057084"></A>
The bill proposes to give the new authority primary responsibility for coordinating, implementing and monitoring the rebuilding and recovery of communities that have been affected, damaged or destroyed by the floods and by Cyclone Yasi. It is proposed that the authority will work across all levels of government to plan and facilitate an effective and coordinated program of reconstruction of community infrastructure and other property. It is further proposed that the authority will have the specific function of facilitating flood mitigation and ensuring that the protection, rebuilding and recovery of the disaster affected communities is carried out effectively, efficiently and appropriately. In order to achieve this objective, the authority will be charged with facilitating and expediting regulatory approvals from both state and local governments to rebuild infrastructure and other property. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057085"></A>
The bill proposes to provide the authority with the power to decide priorities for community infrastructure and the community services needed for the protection, rebuilding and recovery of affected communities. The explanatory notes accompanying the bill explain that it is intended that the authority will take into account the social, economic and environmental impacts of the flood and cyclone damage and the broader needs of the community. Importantly, the bill provides for the authority to be charged with considering whether or not existing damaged infrastructure ought to be repaired, replaced with like infrastructure, relocated or re-established with natural disaster resilient infrastructure. Significantly, while local government will retain primary responsibility for land use and building approvals, the authority will be vested with significant powers to enable it to effectively fulfil its functions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057086"></A>
The authority will be provided with a suite of powers that may be exercised in declared reconstruction areas. These powers include the power to expedite both state and local government regulatory decisions and approval processes by issuing notices requiring a decision maker to make a decision or advising that the authority itself will assume responsibility for making the decision in question. These notices are based on similar powers that are exercised periodically by the Coordinator-General under the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057089"></A>
Finally, it is proposed that the authority will have the power to undertake reconstruction or development works in order to rebuild disaster affected areas of the state. In this regard, the authority will be able to undertake works under the direction of the responsible minister by regulation and will be able to acquire land in order to undertake works, implement a development scheme, or otherwise perform the authority’s functions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057090"></A>
I have taken the opportunity to put on the record an explanation of the role of the proposed Queensland Reconstruction Authority in the anticipation of many of my constituents in the Hinchinbrook electorate approaching me for such an explanation in the coming weeks and months. In particular, I believe my constituents will want to learn more about the role of the North Queensland office of the authority. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057091"></A>
In the two weeks since Yasi hit, I have travelled far and wide throughout my electorate visiting devastated communities and speaking to and listening to my constituents. During those travels I have on a number of occasions encountered Major General Mick Slater, who has been appointed chair of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. I have decided that I rather like Mick Slater and that I can have confidence in him now that he has, in many respects, the future of my electorate in his hands. Mick Slater has spent plenty of time in North Queensland. He has trained at the jungle battle school at the top of the Tully valley in my electorate. As a career soldier, Mick Slater has spent plenty of time deployed in Townsville. Mick Slater spent time supporting the reconstruction of many communities in my electorate after Cyclone Larry in 2006 under the leadership of another major general, Peter Cosgrove. I believe Mick Slater appreciates the circumstances of North Queenslanders and has considerable affection for them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1057092"></A>
As the chairman of the authority, Mick Slater also has responsibility for overseeing the rebuilding of flood affected communities in central and southern Queensland. As such, Chief Superintendent Mike Keating has been appointed the director of the North Queensland office of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. As a senior police officer in North Queensland, I have known Mike Keating on a professional basis for a number of years. I have also spoken with Mike Keating on a number of occasions since his appointment and I am similarly confident that he is more then capable of fulfilling this role. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060509"></A>
Mike Keating has been stationed in North Queensland for 20 years, including in Cairns, Innisfail, Cardwell, Tully and Townsville. In North Queensland, the test to be able to refer to yourself as a local is very tough indeed. Many hard markers in North Queensland might still not acknowledge Mike Keating as a local but after 20 years surely he would have to go pretty close. What do Major General Mick Slater and Chief Superintendent Mike Keating have in front of them? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060515"></A>
I would like to talk about my priorities and the priorities of my constituents. I would like to put these priorities to the Premier in that capacity and in her new capacity as the Minister for Reconstruction. These priorities are separate to those priorities that I have been advocating for over the last two weeks in conjunction with industry leaders and other community leaders to be part of the joint federal and state government NDRRA assistance package for businesses and primary producers. I understand the difference between the two. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060516"></A>
NDRRA assistance funding is primarily targeted at short-term assistance and at restoring existing infrastructure. It is critical that the objective of the authority is much more than short term and much more than simply restoring existing infrastructure. If the authority does not aim to substantially improve the infrastructure in the communities affected by Cyclone Yasi in my electorate, then I believe it will have failed and I will be bitterly disappointed and my constituents will be bitterly disappointed at a golden opportunity lost. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060518"></A>
I want to reiterate the urgent need for the provision of affordable housing to the cyclone ravaged communities in my electorate. On Tuesday during the condolence motion, I mentioned the urgent need to deliver affordable housing to the cyclone affected communities in my electorate, and I thank the minister for her attention to that matter. I am anxious about the pensioners, the farm workers and those people on low and fixed incomes in my electorate and their capacity to survive through this ordeal when so many of them have had their homes badly damaged. A shortage of affordable housing in my electorate will see many farm workers and award wage earners in a situation where they will have no choice but to leave their chosen community. This could lead to a serious population decline in my electorate, compromising our capacity to recover, restore and rebuild. This in turn would result in a downturn for small businesses in cyclone affected areas. As such, affordable housing is one of the key reconstruction issues in my electorate post Cyclone Yasi. I am confident that the Minister for Housing appreciates the integral nature of this issue and that she will respond effectively. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060521"></A>
The tourism industry is an industry I mentioned during my speech on the condolence motion. The difficulties that it will face in my electorate are considerable. As I mentioned the other day, they relate not only to the damage to their business premises but also to the damage to the reputation of the destination when such graphic images in the wake of Cyclone Yasi were distributed nationally and internationally. Having said that, the tourism industry knows what it needs to do to re-establish itself. The tourism industry needs a plan for the future beyond simply re-establishing the infrastructure in place before Cyclone Yasi. The tourism industry is a major employer in my electorate, but many tourism operators will be seriously considering the prospects of another lean year when deciding whether or not to reopen. What is needed is a vote of confidence in the tourism industry in the Hinchinbrook electorate. The state and federal governments need to bring forward infrastructure projects that do more than simply restore what we had before Yasi. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137786"></A>
The tourism industry has pointed directly to the urgent need to deliver much improved commercial and recreational boating facilities at Mission Beach, which is a hub of the tourism industry in my electorate. An opportunity to deliver this infrastructure was not seized upon in the reconstruction effort after Cyclone Larry in 2006. The tourism industry at Mission Beach knows what it needs. I know that Mission Beach Business and Tourism has put this proposal strongly to the government on a number of occasions, including since Cyclone Yasi. I table a copy of the briefing paper from Mission Beach Business and Tourism that I know has been put to the government since Cyclone Yasi. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<A ID="pgfId-1137787"></A>
<Hansard-Italic>
Tabled paper:</Hansard-Italic>
 Paper titled ‘Mission Beach: Surviving and Thriving post Tropical Cyclone Yasi’.</Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137788"></A>
The briefing outlines the history of disadvantage faced by Mission Beach as a tourism destination, but it also outlines its enormous potential--if only this opportunity to show confidence in the future of the Mission Beach community is embraced by the government through the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060534"></A>
We also need to bring forward the proposed eco accommodation project at Wallaman Falls, north-west of Ingham in the Herbert River district. In November 2009, the government announced its plans to pursue the development of a number of eco accommodation projects to boost visitor numbers to Queensland’s national parks. The Wallaman Falls site would be excellent. Progress on this project is overdue, although there are several sites in cyclone affected areas of my electorate that would be perfect for such projects, including the old Cardstone village site north-west of Tully and Blencoe Falls at the top of the Kirrama Range Road north-west of Cardwell. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060540"></A>
While it may sound unimportant, we also need to put a real effort into restoring roadside signage throughout the cyclone affected region that provides travellers with direction and information. This will really help tourism accommodation centres like Cardwell and Kurrimine Beach. After Cyclone Larry, tourism operators found that not having the numerous road signs that had been blown away really impacted on the ability for tourists, especially grey nomads and self-drive visitors, to navigate their way around the cyclone affected area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060544"></A>
In September last year during debate on the Disaster Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, I canvassed matters pertaining to the two most recent major natural disaster recovery efforts in my area, being Cyclone Larry in the Cassowary Coast region in 2006 and the serious flood event in the Hinchinbrook shire in 2009. The Larry reconstruction resulted in the refurbishment of the old Johnstone shire hall, a new emergency services building and a new secondary school in Innisfail. This is an outcome for the Innisfail community whereby infrastructure was put in place that was a considerable improvement on pre Larry standards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060546"></A>
In contrast, after the major flood event in the Hinchinbrook shire in 2009, I put forward, on the invitation of the Premier, a range of issues that would have improved the capacity of the Hinchinbrook shire to respond to future flood events. The hard stand area around the SES building in Ingham was sealed. Other issues that I raised included flood-free access over Palm Creek, relocating the flood prone Ingham fire station, improvements in local drainage infrastructure and improved access to the Ingham Airport. None of these things happened and it was very disappointing. They are still very important and pressing issues for emergency services in the Hinchinbrook shire, the Hinchinbrook shire council and the local residents of the Herbert River district. I would like to once again advance these projects on behalf of the communities in the Hinchinbrook shire which urgently need to have their capacity to respond to these major regular flood events improved. I am anxious that the post Yasi reconstruction experience in my electorate reflects the post Larry 2006 experience rather than the post Hinchinbrook 2009 flood experience. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060548"></A>
Along with the commercial and recreational boating infrastructure at Mission Beach, other infrastructure outcomes that I believe need to be part of the reconstruction effort include rebuilding Tully State High School, redeveloping the facilities at the showgrounds in Tully, revisiting the issue of delivering affordable sewerage in Cardwell and protecting the foreshore in Cardwell to protect the Bruce Highway and the Cardwell community. In the days after Cyclone Yasi, the Premier visited my electorate to inspect for herself the damage to the built and the natural environment. The Premier visited Tully State High School and on doing so stated that Tully State High School would have to be completely rebuilt. I have asked the Premier and the Minister for Education that I be consulted and included in the development of plans to rebuild Tully State High School. Hopefully, as happened with the secondary school in Innisfail after Larry, we can achieve a positive outcome out of a terrible experience for secondary students in the Tully district.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060559"></A>
The showgrounds in Tully are a hub of the community for many sporting clubs, the annual agricultural show, the rodeo and community events such as Relay for Life. The old pavilion at the showgrounds in Tully has been destroyed and the Stan Mackay Pavilion has been badly damaged. The Percy Pease grandstand is remarkably still standing. Percy Pease was a predecessor of mine who represented the Tully district in this place. Percy Pease was a Labor member for what was then the state seat of Herbert between 1920 and 1940. That should give the Queensland Reconstruction Authority a good indication of how old that grandstand at the showgrounds in Tully is. The Tip Byrne Indoor Sports Centre at the showgrounds is also a relic. Those two pavilions, the grandstand and the indoor sports centre at the Tully showgrounds desperately need redevelopment. This would result in a very positive outcome for the community and the Tully district, a community that has been devastated by Cyclone Yasi. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064054"></A>
The issue of affordable sewerage for the town of Cardwell has been a complicated one in recent years, since an application for SCAP funding by the former Cardwell shire council was successful in 2007. Since that time the new Cassowary Coast Regional Council has found it difficult to secure approvals from DERM to proceed with this project. Several conditions proposed by DERM have seen the estimated cost of delivering sewerage to Cardwell significantly blow out without any corresponding increase in the size of the SCAP grant. With the Cardwell community seriously damaged by Cyclone Yasi, I put it to the government and the authority that the time is absolutely right to take this opportunity, while so much reconstruction is going on in Cardwell, to deliver affordable sewerage to these terribly disadvantaged residents. The local residents cannot afford to fund the blowout in the cost of the sewerage scheme, costs driven up by regulations and conditions proposed by DERM. If this authority really can cut through the red tape, this is surely its opportunity to do so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064056"></A>
Lastly, the foreshore in Cardwell was very badly affected after Cyclone Yasi. All Queenslanders saw the extraordinary damage to the Cardwell foreshore with the eastern lane of the Bruce Highway undermined, the whole highway covered in sand and the recreational areas along the Cardwell foreshore destroyed. I have seen the damage firsthand, as has the Premier, as have other ministers, as has Major General Mick Slater and Chief Superintendent Mike Keating. The restoration and protection of the Cardwell foreshore needs to be a project that is urgently considered by the government and the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064057"></A>
The LNP opposition is committed to supporting the reconstruction of Queensland following the devastating floods in central and southern Queensland and the horrific damage caused to North Queensland by Cyclone Yasi, damage that was regrettably centred on my electorate of Hinchinbrook. That support of the LNP opposition extends to supporting the passage of this bill. I submit these infrastructure priorities to the government and the Queensland Reconstruction Authority for its consideration in good faith, in the interests of my constituents and the communities that I represent which have been so terribly affected by Cyclone Yasi. </Hansard-Body>

(5.02 pm): In rising to join the debate on the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011, I once again place on record my deep sympathy for all who were affected by the tragic natural disasters wrought upon Queensland during the summer of 2010-11. As honourable members have heard, the LNP will be offering our support for this bill as we want to progress the rebuilding of our great state as soon as possible. We are keen to help the people of Queensland affected by these floods and cyclones to move on with their lives, to regain some sort of normalcy and to have a sense of control and ownership. As honourable members have also heard, the LNP have a number of reservations about aspects of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011, especially with regard to priority items, accountability and the role the Premier will be playing. In other words, we are taking the government’s word on this for the sake of getting on with the job of helping Queenslanders recover from the massive destruction caused by one natural disaster after another. </Hansard-Body>

The floods of December 2010 and January 2011 affected more than 80 towns and cities and claimed 36 lives, with three more people missing. The Premier had already mentioned that legislation would be required to give power to the government or an established authority to allocate funds for the extensive recovery program before the fury of category 5 Cyclone Yasi was unleashed on the good folk of Hinchinbrook and surrounding areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064066"></A>
The Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011 amends the Building Act 1975, the Disaster Management Act 2003, the Integrity Act 2009, the Land Valuation Act 2010, the Public Service Act 2008 and the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971. Provisions in this bill will allow for the establishment of a single entity, a new independent statutory authority, to oversee and intervene in the reconstruction of flood affected zones, including implementation of flood mitigation recommendations, infrastructure reconstruction and social, economic and environmental recovery in the communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064072"></A>
The chair of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Board will be Major General Mick Slater. The chief executive officer will be former Coordinator-General Mr Graeme Newton. The other six positions will be held by persons with relevant and extensive experience. In essence, the authority will primarily be responsible for coordinating, implementing and monitoring the rebuilding and recovery, working across all levels of government in planning and facilitating the recovery program. These responsibilities include flood mitigation, community protection and rebuilding, expedition of regulatory approvals and setting the priorities for community infrastructure and services. As a result of the damage caused by category 5 Cyclone Yasi and Anthony before it, a dedicated North Queensland office will be set up to deal with the reconstruction in the Cassowary Coast region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064074"></A>
The authority will be separate from the commission of inquiry and not be responsible for hindsight issues. ‘Nor should it,’ I can hear many government members say. It is little wonder that this government does not want to include hindsight issues, as it reneged on its promise to the North Queensland region five years ago after the devastation of Cyclone Larry and failed to build the shelters and protection that then Premier Beattie pledged. How foolish people were to believe him. But then, these were vulnerable people--or should I say that these were resilient people caught in a vulnerable moment. They were honest, trusting people who must be feeling so much anger mixed in with their pain and despair. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064075"></A>
All in this House heard the honourable member for Rockhampton duck for cover in question time on Wednesday and again today when asked by the honourable member for Hinchinbrook to commit to release the timetable for cyclone shelters promised within 100 days of the 2006 state election. In his usual blustery, evasive manner the minister told parliament that government policy was being reviewed--an admission that the Bligh government has failed to honour its commitment to the people of Queensland. Worse still, the minister and his Labor government had left vulnerable communities exposed to the serious dangers of cyclones. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064076"></A>
I note that Minister Schwarten addressed the parliament prior to lunch, whilst I was in a stakeholder meeting, to announce his retirement and resignation from the Bligh ministry. This must have been a difficult decision for him and his family and I wish to acknowledge his service to this parliament over many years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064077"></A>
The explanatory notes inform us that the authority, which will have considerable powers, will be able to enter into contracts, to acquire, hold, deal with and dispose of property and to appoint agents and attorneys. It will advise on the possible implementation of the commission’s recommendations, including future flood mitigation, land use and regulation of planning. This is worrying. Already we are seeing escape mechanisms for the government to weasel out of fixing this mess. Surely the findings of the commission and its recommendations should be taken seriously and not risk being treated with contempt by the government if it does not like what it hears. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064078"></A>
Included in this bill is a two-year sunset clause, with transitional provisions to transfer relevant powers and responsibilities to the Coordinator-General following cessation of the authority’s operations. This bill does include a number of breaches of fundamental legislative principles, such as compulsory acquisition of land and powers to enter land. However, it is considered to be in the broader public interest for the authority to be provided with these powers in order for it to progress its undertakings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1064079"></A>
Poor direction from the minister of the day--that is, the Premier--who, together with the Treasurer, was responsible for selling Queensland’s assets in a fire sale, could spell further disaster for traumatised communities as decisions about their future float in the Premier’s hands. The authority will have a suite of powers that it would appear can be overruled by the Premier, who has decided to appoint herself as the minister for reconstruction. I guess we should have seen that coming, such is her addiction to hard hats and media opportunities. The LNP believe that it is important to have a stand-alone minister charged with such a great responsibility. The last time a Premier took charge of this was under Beattie’s rule, and I have spoken of his and his government’s trail of broken promises to North Queenslanders after Cyclone Larry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067524"></A>
It concerned me greatly, as the new shadow minister for small business, to see that small business have been pretty much ignored and left to fend for themselves until recently. Here we see a big party policy difference. The LNP is unashamedly pro small and medium sized businesses. We recognise the important role they play. This role was magnified for me in the aftermath of these terrible floods and cyclones. I note the recent announcement of a package under category D to assist small businesses and primary producers, and this is a move in the right direction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067528"></A>
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland undertook a survey of Queensland businesses for the week commencing 18 January and ending on the 25th of that month 2011 and reported on the demographics of 555 survey respondents. It has publicly stated that at this point there is no clear indication that any of the Premier’s flood appeal money will be used to assist business. CCIQ’s view is that it is better to assist the employers of flood affected victims in order to be able to offer secure, ongoing employment and, as a result, provide a livelihood rather than a one-off payment to the victim and have their employer fold. I mentioned the key findings of CCIQ’s survey during my contribution to the condolence motion for flood and cyclone victims. I will just touch on the main points again here. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067530"></A>
One in five businesses in Queensland has had to close and the average number of days that businesses were forced to close was eight. It was 31 days on average before they could return to normal operations. Like many inundated residents, most businesses are unsure if their insurance will cover them for this type of damage, with many reporting difficulty in getting clear positions on where they stand. Many businesses have suffered an indirect impact through the floods with affected customers, affected suppliers, employee inability to attend work or due to the loss of appeal of Queensland as a tourism destination. Unsurprisingly, 22 per cent of all businesses within Queensland have indicated that the floods have had a major to critical impact on their business’s viability with the very real threat of job losses. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067531"></A>
CCIQ’s recommendation is for the Premier’s flood appeal to be extended to business including those experiencing a loss of income. In addition, it believes there are many revenue neutral things that government can be doing to assist business through these difficult times. When asked what assistance is needed for impacted businesses, a very clear picture emerges. This includes financial assistance with cash flow and concessional loans from government to help businesses meet their immediate debtor obligations and a marketing campaign highlighting that Queensland is open for business and as a tourism destination is unscathed. I understand this particular initiative is underway. Deferral of tax and bank debt, flood proof infrastructure, more effort to buy and holiday locally, higher priority for business in power restoration and reduced red tape for businesses to get back up and running were further things on the list from CCIQ. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067532"></A>
It believes the financial assistance currently provided by government must change in three key ways. Firstly, in relation to the $25,000 special disaster flood assistance grant, many businesses have not been inundated with floodwater and, as such, are not eligible for this payment, yet they have experienced power outage that has prevented them from trading. The resultant loss of income is currently not a criteria for this special grant payment, yet they are experiencing significant financial hardship at present. Equally, many businesses have had their customer base decimated as a result of the floods. CCIQ believes the $25,000 should be extended to those small businesses who have been adversely affected by loss of income or are able to demonstrate significant financial hardship. Secondly, the $250,000 concessional loan via the Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority is currently only available for small businesses which have sustained damage to property, plant and equipment or stock. Many medium sized businesses have also been impacted by the floods and suffered loss of income. They, too, should be eligible for this concessional loan. CCIQ believes the $250,000 loan should be extended and possibly increased to medium sized businesses for those who are able to demonstrate serious loss of income or business hardship. Thirdly, the CCIQ says these amended measures should be immediately extended to cyclone affected businesses. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1067536"></A>
The Property Council put out a media release today stating that we had been too slow to restore confidence as images beamed across the world of a flooded South-East Queensland. These images have embedded a perception interstate that damage was so widespread that we could not possibly be back to business yet. They are calling for a bigger push by the government for a ‘back to business’ message. Just by coincidence the Treasurer put out a release mirroring this message a few hours later. </Hansard-Body>

Amendments to the Building Act of 1975 will provide--</Hansard-Body>

In order to comment on these new laws I looked back over my contribution to the Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) from September last year, which implemented the new pool safety laws. In that speech I said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067545"></A>
My colleagues and I fear that we will be back here within a year debating another change to this legislation to rectify the mistakes made by this incompetent Labor government. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067546"></A>
It only took five months, but here we are. The LNP voiced a number of concerns with the implementation of this rushed legislation during debate in September last year. However, we supported the government’s pool safety laws in good faith because we believed in the premise that every life is valuable. After all, according to the explanatory notes, the objective of the government’s pool safety reform is ‘to help reduce the incidence of pool related immersion injuries and death, particularly for children under five.’ Unlike the Bligh Labor government, our position has not changed. Labor is compromising children’s safety by postponing its own pool safety laws. Evidence shows that most drownings occur in the first 90 days of people moving to a new residence, yet properties that do not meet the new standard will be able to be rented. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067547"></A>
This government cannot have it both ways. Postponing new laws for some pool owners will add to the confusion that is already widespread in communities. Premier Bligh’s excuse that we need to use common sense in the aftermath of these disasters is flawed as is her comment that delaying the decision was practical. Since when has it been right to place practicality above a child’s safety? It was practical to allow bananas that had fallen to the ground during the cyclone to be harvested and sold, but it is an entirely different case when we are talking about a child’s safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067548"></A>
Unreasonable time frames for the implementation of these pool laws have been further impacted by flood damage, but that is no excuse to put safety, particularly that of children, on the back foot. The new laws were poorly planned in the extreme and the start date of 1 December was unachievable as there simply were not adequate numbers of qualified pool inspectors. Now we have a situation where the Premier has decided to relax the new laws to allow pool owners to lease their properties without a valid certificate. All they have to do is give the tenant a notice to say the pool may not comply with pool safety laws and may pose a risk to young children. What is this nonsense? Either it does or it does not pose a risk. It is disgraceful to play roulette with children’s lives in this manner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067549"></A>
Safety in and around pools is vital. Virtually every member of this House agreed on that premise. We need to ensure that we have a workable system that best meets that aim, not a bureaucratic headache which puts pool owners in a jam and is discriminatory to boot. Postponing these fencing laws has also affected inspectors who have invested thousands of dollars in training and gear-up only to have their small businesses put on hold, at this stage, for six months. I had a call from one fellow who has been a pool fence builder on the Gold Coast for 34 years and trained in the first pool inspector group since the new legislation. He said that all inspectors who are properly trained need to carry public indemnity insurance, which costs between $2,000 and $5,000 and only offers cover for $1 million. This man is very angry as pool safety inspectors had received no consultation or notification regarding this legislation. As the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast were spared flooding and contain a high number of swimming pools, there is a strong argument. Why is the Premier exempting them for six months while homeowners have to comply? This inspector claims postponements will have a significant impact on him and other people in his industry. He says it will be devastating to his new business. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067551"></A>
I am led to understand that almost 600 people have completed the course and with the passing of this legislation they will have trouble finding work. The Bligh government rushed through these pool laws and a rush of people trained to become qualified pool inspectors. I imagine a number have rushed to cash in on these laws using unscrupulous methods, too, passing themselves off as qualified inspectors when they are not, but that is an issue for another day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071132"></A>
Qualified inspectors on the Gold and Sunshine coasts have had their business opportunities crushed for the next six months by Labor’s actions. So much for jobs, jobs, jobs. Laws aside, the best defence against drowning accidents is constant supervision and teaching young children to swim. Parents and carers will need to be doubly vigilant in keeping a watchful eye on youngsters near pools. </Hansard-Body>

In closing, the people of Queensland are pinning their hopes on the new Reconstruction Authority to enable the process of rebuilding to advance in a timely and orderly manner. The authority has broad-ranging powers, some of these yet to be defined. There is much trust being placed in it. Likewise, it is to be hoped that the Premier will use her intervention powers wisely and that recommendations from the commission of inquiry will be adopted where possible. The LNP are wholly committed to seeing Queensland, our great state, rebuilt and powering again soon. </Hansard-Body>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110217_172045" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Gregory--LNP) (5.20 pm): In rising to speak to this unique piece of legislation, the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011, I say at the outset that it is absolutely paramount that the Reconstruction Authority has the powers to shine the spotlight on every corner of Queensland, because every corner of Queensland has been damaged and affected by the horrific events that we witnessed in this great state in December 2010 and January 2011. </A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1071143"></A>
The fact is that we in this state have been through what I termed during the condolence debate as the equivalent of a war zone. It is probably something that many of our people have never been subjected to or witnessed and I hope they do not witness again, especially the people in the Toowoomba and Lockyer region, where life was lost. Because of the wonderful work done by the police, SES and other state authorities and agencies and the prewarning that people were given, we did not have loss of life in the far north when Cyclone Yasi struck in January this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071144"></A>
The Premier and the government have created this Queensland Reconstruction Authority, which is about the reconstruction of damaged Queensland. But the plan must be to do more than just correct the problems that have been created by these disastrous events. I was at a meeting in Emerald a few weeks ago when Major General Mick Slater met with the council. The Minister for Main Roads, Craig Wallace, and the federal minister for agriculture, Senator Joe Ludwig, were also present. One thing Major General Mick Slater said that I liked was that we have to apply a bandaid treatment at the start but we are going to rebuild the infrastructure of this state to better than what it was before. That was music to my ears, because I have to say that a lot of the infrastructure of this state was crumbling, decaying and falling to pieces before this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071147"></A>
It is all very well to stand here today and be critical--and I could criticise--but, if we are going to be fair dinkum about this, it is constructive and positive comments that I believe are going to enhance the opportunity to see our great state once again become the productive and prosperous state that it once was, and still is. We do not need to get the message out there that it is not, because it is. In some areas the rail is working again, especially in the central area which you and I represent, Mr Deputy Speaker Hoolihan. Some of the coalmines are working and the ports are opening up. They are very important to the economy of this state. Some of those communities are seeing the dollars coming back in. We are seeing roads opening up in some areas, and we know of the devastation in the far north and the need there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071148"></A>
I believe that the powers of the authority have to be such that if the authority does make constructive comment then the government--both state and federal governments, in conjunction with local government--has to embrace it and make certain the necessary money is made available for the reconstruction of the infrastructure that has been damaged, ruined or destroyed. Also, we have to get the businesses in those regional areas back to full productivity. We have to get families back to being complete units within those communities and make certain that they are a functional, constructive part of their communities. As the Premier said in her second reading speech, it is about the largest communities down to the smallest communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071150"></A>
I think the devastation we witnessed in other parts of the state before the horrific events that struck South-East Queensland made a lot of people realise just how important regional Queensland is to the productivity of this great state--the coalmines, the agriculture industry, the tourism industry and all other aspects of rural and regional Queensland, where the dollars are generated for the needs of all people. There are other industries in the south-east that are vital and important. But one thing the disasters have made people aware of is that the south-east needs the regional areas of Queensland and the regional areas of Queensland need the south-east, because we are all stricken for the same obvious reason--because of a natural disaster. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071154"></A>
In areas that I represent in the far west we had highways cut off, like the Carnarvon Development Road from Roma right through to Emerald and ultimately up to Charters Towers. You could not go east to Rockhampton because the Capricorn Highway was cut at the Dawson River. You could not go west because there was no way around Chinchilla and those places. All those highways were cut. You could not go north because Rockhampton was cut off. You could not go anywhere. I think that situation demonstrates that we have to give the authority the necessary powers to identify and correct these anomalies so that in future it does not happen again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071158"></A>
When the far north of the state was cut off but you could go via Longreach when the road was open through Chinchilla, Dalby and those places and ultimately via Winton or come back in from Barcaldine to Emerald and up the Gregory Development Road to Townsville, we then saw the destruction of the road pavement with heavy transport pounding the road day in, day out. Somebody counted 87 serious potholes as well as pavement deterioration of that road in that time. That shows that the Bruce Highway is not 100 per cent flood proof in natural disasters, but it also shows that we need alternative routes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071162"></A>
In saying that, the road from Roma right through to Charters Towers--I hope the Queensland Reconstruction Authority will have a look at this artery, because it is very important--is a duplicate artery to the Bruce Highway. But it is no good without further upgrade of the Warrego Highway, which goes west from Brisbane out to Morven, joins the Landsborough Highway and ultimately goes north to Mount Isa, becoming the Barkly Highway at Cloncurry and going on through the Territory. It is a significant, main artery of Western Queensland and it is a conveyor of commerce for the whole of Australia, not just Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071169"></A>
The fact of the matter is--and I hope the Reconstruction Authority will identify this in relation to the events that happened in Toowoomba and the Lockyer Valley--that there is no time like now to identify and demonstrate to the people of Queensland and Australia that a second range crossing at Toowoomba is paramount. It has been outstanding for so long now that everybody has been embarrassed by it. Former federal governments and the current federal government have dragged the chain on it. There is no time like now to allocate the money necessary for that upgrade. The Warrego Highway, not only from here to Toowoomba but also from Toowoomba further west and right through to Roma, is an absolute disgrace. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071208"></A>
I have travelled the Bruce Highway from Brisbane to Rocky recently. That National Highway is a disgrace. On the road from Toowoomba to Dalby there are potholes that one could bury a bullock wagon in. The destruction on that road due to the heavy rain is huge. I was on that road in December and I know how disastrous it was then. The heavy rain that we have had in that region since then and the events of December and January will have further compounded the problem. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071211"></A>
Nobody should stand in the way of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority in making certain that they identify the issues in question. The crossing at Panorama Creek on the Comet River on the Carnarvon Developmental Road at Rolleston has been out for six weeks late last year and this year. During the heavy rain 24 kilometres of that road had a metre and a half of water over it. Nothing could progress along that road. Panorama Creek has been identified to the Premier and Major General Mick Slater as an important link. It must be upgraded, and the upgrade must be expedited. That road is important. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071218"></A>
I hope that the Queensland Reconstruction Authority will look at Cape River crossing on the Gregory Developmental Road between Clermont and Charters Towers. That road culvert is a low crossing. That river cuts the road there for weeks on end. It is paramount that that crossing is made a high-level crossing to allow traffic to be taken off the Bruce Highway in events like we have just witnessed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071221"></A>
There are many issues that the Queensland Reconstruction Authority is going to have to address in its area of responsibility during the two years of the authority. First and foremost, it has to get the social and environmental issues right before it can do the corrections in a lot of places. There have to be realignments of some of these roads in question so the arteries to communities can be opened up and we can make them all-weather surfaces. I know that the events of this year and late last year are extraordinary but they could occur again at a minute’s notice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071222"></A>
We saw Emerald cut off in January 2008 and we have seen it cut off in December 2010 and January 2011. I am pleased to see that my colleague the Minister for Main Roads is in the House this afternoon. I will make some positive comments, Minister. I will talk about the road infrastructure in the far western areas of the state. We have seen some patching work done on the Landsborough Highway. It was done during the wet. It is had it again because the materials are not out there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071225"></A>
For what is it worth, I believe--and this is a constructive comment--Queensland Rail should be used as a carrier of road pavement material to assist in the upgrade and maintenance of roads in the western part of my electorate, the western part of the electorate of Warrego and the electorate of Mount Isa where those pavement materials are not readily available. The cost of hauling this pavement material is a very big capital cost. Queensland Rail could haul gravel from places where we can get the good red gravel soil and drop it at strategic points along the way and then it could be hauled into these places in question and used as road base. I believe this would be a worthwhile initiative. Instead of building roads that are only going to last 10 or 20 years we could be building roads that could last 50, 60, 70 or 80 years as we have seen in the western part of the state where we have good road pavement material available. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071226"></A>
We have to get the social issues and the environmental issues sorted out so that the dollars that will be spent as the Queensland Reconstruction Authority goes about implementing the agenda that the government has directed it to implement are not wasted. There are many issues that have to be addressed. The most important issue is how we can do things better. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071228"></A>
I have examined some of the people who will be in this authority under the direction of Major General Slater. When I see people like the former director-general of Main Roads, Stephen Golding, I am very excited because he is a man who has intellectual capacity and engineering skills and an understanding of road building right across this state. He can help address some of the anomalies that have existed over the last 30, 40 or 50 years. </Hansard-Body>

 There is no doubt about that. I echo the words from the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning; he certainly is and a gentleman with it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071232"></A>
The point I make is that we have to get it right the first time. I have seen situations occur for people in my electorate, such as for people in the Arcadia Valley, and for people in the electorates of Warrego and Callide where graziers and pastoralists cannot get their cattle out. I say to Major General Slater that the situation in Emerald is that while they cannot get their cattle out, the abattoirs are not working, the cattle are not being processed and the export dollars are not coming in. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071234"></A>
I believe that the Reconstruction Authority’s first agenda item must be to identify how to make our railways and roads better when we face a disaster of this nature again. The magnitude of this disaster has been a wake-up call for all of us in Queensland. Whilst the Reconstruction Authority has the power to work with the federal, state and local governments, I urge it to take advantage of local knowledge. There is nothing better than local knowledge. There are some old timers who have been there for 40, 50 or 60 years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071235"></A>
Every cyclone, every fire and every flood is different. There are no two the same. We can witness what is going on in Darwin now. Some 27 inches of rain have fallen over the last two or three days. Please God, I hope they are not going to be subjected to what we have been subjected to in Far North, South-East or Central Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071238"></A>
The important thing is to correlate all that information--whether it is from experts or from people who live in the regions. It is paramount to get the balance right before the dollars are spent. I know the chaff is short and it is not easy to get hold of, but it has to be done correctly. When it comes to road infrastructure in the Far North and redeveloping roads in the Far North, it can cost $2 million a kilometre to build roads. In my electorate it is $250,000 to $300,000 a kilometre. We have to get the equation right so we keep the avenues of commerce open and moving. It is about creating jobs, preserving jobs and keeping people employed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071240"></A>
There are many issues. The task of the Reconstruction Authority is not easy. I talked about the conveyance of goods by rail. I hope that the Minister for Main Roads can talk about that with his engineers across the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071242"></A>
The fact of the matter is that we do have good local knowledge. That local knowledge is going to be very important in this equation. When it comes to our inland roads and our coastal roads we have to get it right. They are the main arteries. There are going to be some significant upgrades around Rockhampton and that is very good. We should all learn from our mistakes and if we do not learn from our mistakes we are not true to the cause of what we are doing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071270"></A>
I urge all of those people right across this state to join with the Queensland Reconstruction Authority and volunteer their knowledge, their information and their constructive comment to assist it to make this state great again.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071271"></A>
In the couple of minutes I have left I want to pay tribute to two of my colleagues who have announced that they will be standing down as of today--Robert Schwarten, the member for Rockhampton, and Desley Boyle, the member for Cairns. I have great respect for those two people, and Robbie and I came into this place together in 1989. He is one of the colourful blokes; he is a larrikin. But there is one thing about Robbie Schwarten: you could ring him and he would always get the job done for you. I have always found him a good neighbour and I have always found him a good mate. I know that he and Desley as the Minister for Local Government have always been there, and I thank them for that. We might disagree in this place from time to time, but after all we are all people. We are all here for a common cause--the common good of the people of Queensland. I say to both Robbie and Desley: I wish you well in the future and, whatever course you take, I trust that you will be blessed with health and happiness. It has been great working with you both.</Hansard-Body>

 (Beaudesert--TQP) (5.40 pm): I endorse the words the good member for Gregory made in his speech supporting the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011. At the outset I thank the Premier for organising the briefing to the crossbenches and thanks also to Lachlan who went more in depth alongside Graeme Newton in terms of our questions and queries before being able to fully support the bill. Naturally it was a tragedy that 36 lives were lost, and now that we have gone through the condolence motion we are now in a position to focus on the rebuild and recovery, which will undoubtedly be an enormous task ahead for each and every single person on the board, for the government and for every single MP in this parliament.</Hansard-Body>
<DIV>
<IMAGE xml:link="simple" href="2011_02_17_DAILY-55.gif" show="embed" actuate="auto"/>
</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071283"></A>
I support the bill. This is something that we have to get underway, as the member for Gregory said, constructively and efficiently. There is nothing more important--I will reiterate what the good member for Gregory has said--than local government. We have to look at that local intelligence and local knowledge to work out exactly how we are going to put the pieces together and ensure that our communities become stronger than ever. The recovery will be long and varied and there will be a lot of questions asked and there will be a lot of people still hurting, and it will not happen straightaway and it will be frustrating for many people. I wish the board every success as it puts the pieces together and oversees the enormous task ahead of it. I want to acknowledge the chair of the board, Major General Mick Slater, for the huge effort that he made throughout the tragedies of these natural disasters and the task that will be ongoing for quite some time ahead.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071286"></A>
However, I am pleased to see that the board and its unreserved powers have a sunset period of two years. That is a rational time frame in order to ensure the reconstruction is undertaken and does not go on indefinitely. That was one of my concerns from the outset, and I am satisfied that the government has thought this through. That time frame should be enough for the board to make all of those recommendations and implementations. I am also pleased to see that on the seven-member board there is an expert from the local government and planning sector and also the former CEO of Townsville council. From a local council perspective, that is critical and it is good to see that two of the seven on the board have a local government background and experience to ensure that our councils are sustained, because councils have had a rough run post amalgamations. Within a two-year period, total debt for councils rose from $2 billion to $4 billion. That doubled in a short two-year period before the natural disasters. I will certainly do everything I can to champion each and every single one of those 73 councils to ensure that they rebuild their communities and have all of the assistance from both the state and federal governments that is required to ensure that they get back on track.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071289"></A>
There will be many towns that did not get the media coverage that will need the same, if not more, not only physical support but also emotional support, because there will be many people struggling to get their lives back. Some may never be able to do that. That is something that we must bear in mind--that is, to also look at the emotional toll that it will take. After talking to some friends in Cairns, I am aware that there is a lot of concern after Cyclone Yasi about dead cattle and the influx of feral animals such as dogs and pigs. With that will come a lot of health problems as well. So it is going to be an enormous task. It is not all going to be done the way that many of the people in those towns will want it, but I am sure that with the bipartisan support of this bill this process will be in safe hands for Queenslanders as they rebuild their communities, especially the farmers. I spent quite some time with farmer Derek Schultz in Grantham. He had 60 employees, had lost all of his crops and has tens of thousands of dollars worth of repayments to make every month. When you hear stories like that right across Queensland you wonder how these people get up in the morning and embrace the day knowing that they are not only starting from scratch but starting well behind. That is something that we must also bear in mind.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071291"></A>
It is also important to note that the rebuilding efforts will be able to be done more successfully if the insurance companies can go that little bit extra above and beyond the written word in those contracts. Those insurance companies that do lend a compassionate hand and do go that little bit extra for their customers will be remembered. Last night the member for Yeerongpilly launched his campaign for compassionate insurance companies, and there will be five or six launches across the state. Those insurance companies need to lend a helping hand because it will make it that much easier to put the pieces together.</Hansard-Body>

One of the issues that has been brought to light was on the front page of the <Hansard-Italic>
Cairns Post</Hansard-Italic>
 today in an article titled ‘Hundreds of far northern tradies rally for post-Yasi jobs’. Some 300-odd people met yesterday under the organisation of Rob Fraser who addressed the crowd and demanded that the main contracts and ‘not just the crumbs’ go to locals of what the industry says is $1.2 billion in work. I say to those far northern tradies that we will be championing to ensure that that employment does go local, and I table that article.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1075010"></A>
I thank Senator Jan McLucas and the member for Leichhardt, Warren Entsch, for supporting and championing that cause and being right behind them. It is one thing to lose so much, but then it would be another to not give that work to locals so they can put the pieces together and have employment so they can earn an income. It would certainly hurt a lot of families seeing people coming in from interstate or overseas taking those local jobs. I want to stress and emphasise that it is absolutely key that we get local expertise in putting the pieces back together.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071296"></A>
I note that in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 today there is an article about the $1 million Derrabungy Creek bridge which collapsed before it was actually even officially opened. That was at a cost of $1 million and these are the sorts of stories we will see in local government right across Queensland. It is no different with the Scenic Rim Regional Council. There was an estimated $10 million worth of damage in the Scenic Rim region area caused by localised flooding. Many of the projects for the Scenic Rim have been postponed. There was a $6 million project for a new library in Beaudesert which will now be postponed for up to two years, and this is typical of what is going to happen right across councils in Queensland. However, I want to emphasise and stress that the financial sustainability of the Scenic Rim Regional Council is absolutely critical. We have seen major projects postponed. $10 million is a huge amount of money for a ratepayer base of only 17,500 homes. I have attempted to lobby the good Minister for Local Government about this. Whilst she has a good heart, she is a tough nut to crack in trying to get those boundaries changed. But I tell you what: that will be the first thing on my agenda for the new minister. I do thank the minister for executing her job well in the time that she has been the minister. As I said to her, I remember the time that she chauffeured me back from Government House. I thank her for making me feel very welcome in my first few days here in the parliament. Well done and all of the best for your future endeavours, Minister.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1071302"></A>
I have raised in the local media in Beaudesert the fact that the new satellite city of Flagstone--one of the three satellite cities that the Premier has announced, greater Flagstone at the top end of the Scenic Rim--should undoubtedly be part of the Scenic Rim Regional Council. That will then inject that council with anywhere above and beyond 40,000 ratepayer homes on top of the existing 17,500. That makes sense. There is a connectivity in terms of local communities of interest. The proposed Flagstone station runs straight into the state development area in Bromelton. Most of the localised catchment employment areas will be there, and this is one way that the government can do something positive to assist in the rebuilding and reconstruction of areas of the Scenic Rim. It is very important to realise this, and I have also raised this issue with Scenic Rim Mayor John Brent. I spoke to him last week and he said that that would be a matter that he is happy for the community to have input on to let the community decide whether it wanted to go that way.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1075212"></A>
Yarrabilba is going to the Logan City Council, which is already sustainable. It would be good to see one satellite city go to the Logan City Council area and then Flagstone and Greater Flagstone come into the area of the Scenic Rim Regional Council. It is absolutely paramount that that council has a viable ratepayer base to be able to repair a lot of the damage that has occurred in the past couple of months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075215"></A>
It is important to note also that there are some 900 kilometres of unsealed roads throughout the Scenic Rim Regional Council area. There is a huge job ahead of that council. There are also 32 bridges that are in need of urgent repair or upgrade. Certainly, many of those bridges were flooded and many roads were damaged quite heavily through localised flooding. The council will need every bit of help that it can possibly get. It only makes sense and I will certainly be lobbying both the government and the opposition in the lead-up to the state election to ensure that these boundaries are changed and that this community can once again become thriving and viable.</Hansard-Body>

This morning I gave notice that I will move a motion in relation to rebuilding Queensland and the need to look at a long-term strategy because, while we fix up the physical, in terms of the primary industries sector I think it is absolutely crucial that a campaign of ‘buy 100 per cent Queensland’ begins immediately. This sort of campaign, similar to the proudly made in Australia campaign, will certainly be able to give hope and confidence to the primary industry sector in Queensland and will ensure that the consumer is empowered by the knowledge that they can contribute to a local farmer and to the primary agricultural secretary. This is absolutely critical. There are people who are starting from scratch and some may even end up throwing in the towel. We need to give them the confidence that they are going to have 4.5 million Queenslanders backing them up. People can see the sticker on the apple or the banana to show whether it is 100 per cent Queensland made. They will then be able to make that informed choice to support local farmers. Last week I wrote to the Premier about this issue. I hope that the government can take this idea very seriously. This morning I heard the Treasurer by his words certainly encouraging Queenslanders to buy Queensland made. So I think such a campaign would be a great initiative that would be able to attain bipartisan support. It would ensure that these good farmers know that we are right behind them, that we will get them back on their feet and that we will certainly pay for the goods that they are able to produce for us. </Hansard-Body>

I want to thank the minister for the success of Wyaralong Dam and the good work that his office did in contacting my office. I would like to congratulate the CEO, Frankie Carroll, and the staff there. They did a fantastic job. Frankie Carroll was in touch with me two or three times a day right into the late hours of the night. I think I got a text at about 11.30 at night and I was wondering who was texting me. It was Frankie to let me know how the water was flowing and how it was all going. So he certainly went above and beyond his duty. As I said yesterday, this is one of the few success stories in terms of the tragedies that occurred across the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075220"></A>
One of the terms of reference that I would have liked to have seen for the board, even though it is not directly involved in the rebuilding and recovery, was that dams need to be looked at--what worked and what did not work. I know that the Wyaralong Dam certainly prevented the possible flooding of the Logan River into Logan. After the sunset clause of two years for this authority is over, it would be great to see that we can identify where flooding can best be prevented and also to look at the big picture and educate people on water usage. I think Queenslanders have been completely compliant in their water usage. In terms of water use, there is a time and place for when we can ease up a bit and loosen our belts a bit. Queenslanders have demonstrated that they can conserve water. I am a strong advocate for making sure that water charges can be decreased in a period where we have a huge influx of water. The tolls were waived for a period of a week and I think that was another good initiative of the government. Some one million vehicles went along those roadways in that period when the government waived the tolls. </Hansard-Body>

Only a couple of hours ago I received an email from a couple of people in the Cairns region. I will read out some of their concerns. I said that I would raise this issue in the parliament. I will make sure that I do that, because it would be remiss of me if I did otherwise. The email states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1075223"></A>
Southern interstate building companies have arrangements with insurance companies and they are getting the rebuilding jobs ahead of local tradesman. A Melbourne company has set up an office in Tully saying they have 5,000 jobs on the books already and have been chasing local builders to come work for them. They basically threaten them saying if they register and do the work in a timely manner they’ll get more. If not or if they knock a job back that’s offered to them they won’t offer the jobs to the tradie after that. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075224"></A>
That is a concern, and rightfully so. Certainly, I think these people need to understand that the interstate workers will not be taking precedence over those locals who are on hand and ready to be employed. Apparently, after Cyclone Larry, out-of-town tradesmen came in, undercut the locals and then took off out of town and they were not there to rectify the faults. That is something that needs to be considered in these rebuilding efforts. While people might think that they are getting a good deal in the short term, you cannot beat a local tradie who will back up any repairs or work that needs to be done in the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075225"></A>
Another email that I have received states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1075227"></A>
Also on recovery issues, they have finally started getting in to Tully heads to commence clean up. It is being reported that the military contingent has been stood down. This is a major issue as there are still many places such as Kurrimine Beach, Colwey Beach, Tully heads, Hull Heads etc that still need a lot of work and didn’t get the same media coverage as Tully etc. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075228"></A>
I have mentioned that before. A lot of small towns will be struggling. They did not get the attention and they will certainly need every bit of effort that we can stretch our resources to provide. Another concern that a lady raised was the major issue of depression. I think we need to be very mindful that there will be people going through a terrible time. We need to make sure that the rebuilding efforts are not just done physically but also emotionally. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075229"></A>
The email states further--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1075231"></A>
The cyclone went over there on the way to Mt Isa. A lot of rural properties have been smashed and the council is overwhelmed in their ability to get to these rural properties. They are having problems getting through due to the workload etc and the need for heavy machinery across such a large council area. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075232"></A>
The email goes on to state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1075234"></A>
If the army are no longer needed on the coast they could sure be used in the tablelands. There are a lot of farms etc that have had sheds and houses damaged etc that will need help with clean up but because there’s no access in yet they’re being left out. By the time the council is able to get into these areas the recovery efforts will have been scaled down and extra SES, army crews etc will have left and these farmers will be left holding the bag. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075235"></A>
I think it is important that at a state level of government we do everything that we can do to lobby the federal government to make sure that the necessary coffers are brought into local government. I am very passionate about local government. I am very passionate about the fact that local government has a lot of local intelligence and it will need every bit of assistance that it can possibly get. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075237"></A>
I congratulate Mick Slater and the team. I wish them well in the huge task ahead of them. I thank the government for moving swiftly on this bill and I also thank the opposition for supporting it in a bipartisan manner. I think it is now time to get on with the job. I wish all the best to each and every single one of those board members. My thoughts and prayers are with all of those Queenslanders who are still struggling. </Hansard-Body>

(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Infrastructure and Planning) (5.56 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011. None of us will forget the natural disasters of this summer. The recent floods left 35 dead and 70 per cent of the state impacted, while category 5 Tropical Cyclone Yasi threatened the region between council and Cairns and contributed to one fatality. The gravity of the situation and task head is apparent in the statistics. More than 5,400 houses and over 3,500 businesses have been inundated. More than 5,900 people were evacuated. There were commercial losses of $4 billion in the agricultural, tourism and mining sectors and over a $1 billion worth of cyclone damage. However, behind each of these numbers is a resident or a business owner, their families and their friends. I doubt that there is anyone in Queensland who does not know someone who has been severely impacted by the events of this summer. Few also would be unaware of the spirit experienced in the face of adversity and of the good humour and resilience that was evident from Innisfail to Indooroopilly. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075244"></A>
I now turn to the main purpose of the bill, which is the creation of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. Independent planning powers will provide the authority with the ability to slash red tape, the capacity to intervene in approval or regulatory processes and the capacity to declare designated reconstruction areas in the face of flood and cyclone recovery. These powers will help ensure that the reconstruction of impacted areas will occur as quickly and as efficiently as possible--helping Queensland get back on its feet. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075245"></A>
I welcome the appointment of Major General Mick Slater as chair of the authority board. The major general is very well suited for this role and I know that he will get the job done. We have heard great testament of his efforts already by a number of members during this debate. I further welcome the appointment of the former Coordinator-General and director-general of the Department of Infrastructure and Planning, Graeme Newton, as the chief executive officer of the authority. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075248"></A>
The real test in these circumstances is how you rebuild better, more resilient than before. To that end, I commend to the authority and the affected communities the principles of adaptive building design. As I have told this House on occasions before, the vernacular Queenslander has design features that were developed by bitter experience and typical ingenuity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075286"></A>
Late last week I joined the Premier, the Deputy Premier, the Treasurer and the Minister for Local Government--who I know would have enjoyed that meeting but who will now go on to more enjoyable opportunities--at a meeting with mayors from flood and cyclone affected areas across our state. I believe that an important role for the Queensland Reconstruction Authority is to consult and, in turn, work closely with relevant local authorities. As the Premier noted during debate on the condolence motion, our disaster management arrangements rely heavily on local responses, local people and local authorities. I highlighted the important role of day labour in local authorities during the recovery and the management of the crisis. I applaud the responses of these organisations and believe that they will continue to have a very large role to play in our recovery. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075288"></A>
Further, this bill includes three building related reforms that will assist in the flood and cyclone recovery. Firstly, it introduces a six-month exemption that will allow owners of properties with non-shared swimming pools to lease their properties without first obtaining a pool safety certificate. This will add to the stock of rental accommodation in areas where rental accommodation is most needed to rehouse flood and cyclone evacuees and accommodate tradespeople relocating to disaster affected areas to help with the recovery effort. This change is being made with the safety of children squarely in mind. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075290"></A>
Pool safety certificates remain a requirement for homes sold. This is an appropriate balance for those who have committed to the pool safety inspection business. The amendment includes a requirement for a prelease notice that alerts the new occupier of the property to the fact that the pool may not comply with the new standard and may pose a risk to children. Nothing in the exemption absolves the owner of responsibility to comply with the currently applicable pool safety laws. Further, consultation on this matter has occurred with members of the Pool Safety Council, including Hannah’s Foundation, the Local Government Association of Queensland and the Real Estate Institute of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075293"></A>
Secondly, the bill extends the ability of all hotels, motels and resorts to apply to the chief executive officer of the Department of Infrastructure and Planning to implement a pool safety management plan. It must be demonstrated that they can implement appropriate safety measures to provide child safety, such as an onsite lifeguard. Historically, this was only available to 19 resorts across Queensland. It is envisaged that this may benefit those resorts in flood and cyclone affected areas by providing them with more flexibility in relation to their duty to comply with pool safety requirements. The CEO of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council, Mr Daniel Gschwind, has advised my department that the extension of the pool safety standard exemption to all resorts will provide relief to resorts during the reconstruction and that it is very much appreciated by our very important tourism industry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075297"></A>
Finally, a transitional amendment will reinstate and validate certifying functions performed by local government building surveying technicians. Prior to 1 January 2010, these local government employees were authorised to certify buildings up to two storeys in height and a total floor area of 500 square metres. This amendment will directly benefit people in remote regional areas who require the services of local government building surveying technicians to approve flood and cyclone related building works. This will improve recovery in those communities and is another significant measure of this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075298"></A>
The bill provides for the rebuilding, recovery and reconstruction effort in the face of these terrible natural disasters. On that note, I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

The weather events of the past two months in Queensland have been unprecedented and, as such, require special and urgent action in order that our great state is rebuilt as quickly as possible. The recovery process will be a whole-of-community responsibility. As we know, all parts of affected Queensland have been hard at work getting on with the job of doing just that. This bill enables the very important recovery of critical infrastructure either by project or geographic area, and I am supportive of this. </A></Hansard-Body>

Before discussing some specific aspects of the bill, I place on record some additional comments relating to cyclone damage sustained in North Queensland and the recovery effort in the area of Townsville and North Queensland. The Townsville city area obviously sustained quite a large amount of damage. It was not as much as our northern neighbours, but we have millions and millions of dollars of roadworks and green waste to be dealt with. To give people a sense of the amount of trees that were destroyed, it is estimated that once all of the green waste is collected and mulched the city will have enough mulch to last for 10 years. We have issues with kerbs and channels, roads, potholes, sealed roads, unsealed roads, damaged parks and damage in other parts of the city. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075309"></A>
Palm Island is the other council area in my electorate that obviously sustained some damage as well. Some council buildings were damaged, lots of trees were damaged and there was foreshore damage in that area. Our councils are obviously in the process of assessing the damage and will feed into this process. I commend the Palm Island council and its local disaster management group on its communication with the Palm Island community in the lead-up to Cyclone Yasi and during and after Cyclone Yasi hit our community. The council took a proactive step to provide vouchers to people on the island so they could purchase goods from the store whilst the ATM machines were not operational. That was welcomed by people there. I thank Ergon for getting power restored to parts of Palm Island very quickly so that things could get back to normal.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075313"></A>
Our schools sustained a lot of damage. I thank Public Works, Education Queensland, Ergon Energy and all of our local teachers, staff and parents who got in and cleaned up our schools on the weekend after the cyclone. I was pleased to help the teachers and staff at the local Hermit Park State School so it could open again on the Monday morning and our kids could have some normality. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075316"></A>
For me, one of the issues of concern in the schools is that there has been a lot of damage to not only trees and fences but also shade sails. We have a very serious risk of skin cancer in the north, and it is important to me and the parents in my community that those shade structures are repaired as soon as possible. One P&amp;C group has already contacted me about this so I will take it up with the minister as soon as I have an opportunity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075318"></A>
I want insurance companies to be accountable to policyholders in the wake of the cyclone. I know of at least one insurance company that has already received over 5,000 claims. I have arranged to meet with the general manager of that insurance company because I want to make sure that people get a fair go from these companies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075319"></A>
I want to place on the record my thanks to all the people who sent messages of support and concern to us both in the lead-up to and during Yasi. In particular, I thank the Premier, the Hon. Anna Bligh, for her leadership and communication with the Queensland community during these times and for taking the time to speak to me personally in the lead-up to Yasi with advice and information about the most sensible and effective way to get people prepared in advance of Cyclone Yasi. I know that the people in Townsville and North Queensland relied on the regular updates given by the Premier and by Deputy Commissioner Ian Stewart. We thank them for providing that during the very, very scary and uncertain times of the Tuesday, the Wednesday morning and into Wednesday night.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075324"></A>
The leadership shown by the Premier during this crisis demonstrates to me that she is absolutely the right person to undertake the responsibilities of the minister in charge of the reconstruction of Queensland, and she has my full support in that. As I said, I really do want to place on the record my thanks to Deputy Commissioner Stewart. I also want to thank David Smith from Minister Neil Roberts’s office for providing his endless and tireless updates to us. It was incredible the way we could get that information. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Down>
Ms Johnstone:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 The member for Hinchinbrook is saying the same thing. We had power at different times, but getting those updates on our mobile phones was invaluable. We could get the message out to our local media outlets on different things and keep our communities as informed as possible. So thank you, David.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075329"></A>
I also want to mention the entire team at Ergon Energy. They really have gone above and beyond. It is inconceivable that a city the size of Townsville could have 85 per cent of its area without power. Parts of the HInchinbrook electorate have had the entire network blown out of the ground, and the reconstruction of that network alone will be a massive job. As far as Townsville goes, I think we are now down to a handful of people who do not have power, and my understanding is that most of those people have generators to get them through. I thank the Ergon workers for the work they did to get Magnetic Island and Palm Island restored; it was amazing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075331"></A>
The local disaster management groups of both Townsville and Palm Island made very difficult decisions in short time frames. It is a testament to the planning that goes into our counterdisaster groups that there was no loss of life during the immediate impact of Yasi, although tragically a life was lost after that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075365"></A>
It has been said that adversity brings out the very best in most people and the absolute worst in a minority of others. I was appalled when I was contacted by several workers post Yasi who could not get to work because of Cyclone Yasi and were told by their employers that they would need to take leave without pay or recreational leave for those two days. One employer even went further, saying that if workers chose not to come to work then they should not be paid. I understand that businesses have been impacted heavily by these events. However, I ask them to show some compassion and consideration to the circumstances of their staff members where they can. In some cases these workers have given up recreational leave days in the past to support other disaster relief efforts. Employees did not go to work on Wednesday or Thursday of that week, not because they did not want to but simply because it was unsafe and it would have been irresponsible for them to do so. It would have also been acting against the advice of the authorities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075366"></A>
I commend the Townsville Community Legal Service in its efforts to ensure people are protected legally by any impacts of Cyclone Yasi and our local union organisers who are also assisting affected workers. A huge number of people in our community have been assisting in the recovery that started immediately the winds died. There are a few who I want to place on the record. The Northreach Baptist Church and family emergency accommodation in Townsville saw 400 families in the week post Yasi. Food Relief NQ provided 900 boxes of food between Townsville and Innisfail. I thank the SES volunteers from all over Australia who volunteered around the clock, including my husband Carl who volunteered for a number of days. I give a special thankyou to Corrective Services. The general manager of the Townsville Show Society contacted me on Monday saying how Corrective Services had been in touch and prisoners had been out assisting in the clean-up at the Town and Country Club. This caravan park is home to 66 permanent residents. They have not been able to stay in the park since the cyclone because electricity and water services were not able to be restored due to tree damage. The show society general manager asked me to personally place on the record his thanks to those people who came in on Monday this week. Now we have 66 people who can go home, which is fantastic. The port of Townsville was operational 48 hours after the cyclone passing. This was no mean feat given the precautions they were required to take to secure port assets in advance of what could have been a catastrophic storm surge. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137777"></A>
Finally, thankyou to the people of Townsville who participated in Rescue Townsville last weekend. Hundreds of volunteers came out to work all weekend to clean up the yards and residences of people who could not do that for themselves. I was fortunate to volunteer with the team from WHK. Thankyou to those people for doing that. Thankyou to Errol Young, the team leader. I also know that there was an extensive clean-up effort on Magnetic Island. That is highlighted best by an article out of the <Hansard-Italic>
Magnetic Times</Hansard-Italic>
 that George Hirst has published online just in the last day showing how many people came out on Magnetic Island. There is a great pictorial display of the work that went on over there. That community really does pull together when it needs to. I understand that the percentage of workers who came out to volunteer was way in excess of the number on the mainland in Townsville. Well done to Magnetic Island.</Hansard-Body>

I want to place on the record again--I think I said it yesterday in the condolence motion--that it is essential to Townsville and the people of North Queensland that the small towns of Cardwell, Mission Beach, Tully and Ingham are rebuilt and receive the help they need to get back to normal as soon as possible. These small towns are founded on the jobs and industries that have been destroyed. We need our schools back up and running as soon as possible. They are the lifeblood of our regions and we could not survive in major regional centres such as Townsville without being very interconnected with those smaller communities. I wish them all the best. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075371"></A>
The Queensland Reconstruction Authority will be a statutory authority for the efficient and effective coordination of the reconstruction effort. To councils in North Queensland that may be concerned as to what that means for their local responsibilities, I assure them that local government will retain principal responsibility for local issues including local planning policy. When this is coupled with the fact that the north will have its own dedicated North Queensland office in Innisfail, more than ably led by Superintendent Mike Keating, I am confident that the views of those local communities will be well and truly heard. Others have spoken about Mike, but he really is a man for the job. He has connections with all of the communities up and down that part of the coast, and he has their respect. He is certainly more than qualified to undertake the responsibility given to him and I wish him all the best with that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075372"></A>
The bill is structured around the fundamental principle that responsibility for land use and building approvals continues to rest with the relevant local government. As the Premier said to all mayors when she met with them last week in briefing them on the intent of the authority, it is the government’s intention that these powers be used in cooperation with local councils rather than being imposed against their will. The Reconstruction Authority’s powers will be used by exception, not as a rule, and only where essential to facilitate reconstruction. Councils should see the establishment of the authority as an opportunity for mayors to have the same sort of access to the resources of the state government and its key decision makers during the recovery that they have had during the immediate disaster response. This is not about control but rather capacity building to assist local governments. It is about facilitating and not frustrating the most efficient recovery for our North Queensland communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075373"></A>
Built into the legislation are a range of mechanisms to give councils and communities a say on how the authority would operate in their towns. Before declaring a reconstruction area or a declared project the authority will consider the responsibility of local governments for land use and the granting of development approvals in each area, recognising that for the most part they will retain primary responsibility. The authority will work collaboratively with local governments and other agencies to secure approvals and to expedite reconstruction works in the first place using the existing local planning scheme. Where the authority makes its own development scheme in a reconstruction area, the authority will be required to consult with local councils and local communities about the scheme. A period of at least 30 business days will apply where the authority must publish its proposed development scheme on its website with ads in local papers to invite public submissions. The local planning schemes that councils already have in place will remain in place, with the authority’s scheme only prevailing to the extent of any inconsistencies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075374"></A>
Local governments will also retain primary responsibility for assessing and deciding development applications made under the new QRA development scheme. Councils will keep undertaking the nuts and bolts of planning in their local areas. Another mechanism available to the minister for reconstruction will be the ability to direct local governments to take an action in relation to a local planning instrument, such as making or amending a local planning instrument. This is similar to the power that exists under the Sustainable Planning Act. Again it is intended that such power be exercised at the request of a local government to fast-track the reconstruction. Before giving such a direction, however, the minister must give notice of the proposed direction to the council and give them an opportunity to make submissions about the proposed direction. This tool will allow the authority to intervene in situations where more significant interventions, such as declaring a whole development scheme, may not be warranted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075375"></A>
I am confident that the powers afforded to the authority in its interactions with local councils will be focused on harnessing the spirit of cooperation, cutting through red tape and rapidly working together to determine reconstruction priorities in order to get funding out of the door to repair the infrastructure local communities so desperately need in order to rebuild their sense of place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075376"></A>
If I could finish on something that the Minister for Housing was talking about when she was giving her speech, there are people who we are helping already in our communities. People should not think that there is no help. Just today I had a woman from Bushland Beach contact us about her rental property being uninhabitable. The Department of Communities, through community recovery, has already assisted her. People just need to ask for help. We are trying to get the information out there as much as we can. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

 (Burdekin--LNP) (6.18 pm): In speaking to the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011, I endorse the position taken by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for flood recovery in their support of this bill. As we have heard so very emotively in this chamber over the previous two days, Queensland has endured loss of life and considerable damage to public infrastructure, businesses--both rural and urban--and to people’s homes. There was a bipartisan message also that we must look to rebuild and to add resilience and robustness to various infrastructure. There was also a general statement that we must learn from these events, to look for and close the gaps, to revitalise and to look with fresh eyes and a fresh approach. There was also a feeling that we owe it to those whom we have lost and those picking up the pieces and looking to start again from whatever natural event has befallen them.</Hansard-Body>

The task is a bit like the geographical state of Queensland: it is huge. To do the state justice there needs to be a separate, dedicated, devoted minister for reconstruction. This needs to be appreciated to ensure that processes are kept on track, with no short cuts that will need to be revisited. These short cuts and oversights can cost in a financial sense but, more importantly, they create potential for future physical harm. The Premier is to shoulder this mammoth task along with the other important matters of state. While this stance may have the best of intentions, there is a question about what will be given up when there are so many and varied demands on the Premier’s very limited time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079291"></A>
With the state still in its normal wet and cyclone season, there needs to be ongoing vigilance. Flood mitigation measures and recommendations need to be prioritised once the commission of inquiry has put forward its recommendations. Effective implementation is paramount to ensure that the potential for the vagaries of the series of events leading to the Brisbane flood is minimised. Confidence needs to be restored so that such measures are implemented prior to the next wet season. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079292"></A>
The need for evacuation centres, especially in cyclone prone areas, has been discussed for many years. Following Cyclone Larry the then Labor Premier, Peter Beattie, promised the provision of specially equipped cyclone shelters from Bundaberg to the Torres Strait. I acknowledge that this is a difficult task, but there has been ample opportunity to incorporate so much more over that time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079294"></A>
The federal Labor BER program is one of these missed opportunities. Some of those buildings could have been cyclone rated. I appreciate that people cannot expect to all be housed in a cyclone shelter; that is not the point. However, we are still in a cyclone season and many people’s homes have been damaged. Should there be another system, where do those people go whilst their own homes are compromised? Not everyone may be in a position to call on others to provide safe haven during a cyclone event. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079296"></A>
Some of those BER buildings could have been built to fulfil a dual role of assisting with educational infrastructure and serving as purpose-built shelters. I am certainly aware that the Burdekin Shire Council, for one, made representations to have at least one of the BER funded facilities built to a category 5 standard. This was not done--again, an opportunity lost to build once and build well. So much for the Smart State mantra when a valid request put forward for the safety of northerners was overlooked. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079298"></A>
In his response to the member for Hinchinbrook yesterday regarding cyclone shelters we heard the Minister for Public Works gloss over and pay scant attention to the people of North Queensland. He summed up with this response--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1079301"></A>
I think we really need now to revisit this whole question in terms of whether we want to squander money on evacuation centres that will ultimately not be required. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079304"></A>
This is not helpful when the BER buildings that are in place throughout North Queensland communities could have been built for a dual purpose. A generic, one-size-fits-all approach has not been helpful with this program. North Queenslanders can now view this promise, made in good faith to people in cyclone prone areas, as one with little likelihood of being honoured. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079307"></A>
The local authorities know the grassroots issues and often feed these opportunities up for consideration and implementation. With this in mind, I note that the Queensland Reconstruction Authority has the power to override others. I further note that local government is subject to this authority as well. Overriding powers are not necessarily helpful in achieving longer term outcomes. There needs to be more consultation and acknowledgement of the issues dealt with by groups within frameworks, particularly the areas such as the local disaster management groups. These must not be ignored. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079310"></A>
This government has put authorities such as the Urban Land Development Authority up on a pedestal under the guise of undertaking meaningful two-way consultation. From my rather limited experience with the Oonoonba UDA I can say that preconceived ideas were foisted on nearby residents. Some concessions have been made after the fact, but the nearby residents are still aggrieved at the lack of true and meaningful consultation. It is very concerning that this authority could result in a similar situation. Nearby residents have had their homes devalued when there was an opportunity for the UDA to build onto the existing adjoining developments. A person who shared with me their feelings about the lack of consultation afforded by the ULDA said that it could be an acronym for ‘under Labor developments anger’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079316"></A>
With this authority there needs to be a fresh respect for the geography that has been impacted and an appreciation of the local respected people who have considered input. There is an opportunity for cooperation and consultation, and this can be carried out expediently. I certainly hope that the sentiment ‘under Labor development angers’ does not come out when this authority begins implementation of infrastructure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079318"></A>
With the approach of Cyclone Yasi as a severe category 5 system there was also the potential for a storm surge. There was a broad call for people to consider evacuation of their homes and districts. Many people heeded the call to evacuate to higher ground and many evacuated further south in an effort to ensure the safety of family members. I am aware of this exodus firsthand as I saw the many cars heading south to move away from Yasi’s path. However, once Yasi passed these same good people wanted to go home. They were confronted with road closures due to flooding associated with the cyclone. Locally, the same trouble spots came up: Sandy Gully, Yellow Gin Creek, the Barrattas, Haughton River and the reed beds. I am certainly aware that many of the local police had to deal with the frustration of these motorists who were anxious to return home and wanted to cross these closed roads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079327"></A>
I am not at all being critical of the call for evacuation. What I am pointing out is the fragile nature of the Bruce Highway in times of flooding. It has not been helpful for the federal government to cut North Queensland road funding. That will set back the ongoing push to mitigate against flooding on the Bruce Highway. The federal member for Dawson and I both voiced our concerns. We stated that ongoing improvement to the Bruce Highway in North Queensland is critical. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079332"></A>
Coming from North Queensland, I am mindful that there is little potential to fully flood-proof the Bruce Highway against one-in-50-year events and so on. That is a panacea and is a notion that is not likely any time soon. For the highway to be cut numerous times each year is not safe or efficient. Every wet season there are road closures at places such as those I have mentioned. Many of these are trouble spots that occur with minimal rain in the catchment area. This must be addressed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079333"></A>
A dedicated North Queensland office to deal with the reconstruction required following Cyclone Yasi is welcomed. This will be important to ensure that the smaller towns that were severely impacted are rebuilt within a reasonable time frame. I note that the minister will have overseeing and overriding powers. This will be inclusive of development approval and local planning instruments. These powers, if used, need to be used in a very judicious manner. Too often we have seen the overarching power of bureaucracy intervene to the detriment of long-term viability and social structure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079335"></A>
With regard to the authority advising on the possible implementation of recommendations of the commission of inquiry, any deviation from the recommendations will need to be judicious, transparent and scrutinised. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079337"></A>
In summary, the Queensland Reconstruction Authority impresses as having the best of intentions. These need to be converted into timely outcomes relevant for the geographical area concerned. Sound local input must be sought and must be utilised to ensure there is a minimum of legacy issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079338"></A>
As we are all well aware, natural events do not wait for areas to be prepared. The last two months will go down in history for the chain of events that have caused heartache, misery and cost to a great number of Queenslanders. What is important in the two-year term of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority is meaningful, less bureaucratic and sensibly prioritised outcomes to meet the real needs of Queenslanders, wherever they live. </Hansard-Body>

Mother Nature unleashed a virtual inland tsunami across the Lockyer Valley, the most violent storms bringing torrential rain with them and then, of course, Cyclone Yasi. In October last year, barely two months before these disasters, renowned weather forecaster Mr Hayden Walker said to me and my staff in my office in Buderim, ‘In relation to rainfall and floods, it’s going to be quite spectacular. And at the same time, with the increase in subdivisions, increase in roof area and loss of vegetation, the run-off will be increased. So, therefore, if you get run-off increase and the high tide, well, it’s going to be absolutely out of control. It is going to be the biggest storm season we have seen for quite some time.’ </A></Hansard-Body>

The floods affected more than 80 towns and regional cities, 36 lives were tragically lost and, indeed, there are still three more people missing. The Holmes commission of inquiry into the flood has been tasked to hand down its interim report, aimed at the pre-summer flood mitigation, this coming August. The inquiry’s final report is due in January 2012. However, as with most royal commission inquiries of this nature, it is not until the evidence is heard that the practices and procedures and the people who implement them are put under the microscope. Will we see a need for the time frame of the inquiry to be extended or will the terms of reference need to be expanded? Only then will we get some sense of whether there has been any culpability. </Hansard-Body>

This will be an open, transparent and honest review into what we have just experienced. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083452"></A>
I sincerely hope that Justice Holmes and her deputy commissioners are allowed to conduct an inquiry without any political interference leading into an election year. We shall see. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083453"></A>
Cyclone Yasi has been included in the scope of the authority since the original announcement. One dedicated office will be established in North Queensland for this purpose. The Queensland Reconstruction Authority jurisdiction only covers areas affected by the December-January floods and Cyclone Yasi. Future disaster areas can be included by regulation, but areas unaffected by the disasters are not covered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083456"></A>
The bill establishes a new independent statutory authority to coordinate reconstruction of infrastructure and community recovery in areas impacted by the floods and Cyclone Yasi. Sensibly, this bill seeks to amend the Building Act 1975 to provide a six-month exemption period, from 8 January 2011, for pool safety certificates by leasing of houses and units with non-shared pools, to extend the standard to tourist resort complexes and to restore the capacity of building surveying technicians employed by local governments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083458"></A>
The authority will not be responsible for ‘hindsight’ issues. This will be a job for the Holmes inquiry. The authority will advise on the ‘possible implications’ of the commission’s recommendations, including future flood mitigation, land use and regulation of planning. The authority will primarily be responsible for coordinating, implementing and monitoring the rebuilding and recovery. The authority will be working across all levels of government in planning and facilitating the recovery program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083460"></A>
As the authority will be working across all levels of government, the entire community is keen to know how all this reconstruction is going to be paid for. Queensland is apparently the only state in Australia that does not insure its infrastructure assets. The state Treasurer was quoted in the media two weeks ago as saying--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1083462"></A>
Previous market soundings have indicated reinsurance is not cost-effective, given Queensland’s history of natural disasters and the length of the state’s road network. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083463"></A>
Not cost-effective! I understand that the premiums for such is between $50 million and $100 million. Now, we are faced with infrastructure losses worth billions of dollars. The Treasurer further quoted that, while the state government did not buy reinsurance on the commercial market, the Treasury Insurance Fund had ‘sufficient reserves to meet the claim’. Well, it would appear not, and now the state government has had to go cap in hand to the federal government in order to fund the reconstruction of our state assets. But is that funding guaranteed? They do not seem to have a clue in Canberra. The Prime Minister and Wayne Swan say that the only way they can pay for the reconstruction after the floods is to introduce a levy. But, since Cyclone Yasi, the Prime Minister says that they can find savings in the budget to pay for the cyclone damage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083465"></A>
As I said, they do not have a clue in Canberra how disaster funding will pan out. For one disaster they say we need a levy. Another disaster comes along and they say they can fund it from savings in the budget. And the flood levy has no certainty of getting through the federal parliament. It was reported only yesterday that the Independents and some of the Greens are having second thoughts about the imposition of a flood levy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083466"></A>
I mentioned earlier that the Reconstruction Authority will advise on the ‘possible implementation’ of the commission’s recommendations including the regulation of planning. Let us not forget that weather experts are telling us that we can expect cyclones all along the South-East Queensland coast possibly this year and into the future. In relation to the planning for future infrastructure needs, do we continue to build infrastructure on flood plains and other areas that are prone to cyclone generated flooding? Look at what happened during Cyclone Yasi with patients and staff having to be evacuated from Cairns hospital. What would have happened had Cyclone Yasi struck Cairns head on? The people of Cairns, many of whom may have been injured, would have been left without a functioning hospital. It was reported in the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 newspaper on 4 February--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1083470"></A>
The government might also consider whether it is wise rebuilding Cairns Base Hospital on its present site, so close to the shoreline that it was evacuated for fear of flooding, leaving the city vulnerable had the cyclone caused major casualties. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083471"></A>
The Minister for Public Works and I disagree on a lot of things, but the minister made a statement in this chamber on Tuesday that I could not agree with more. I am sure the minister will not mind me quoting him. Minister Schwarten said during a condolence motion, ‘Anybody who suggests of course that you could flood proof a flood plain really does not know a lot about hydrology or real life.’ I will repeat that: ‘Anybody who suggests of course that you could flood proof a flood plain really does not know a lot about hydrology or real life.’ Similarly, during the Premier’s condolence motion, the Premier made the following statement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1083473"></A>
... we are already ploughing ahead with an official inquiry; and, secondly, to rebuild and reconstruct Queensland. Where possible, those buildings and assets that mean so much to our communities and that have been destroyed will be replaced and they will be replaced to more flood-resistant standards. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083474"></A>
That is interesting. To that end, I believe that the government should seriously consider a moratorium, and that moratorium should be placed upon allowing the approval of any new construction on flood plains or land which could be impacted by flooding from cyclone generated torrential rainfall until after the Holmes inquiry final report is tabled in parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083475"></A>
On this side of the chamber, we are particularly concerned that this reconstruction task is not the subject of a separate portfolio with a minister in a stand-alone role dedicated to that very portfolio. It seems that the Premier does not accord the importance or attention to the job required. It is a huge job and the priority of the state, and as such should be the focus of a dedicated minister. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083476"></A>
I note that part of the Premier’s new role affords her the power of ministerial intervention. The Premier in her new role as minister has oversight and intervention of powers, including over development approval and local planning instruments. It seems unclear how this authority relates to the existing bureaucracy and where the chain of command will lie. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083478"></A>
The Premier has in fact taken authority away from the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning for such development and planning decisions which will need to be made in the areas subject to the Reconstruction Authority. There is a risk of creating yet another bureaucratic jungle. I encourage everyone to visit the Reconstruction Authority website. On the home page there is a map of Queensland with another map overlaying it showing the extent of the area that will be covered by the Reconstruction Authority. It is most of the state! I hope the Premier, along with running the state, really pays her new role the attention it requires and that it does not merely end up amounting to a nightly media opportunity.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083479"></A>
Finally, I note there is a two-year sunset clause, winding up the Reconstruction Authority at the completion of its work. Faced with the mammoth task ahead of it, I doubt that the Reconstruction Authority will have completed its work within two years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1083480"></A>
Quickly, while I am on the subject, I would like to talk about Buderim. We had a couple of houses in Buderim slip off the side of a hill. People by the name of Miller own this particular property. They thought they were covered by insurance as well. I am going to name the insurance company. It is called Apia. It looks after people over 50. It is not looking after these people over 50. It has decided to void their insurance contract. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087430"></A>
Some $440,000 would replace their house. I am calling on APIA to do the right thing by the people of Queensland, particularly the Millers and others who have had their insurance policies voided. This is a time for Queenslanders to pull together. If insurance companies want to represent the people of Queensland appropriately then maybe they need to pull together and do the right thing by people. There are many people in need. It is a time in this state’s history when we should all work together. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087431"></A>
I think we need to be very careful of the weather ahead of us. I spoke earlier about Hayden Walker. He has predicted that we are going to be hit with some very nasty weather towards the end of this month and early March. He has also predicted that it will be the wettest year in 100 years. I hope he is wrong and I am sure all Queenslanders do. I hope we are ready for what is coming next. </Hansard-Body>

(7.40 pm): I rise this evening to contribute to the debate on the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011. The bill before the House will establish a single authority to oversee and assist with the reconstruction of the flood affected zones, including implementation of flood mitigation recommendations and infrastructure reconstruction. </Hansard-Body>
<DIV>
<IMAGE xml:link="simple" href="2011_02_17_DAILY-60.gif" show="embed" actuate="auto"/>
</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087439"></A>
The authority is charged with the sole task of rebuilding Queensland in the wake of these two devastating natural disaster events. A commission of inquiry has also been established to examine the procedures of flood mitigation and the management of our dams and waterways. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087440"></A>
The bill before the House will create a separate act of this parliament and amend several other acts for the purposes of establishing this Reconstruction Authority. Given the amount of damage to vital infrastructure and services that has been incurred, there are relevant time line factors which will need to be taken into consideration with the rebuilding efforts across the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087441"></A>
Priority needs to be given to projects and communities which need assistance as a matter of urgency. Accordingly, it is vital that the Queensland Reconstruction Authority is not simply another layer of bureaucracy. The focus of this new body is to ensure that communities, supporting infrastructure, industry and the plethora of services offered to Queensland communities are operational in a short period of time. All of the relevant social, economic and environmental impacts in this period of rebuilding Queensland must also be considered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087443"></A>
The responsibility to oversee the local rebuilding efforts of many communities across Queensland is of paramount importance. That is why the LNP moved swiftly and decisively to appoint one dedicated spokesperson for the recovery process. My colleague the member for Redlands has tremendous local government experience, having been elected to serve on the Redlands Shire Council from 2000 to 2009. During that period, the member for Redlands was also a representative on the water and waste committee, chairman of the development assessment committee as well as serving as deputy mayor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087444"></A>
The LNP is committed to the task of rebuilding Queensland and the long journey of recovery ahead for many communities. I concur entirely with the sentiments of the Leader of the Opposition in welcoming the appointment of a reconstruction minister in the Queensland government, as was already the case in the federal government and the Queensland opposition.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087445"></A>
The task of rebuilding Queensland will need to be undertaken in a manner of due process and will take a considerable amount of time. The responsibility for this task should be bestowed on one dedicated minister. I question the Premier’s ability to fulfil this responsibility with the required attention, given her other roles and responsibilities as Premier of the state. After all, this role will require more than being a good newsreader or weather reader.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087446"></A>
Queensland is Australia’s second largest state in terms of area, third largest in population, but most decentralised in terms of the population of Queenslanders who reside outside the capital city. The majority of Queensland’s towns and cities are either built on the coastline, a river or both. Whether it is the northern coastal rivers of the Herbert, Proserpine or Flinders, the Fitzroy, Burnett, Mary or Bremer or the inland rivers of the Condamine or Barcoo, Queensland is renowned for its system of rivers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087447"></A>
With this in mind, the overall issue of flood mitigation becomes important for most regions in the state. In Goondiwindi, the levee bank of some 11 metres was built in 1958 and serves the town well given its location on a flood plain and that it is split in half by the Macintyre River. Temporary flood defences can be constructed relatively quickly and in many cases, such as in St George, these temporary defences protected property from flood inundation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087448"></A>
The development of flood risk maps is essential in reducing the risk to people and property of rising floodwaters in communities which are particularly flood prone. There has been a call for these maps to be published on the relevant local government websites so that information can be disseminated to the community when required. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087449"></A>
There are provisions in the bill before the House which are of concern. Local government jurisdiction and planning authority can be resumed. This does set a concerning precedent as the best people to undertake local planning are local people in local governments. Cooperation between local government and the relevant authorities should be the priority, rather than the local government being overridden by state government authorities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

A constituent has raised with me an issue regarding the urban footprint in the South-East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program 2010-2031, where flood plains are built up and landfill often disturbs the natural flow of the watertable. I would envisage that the government is undertaking a review of this urban footprint to ensure that appropriate caution is heeded in considering the planning requirements of local communities across Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

The major Queensland industries of tourism, mining, agriculture and small business have been dealt a massive blow by these two natural disasters. It is important that governments rebuild infrastructure to assist in the transport of goods and services across the state. Many areas which were not directly affected by the floods or cyclone have been indirectly impacted following the closure of many major regional roads and rail lines. Over 25 per cent of our road network has been impacted by the recent disasters and will need some form of repair or rebuild. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087452"></A>
The damage to agriculture is heartbreaking. After enduring years of drought, many farmers had crops which were heading for harvest. In another cruel blow, floodwaters and cyclonic winds and rain struck our agriculture sector at a time when many farmers across the state were heading for the best season in years. The resilience of our farmers will again be tested, but government needs to recognise a role in supporting this sector with subsidy and employment assistance.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087453"></A>
The Queensland tourism industry is a major employer and contributor to the economy. The Bligh government has already commenced a $10 million advertising package to rejuvenate this sector, but more needs to be done to send the message to the rest of Australia and indeed the world that Queensland is open for business and back on its feet. The development of the tourism sector should be a priority for local regions and the Queensland government. The industry is intrinsically linked with other sectors of the economy and needs to be given additional support and attention.</Hansard-Body>

This morning we heard the Minister for Tourism blame the media for all the hype and hysterics in relation to the cyclone. The Minister for Tourism needs to look at who was standing at the front of all those press conferences and actually putting this in the minds of people around the world and not be so quick to blame the media when it was the Queensland government giving the media all the information in the first place. It is easy to blame the media, but when they are feeding the media with hourly updates they cannot turn around and blame the media and the rest of the world for thinking Queensland is closed for business. </Hansard-Body>

 I understand that, but those opposite cannot blame the media today for their operational role when they had a role to play. They cannot turn around and blame the media for closing Queensland. It was the statements of those on that side of the House that made people in the rest of the world believe that elements of Queensland are closed for business. Over the past 13 years this government has racked up an $84 billion debt during a period of mining boom and prosperity for the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087457"></A>
In closing, I want to reiterate the points that many of my colleagues have made today. We seriously doubt whether the Queensland government, whether this Labor government and all its task forces and the Reconstruction Authority has the competence to actually deliver, has the competence to get our AAA credit rating back and has the competence to restore faith and trust in Queenslanders that it can rebuild Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087459"></A>
I think the case is in the negative. The Queensland community cannot trust this Labor government. If we base it on nearly 20 uninterrupted years of Labor rule in Queensland, can Queenslanders now turn around after three weeks of tremendous disaster in Queensland and trust the Labor Party? They cannot. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(7.48 pm): I rise in support of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011. As the member for Bundamba, people in our community are aware that there was widespread damage in Goodna, Redbank, Riverview and Bundamba. I outlined all the damage to the House in the condolence motion on Tuesday. </Hansard-Body>

This bill establishes a Queensland Reconstruction Authority. The purpose of this authority is to coordinate and manage the rebuilding and recovery of affected communities. This will include the repair and rebuilding of community infrastructure. The bill will also establish a Queensland Reconstruction Board. The role of the board is to oversee the work of the authority. The Premier has announced that Major General Mick Slater will chair the authority with Graeme Newton being appointed the new CEO. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087514"></A>
I am pleased to note that clause 10 of the bill says that the authority will work closely with affected communities to ensure that our communities’ needs are taken into account in the rebuilding and recovery process. Clause 10(1)(e) also gives the authority the power to coordinate and distribute financial assistance. This is very welcome. Our communities have expressed a strong desire to be listened to, to be heard and to be consulted throughout this process. Each suburb and each community is different, and they all need to have their say in this process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087516"></A>
I am pleased to report to this House that Major General Mick Slater has been on the ground in Goodna. He told me personally that he was aware of the needs of the Goodna area. Graeme Newton has also visited the Goodna area. I explained to him the community facilities that were destroyed in the flood and how important it is for them to be rebuilt in our community--infrastructure like the Goodna rugby league club, the Goodna Bowls Club, the RSL club, the Goodna pool and the Goodna netball club facilities. The Goodna Rugby Union Club is also an important sports club. The Frank McGreevy centre of the Goodna RSL Services Club had been finished for only about 12 months when the flood hit. It was built with environmental considerations in mind--for example with solar panels--and we were very proud, particularly our ex-servicemen, of that building.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087524"></A>
Clause 30 of the bill relates to membership of the board. There will be a chairperson, two members appointed by the Commonwealth, one member nominated by the LGAQ and three other members. Clause 35 relates to time and place of meetings. I note that the board may hold its meetings when and where it decides. Can I now invite the board to meet in our suburb of Goodna. Our local people would consider it an honour to host the board in its community. I advise the House tonight that I have faith in Major General Mick Slater. He has already visited our area, as I said, and he knows just how important our community infrastructure is to the wellbeing of our community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087528"></A>
I have listened to many MPs’ contributions to the debate on this bill and particularly took into account the comments of the member for Moggill in his assessment of the folklore that the river would not flood again. In Goodna we have a community elder who has studied floods in the area over many years. His name is Reg O’Dea. Reg and his family were inundated by floodwaters in 1974 to the height of just over one metre. He was then living at 222 Brisbane Terrace in Goodna. About four years ago Reg asked me if I could organise a meeting with the Queensland Public Service hydrologists to discuss with them whether there was any possibility of another flood event at Goodna. I was more than happy to arrange this and together we visited the experts in Brisbane. The meeting went for about three hours and all sorts of flood issues were discussed. He asked a direct question: can another flood occur? He was advised that it was quite possible.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087530"></A>
Reg and I remember having a tour of the control room and particularly how courteous and efficient the staff were and also their patience with the both of us. Reg had been worried about the floods in Goodna for many decades, even before 1974. He predicted this flood, he says, but he thought the flood would come two weeks earlier than it in fact did. He says that he was out by one metre; this flood was one metre higher than he thought it would be. Reg and his family were very lucky not to be flooded this time, but he is thankful that they were evacuated for their own safety.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087531"></A>
Reg has told me that he is prepared to provide whatever assistance necessary to the flood inquiry and also to the Queensland Reconstruction Authority as he, too, loves the Goodna area. Reg told me today that he will be making a submission to the flood inquiry but that it would definitely not include any criticism of the Wivenhoe Dam operators or anyone associated with the operations of Wivenhoe Dam. As a highly respected community elder in our community, Reg wants the flood inquiry and the Reconstruction Authority to particularly focus on town planning issues, especially in relation to the units built around Mill Street and also units built in other low-lying areas at Goodna and Redbank. This is an important issue in our area as many poor people--our most impoverished, many pensioners and the working poor--live in these units and now they are faced with ruin. They are faced with ruin physically, emotionally and financially.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087536"></A>
In conclusion, on behalf of our community, which has been affected by these devastating floods, I give our commitment to work with Major General Mick Slater and his officers to rebuild and reconstruct where appropriate. Let us never forget that folklore can become urban truths, and we have to push that back. We have to make sure that this folklore--that it could never flood again--is never, ever raised again. The fact is that the river did flood again, and that is the fact that we should learn from and recover from together as a community with the help of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

The LNP is not opposing this bill as we need to move quickly to restore and rebuild Queensland. We continue to approach the flood and cyclone recovery process with the bipartisan spirit of what is best for Queenslanders. We continue to put Queensland first. The purpose of the legislation is to establish a single entity to oversee, coordinate and intervene in the reconstruction of flood affected areas impacted by the 2010-11 floods and Cyclone Yasi. This includes implementation of flood mitigation recommendations, infrastructure reconstruction and social, economic and environmental recovery in the communities.</A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1087546"></A>
Before going any further with specific comment on the bill--and, as I said, I plan to make only a short contribution in that regard--I want to take this opportunity to pay my respects and express my condolences and sympathies to all who have suffered during Queensland’s summer flood and cyclone events. In particular my thoughts and prayers go to those who lost loved ones and who are trying to rebuild their lives. Many people lost homes, property and personal possessions. Some were uninsured and many more were underinsured. It has been a time of anguish and suffering. Having lived in North Queensland for 13 years, I know firsthand what it is like to have a cyclone bearing down on you. I empathise with those who sat in their homes and waited out the cyclonic winds, not knowing for sure what would happen. It is a truly frightening thing for many people.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087549"></A>
The speeches made by members of parliament of all political persuasions during debate of the condolence motion were heartfelt and moving. I was happy to step back so that other LNP members from flood and cyclone affected areas could use the time allotted to me to talk about the greater pain their constituents have suffered. While I did not speak to the motion at the time as Cleveland and the Redlands were not directly affected by the flood, I now pay my respects at this first available moment. I also commend the member for Redlands for his condolence speech as the shadow minister for flood recovery and, further, I echo the heartfelt sentiments of the Leader of the Opposition in his most presidential condolence speech.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087551"></A>
As I have said, the Redlands as a region of greater Brisbane was not directly affected by the flooding of the Brisbane River. We are most fortunate that the Redlands was far removed from the destruction that followed when a large volume of floodwater was suddenly released from Wivenhoe Dam. I am extremely proud of every Redlander who stood alongside their Brisbane, Ipswich, South-West Queensland and Central Queensland neighbours in their hour of need, whether as emergency service personnel or as volunteers in the mud army, by providing machinery, monetary donations or donated goods or by helping in other ways. I know that the Redlands will continue to do these vital things when called upon in the reconstruction stage. We witnessed a true case of loving thy neighbour as thyself.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087554"></A>
The response of the Redlands community to flood affected areas of southern and Central Queensland was nothing short of amazing. I want to commend my parliamentary colleagues in the Redlands, Peter Dowling and Michael Choi, for their partnership with me in coordinating the relief effort in the Redlands. I was probably the least of the three. Tonnes of goods were donated, collected in a warehouse and trucked to flood affected areas of Brisbane, Ipswich and South-West Queensland. I want to acknowledge Susie Masters, Stephanie Pearce, Terri Davidson and the team of more than 1,000 volunteers who gave their time over a 10-day period to do their bit for fellow Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095622"></A>
I want to acknowledge those businesses from Cleveland that donated their time, machinery and expertise to the flood response and relief effort. I also want to acknowledge the critical role that Unimin, the sandmining company of North Stradbroke Island, played in providing huge loads of sand for the house-saving sandbags. This community minded and socially responsible sandmining company, which has been unfortunately greatly maligned by this government, came to the rescue of many Queenslanders by providing the key ingredient of the sandbags. I wonder how many houses and other buildings and properties were saved from flood damage because of Unimin’s generosity. I thank it on behalf of the people of Brisbane, and I call on the Premier to publicly acknowledge the role that the sandmining company played in saving Brisbane homes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095635"></A>
When it comes to the rebuilding and reconstruction of Queensland, we need all of our big businesses to do their bit. So I call on the Premier to quit her petty attacks on the mining company and to treat them as they truly are: the helpful Queenslander who did their bit in the floods. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091627"></A>
While the Redlands was not directly affected by the floods, the tentacles of the floods reached into the lives of many Redlanders who had family members and friends, homes and businesses in flood affected areas. Many of my constituents, while grateful that they did not lose loved ones, have lost much and it will take a long time for some of them to recover and rebuild their lives and livelihoods too. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091628"></A>
Having made clear the goodwill of the opposition in the coming reconstruction stage, it would be remiss of us as the opposition to give the government a blank cheque on the reconstruction. This government has a long history of promising much and delivering little. Queensland is littered with the debris of Labor’s good intentions, overpromising and underdelivering. The lost AAA credit rating, the Queensland Health payroll fiasco, the Traveston Dam, the dysfunctional Tugun desalination plant, the sell-off and sell-out of Queensland Rail, regular budget overruns and costs blow-outs are just a few examples of Labor’s failures and mismanagement. Based on their record of failing Queensland, when it comes to the detail and to the actual delivery of infrastructure and services, the eyes of the opposition are watchful to ensure that the reconstruction occurs effectively and timely. We will not turn a blind eye to government incompetence as it emerges, because we care for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091629"></A>
Examples of potential areas of concern in the reconstruction process include things like the government’s lack of a separate minister for reconstruction, the length of time it will take for the commission of inquiry to make its recommendations and the potential conflict with local councils should the government not properly consult and consider local council advice. The skills shortage, particularly in trades, is another area of concern and it will be a challenge to keep the reconstruction on track due to a lack of availability of tradies. As shadow parliamentary secretary for apprenticeships and trade training, I look forward to contributing in a way that speeds up the factory line so that we have the carpenters, plumbers, electricians and other tradies who will be needed over next few years. It is disappointing that this government has not kept pace even with the current demand for tradies. They are already in short supply and it speaks of a planning failure by the government prior to the flood and cyclone events. We are not in a strong position with the labour that will be required. Queensland needs rebuilding and I have major concerns that this government is up to the challenge. </Hansard-Body>

Sadly, floods and cyclones are part of the price we pay for living in a place that we proudly advertise as beautiful one day and perfect the next.

Despite many years of apparent good luck, especially after having seemingly dodged a bullet after the GFC and a recovery from drought, we were all given a tremendous reality check in the form of a severe rain depression and Cyclone Yasi. The unremitting wind and rain washed far too many lives, too many homes and businesses, and all our hopes away. I ask members to allow me to discuss an approach to recovery in a manner that this bill might facilitate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091637"></A>
Natural disasters can have the capacity to destroy everything from one’s life to the permanent excision of a community from a region. Useful lessons from past disasters assist us to understand what we need to do for future disasters. Whilst two floods, cyclones and in some ways wars are never the same, each event adds to our cumulative knowledge of what it takes to resume normality. Good preparation provides the framework for facilitating disaster response and recovery, but it is how we rebuild that we are judged to have succeeded or failed. Perception rules, because memories are short. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091638"></A>
It is testament to our planning, our key staff, our courage and some good luck that the loss of life from the recent disaster was actually so low. In 1995 in the Kobe earthquake, 6,430 people lost their lives, 150,000 houses were destroyed, 150,000 houses were partially damaged and 310,000 people were evacuated to shelters. In 1995, the economic damage was US$130 billion, with only $3 billion of insurance cover, an 80 per cent decrease in freight, 1.2 million people affected by water disconnection and 2.6 million people with no electricity supply, the majority for up to two weeks. I put it to members that these disasters are, in fact, similar to our own and, by comparison, by virtue of preparation, we may have saved over 6,000 lives. All other comparisons are similar, excepting that our damages were spread over 70 per cent of our state’s 1.7 million square kilometres. Therefore, our primary role in this January 2011 disaster was, indeed, successful, but to avoid total loss of life must remain a key objective. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091639"></A>
The Reconstruction Authority, as proposed by this bill, needs to do many things and it represents a great challenge to those on it. Major General Mick Slater, whom I went to school with, will do a great job. The sunset clause of two years is sensible and will drive all of those involved to take action and to not procrastinate. What is universally known is that housing is usually the largest category of property loss. Historically, there is no strict linear correlation between the magnitude of housing loss and the recovery process. The short-term recovery of economic activity is often more rapid than the rebuilding of housing stock or the reconstruction of a community. It must be noted that, despite rebuilding, there may remain a handicapped economy with social and environmental stresses and I wish to discuss those. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091640"></A>
Again, Kobe, has lots of lessons for all of us. All but 10 per cent were housed within four years of the disaster, but the delays in reconstruction were shortened by a dedication of the reconstruction authority initially to analyse the deficiencies in infrastructure and, when reconstructing and rebuilding, correcting these anomalies. In Kobe’s case, they were dependent on the one main elevated motorway to drive their port, which, in fact, occupies 30 per cent of all the business in Japan. They reorganised their parks, which act as safety refuges in times of disaster. They helped the city realise its strategic objective, which had been identified at the time of the earthquake--actually, almost immediately prior to the earthquake.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091641"></A>
Honourable members, Brisbane and Kobe--and this bill is not entirely about Brisbane--are sister cities and the parallels are far closer than is initially apparent. Brisbane is a port city located on a flood plain with a series of hills within and around it. It is reliant on one major arterial road from the west, with a single range crossing at Toowoomba that carries the vast bulk of our porting goods. The flood plain is our Achilles heel and we cannot change that. Kobe is located in an earthquake zone, which is obvious. Kobe’s homes were old. People were very reluctant to move. Many of those who died were elderly and lived alone in small wooden structures. Brisbane, Ipswich Condamine and Theodore homes are older. Many of the residents are elderly and do not want to move. Tragically, some of them are multiple occupants and, yes, some of them are in the lower socioeconomic band. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091642"></A>
Insurance claims were very restricted in both areas. As I say, insurance claims were a contentious issue in both our situation and in Kobe’s situation, for slightly different reasons, but they were significant issues. Kobe and Queensland are huge cash generators. As I said, Kobe’s port moves 30 per cent of total Japanese freight, as does Brisbane’s port. I will not go on about the comparisons, but they are very similar. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091643"></A>
We have done the same as Kobe did in the early reparative phase. Federally, the Gillard government chose to impose a flood levy and a series of cuts to non-essential budget programs, but they strangely did not countenance a deficit. Kobe was rebuilt and funded by municipal bonds issued by the federal Japanese government. They were issued early but were sold as safe instruments as opposed to what is described as a high-yielding junk or zero-coupon bond. That provided the financial horsepower to drive the issuing of new contracts to private industry and some government entities to build with confidence. GNP did fall across Japan by 1.2 per cent, but there was no recession. Business--industrial, retail, construction and transport--actually boomed. But they did issue these bonds early. The social problems were marked. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095892"></A>
I would like to discuss the principles they used which we could use. These are wider reconstruction principles for these disasters and they go beyond Brisbane, Ipswich, the Lockyer and Toowoomba and beyond the Condamine, Darling, Nogoa, Burnett, Mary, Balonne and Dawson rivers. Our communities need unique approaches, but there is a similarity with what was done there. Clearly, Gympie has a unique history of dealing with floods. They build to allow for floods and they do not allow housing on the fringes of rivers. We need better levies on those rivers. The authority needs to investigate, analyse, plan and build a series of levies around our regional towns that are affected.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095897"></A>
Councils cannot be expected to fund any capital expenditure, nor should they shoulder any of the interest expended on the 26,000 kilometres of rural roads that need a part or complete rebuild. These roads are our economic arteries. The rail has degenerated into almost a coal-freight-only option. We have to decide whether our below-rail infrastructure in these non-coal areas will actually be replaced. Our major highways need to be made for all weathers, torrents and current flood peak levels. Airports are critical, as was found out. The airports at Gladstone, Alpha and Emerald need to be updated. Alpha requires a new hospital which is appropriately staffed to cater for the $33 billion Galilee coal expansion which was announced today.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1137772"></A>
In those cyclone affected areas, we must learn the lessons of Cyclone Larry and do all of the things that we did not do then. We need to use the opportunity presented by serious adversity and tackle that problem in a three-year plan, similar to the master Kobe plan, which I will table tonight. The aim of the plan is the five key points in ordinance. All residents will be housed within that time frame. It will occur within commercial and governmental reconstruction and it will integrate. We should provide a five-year rental subsidy plan--which is what they did to achieve success--and the variations of public housing, group title and collective housing should be incorporated within that. I would utilise that system proposed in the Kobe plan. It is universally accepted as the best that came out. I table that document.</Hansard-Body>

I would recommend that the authority stay away from the differentiating divisions within itself that wish to pander to the issues of sectional interests, however important they believe themselves to be. The government’s role is to reassure every different group. For example, if we start with tourism, we should use our existing Tourism Queensland infrastructure. If we are dealing with industry, we should use our existing industry infrastructure--in other words, reassure the coal industry, the steel mills, the power stations and our overseas buyers by reactivating our ports and railway lines and reassuring businesses that we are good providers et cetera. These are constant themes and we should utilise what we have already got.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095902"></A>
I discussed the social problems earlier. These have all been reviewed extensively both in Australia and overseas. Basically, they have shown that there are adjustment problems but if we focus on them early we will end up with a much better result. With housing in Australia, we have to accept that we have got intergenerational people within the one structure. As such, we are going to end up with what they believe are social and environmental problems which may be ramped up from what previously occurred. This does obstruct economic recovery. Some people believe it can actually lead to a two-year lag in economic recovery. This was extensively reviewed in 1979. The government held and supported a seminar which was reported on in a book titled <Hansard-Italic>
Response to Disaster</Hansard-Italic>
. I would like to stick to the sections regarding social and economic activity--those by John Western and John Price and those by Kearney and Reagh. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095908"></A>
They described that we have to address the issues of the psychiatric problems, the psychological problems and the recovery phase. I know that you, Madam Deputy Speaker, as a clinical psychologist, might have a greater knowledge of this, but I will cover it without being too boorish. They said that the public do understand that disaster strikes without reason and that we have to stop describing them as ‘victims’. People fatigue, volunteers fatigue and reconstruction authorities fatigue. Those reconstruction authorities need to resist that because when the reconstruction authorities fatigue it leads to problems. Bad news travels fast; good news is slower. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095909"></A>
One of the greatest psychological needs after a disaster is involving the disaster victims in making decisions for the future of their own community. It is called active involvement. We need to address that straight-up. We need to resist creating an authority that overly controls everything. Protest is what most people do as a recognised response to loss. Actively involving people is part of the restitution mechanism so that they can go forward. It should act as a basis for what the authority should be doing. </Hansard-Body>

It is normal for most people to go through all sorts of stages of grief. According to Kubler-Ross there is denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. This is normal. In a disaster there are three major phases. First there is the phase of the disaster itself, which includes the pre-crisis, the crisis, the community response and the emergency response. We have all seen that. Immediately after that there is what they call the social response, which is the physical stress, the issue of reclamation--when people go back into their homes--and the transition, when people have to make a decision about what they will do. The authority has to have a role in this stage. The third stage is rehabilitation. These days this includes issues of compensation and insurance. In Kobe, they just had to accept that they were not going to get insurance because the insurers were going to battle them all the way through. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095912"></A>
Planning and organisation are important. We have to focus on recovery. There has to be a series of review and recrimination, and we have to accept that there will be people who do not like what has happened. Then we have to aim for closure and we have to include a period of thankyous. We should start thinking about who we are going to thank at this stage and try to be as inclusive as we can. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095914"></A>
In terms of long-term needs, we cannot deny the fact that people do actually have responses to stress. We have to accept that there are multiple forms of adaptation and we have to try to encourage that adaptation to evolve. We have to continue this active community involvement and it has to be multilevel; it has to be what they call horizontal and vertical. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095915"></A>
We have to use the community as a therapeutic community. We have to use the external agencies and make sure they remain sensitive and understand what we are doing. We must gradually remove the dependence on all external providers. The aim must be to focus on the word ‘optimism’. ‘Optimism’ is used widely; its definition is actually ‘looking forward to the future with a positive sentiment’. It must follow on from chaos and conflict. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095916"></A>
To drive that optimism, there are four key points that must underpin the whole response and not just that of the reconstruction authority. The authority must come back to these key points all the time to ensure it is relevant and it does not follow the inherent tendency to become insular, which is what happens with most of these authorities. It must accept broader views, and these positive messages must come from all people interacting with it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095917"></A>
The four points are as follows. First, governments can and must be prepared to mitigate the economic and social impact of disasters by better planning and coordination across all government responsibility. In other words, they have to implement that as part of their strategies in all their departments. Second, public trust as well as consumer and investor confidence are key elements to ensure rapid and systemic recovery. Third, governments need to work more closely in partnership with the private sector, from disaster prevention through to recovery. We actually have to be starting to plan for our next disaster as we talk about it. This must start in tandem with reconstruction. Fourth, major disasters have multiple international dimensions. We are a global village. This calls for more systematic international cooperative agreements. In other words, we have to tell the people that we have had a problem. We have to say, ‘This is what we’re going to do about it, this is what we are doing about it, and this is what you will see within a fixed time.’ In other words, we need to be proactive by being honest with what we are doing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095918"></A>
In relation to the authority itself, it becomes interesting. There have been multiple reviews. The best one that most people may have seen at some stage is the one by Tony Powell, the ex-chair of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. He is a town-planner and accountant. He said that the authority staff must live and work in the prescribed areas so they can maintain constant contact with people and issues and have a view of a high sense of urgency about fixing problems. Time is the enemy. The authority must understand the individual’s anxiety about priorities for fiscal investment. Other government priorities must not stop fair rebuilding and recovery. We need to set up mechanisms internally within all government departments at all levels to stop the politicisation of public administration, because people tend to block when they find things are difficult or uncomfortable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095951"></A>
Curiously, at a time when we have proposed a Commonwealth Games application, the challenge for the Premier is to set the Reconstruction Authority the Olympic Games challenge to plan, develop and reconstruct buildings and infrastructure in the prescribed disaster areas using both private and public sector resources to achieve the best possible result. The bill itself is merely the tool by which all of this would happen. I cannot see any major problems with it. It has been carefully dissected by multiple people, including the shadow minister and previous speakers. I do not wish to challenge any of those details that they have discussed. For a lot of good to happen, barriers to the reconstruction and recovery need to be removed. The bill attempts to do this. Altering the valuation to a later June date will bring fairness to those whose valuations are pre-flood or are cyclone stressed rather than the March closing date which is often used by the councils. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095952"></A>
The task ahead for the Reconstruction Authority is a sobering one. It will be a long, painful, expensive and great challenge, despite it being only two years. It will require great tolerance, sympathy and perseverance on the part of many players. Rebuilding one million square kilometres of affected state is a big call. We must seek to rebuild the foundations of sustainable communities that reflect that we live in a hostile world where we cannot control many of those things we wish we could. The authority must address the serious issues of goemorphology, hydrology, civic planning and design. These are all points that we are debating all the time at the moment in relation to the problems that are occurring. It must not fall into the pattern of one-size-fits-all as a mindset. John F Kennedy was quite right when he reminded us all that we must use time as a tool and not a couch. </Hansard-Body>

(8.21 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011. As other members have indicated, the authority’s job will be to manage and coordinate the state government’s program for infrastructure reconstruction and recovery in disaster affected communities throughout Queensland. The authority will have significant new powers to undertake what are currently local government planning responsibilities. The authority is currently set a limited time span of two years. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1095959"></A>
I note that the authority will also be able to act on the direction of the relevant minister. There has been a bit of debate during this sitting as to whether the appropriate minister should be the Premier or a stand-alone minister. My view is that there is no better person to be responsible than the Premier of the state. I know that there is criticism and that the view has been put that the Premier will be too busy to be able to apply the resources and the time that is necessary. The reality is that the Premier has many more resources at her disposal than ministers of the government. I put on the record that I believe it is appropriate that the Premier of the day should be the relevant minister. In the past when problems have occurred in state government we have seen situations where the Premier has taken charge and taken responsibility away from the relevant minister. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095960"></A>
This leads me to the next issue which is very important. I believe that we need to ensure that there will be total stability in Queensland for as long as is possible during the life of this stand-alone authority. Prior to the resumption of this sitting of parliament the Premier was on the record saying that 2011 will be the year of the rebuilding of Queensland and that there will be no state election until next year. Yesterday I understand that it was reported in one of our media outlets that approaches had been made to the Queensland Electoral Commission about a possible election date in April. Tonight on the 5 o’clock, 6 o’clock and 7 o’clock news there was banter that the resignation of some of our ministers may be the trigger the Premier may use to call an early election. I believe that we need the Premier in her reply to this bill to state very clearly whether there is going to be an election during this year. Queenslanders need stability and certainty. I believe that if the Premier cannot give a commitment that there will be no election this year she should go to the people and have the election tomorrow so that we can get over this hurdle and we can make sure that for as long as possible for the duration of this Reconstruction Authority it will know who the appropriate minister is that it is answerable to so that it knows where it is going with the proposed tasks that this government and this parliament will hand to it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095961"></A>
We have heard from the government, the opposition and the Independents overwhelming support for the intent of this Reconstruction Authority to take charge, to take control, and try to lead the reconstruction and recovery of our disaster affected communities throughout Queensland. The bill provides the opportunity for future communities that we are not aware of at the moment to come under the umbrella and the ambit of the power of this proposed Reconstruction Authority. That leads me to the issue of other authorities that have similar powers to the proposed Reconstruction Authority. In particular I refer to the Urban Land Development Authority.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095962"></A>
One of the core responsibilities of the Urban Land Development Authority is to provide affordable housing to Queenslanders. I and other members in this House have stated that we understand that one of the core responsibilities of this Queensland Reconstruction Authority is also to provide affordable housing to Queenslanders. Yet when I read the bill I see how this bill provides the authority with the capacity to override local councils, to take matters out of councils’ hands, either because the board thinks it appropriate or the Premier of the day has directed it to do so. There are similar powers under the Urban Land Development Authority. I will quote from an Urban Land Development Authority publication--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1095964"></A>
How does the ULDA development assessment process differ from the Sunshine Coast Regional Council?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1095965"></A>
Development applications over land outside a UDA are made to and assessed by the local government authority under the Sustainable Planning Act 2009 (SPA) and the planning scheme.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1095966"></A>
Development applications over land within a UDA are instead made to and assessed by the ULDA under the Urban Land Development Authority Act 2007 and the land use plan for a UDA. Under this Act, the assessment process has been streamlined to enable a development application to be assessed and decided within 40 business days after lodgement. This shortened timeframe does not include circumstances where there is a need for additional information or public notice of the application. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095967"></A>
I will quote from another section on the topic of the similarity between these two authorities--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1095968"></A>
What will happen when a development application is lodged with the ULDA?</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1095969"></A>
When lodging a development application within a UDA, the application will be assessed against the Urban Land Development Authority Act 2007 and the Interim Land Use Plan, until such time as a Development Scheme becomes effective for the area. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095970"></A>
There are places throughout the length and breadth of our great state where the Urban Land Development Authority is responsible and is effectively doing what our local councils were previously doing--developing affordable land. When I look to section 149 of the bill, which sets out how the chairperson of this proposed authority has significant powers to give a notice to a council in relation to development applications before that council, I see no reason why this authority should not have similar powers to give similar directions in relation to land that is the responsibility of the Urban Land Development Authority. Why should we have a difference where this proposed authority has the capacity to override local councils in Queensland but it does not have the capacity to interfere at all or have anything to do with land which may be in that same area but is, because of our legislation, under the responsibility of the Urban Land Development Authority and that Urban Land Development Authority is doing the very thing that the council could have done?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096002"></A>
I table for the benefit of members an amendment that I intend to move when we proceed to the committee stage. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1096006"></A>
Clause 149, page 83, after line 18, insert:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1096007"></A>
’(6A)	The Chairperson may give a notice to the Urban Development Authority if the Chairperson forms the opinion that the Urban Development Authority needs to suspend work on a site or sites of land for which the Authority has responsibility.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1096008"></A>
(6B)	If a notice is given to the Urban Development Authority under subsection (6A), the notice is of the same effect as a notice applicable to a local government under this section.’</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096010"></A>
I believe we need to seek consistency in Queensland. In one breath the government says, ‘This authority is independent,’ yet we see that authority has the capacity to be clearly directed by the relevant minister, and that happens to be the Premier. When we refer to the Urban Land Development Authority, again there is a very clear link between the Urban Land Development Authority and the relevant minister of the day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

There should be no difference in Queensland--no difference at all. We need to see consistency. On one hand we have the Premier as the relevant minister who has the capacity to give directions and have direct discussions with this authority and on the other hand we have the minister--another minister, not the Premier--who also is in a different position responsible for land of which the Urban Land Development Authority has control. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096017"></A>
We know where the disasters have occurred. This bill provides the capacity during the next two years for this authority to take responsibility for future areas if a disaster should occur. If a disaster occurs in the next few months, later this year or in the future the authority will have the capacity by regulation or by gazette notice to take responsibility for the planning and the reconstruction of those respective communities. I note that late last year when the Premier and I spoke about the very contentious issue of the Caloundra South development area--Mr Deputy Speaker, can I have some quiet? I can hardly hear myself.</Hansard-Body>

When the Premier responds can she please clarify this for me? Should we have a disaster on the Sunshine Coast--and I pray and hope that we do not--of such a magnitude that it falls under the umbrella of the proposed Queensland Reconstruction Authority, in light of the possible impacts on the Sunshine Coast Regional Council and on land for which our government has passed responsibility to the Urban Land Development Authority, what involvement does she propose the Queensland Reconstruction Authority will have in relation to the Queensland Urban Land Development Authority, especially in the proposed Caloundra South area? I passionately disagree with the government on this issue and on its position on Caloundra South. I disagree with the justification the government has put forward to this parliament and to Queensland as to why this matter had to be taken out of our Sunshine Coast council’s hands. </Hansard-Body>

The LNP supports this bill with some reservations relating to the amount of bureaucracy involved and the priorities of the bill. The bill establishes the Reconstruction Authority through the proposed Queensland Reconstruction Authority Act 2011. The bill amends the Building Act 1975, the Disaster Management Act 2003, Integrity Act 2009, the Land Valuation Act 2010, the Public Service Act 2008 and the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971. The bill’s purpose is to establish a single entity to oversee the reconstruction of flood affected zones and to implement flood mitigation recommendations, infrastructure reconstruction and social, economic and environmental recovery in all affected communities. I hope it does relate to all affected communities. We notice that category D has already been applied to a number of communities and a lot of communities have missed out on it. Queenslanders need this bill to assist in the rebuilding and re-establishment of our communities, the restoration and reconstruction of our infrastructure, and rejuvenation of our industries and economies.</A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1096043"></A>
Many Queenslanders have suffered horrific personal and financial losses during these disasters. The LNP will be supporting the bill to ensure the recovery occurs in a practical, appropriate and timely manner. Many communities within my Condamine electorate have been affected by flooding, some directly and others indirectly. Houses and businesses were inundated at Dalby, Oakey and many other small downs. Primary producers along the river and flood plains lost crop and stock, farm infrastructure, roads, fencing and topsoil. These communities will welcome the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011, but they want to see outcomes that will vastly improve the preparedness for future disasters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096046"></A>
I join with the people of Condamine in wanting to see effective and timely implementation of flood mitigation measures and assurance that the recommendations from the commission of inquiry will be implemented as soon as possible. We cannot afford to see the bill overtaken by wasteful bureaucracy. The Reconstruction Authority will be able to cut through the red tape and allow for quick, responsive action to occur. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096048"></A>
It should be a priority to get primary production up and running as soon as possible. This will provide an immediate economic injection into the communities that they support. Our country towns thrive from primary production. Agriculture is the production base of Queensland. It saved this state and country from falling into recession on more than one occasion. It was agriculture that saved Australia from going into recession. The importance of agriculture to our state’s recovery can never be overstated. This is the time to support one of our three major industries--agriculture. The dividends will be reaped many, many times over. The job to rebuild Queensland is absolutely immense. It will take a huge amount of money and a great deal of time. However, I am confident that the resilience of Queenslanders will be evident as the recovery takes place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1096049"></A>
It is important to have as many early warning systems in place for when unexpected events occur. Within my electorate and neighbouring rural electorates there is a great need for more automatic river height gauges while still maintaining the manually read gauges. The lack of these gauges became evident at the height of the flood in the Condamine River, its tributaries and other waterways. We need gauges between Oakey and Cecil Plains. We need gauges down the Condamine River. We need gauges from Cooby Dam to Oakey. The town of Oakey was flooded. The people did not even know it was coming. There were people on roofs in Oakey who were absolutely terrified. All they could do was wait until the water went down. If we had these gauges local authorities could have warned these people. We could put in place this type of mechanism. We could use text messages on phones to warn people. The warning system would be much improved. I hope this facility is seriously looked at with the establishment of this authority. The massive volume of water coming down and the reported failure of one of the automatic gauges meant that there was less time to prepare downstream. These farmers and communities were waiting to hear of the measurements upstream so they would know whether they would need to move their stock or whether they had to get out of their house, and those warnings failed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100407"></A>
The gauges provide excellent data to townships and communities downstream but only if they are working. Automatic rainfall gauges that trigger advice to emergency service departments and local government would enable advance warnings of potential flash floodings when isolated rainfall events have occurred. No-one knew that the massive rainfall in Toowoomba, only a couple of kilometres away, had happened. These gauges should be included in flood mitigation plans as important early warning devices that provide vital information to communities.The Reconstruction Authority will need to make certain that the recovery and reconstruction process will be effective and will provide effective outcomes. We hope this is not just a farce coming up to an election. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100410"></A>
Local government will be the key to the recovery of affected communities. Working in cooperation with local authorities is essential. Problems have come from and are associated with the amalgamation of the shires. This was highlighted as an issue during the floods. Some areas were left out of the initial disaster declarations due to local council personnel not being aware of local flooding events. Now the councils are so big but with less representation that there were no local leaders in small communities. We are trying to get category D disaster assistance for farmers in the Condamine region but because they are in the Toowoomba shire they will have to declare the whole shire. We could have used the old shire boundaries like Millmerran shire or Wambo shire or we could hire some statesmen from within those areas who know the areas and who know the farms that are affected to the extent that would need category D disaster declarations. Some of those farmers are going to go to the wall unless they get the same declaration that the people up north affected by the cyclone have just been granted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100413"></A>
The lack of communication was very distressing for the individuals concerned. They sat and waited and did not know. They were completely devastated by the flooding and struggled to be heard. This is an issue that really needs addressing. Road and rail infrastructure has been badly affected in the Condamine electorate. Roads still remain closed and much of the rail line has not started to be repaired. This has pushed all the freight, coal, stock and grain travelling east to the already overloaded Warrego Highway and down the Toowoomba range. Upgrading of these roads and rail is absolutely essential, not repairing but upgrading and renewing. The lack of maintenance, repair and renewal of these transport assets is long overdue and is an example of the lack of foresight and planning that the long-term Labor government has inflicted upon the people of Queensland. So many times I have gone to Main Roads to try to get a road fixed. It might be the Cecil Plains-Toowoomba road and the answer is, ‘We have no money.’ That has been the story for a number of years. Thus the predicament we are in now. The infrastructure was weak. The roads were ruined before the flood started. Smaller communities need to be supported with infrastructure and services to ensure that they remain viable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100415"></A>
Queenslanders would like assurance that this Reconstruction Authority will properly prepare us for any future disaster, that the mistakes made in the past will be rectified. The lessons learnt from these devastating events are a reminder to us all that effective planning is vital for effective recovery. My hope is that the Reconstruction Authority will bring effective, long-term recovery to Queensland. My hope is that the purpose of this bill will bring efficient, responsive recovery that enables Queensland to bounce back rapidly, sustainably, economically and spiritually. So many bills that have come before this House have been a farce. We have lived on promises under a Labor government for the last 10 years that I am aware of since I was elected. Let us hope that the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill is not just another promise. </Hansard-Body>

 (Gympie--LNP) (8.44 pm): I rise tonight to also speak on the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill. In doing so, I note the objectives of the bill: the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011 will establish the Queensland Reconstruction Authority to coordinate the reconstruction and recovery following the floods of December 2010 and January 2011 and Tropical Cyclone Yasi of February 2011. I also note that the bill amends the following legislation for particular purposes: the Building Act 1975, the Disaster Management Act 2003, the Integrity Act 2009, the Land Valuation Act 2010 and the Public Service Act 2008. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1100428"></A>
Whilst the opposition supports the setting up of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority as the best method of organising and rebuilding the areas of the state of Queensland that experienced significant and widespread flooding over this summer period and the areas that have been impacted by the tropical cyclone in February this year, I must stress though that I am concerned that the government wants to push this legislation through quickly without allowing it to be considered in great depth. There is always a concern in my mind whenever this government introduces legislation and then wishes to push it through quickly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100429"></A>
I have some concerns in particular with regard to the areas of the bill that cover this authority’s power to take land. Section 99 of the bill discusses the authority’s power to take land. I am concerned by subsection (6), which says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100432"></A>
To remove any doubt, it is declared that the taking of land under this section is not a taking of land under the ALA--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1100433"></A>
the Acquisition of Land Act--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1100434"></A>
even though the process for taking the land and paying compensation for the land is the process stated in that Act. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100436"></A>
The Acquisition of Land Act is a piece of legislation that has served the state of Queensland well. Within that piece of legislation there are protections. There are checks and balances. That subsection is the equivalent of saying, ‘Trust us. We are a Labor government.’ Well, if there are words that strike fear into the heart of any sane Queenslander, it is when a Labor government says, ‘Trust us.’ That is more so for my residents in Gympie than perhaps in other parts of state, because we have gone through this, particularly with the acquiring of land when it came to the Traveston Crossing Dam. As I read this section of the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill, what concerns me is what it does not say as opposed to what it does say. I wish to place on the record my concerns with regard to disputes that may arise over the valuation of land that will be acquired under this section. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100441"></A>
The Acquisition of Land Act provides, if there is a dispute, that it can be taken to the Land Court to be resolved. My community did not have that privilege. When the government went through the purchase of land for the Traveston Crossing Dam, what we found was that landholders were bullied and cajoled by this government into selling their land to them. </Hansard-Body>

Mr GIBSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the member, because the land was good. To state that the land of the Mary Valley was no good highlights the ignorance of Labor members opposite, because this land is productive farmland. That is the equivalent of saying that the flood land is no good. That is the equivalent of saying that the land up north is no good. </Hansard-Body>

There is too much audible conversation and too much interjection. The member for Gympie has the call. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100448"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr GIBSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 What we heard from that interjection is that they look at Queensland and they say it is no good. They believe that this government should be able to come in at any time and, without having the protections that we have provided within the Acquisition of Land Act, be able to negotiate, supposedly, a price. What happens when those negotiations are skewed? Because the power imbalance is immediately there. The power imbalance exists, because what we find is that we have the state government, through this authority, tapping on someone’s shoulders and saying, ‘Look, sunshine, we have the authority to take your land, and we will.’ And what we have there is an immediate power imbalance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104942"></A>
I note the concerns that have been raised by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee with regard to this issue. I want to touch on the principle of natural justice. The principle of natural justice is one that is critical to legislation that we bring in and ensures that the residents of this state are protected. The committee states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1104944"></A>
The principles of natural justice require that a person whose interests might be affected by a decision be given a fair hearing and an opportunity to present his or her case, that a decision be made by an unbiased and disinterested decision-maker and be based on logically probative evidence. At common law, a person denied ‘procedural fairness’ may seek review of an administrative decision affecting his or her interests. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104945"></A>
Yet within this legislation there is no opportunity for a review. There is no opportunity to take it to the Supreme Court. We find in this legislation a sunset clause for two years. Let me place on the record that two years of a Labor government having unfettered control is two years too long. We must ensure that within the legislation we have the protections so that people can enter into negotiations in good faith and that they can have confidence that they are empowered to move forward. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr GIBSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the member because it comes back to the point that I indicated at the very beginning. The manner in which this has been rushed through this parliament does not provide the opposition with the opportunity to draft amendments in a timely fashion. Had we had the normal procedure of this bill sitting on the table for two weeks there would have been the opportunity, I am sure, for many amendments to be drafted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104948"></A>
Clearly, it was not of such great concern to the government that it would recall parliament to bring forward this bill. It was happy to wait until parliament came back. But we then find that there is urgency to move forward without allowing us time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104949"></A>
Can I suggest that we must ensure that community members who must deal with this authority are empowered in such a way that they can have confidence in the decisions of the authority. Let me state right now very clearly that I have full confidence in the chair, Major General Slater. I am sure that he will do his job and discharge it with the greatest of professionalism. I cannot say I have confidence in the CEO, Graeme Newton, because we dealt with Graeme Newton as the CEO of Queensland Water Infrastructure. The experience of the community in the Mary Valley was such that he was not a man of integrity. I place on the record here and now that I do not have confidence in the CEO. However, we do have confidence in the chair. If any man can ensure that the Reconstruction Authority works properly it will be Major General Slater. However, that does not give any government the right to strip away the rights of its citizens. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104951"></A>
In preparing for this speech I looked at the reconstruction authority that was established after Cyclone Tracy. Clearly with regard to Cyclone Tracy we saw a disaster of a magnitude that was unheralded. Approximately 41,000 of Darwin’s 47,000 inhabitants were made homeless. Approximately 33,000 were evacuated following the passing of the cyclone. Some 71 people passed away. Approximately 70 per cent of the city’s homes were either completely destroyed or suffered severe damage. Public services such as communications, power, water and sewerage were also damaged. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104952"></A>
In looking at how the federal government of that day, in 1975, set up an organisation for the reconstruction of Darwin, the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, I note that within the legislation for that commission it provided for the establishment of a citizens council. The legislation provided for the establishment of the Darwin Citizens Council which comprised a maximum of 20 members, appointed by the minister after the commission called for nominations from those interested in council membership. The chairperson and deputy chairperson of the council were both elected by the council members. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104954"></A>
The function of the council was to give advice to the commission concerning the exercise of the commission’s reconstruction powers. That is a very strong check and balance. That is a citizens council that can directly approach the reconstruction authority and ensure that advice can be provided as to how they are exercising their powers. That type of mechanism should be considered for the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104956"></A>
We need to ensure that the voices of individuals are heard and that their concerns are able to be taken to the very top. Whilst I am sure that those of us who are members from areas that were flood affected or affected by the cyclone will do an outstanding job, it is nevertheless important that the community has the opportunity to exercise its voice and to be heard. I would encourage the government to consider the inclusion of a citizens council type model for the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104958"></A>
I would now like to briefly move to a couple of other points. First and foremost, we have heard much from both sides of the House with regard to how this Queensland Reconstruction Authority will cut through red tape. Let us make it very clear: the fact that we need to have this Queensland Reconstruction Authority is an admission that red tape has got out of hand. It is an admission that our local governments, with the normal structures that are in place now, are unable to effectively and efficiently operate because their hands are tied by red tape. We must ensure not only that this red tape is stripped away in the dealings with the Queensland Reconstruction Authority but also that it is removed permanently so local governments can get on with the job day to day of enabling their areas to grow without having this red tape bound across them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104961"></A>
I will now briefly touch on my area of Gympie and the importance of the reconstruction efforts. As I indicated in the condolence motion, the community of Gympie is one that has great experience with flood events. As such, it has been able to ensure that over time it has developed the experience and the framework for dealing with floods.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104962"></A>
No absolute flood protection measures can be applied. Any plan or any objective is simply to reduce the flood effects. That clearly happens in Gympie. The reduction in flood damage is as a result of a well-organised and well-aimed response and the actions of the local disaster management group. What we see from their efforts are objectives being achieved that can be summarised in three areas. There is the reduction in the risk of damage from floods, there is a reduction in the impact to businesses and homes from floods and, most importantly, there is an increase in flood awareness on the part of the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104963"></A>
This flood awareness is as a result of experience but it is also as a result of the community being able to follow the information that is put out. One of the concerns that we have is with regard to automatic river gauges. On the Mary River we watch the river heights at various gauges and we can indicate very clearly the time frame that we have before the floodwaters will hit the township of Gympie. However, we only had two automatic river gauges along the Mary River that were operating and were of benefit during this flood--one at Moy Pocket, which is basically at the base of the Conondale Range at the commencement of the Mary River Valley, and one at Dagun. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104968"></A>
We clearly need to have more automatic river gauges so we can also take into account the inflow from streams within the area. The information provided by an additional automatic river gauge would enable the community to have a more accurate estimate of when the river was to peak. That could result in conserving effort. We were expecting a flood peak of 20 metres. As a result some businesses evacuated their premises and their stock and, at the end of day, they did not need to. It was prudent that they took that measure but if we had more accurate information we could have ensured that those businesses that were clearly going to be affected could have been helped and those of lesser risk could have been evacuated based on information that came through at a different time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109279"></A>
The other issue with the Gympie electorate is the condition of roads and bridges. As we heard from the main roads minister, the impact from the flood and cyclone events upon roads of this great state has been major. For Gympie, the impact upon our bridges was such that in many cases communities were isolated. Some of the bridges in those areas are over 100 years old, they are timber structures and they are clearly no longer suitable to withstand major flood events. We need to ensure that those bridges are replaced and that those bridges are upgraded to a level such that, whilst they may be flooded, after a flood event they are able to be operated and used quickly.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109281"></A>
I note that in her second reading speech the Premier made it very clear that the Reconstruction Authority would be covering all of Queensland. As I indicated in the condolence motion debate, the people of Gympie accept that there are places in this great state that have been devastated far more than we ever were or would like to be, and as a result they deserve to have the priority in those reconstruction efforts. But I will be holding the Premier to her word that the smaller areas and the smaller communities, like Imbil, Widgee and Woolooga--whilst not all of them are in my electorate, they certainly fall towards Gympie as their commerce area--are also included in the reconstruction effort, that those communities, along with the community of Gympie and others, receive their fair share in the reconstruction so that we can have confidence in moving forward, that we are able to rebuild at a time that will enable us to face disasters again, as we unfortunately know this great state will. In particular, we know that Gympie will indeed face floods again, as it has done 19 times in the past with major flooding events. That being said, I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110217_210114" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Gladstone--Ind) (9.01 pm): I rise to speak to the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill 2011. Many speakers have already stated that this debate is a natural follow-on from the condolence motion yesterday in that a lot that was said yesterday is reiterated in part today and reinforced, and that is appropriate. This bill follows on from the disasters and the trauma that occurred in the last few weeks.</A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1109293"></A>
I want to thank the Premier for the briefing that was made available to the Independent members Monday. Quite a number could not make it because of the timing of it, but I appreciate the staff who were made available for that briefing. During that time a number of matters were canvassed. The proposed CEO, Mr Graeme Newton, was in attendance, albeit late. The Major General was not able to attend, but the two staff members who were there were very competent in being able to address the matters that were raised. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109295"></A>
I note from the briefing we received that the establishment of this authority is not intended--although the bill could be read this way--to overrule local government. In the briefing there was discussion about the interaction between the authority and local government. It was reiterated on a number of occasions that the intention is for the authority to work with local government, not in competition with or in opposition to it. It is my hope that that occurs--that is, with all of the local authorities throughout the state that have been affected by floods, there will be a cooperative agreement and a cooperative relationship between the authority and the relevant local authorities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109296"></A>
One of the frustrations that I have had expressed to me in relation to flood damage is the directive that local government day labour staff are not able to do flood rehabilitation work, other than the absolute critical work that was done at the time of the flooding, because of risks, I am assuming, that the day labour crews may do more than flood rehabilitation and therefore the state and federal governments will be asked to fund works that should be maintenance works funded by local authorities. The argument that it would be easy for local authorities to misrepresent the work that they are doing is dated. There is a lot of electronic equipment now that can photograph and detail the works that are being done by local government day labour gangs and it would be very easy to be able to differentiate between flood damage and ordinary maintenance work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109297"></A>
The larger councils that have a high level of maintenance work on an ongoing basis--and perhaps the Brisbane City Council is one of those--may have enough work to be able to maintain their day staff alongside those undertaking the rehabilitation work that has to be done as a result of the floods. However, for a lot of other councils the priority will be to carry out the flood work, and the day labour could be the most cost-effective and appropriate staff to use for that. Additionally, setting up the contracting process to get the work done on a contract basis is going to cause even greater delays--there may not be contractors who want to go that far out west--so I would ask that that process and that mandate be reviewed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109300"></A>
Another issue raised with me in relation to reactions to the flooding--this was particularly raised with me by residents in the Brisbane region, but I think the principle applies to residents right across the state--is that many people lived in Brisbane in 1974, and I will use Brisbane as the example because that is where it is probably the most stark. There were reports in the media in January as the floodwaters were rising that it was going to be worse than the 1974 floods, that it was going to be less than the 1974 floods, that it was going to be the same as the 1974 floods. If you lived in the same premises, you would know what that meant--that is, there would be a mark on the wall or a biro line or a felt pen mark that said, ‘This is where the floods were in 1974.’ But there have been a lot of changes not only in people’s place of residence but also in people who have moved into the district, and town planning and development have changed the topography and the drainage in areas.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109304"></A>
A flood of significance occurred in 2011 and people have said to me that, with the GPS data, with other modelling data that is available, with the capture of information and photographs, now is the time to have a database set up, either on people’s rates notices or as a general data storage, detailing the flood heights. If that happened, when the media said, ‘This will be a 14-metre flood,’ somebody at Jindalee could say, ‘That’s where a 14-metre flood reaches,’ and somebody at Yeerongpilly would know that that is where a 14-metre flood reaches. Therefore, if it is a 12-metre flood they can measure down from that; if it is projected higher, they will know. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109305"></A>
Now is the time when that information and data has to be captured and stored and has to be disseminated, because it is fresh in everybody’s mind. The people who have commented to me have said that that would give flesh to the warnings that came over the radio and TV, albeit those warnings had a lot of detail. People would be able to know what 14 metres was--whether it would reach their house, whether it would inundate or whether it would just go to the first storey if they are in a high-block house. I support that call. It is not only an important call; it is also very realistic for people who live in this region and in other regions to have that sort of information--information that is precise, practical and means something to the house owner.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109306"></A>
At the briefing there was a question asked about the cost of operating the board that will oversee the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. We were told that the cost of the board would be meeting fees only plus costs incurred, and I welcome that. I believe that the community, whilst it is 100 per cent supportive of rebuilding our state, wants to see the money that is available for reconstruction as much as possible go to reconstruction. Having said that, I am not saying that people are not worthy of proper remuneration. However, I believe that the community, as it does with the Premier’s flood appeal, wants to see that money go to where it is needed the most.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109337"></A>
As other speakers have said, the authority will have significant power. It will be calling up in instances the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act and the operation of that act is something that people in my electorate are very much aware of. It has significant power. It has powers of entry, which a lot of acts carry, and it has powers for compulsory acquisition. The ability for members of the public--owners of property--to be able to cope with the process of compulsory acquisition is in direct relationship with a number of factors: their understanding of the powers within the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act, the ability of the employees of the government to administer that act and the attitude, competence and compassion of those people who administer the act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109339"></A>
The member for Gympie in his contribution made some very negative comments about the CEO of this proposed authority. I cannot comment, because I am not in Gympie and I certainly had no experience with the Mary River compulsory acquisitions. But I have experience with the operation of this act up in the Targinni area. There were people there who were treated appallingly. Because there was a five-year period or there abouts where there could be negotiated sales as opposed to compulsory acquisitions, there were older people who were told, ‘This is how much we are going to give you.’ If that person indicated concern, they were told, ‘Take it or leave it. If you don’t take it, we will just come and take you when we want you.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109341"></A>
I do not believe that is the intent of the Premier. I do not believe that it is the intent of the director-general of the department. But the implementation of that act is directly related to the people who are given the powers on the ground to go to speak to the people affected and it is critical that those people are the right people. There should be a fair deal for the taxpayer--100 per cent--but there should also be a fair deal for the occupier or the owner of that property because, in all instances of compulsory acquisition as opposed to negotiated acquisitions, and in some instances for negotiated acquisitions, those people are being moved on against their desires. They want to stay. So the treatment of those people is critically important. In this instance, we are talking about people who have faced tragedy and trauma. Unless they are treated appropriately in the way in which the act is implemented and the manner in which they are dealt with, those people will be traumatised again and they do not deserve that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109342"></A>
Other members have talked about cutting through red tape. Again, I do not have a problem with that. There will be times when due process will take time. The end of that due process would be the same as what will be achieved without the process because of the extenuating circumstances. However, again, people’s rights and liberties must be respected and they must be afforded as much as possible an opportunity to present any concerns that they have. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109343"></A>
During the condolence motion I mentioned the infrastructure in the Gladstone region. We were very blessed. We only had localised flooding. Infrastructure was affected. Roads were damaged and they will be repaired, I have no doubt. We certainly did not face the wholesale destruction that places such as the Hinchinbrook, Yeerongpilly and Bundamba electorates suffered. We have a breadth of socioeconomic residents and particularly there are areas in this state of Queensland where the majority of residents do it tough and they need help. They are often not insured and their opportunities to bring their homes back to a habitable state are limited. We need to be compassionate with them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109344"></A>
My constituency have asked me to bring to this chamber the fact that stress, not from floods but stress from industrial development, is bringing pressure on our infrastructure--things like our airport and our hospital. We were pleased to welcome the Premier and the Prime Minister to Gladstone. They landed at Gladstone Airport and then were helicoptered out to inspect affected places such as Theodore and Rockhampton and we welcomed them. But the message that my constituency asked me to convey is that our stresses in the next year will not be flood related; they will be related to industrial development. I have not heard one person in my electorate not wish success and rehabilitation for anyone who has been flood affected. However, there are people in my electorate now who are facing eviction from their houses and flats because they cannot afford the increased rentals and they will be in similar positions as the flood victims unless infrastructure investment in relation to the LNG development occurs through this government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109345"></A>
Those are the main points that I wish to raise in this debate. I place again on the record, as I did in the condolence motion, the thoughts and prayers of the people in my electorate for those throughout Queensland who have been so tragically affected. Our hope is that the Queensland Reconstruction Authority will be able to bring this state back into an operating, welcoming, homely and rehabilitated condition as fast as possible. We wish for all of those who have suffered physically, psychologically, financially, emotionally--in whatever way--a speedy recovery. </Hansard-Body>

 (Bundaberg--LNP) (9.15 pm): Across this vast state of Queensland we have all witnessed the blanket of destruction that engulfed the streets, neighbourhoods, towns and cities that we all call home. However, throughout this destruction we also witnessed the best in people and showcased to the world the true fibre of mateship that links together all Queenslanders. This mateship extended beyond the boundaries of race, religion, age or creed and brought people of all different footprints to stand together as one. The people of Queensland have spoken through their actions and now it is time for this parliament to allow words to be put into action and to allow Major General Mick Slater and the Reconstruction Authority to get on with the job and cut through the red tape and bureaucracy that is strangling Queensland and the community of Bundaberg. This cutting of red tape, coupled with an open and transparent administration, will assist the hundreds of homes and approximately 120 businesses that were inundated with floodwaters and the 2,000 people who were assisted in our recovery centre in Bundaberg. There is also the indirect effect on businesses that did not go underwater through loss of trade and the reduction of the backpacker trade, which has severely affected the accommodation houses, hospitality and agricultural businesses throughout my region.</Hansard-Body>
<DIV>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109352"></A>
Destruction has occurred to key community infrastructure, including roads, bridges, drainage, sewerage, water treatment facilities, jetties, pontoons, pavements, parks, play equipment, play amenities, sporting facilities and the Bundaberg port, just to name a few. We have experienced a loss of stock, contracts, normal trade and tourism packages due to media negativity that was assisted by comments such as ‘floods of biblical proportions covering an area the size of France and Germany’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109353"></A>
The financial impact of the flood on the community of Bundaberg is also devastating to our local cane, timber, horticultural, fishing and tourism industries, which are all affected. In dollar terms, Bundaberg’s cane industry has lost approximately 2,000 hectares, worth approximately $30 million. Millions have been stripped from the region’s horticultural sector, consisting of tomatoes, capsicums, zucchinis, rockmelons, watermelons, pumpkins, sweet potatoes--all damage and destroyed. Several thousand hectares of productive farmland were inundated, resulting in soil erosion and a loss of topsoil, coupled with increased costings due to hand-picking and damage to cane train networks. These cane train networks need to be repaired in a timely manner or more heavy trucks will be pushed onto our already fragile road networks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109355"></A>
On another note, the Port of Bundaberg is very important for the export of sugar and molasses. With so much silt carried down the river, this vital infrastructure is still closed. That means that all the sugar--approximately 120,000 tonnes--in these enormous sugar sheds cannot be exported. This issue becomes another anxiety for farmers, who are tied up with forward payments. Four seafood processors were also badly damaged and people along the side of the river cannot get flood insurance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113872"></A>
The local marina was totally washed away, including the fuel facilities used by a large number of the trawlers that travel along the east coast of Australia. In particular, ASP Holdings lost its catwalk worth approximately $300,000. Its fuel facility went under water and that cannot be restored by a grant of $25,000 or even a loan of $250,000. The Bundaberg slipway on the north side of the Burnett River also sustained many hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of damage. The Midtown Marina, owned by Ray Foley, was totally obliterated and the fuel facility, which is one of the busiest on the east coast of Australia, was also washed downstream. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113875"></A>
The fishing industry has been decimated, and most in the industry were already struggling prior to this devastation due to the state Labor government’s industry reforms. These facilities in Bundaberg are used by 41 trawlers and countless beam net, crabbing and line fishermen for mooring, refuelling and repairs. The destruction of these facilities and the direct threat to several hundred jobs will have a significant impact on the marine and fishing industries in Bundaberg. I am saying to this state government that what we have on offer is not enough for these industries, and I respectfully request that this government work with the federal government to extend category D funding to the Bundaberg region. The business community needs confidence so that when governments say they will do everything possible within their means to help we are not overridden by cynical comments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113877"></A>
For some of these agricultural industries, having skilled work is the most important component to their existence and we need financial incentives to keep workers in the region. The statistical data for our region and the information provided also have to be taken into account whilst comparing our current population and the high percentage of socio and economic issues and the unemployment both pre and post the Christmas floods. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113878"></A>
In conclusion, we need significant infrastructure projects brought forward to increase the stability and confidence in our community. We need better monitoring and reporting of flood heights and we need a review of flood mitigation schemes and incentives. This bill represents the beginning of the official reconstruction. More than that, it represents a promise to the people of Bundaberg. They cannot afford to lose their trust in our parliament that we can rebuild our communities. We owe it to the communities and these people to ensure the rebuilding is undertaken with practicality, efficiency and compassion. Our communities deserve a response that will give them back the communities, facilities and infrastructure they lost; they also deserve a response that will provide them with optimism, hope and great expectations for the future. </Hansard-Body>

 (Caloundra--LNP) (9.22 pm): I rise to make a contribution to the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill before the House tonight. On behalf of the people of Caloundra, I pass on our condolences to all of those who have suffered the loss of loved ones, property and other matters and will suffer for some considerable time. I want to confine my comments to the terms of section 10(1)(h) of the bill before the House. Subsection (h) explains what the authority will do. It states--</Hansard-Body>

... if asked by the Minister, to give the Minister advice about putting into effect the recommendations of the commission of inquiry issued by the Governor in Council under the <Hansard-Italic>
Commissions of Inquiry Order (No. 1) 2011</Hansard-Italic>
, particularly any recommendations about flood mitigation or land use planning.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113887"></A>
I will come back to that subsection in a moment. If we hark back to the last flood in Brisbane, the 1974 flood, we can see that between 1974 and 2011 there has been a significant population growth and a significant increase in dwelling numbers. In addition, we know that the dwellings have spread much further than they were in 1974 and we know that there are plans across the state to increase the number of dwellings into even newer areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113888"></A>
The floods and cyclone of 2010-11 were one of the most devastating events that occurred across the state for well over 100 years. Of course, it cannot be considered that it was a one-in-100-year event because when we look back at La Nina over the past century we find that there have been 12 strong classic years of onset of La Nina--1910, 1916, 1917, 1938, 1950, 1955, 1956, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1988 and 1998--prior to 2010. The reason I have listed that series of years harks back to the subsection I quoted before and the power of the minister to obtain recommendations in relation to flood mitigation or land use planning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113889"></A>
One would anticipate that the commission of inquiry will have wide-ranging powers. One would also expect that the commission of inquiry will comment upon and make recommendations about future building proposals and the future use of land that may not be under construction at this time but may be being considered by various authorities for construction in the foreseeable future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113890"></A>
Again, I stress that the subsection I referred to allows the authority to give advice about flood mitigation or land use planning as a consequence of the commission’s recommendations or findings. Given that the commission is required to give an interim report by August this year, there are a number of factors that would be prudent. Before going into what those factors are, I note that the member for Nicklin touched on the ULDA and that is exactly the point I want to raise. I want to raise the ULDA in the context peculiar to Caloundra South and tie the ULDA into the terms of the subsection I quoted and the powers of the authority to give advice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113893"></A>
Let us leave aside the issue of Caloundra South’s other matters of infrastructure et cetera and let us just consider the size of Caloundra South. The total block is 3,000 hectares and the area for construction is 1,600 or 1,700 hectares. There is a plan to develop that block to accommodate some 22,000 homes and 50,000 residents over a period. We know that block is now subject to ULDA and we know that the ULDA has an obligation to issue a draft plan for consultation with the public by March or April this year. At that time, the people of Caloundra and the Sunshine Coast will make recommendations about what they think should or should not occur or amendments in relation to the proposed plan. However, we know that the commission of inquiry is required to produce an interim report by August of this year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113895"></A>
I mentioned that there are certain things that would be prudent. Bearing in mind 1974 and the devastation that occurred at that time and bearing in mind the devastation that has occurred this time and the loss of life, there is nothing to be lost by the ULDA deferring any further plan in relation to Caloundra South until such time as the interim report is available. Let us not wait for a disaster to happen. This commission will have a far-reaching impact in regard to planning for many years to come. Given this area would house a population of 55,000 and a dwelling capacity of 22,000 and given the short period of time between now and August this year, it would be extremely prudent for the ULDA to halt any further planning and take into account the recommendations of the commission of inquiry. That would be a logical step and a logical process to adopt. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118302"></A>
With that report in front of it, the ULDA could then make informed decisions based upon an independent commission assessing and making recommendations as to what would be prudent for future development. What I do not want to see is some time down the track we are standing in this House saying that Caloundra South was a disaster waiting to happen. The opportunity now exists, and the chink is there for a short period of time, to make common-sense decisions that are thoroughly researched and investigated and proper recommendations are taken into account in relation to future development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118303"></A>
The LNP has made it quite clear that we support the development of Caloundra South, but we do not support the development at all costs. We support a development that is rational, that is thought through, that is modern and takes into account the needs not just of the population who reside there but the population across the coast. If the 2010-11 disasters have taught us anything it is that history will repeat itself. If we have forgotten the lessons of 1974 we now have an opportunity to regather that information by use of an independent body to assess where we went wrong but, more importantly, where we can do better in the future. I therefore request and suggest most strongly that planning by the ULDA be suspended until at least the interim report becomes available and a properly informed decision can be made in relation to the development of that site. </Hansard-Body>

(9.31 pm): I rise to speak to the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill. There has been a lot of talk tonight. I will not go over too many things that have been raised today, but I would like to touch on a few things. This bill is the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill and I think that that tells us exactly what it is all about. Its job is to rebuild, restore and progress this state--to restore not only our infrastructure but also people’s confidence in themselves and the future of Queensland. There are many questions that will be raised over the next few months in relation to the inquiry. That is where many of the questions that have been raised here tonight should be directed. I believe that housing those people who have lost their homes is the No. 1 priority. Nobody should be left without a roof over their head. That roof should not be a tent or a make-do shelter; it has to be a home, because as soon as people are back in their home their confidence builds. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1118310"></A>
We also have to ensure that our roads and infrastructure are back in place. We have to be honest and recognise that for quite a number of years now our roads have deteriorated. There have been patchwork quilts on a lot of our roads. Our bridges have been reduced from two lanes to one. We see a lot of that in the rural areas of Queensland. Most members would remember the old joke about the woman who died and on her gravestone was, ‘I told you I was sick’. I have been telling people for almost 13 years that the Blackbutt Range was in bad need of repair and that as soon as there was a heavy deluge it would come down. Maybe now they will believe me that that range needed a lot of attention a long time ago. I hope that the attention it gets now will be looking 50 years into the future and not just be a patch-up job to allow people to go through. I am not saying that we are not appreciative. I really do thank the minister for getting that range road open. It seemed a long time coming. For many country areas perhaps the flood may have been welcome in that we will get a lot of repairs done over time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118311"></A>
The boundary redistribution for the regional shires is flawed in this instance. Yarraman, which is part of the Toowoomba Regional Council, was well and truly cut off in several ways. The South Burnett Regional Council picked up a lot of the load with regard to Yarraman. They did not mind picking up that load but it really did show that Yarraman is definitely in the wrong regional council. That does need to be looked at very closely in the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118312"></A>
There will be questions about the operation of Wivenhoe. There will be questions about insurance. I hope that there will be a lot of changes in that regard. SunWater has a chart--I saw one a few years ago and an article in one of the letters to the editor today reminded me of it--that records the previous 100 years that shows periods of drought followed by rain. Everyone on the land knows that. A common saying in the country when people say, ‘When will the drought end?’ is ‘When there’s a bloody good rain’. That tends to be what we say: it will not be finished until we get a flood. It is a standard conversation. We have to be aware that this is not just today’s history; it has been the history of the past. We have had floods left, right and centre through the two centuries we have been on this land. They will continue in the future as they would have happened long before. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118313"></A>
This event must not be forgotten. A flood map needs to be drawn up. This was for many areas a high flood. It has to be recorded and people have to be discouraged from building in flood-prone areas. I know of an instance where people I know fought like crazy with the council to a build a house that could be, in extreme circumstances, subjected to flood and it was subjected to flood in this particular instance. One has to wonder when people who do that say they are going to now sue the council because they have had a flood through their house and they should not have been allowed to build there. It is quite disturbing when one hears stories such as that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118314"></A>
We should also not forget that many farmers have lost lots of land. The river has carved wide areas of land off people’s property. That has to be reassessed because I do not think it is appropriate that they be charged for X amount of land pre-flood and be charged the same after the flood when in fact they may have lost 20 or 30 acres to the waters. The shire councils will no doubt have put in a huge list of requirements. They have done it tough. They will do it very, very tough for a long time to come and they should not be expected to pick up the entire bill. The South Burnett Regional Council, on the second or third day after the floods receded, came back and said that it had probably lost $300 million worth of infrastructure. The very next day, and the next and the next, that kept going higher and higher and higher. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118315"></A>
I endorse almost everything that people have said in this House. I will be supporting the member for Nicklin’s amendment and his concerns about the ULDA. With those few words I trust that we will do the right thing in the right order, that there will be very few delays and people’s lives will be back on track within a very short space of time. </Hansard-Body>

 (Toowoomba South--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.38 pm): I join with my LNP colleagues not only in speaking to this bill but also, in a spirit of bipartisanship, in supporting this bill so that it is passed and we can start very quickly bringing about the various engineering and regulatory changes that are needed to be brought about by this bill. I will also provide some warnings. We have to be careful in introducing the Queensland Reconstruction Authority that we do not add another entire level of bureaucracy that gets in the way of all the decisions that are being made by councils which are going ahead with repair work and that it does not get in the way of the normal decision-making processes of departments. We have to ensure that this is kept as a lean and mean organisation that acts quickly to provide the opportunity for reconstruction to proceed at a fast rate and to adhere to the principles that it was set up for.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1122751"></A>
The key issues for the Reconstruction Authority under the bill are reconstruction, preparation so that we will be well prepared for any future disasters and flood mitigation. Its provisions enable it to expedite regulatory approvals and put in place priorities for community infrastructure and services. The task of the QRA will be massive. Never in our lifetime or in the history of Queensland have we seen something so extensive. Up to 80 per cent of the state has been hit by flooding, freak storms and deluges, inland tsunamis or one of the fiercest tropical cyclones that Queensland has ever seen. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122753"></A>
In my speech earlier this week on the condolence motion I mentioned the human tragedy that has beset Toowoomba and also the Lockyer Valley. I continue to provide my condolences to all of those families who have suffered from other losses that occurred throughout the floods in Central Queensland and in Brisbane and also the cyclone in North Queensland as well as the people who have suffered damage to businesses, homes, farms and so on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122755"></A>
The inland tsunami in Toowoomba was catastrophic and shocking. It shocked everybody. Being on top of a mountain, we never thought we would see a wall of water like that. Prior to the event and also after it, we had weeks and weeks of rain that delivered the massive floods of the Condamine and surrounding areas. Our city was isolated for large periods. Well before Monday, 10 January, when we were hit by the inland tsunami, the range highway had been closed on a number of occasions. I was caught at the bottom of the range for a couple of hours on 5 January, when water poured down the range through Withcott. It rolled rocks and rubble all down the range and over the road. It poured about two feet deep across the four lanes of the highway at Withcott. As a result, the range was closed because of land slips after weeks and weeks of rain. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122758"></A>
We started to get more land slips then. I have railed in this House for many years about the problems of the range and the desperate need for the Toowoomba bypass. Not only is it land slips that close the road; often it is accidents--truck rollovers in particular--that cause road closure. Because the large semitrailers drive in the left-hand lane, when they lose their brakes, which happens on occasions, often they cannot move across to the right-hand lane to get up into the safety ramps because there are cars with passengers on the inside of them. Then they bravely go up the back of another truck. So we face all of these problems. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122761"></A>
This road is the artery of Australia. It allows trucks to take goods to and from South-East Queensland, the southern states of Australia, the north-west and the north of Australia. Three million to 3 million people live in South-East Queensland. Some 4,500 B-doubles a day travel through 16 sets of traffic lights, through the biggest inland city of Australia. It takes them about an hour to get from the bottom of the range, up the range and through the city. No other city in Australia would have to be subjected to such a social blight. Some $44 million was spent by the previous Howard government on the purchase of the corridor, on the drilling of the test holes for the tunnels and for the finalisation of the detailed plans. It is ready to go. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122766"></A>
I implore the QRA to examine this matter closely. I know that Mick Slater, as chairman of the QRA, is a very strategic person. Not only is there this massive transport task for all of Australia; there is also the social blight on Toowoomba. Now we see the absolute disaster of land slips, crashes and all the other problems that isolated our city. During this disaster we were isolated from the east on the range highway and to the south as Cunningham’s Gap and the New England Highway to New South Wales were closed. Roads to the west and roads to the north were also closed. It reached the point where petrol, food, milk and bread--just about everything--was all running out. The west could not be supplied and people were desperate for supplies. It really was a disaster. In a nation like ours, a region like the south-west of Queensland, where about a quarter of a million people live--part of the most productive export earning area of the state--should not be left in a situation like this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122768"></A>
This has to be the No. 1 priority for Queensland. It has to be one of the major priorities of the QRA. It must take a lead role to ensure that both the federal government, in terms of providing the funding, and the state government, in making it a road priority, are not only alerted but pushed to do this because this cannot go on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122770"></A>
The whole problem has been exacerbated by the absolute destruction of the railway line down the range. The port of Brisbane was sold on the basis of moving about 10 million tonnes of coal a year. The bulk of that coal comes down the railway line or it comes down in B-double trucks through Toowoomba. This railway line is still out and it will be out for at least another seven or eight weeks, until a week or two into April. There is increasing production at mines like New Hope at Acland and Cameby Downs and other mines in the Surat Basin. There is the grain to be carried, which cannot be carried at the moment because of the destruction of the line. We are looking at hundreds, if not another thousand, of trucks that will be going through Toowoomba with all this extra freight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122775"></A>
In the immediate aftermath of this inland tsunami in our city there was absolute chaos. The two alternative roads, Murphys Creek Road and Blanchview Road, were cut off by substantial damage and the city was isolated. Once they opened the range, with just one lane up and one lane down, there was up to three hours wait. I was there one afternoon when I saw stretching from the top of the range back to the CBD four lanes of traffic--two lanes on the Warrego Highway right back to the CBD. About 70 per cent of those two lanes were B-doubles. Traffic on Herries Street and Margaret Street was stretched back to the CBD. It was absolute chaos. No city, especially a city of 100,000 people that serves another 150,000 in our immediate region, should have to put up with that. Strategically for the people of Toowoomba, for Australia and for Queensland, but particularly to cope with disasters like this and flooding that can occur in the west, it is so important that this matter is addressed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122782"></A>
The Toowoomba Regional Council has suffered massive damage. It is a council made up of eight previous councils stretching from Clifton and almost out to Inglewood, almost up to Dalby and up to Yarraman--</Hansard-Body>

 Seven previous councils plus the Toowoomba council. It has been a massive job. Most of the service centres spread all around this area were separated by floodwaters and basically had to do what they had to do. The Toowoomba council did a magnificent job in the city, in the areas that I was able to get to after our inland tsunami on Monday the 10th. It had the area cleaned up very quickly, which gave great heart to the shopkeepers in the area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122786"></A>
There is massive damage to infrastructure such as the sewage treatment plant at Oakey that has been destroyed, the roads and the bridges that have been damaged and the railway lines through the city that have been damaged. Strategically, it all has to be looked at. It may be that, as a strategic move, the railway line should be moved to skirt around the city on the western side. We would still have the old corridor there, which would be great for movements of some form of public transport in the future. That railway line caused such chaos where it crosses the creek. It acted like a dam wall. That could be taken out of our city and with it all the crossings over the railway line. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122822"></A>
I think issues like that have to be looked at strategically. When you look at this storm--nine inches fell in about three-quarters of an hour after days and nights of non-stop rain--it is almost impossible to cope with such a mountain of water coming down the two creeks, East and West Creek. But we have to consider that, when the 1974 floods occurred, the catchment areas were all small crop farms, kikuyu farms and so forth, and now they are all suburbs with bitumen roads, tin roofs, landscaped lawns and so forth. So there can be the potential for a greater flow. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122827"></A>
Millions of dollars of work has been done in flood retention, particularly on things like the waterbird habitat on East Creek, and on West Creek, in particular, a large number of retention basins were built during the time of the Howard government. Obviously we have to look at this problem that has occurred. We could still have more flash flooding. It is really important that this is looked at strategically so it can be fixed or moderated. Certainly, to have carried that water during that flood, you would have needed a concrete channel on both East and West Creek that was about 50 to 70 metres wide and probably 10 to 15 metres deep. That is the amount of water that had to be carried at that particular time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122830"></A>
The other issue, in terms of safety and prevention that I have discussed with the Toowoomba council, is the need for a system of gauging. People drive over the crossings that flood on both East and West Creek all the time. There are flood gauges with black and white lines, and I am sure a number of people do not know exactly what they mean. I think better designed permanent gauges that have red marks for danger and so forth should be considered. I also believe that we need robust gauging systems. It could be as simple as a bore pipe with a slot on the down side of the water flow so it does not get hit with debris and a ball that goes up and triggers a mechanism that turns on flashing lights with a sign under it that indicates dangerous water levels or flowing water. Also, when people get their driver’s licences they should be taught that you put your car into low gear and drive slowly, not to go fast which can spray the water up and stall the car, and also things like opening the car door to let the water in if the car starts to move to try to stabilise and hold the car. That is important, particularly for young people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122832"></A>
The Toowoomba Regional Council has a particular issue with day labour. The staff are employed on day labour doing particular roadworks and earthworks that are funded by certain funds. When those staff were diverted to do all the flood work that they had to do, it has cost the council because they cannot use those specific funds that were designated for day labour. It is so important that, under the NDRRA, councils like Toowoomba do receive proper funding and are not denied that funding because they operate on a day labour basis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122833"></A>
The QRA will have to look at not only the areas that have been flooded in cities like Toowoomba but also the surrounding areas and townships that have been flooded and cut off for days and days. They have to look at systems. I certainly think the inquiry needs to look at systems. I think decentralisation is a great thing in a crisis, because it is the councils on the ground--and I saw this in Toowoomba--that have the people, the mobility, the machinery, the equipment and the local knowledge to make decisions. We need the Defence Force to be able to make quick decisions. Toowoomba was desperately trying to get a little Bell helicopter from the Army aviation base to take medical supplies to Cecil Plains when it was marooned, but it could not get a decision. We should enable decision making like that. Some of the organisations that provide such wonderful volunteers, like the Red Cross, need to be able to make faster decisions. People were evacuated from Oakey and from the Lockyer Valley to the Toowoomba Grammar School. The Toowoomba Grammar School dealt with it all before some of the agencies who were wanting to go in and help got permission from their head office to go in and do that some two to 2 days later. We need decentralisation, trust, responsibility and preparation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122835"></A>
This has been an enormous learning experience. The Toowoomba council were fortunate that they had just formed their disaster management committee and that it was put in place just days before the crisis hit us on Monday, the 10th. All councils need to have some form of training process so they are ready for whatever it might be, and to do that perhaps at the beginning of the summer season. I do compliment the Toowoomba council for the way they devolved responsibility. They told their service centres in the other seven former shires, ‘Do whatever you have to do,’ and they just got on with the job. I would like to compliment the people of Toowoomba who just got stuck in. The people who were hit by the water in the middle of the town were cleaning up the next day, shoulder to shoulder with all the council workers and volunteers. The people whose houses and yards were inundated just got in and cleaned up. Everybody just felt so sorry and so much sympathy for our friends and neighbours down in the Lockyer Valley. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122836"></A>
I think it will be an important education for people. Younger generations who had not been through floods before thought that, because the floods were going to go to 5.4 metres in Brisbane, that meant 5.4 metres where they lived up river. It needed to be explained to them that halfway up the river to Ipswich that rise might be 13 or 14 metres. We do need a proper warning system. Everyone is so concerned about what happened at Wivenhoe. There was an old guy from Somerset who rang the ABC in Toowoomba on Monday morning and he said, ‘We had 400 millimetres last night in Somerset. That’s 16 inches.’ His exact words were, ‘Brisbane better be warned.’ That was the time to open the gates and let out 200,000 or 300,000 megalitres so that the next Tuesday--midday Tuesday or late on Tuesday--they would not have had to let go 635,000 megalitres which then swamped Brisbane. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122839"></A>
The water that hit above Grantham landed on about 330,000 hectares and funnelled down to Grantham. That water did not get to the Brisbane River until about midnight on Monday night. So there was all that time, from say five or six on Monday morning. We were in the midst of one of the worst rain events that had been going on for days and days and days, with the BOM showing a great long cloud of red and yellow and blue on the weather map. That was the time, at five or six in the morning, to start letting water out, because it was obvious what was going to happen. There was the inflow from that 16 inches that fell at Somerset and the water that was pouring in from other areas. Perseverance Dam on the Monday overflowed. That meant Cressbrook Dam went up by one metre an hour and it eventually overflowed into Wivenhoe as well. There have to be major improvements made to the way we manage our dams. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122842"></A>
It has been said often that every good drought ends with a good flood. But we know now with modern technology that a good drought is El Nino, and once you move into a La Nina system you come into a time of more storms, more water and so forth. So obviously the system of management of dams--those dams like the Wivenhoe, whose purpose is approximately half for drinking water and half for flood mitigation--have to be managed under a La Nina regime, not an El Nino regime, and even so at a time like this when water was pouring in for weeks and months from all the creeks and streams above that wall and then particularly that weekend, with the non-stop, constant rain. When we had 16 inches that night at Somerset, that was the time. Everybody should have been there and made absolutely sure that water was released, and thousands of houses in Brisbane and Ipswich could have been saved. </Hansard-Body>

I wish Mick Slater and the members of the authority well in doing everything they can to bring about robust engineering principles and good modern design for the future and to work cooperatively with councils and departments. I hope that the bureaucracy is kept to an absolute minimum and that this can result in a better build up of services and facilities for people who have been devastated by all these disasters.</Hansard-Body>

 (Keppel--ALP) (9.58 pm): I have sat here and listened to the arguments put by so many members, and it really intrigues me that they do not seem to have any concept that we are talking about the Queensland reconstruction bill. I mentioned in the motion of condolence a Latin maxim which is my family motto: dum spiro spero, which means ‘while I breath, I hope’. What this bill, the Queensland reconstruction bill, does is to give the people of Queensland hope, to give the people of Queensland satisfaction that they will be looked after and that they will be looked after across the whole of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

I draw the attention of members to certain matters in the explanatory notes. These are the real thrust of this bill. Everyone should stop and listen to this. If you can read, you can always go back to the explanatory notes and have a look. The explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1127602"></A>
The damage to Queensland homes, businesses and infrastructure caused by the floods and cyclone is unprecedented, and the recovery effort will require the dedication of significant resources for assessment, coordination and management of the reconstruction program across the State and involving all levels of government. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127603"></A>
All levels of government means local, state and federal governments. The explanatory notes outline the process for the achievement of the objectives. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1127605"></A>
The Authority will work across all levels of government to plan and facilitate an effective and coordinated program of reconstruction of community infrastructure and other property. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127606"></A>
The authority will not be tasked with dealing with anything that has happened before this. It will not be responsible for looking at any events prior to the devastating floods--bearing in mind that one of the first areas to be flooded was Rockhampton--as we have a commission of inquiry to do that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127607"></A>
This act will grant to the authority an overriding power to make sure that the people of Queensland effect recovery and enjoy recovery. As the explanatory sets out, reconstruction will be managed and implemented by local authorities and existing government entities. There are some that it cannot utilise so this bill ensures that the authority has the statutory powers to intervene where necessary. To facilitate this in the bill there is a notice to decide. To expedite things there is a progression notice. To undertake reconstruction efforts there is a step-in notice. These are powers that presently exist and are exercised by the Coordinator-General under the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127609"></A>
What this act does is give to the authority the ability to make those decisions that may not be made because some other level of government or some other authority drags their feet. This act is designed to ensure that the reconstruction of Queensland is affected smoothly and effectively. It has a two-year time frame. There is a sunset clause that limits it to two years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127611"></A>
I have heard members make comments about whether or not it will work. The Coordinator-General works and the Coordinator-General has been very effective in making sure that Queensland has proceeded and been able to develop. What this bill and the subsequent act will do is give the authority the power to make sure that Queensland can get back to being the Queensland that we know and love. I would like to thank the Premier for introducing the bill and for the work that has gone into the production of the bill. I commend it to this House. </Hansard-Body>

This bill is a vital plank in the rebuilding of Queensland following the devastation that has been inflicted on our state this summer. The rebuilding and recovery task facing us is immense, but we will, through the authority, remain focused on ensuring that the reconstruction of our state happens as quickly as possible.  I thank the opposition for its support of the bill. It is essential that we act in a bipartisan way and focus on the reconstruction, recovery and protection of the state in the interests of all Queenslanders. </A></Hansard-Body>

Tabled paper:</Hansard-Italic>
 Letter, dated 17 February 2011, from Hon Anna Bligh MP, Premier of Queensland to Ms Jo-Ann Miller MP, Chair of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee, regarding the Queensland Reconstruction Authority Bill.</Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127621"></A>
Let me address some of the comments made by members during the debate. The Leader of the Opposition made comments on a number of aspects of the bill. In particular, the leader and other members of the opposition have spent a great deal of the debate arguing about the need to have a separate minister responsible for reconstruction. In arguing this case, it seems the opposition is determined to judge me and my work ethic by their standards. I can assure them they will make a grave mistake in doing so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127622"></A>
It is apparent from the comments by the members of the opposition that their approach to the issue of bureaucracy is entirely inconsistent. While the Leader of the Opposition says he has reservations about how the extensive powers and responsibilities of the authority will operate, he also suggested in the same debate that we should extend those powers to other areas of the state not affected by natural disasters. He thinks the current planning and approvals process is too bureaucratic but, at the same time, has reservations about an alternative that cuts through them for these purposes. Meanwhile, the member for Redlands appears to be of a view that the authority simply represents a new bureaucracy. So, as usual, there is a very inconsistent approach. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127623"></A>
To address the Leader of the Opposition’s particular concerns about the operation and outcomes that stem from the authority, the reality is that the QRA will exist within the existing structures of government--that is, ministerial approval of its activities in the same way as every other statutory authority of government operates, subject to cabinet processes and subject to audit and probity requirements. It is not a law unto itself. In fact its powers and responsibilities are consistent with those afforded to the Coordinator-General in facilitating state development and the existing ULDA in facilitating affordable housing. It cannot be said that in either case the powers of those authorities have been abused in their operation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127625"></A>
Further, in relation to the Leader of the Opposition’s comments on the need for transparency and scrutiny of the authority’s powers and its spending let me say that I can advise that the authority will be subject to an extremely high level of scrutiny because of the legitimate and very strong interest from Queenslanders across the state in how the disaster recovery is going and what I expect to be a very high level of interest from the media. The board will be required to provide a monthly report on the authority’s operations, including details of how it has exercised its functions and powers. These monthly reports will be available on my department’s website and will ensure that all Queenslanders are kept informed about the progress of the reconstruction efforts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127627"></A>
It will be overseen by a board of management and be subject to both state and Commonwealth oversight in performing its functions. It will be subject to the oversight of the Auditor-General, the Ombudsman and the CMC. The authority will also be subject to right to information and privacy laws and the state procurement policy. Further, the Commonwealth government has established a reconstruction inspectorate to oversee the expenditure of Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangement funds in jurisdictions across Australia by scrutinising contracts, inspecting projects and investigating complaints, reviewing requests for reimbursement and analysing tender processes. I would venture to suggest that this may in fact be the most scrutinised statutory authority ever established in the history of the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127629"></A>
I also note that some members have sought assurances that reconstruction moneys will only be used for reconstruction purposes. Let me be clear about this: all funds flowing to the authority--both state and Commonwealth funds--can only be applied to the reconstruction and recovery effort consistent with the functions of the authority as set out in its legislation. The state’s funding to the authority will be identified in the documentation of the authority’s budget as part of the state’s budget papers and will be subject to the estimates process and the normal questioning available in the parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127631"></A>
A number of members made comments about the amendments to the Building Act 1975 and the Land Valuation Act 2010 to delay new statutory requirements for swimming pool fencing and land valuations. They questioned why there is a need for these delays to apply state-wide rather than being limited to declared disaster areas. Despite the suggestion that we should have two parallel statutory regimes in Queensland, where one set of pool fencing and valuation time frames apply to flood affected parts of the state and another for non-flood affected parts of the state, a number of major stakeholders are on the public record supporting these state-wide amendments. The REIQ has described the pool fencing amendments as ‘a sensible approach’. The LGAQ has said on valuations, ‘Given the impact of natural disasters is widespread across Queensland, the decision to delay the issue of valuations so that valuations are as accurate as possible is a logical approach.’ The Property Council said, ‘It is vital that we get it right. A short delay is a small price to pay to achieve this.’ I venture to suggest it is not often that we get agreement between the LGAQ and the property industry, but it appears that everybody except those opposite agree with this common-sense approach. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127672"></A>
In relation to pool fencing for example, the reason we have brought about that delay is recognition that there is a lot of pressure on the rental market right now and a lot of people who have been made homeless because of these disasters. We want to ensure that they can get into rental properties as quickly and as easily as possible. So if we only applied this to flood affected areas, it would mean that the people who are homeless would be delayed if they wanted to move out of the flood affected areas, which is of course precisely what they would want to do because the flood affected areas are flood affected. The reality is that the scale of these disasters has meant that the impact of the floods and the cyclone have been felt state-wide. It would be impractical and confusing to commence new statutory requirements for pool fencing or to issue new statutory valuations only in certain parts of the state or, in the case of the city of Brisbane, only in some suburbs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127674"></A>
I can advise the House that implementation of both of these new laws relating to pools and the new valuation regime is continuing successfully. Prior to the floods valuations were on track for delivery prior to 31 March, as required. However, additional time is now required. Why? To ensure that the impact of the disaster events can be fully assessed. Valuations, by and large, were done of properties at the end of last year prior to the disasters, prior to the floods. So we ran the risk that people’s valuations would in fact basically be inflated and higher than the actual value of their properties now and they would be exposed potentially to higher costs. Fair and accurate valuations will be an important part of the rebuilding process in many regions, and in fact the local governments affected sought this consideration from government.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1127676"></A>
I note the member for Burnett has written to me about eligibility for NDRRA assistance. I will investigate the issues raised by the member and respond in due course. I thank the member for Nicklin for his clear support for my decision to be the minister responsible for this legislation. I do so because, sitting in the centre of government, this recovery effort will require not only the legislative activities but the attention and funding of a range of government departments, and it is sitting in the centre of government that you can make those things happen. So I thank him for the recognition for that. I also note his comments in relation to an election. Can I say two things. He alluded to some rumour that the AEC was checking out possible election sites in April. Can I tell him that it is certainly not the state government making those inquiries, so perhaps there is an early Commonwealth election I do not know anything about. But I can give him an absolute guarantee that there have been no inquiries made to the Electoral Commission with regard to not only that date but to any date in 2011.</Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Well then, it must be true! But I am happy, if there is that rumour, to put that one to bed. Can I also say that in relation to speculation on tonight’s news that in fact that speculation was made contrary to the question that was put to me, and which I denied, that the movements by some ministers meant anything about an election. In fact, what it meant was that we had an opportunity to reshape government for the task ahead. This is a rebuilding year and we need to make sure that this cabinet has the best people on the job focused on just that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127681"></A>
I also wish to advise the member for Nicklin that the government will not be supporting the amendment to clause 149 that he has circulated, not because we do not agree with the intent of it but because we believe that under the legislation the authority has the power through its step-in powers to achieve the outcomes that he is seeking. The ULDA is a statutory authority of the state government. If the Reconstruction Authority is of the view that action that it is taking should be stopped in the interests of mitigation and recovery, then it has the power under its step-in power to do that. So what the member is seeking is actually already contained in the legislation and is implicit in the step-in power.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127683"></A>
The member for Gladstone raised the very important issue that I spoke a bit about in question time this morning, and that is the importance of making sure that as we focus--rightly--on recovery and reconstruction as our No. 1 priority we do not take our eye off those other priorities for communities both affected by flood and not affected by flood. Without doubt the realisation of the opportunities from the liquid natural gas industry are now more important to our economy than they have ever been, but getting them right is just as important as it has ever been. I absolutely concur with the comments from the member for Gladstone and can reassure her that this will continue to be a very top of the agenda item for government and she is going to see a lot of activity from us in and around the Gladstone region.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127684"></A>
Finally, I note that various members have, in the course of the debate tonight, spoken about the damage to specific infrastructure and assets in their respective electorates and that just about every member of those opposite argued for more money for many worthy purposes. What I did not hear from any member opposite was a declaration of support for the flood levy. I would suggest to them that when they roll out their long list of claims for more money for more things they might like to think about talking to Tony Abbott and their colleagues federally, because the sooner we can settle the source of Commonwealth funds the sooner they can legitimately have a debate about extra things that you might add to the shopping list.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127685"></A>
There was some debate about whether or not this might hold up the activities of getting things moving while we put all of the machinery in place. Can I assure the House and those opposite that councils are not waiting for this to happen, and nor should they be. If you get out and about and have a look at what is happening, councils are out there on the ground and are in fact putting in place repairs whenever they can. A lot of the roads have already had temporary works to make them trafficable, and those temporary works over time will have to be prioritised for permanent works. But they are getting on with the job, as they should be, and it is not intended that this authority will stop them from doing that. It is there in case they need assistance to move.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127687"></A>
As individuals, businesses and farms and communities now work to re-establish themselves, the Queensland government will continue to be there, standing alongside them doing whatever it takes to get Queensland back on her feet. This bill is the centrepiece of our strategy for the reconstruction of Queensland’s infrastructure and assets and the rebuilding of our communities. I want to thank those Public Service officers who have worked hard on the development and drafting of these bills. As members can appreciate, it has been an extraordinary effort to bring them to the parliament in the first week of the parliamentary sitting year so soon after the devastating effects of the disasters that we have seen. They have worked very hard and I particularly thank officers from the Department of the Premier and Cabinet, the Department of Infrastructure and Planning and of course those mighty drafters from the Office of the Queensland Parliamentary Counsel, and I commend the bill to the House.</Hansard-Body>

 (10.17 pm): This clause relates to definitions and states that the dictionary in the schedule defines particular words used in this act. There is no definition of the word ‘minister’. Is it intended that you as Premier will have sole power to do what the minister’s powers are under the bill, or is it intended that there will be, say, the director-general and the deputy director-general with delegated powers to make those decisions in lieu of the minister? Often I understand in other legislation they refer to a minister having powers, but senior departmental staff in various departments have that power and it is actually not the minister personally making that decision; these other people have delegated power to make the decision on behalf of the minister.</Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It does not define ‘minister’ because ‘minister’ generally is defined by the Constitution of Queensland. But in this case I have not put the word ‘Premier’ in because it leaves it open that, following an election next year, a different government or a different Premier--whatever--might want to change that without having to come into the parliament. You would not want to restrict anybody in the second year of the operation of this, and I do not think that makes sense. In relation to delegation of powers, it is open generally under the Acts Interpretation Act for powers to be delegated, but it is my intention that the minister’s powers in relation to this bill would be exercised by myself as the relevant minister.</Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This provision is there predominantly to provide for the sharing of data such as flood mapping to ensure that the Reconstruction Authority has the information that it needs to make good decisions in relation to redevelopment and reconstruction. At the point at which this authority ceases to exist, whether those provisions need to be saved and put into other relevant pieces of legislation is a judgement that should be made at the time. I would suggest that there would be an arrangement put in place. If there was a problem, if it needed a legislative base, then a government at the point at which this expires--because there are other provisions in this bill that will need to be transported, at the point that the QRA ceases to exist, to the department administering the state development act or the department administering the ULDA, for example. I envisage that this provision would likely lapse, but it is one that could be saved if at the end of the two-year period it needed to be. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the Premier. My second question is about another aspect of this clause. It is about the balance between flood mitigation and early reconstruction. I know that there are communities that at the moment are unsure of exactly what the priority rationale is between those two particular areas. They are not sure whether particular areas may be prescribed for flood mitigation and they are not sure whether they are all going to be able to get on with reconstruction first. I would like to have a potential explanation from the Premier about the authority’s function in that regard. </Hansard-Body>

 I thank the member for the question. I appreciate that there are some questions and confusion. I made a public statement in relation to this issue about two weeks ago--it was published in the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail</Hansard-Italic>
--and I was backed up by similar public comments at the time by the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, that those people who are in a position to make any adjustments to their homes that will make them livable should do so. If at some point down the track there is a judgement made by their council or by this authority that they should do something different then there would have to be other arrangements put in place to facilitate that. But we do not want people out of their homes or in temporary situations for a minute longer than they need to be. People who are in a position--for example they have insurance, they have a builder and they can get on with it--should do so. </Hansard-Body>

Clause 12(3)(a) states that the authority must--it is mandatory--include in its annual report a range of things. By way of comparison, clause 12(3)(b) is discretionary and states that the authority ‘may include in the report a comment about the effect on the authority’s activities of complying with the direction or notice’. My view is that that paragraph should be mandatory, just like the requirement in paragraph (a) before it. I seek clarification as to why it is not. </A></Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I think it is as simple as in some cases there may in fact be no effect on the authority. The paragraph is there to provide expressly that if the authority believes there is some comment it should put in the public arena about the minister’s direction then it is authorised to do so. But if there is nothing upon which the authority wishes to comment, or nothing that had any effect on the authority, then there is no requirement on them to do so.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132739"></A>
The member will find that this clause--and similar clauses--is a very standard clause in GOC legislation and in statutory authority legislation. It is a recognition that these bodies are slightly more independent from government than a government department and that they are not directly at the direction of the minister in the same way as a government department might be. Nevertheless, they are government bodies and they should be subject to the direction of the elected government. But if they are subject to that direction, that should be publicly made known. So it puts a bit of weight on the minister to only give a direction where the minister believes that the reason for doing so is publicly justifiable. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It could be a bit non-sensical if the authority has no comment to make. I do not believe that this paragraph in any way hampers. In fact, it frees up the authority to make as much comment as it wants. Say, for example, a minister directs the authority to expend money on a certain project. The authority is then at liberty to say, ‘Because of this direction we were unable to spend money on this other thing, which was equally or potentially a priority.’ But if there is no effect, if there is nothing on which the authority wishes to comment, as I said, it seems a bit non-sensical to somehow force the authority by legislation to make a comment on something that may not require it. </Hansard-Body>

In this case, from my reading of the functions and powers of the chief executive officer, this has already been preordained. You have a CEO who, under subclause (1)(b), takes ministerial directions, or the minister directs the CEO. I cannot see anywhere within that clause where it states the functions and powers of the chief executive officer where that CEO must take directions from the board. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132751"></A>
The nearest I can find to this model of board is the Queensland Health boards or the local hospital boards, where you have at the moment community representatives but they can merely make recommendations to the CEO and all the power exists within that board with the CEO. The way the legislation is written now, there could be recommendations made from the board to the CEO, but the CEO may not follow through with those recommendations. The CEO’s direct focus is through to the minister, who will be directing the CEO. In a nutshell, what I am trying is find out is: we have a general on the board but does a CEO outrank a general? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132752"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In relation to the relationship between the board and the CEO, I direct the member to part 3 of the bill which outlines the functions. These include setting the strategic priorities for the authority, making recommendations to the minister about priorities for community infrastructure or the need for the declaration of declared projects, and ensuring that the authority performs its functions and exercises its powers in an appropriate, effective and efficient way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132753"></A>
Those are the sorts of general provisions that you would find in most statutory authorities, which generally mean that the board sets the strategic direction and is then responsible for ensuring that the authority as a whole, including the CEO, implements that strategic direction and takes the authority in the set of priorities that have been identified by the board and approved by the minister. So the CEO is responsible to the board. The chair reports directly to the minister. It is no different in this authority than in every other statutory authority. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I appreciate the answer that the Premier has given. However, the way it is written in the legislation at the moment is that there is only one direction. The CEO takes directions from the minister and at all other stages there are merely recommendations made from the board through to the CEO and then the CEO may or may not carry through with those recommendations. You would obviously think that with this group of people that would never happen. Nonetheless, there is a fundamental difference between this QRA board and any other board that most other people in corporate life would be aware of. </Hansard-Body>

 (10.30 pm): Premier, I have not thanked the staff for the briefing we had for this on Monday. I do want to thank the staff from the Premier’s office and the CEO, whom we met. I know it is in the early stages of preparation in terms of getting ready for the authority, but I am interested in potential staff numbers, which is covered by this clause. The clause states that the authority may employ other staff under the Public Service Act. Could the Premier give the House an idea of the projected full-time equivalents who may be allocated to this and how many may come from other government departments or may be externally hired? </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. I hope that he appreciates that it is genuinely too early to give any accurate response in terms of numbers. What I can say is that this is a short-term authority and it will rely on people with expertise in other agencies whom we know are sitting there. I acknowledge that in a smaller scale disaster many of the activities and functions that the authority will carry out would have otherwise been conducted by the department of main roads, the Department of Communities or the department of environment and planning. What we are doing with this is bringing those resources into one central place to minimise the amount of time it takes a council or another constructing authority to go around and knock on the various doors of government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132809"></A>
We are looking to second officers into the authority from other parts of the Queensland Public Service. So while they will appear on these books, they are people who would have been paid to do this work in another agency. Given the scale of what we are dealing with, this will require additional resources beyond that. We are certainly not looking for a large bureaucracy; we are certainly looking for an authority that is reasonably light on its feet. As you will appreciate, this is something I will be able to report on as the authority gets established and gets a sense of the exact size of the task, which is the phase it is currently engaged in.</Hansard-Body>

 As I said, it is the role of the board to set the strategic priorities, to set the overall plan. It is the role of the CEO to implement that plan and then report to the board regularly on the progress of that implementation. It is also important to recognise that it is the role of the board to make sure that, if there is any slowing down in the progress or if there is any problem, they are interrogating the CEO and other relevant officers of the agency about that problem. I certainly see them as being high level and strategic. If they identify, for example, that the progress reports of the CEO are unsatisfactory--if that is the case--they will be very actively involved in delving down and getting to more detail. </Hansard-Body>

 (10.34 pm): From the answers we have had from the Premier, it appears that we still do not know how many staff will be employed. As yet, I do not believe we have an estimate of how much money this authority will administer. Obviously, this authority will be administering funds in excess of billions if not tens of billions of dollars to carry out its core objectives. Therefore, I want to talk about clause 40 and the disclosure of a conflict of interest. The way I read this clause is that there is no provision within clause 40 for board members or the CEO or staff for that matter to make disclosures of a conflict of interest on a register prior to them beginning their job. The clause states--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1132835"></A>
the member must, as soon as possible after the relevant facts have come to the member’s knowledge, disclose the nature of the interest at a meeting of the board. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1132836"></A>
I may be wrong and I hope to be corrected but it does not appear their pecuniary interests are treated the same as a member of this place, whereby we must place them on the public record. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This again is a very standard clause. It is not possible in all circumstances to anticipate where a conflict of interest may arise. What it does is impose on a board member if such a conflict arises an obligation to disclose it and to absent themselves from the decision. As I said, this is a very standard provision not only in legislation establishing government bodies but in private board arrangements. There is a requirement that the chief executive must make a disclosure of their pecuniary interests to the Integrity Commissioner; that is in clause 153, which is an amendment of schedule 1 to do with statutory office holders. It is a consequential amendment at the back of the bill that will require the CEO to make a declaration as other CEOs are required to. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I just think we are dealing with uncharted waters here, so to speak. We have had unprecedented natural disasters and this is unprecedented legislation. The Premier has just described the method of managing the pecuniary interests of the CEO, and I would have thought that all members of the board would have to place their pecuniary interests on a similar register so that it is beyond reproach, it is there and it is transparent for all to see just exactly what interests they do have. These people will be making decisions about billions and billions of dollars. This state government has a budget of around $40 billion, so I just repeat and reiterate that, in the best interests of prudential account keeping, openness and transparency, all board members and all those associated with those senior positions should have their pecuniary interests on a register prior to them making decisions.</Hansard-Body>

 There is no such registry for board members. There is no such requirement on any other board of any other government agency.

 It is not the intention that the Urban Land Development Authority would be seeking powers under this act for the purposes of flood recovery. We would not be giving the Urban Land Development Authority the ability to use the powers under this act. They have an entirely different purpose. Flood recovery mitigation and reconstruction is the role of this agency and I would not want to see the two of those confused. If, however, and I understand your concern is predominantly in relation to the Sunshine Coast, there is an urban land activity happening and the Reconstruction Authority is of the view that it is contrary to the aims of flood mitigation and reconstruction it can step in and order that that activity cease, but under a different provision than this one. </Hansard-Body>

 They would be decisions made by the authority. I cannot imagine a circumstance where the authority would make that without it being the recommendation of the relevant local council. While it is technically possible under this bill for that to happen one does not have to think too much about how difficult that would be if it was against the will of the local council. Whether it is done straight upfront or later on, in both cases when it comes to the point of sale then the Acquisition of Land Act provisions would apply in terms of someone’s rights to valuations and appeals et cetera. </Hansard-Body>

 I thought the member might be going to talk about explanatory notes. The government has indicated that it will be moving to make all subordinate legislation require explanatory notes. The drafting practice requirements changed to that effect on 1 January. The amendment to the relevant act has not been brought into the parliament yet but it will be. But as a matter of practice that has already started occurring. </Hansard-Body>

 I acknowledge that it looks a little odd but my advice is that it is a very standard provision in relation to regulation-making power because the regulation needs to serve the purpose for which it was intended. I would suggest that if it did not, the price would probably be a political one rather than disadvantaging the person or the entity for whom the regulation was intended. I am happy to find other examples of it in legislation for the member, but that is the advice that I have. </Hansard-Body>

The penalty under this particular clause is 200 penalty units, which I believe is the maximum number of penalty units for any offence under this bill. In other clauses penalties range from 165 to 200 penalty units. So we are looking at $16,500 to $20,000 in fines. When compared with other legislation, these fines are significantly lower. I would like the Premier to detail for this place how they came up with that $20,000 fine. </A></Hansard-Body>

I raise this because I am dealing with a number of other issues at the moment. For example, under the fish habitat legislation the maximum fine for damaging a riverbank is $300,000. I am dealing with a number of people in the Burnett who are facing those fines at the moment. There is one gentleman, a Vietnam veteran, who is facing a maximum fine of $300,000, causing him great concern. There is also a lady, a widow, whose husband tragically killed himself during a court case late last year in Bundaberg over a fine of $300,000 under the fish protection legislation for damaging a fish habitat. In the case of a member of the board or an officer of the authority failing to act honestly in the exercise of their powers and functions, I am wondering whether a maximum fine of $20,000 is enough. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In terms of offences, the legislation has been drafted in comparison to other similar legislation for boards dealing with matters of a similar nature. As always happens with drafting, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel tries to ensure that, across the broad spectrum of matters that we deal with in this chamber and the broad spectrum of legislation, there is not too much discrepancy between offences of a similar nature. Not every offence is comparable, but I think the drafters do a pretty good job of ensuring some level of consistency.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148014"></A>
Obviously I cannot comment on the cases that the member has just talked about, but I am satisfied that the work has been done to ensure some consistency between the offences for board members and others in this legislation compared with similar breaches of duty in similar legislation. </Hansard-Body>

One such person is Frank Barnes, OBE. We joke about Frank Barnes, OBE--‘over blinkin’ eighty’. Frank is a guy who has been around for many years. In fact, I first met him when he was the chaplain at the Beenleigh State High School, before there were school chaplains in any number. He was paid for a day a week and worked five days a week. If it is about youth, as far as Frank is concerned it is about him. So he was right in there looking after these young people. He now coordinates the school chaplains in the area. He is the Police Citizens Youth Club rouseabout. By that I mean he is the chef, the waiter and the organiser. In fact, he organises and runs the Beenleigh Junior Chamber of Commerce--and the list goes on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1148075"></A>
Frank does not know this, and he will probably be cranky when it happens, but tomorrow morning at the Beenleigh-Yatala Chamber of Commerce breakfast Frank is going to be honoured by those who appreciate him and his efforts--for all that he has done and continues to do--for the Police Citizens Youth Club. They are going to cause this man’s name to be recognised forever. From tomorrow the extensive commercial kitchen area in the Police Citizens Youth Club will be known as the ‘Frank Barnes Kitchen’. Of course, Frank is still around so it is not going to be the ‘Frank Barnes Memorial Kitchen’. However, I dare say that at some time in the future we are all going to fall off our twig--and so will Frank. His name will live on in the Beenleigh area for many years to come. It is a fitting tribute to the man who has meant so much to the youth of the area. </Hansard-Body>

Brian Collard was born on 17 December 1943 and he passed away suddenly last Saturday afternoon. Together with the member for Albert I attended a celebration of Brian’s life today, as did some 600 to 800 people--the celebration of the life of Brian, and what a life it was. For almost 50 years he did so much for the people in and around the area of Beenleigh, Woongoolba and all of the other areas that are joined. Brian leaves behind his wife, June, sons David, Anthony, Timothy and Matthew, together with his daughters-in-law and 11 grandchildren. Clearly, he touched so many lives, as is evidenced by the number in attendance. I am sure all members join me in passing my condolences to June and the family. </Hansard-Body>

 (Broadwater--ALP) (10.59 pm): This coming Sunday I will chair the annual general meeting of the Runaway Bay RSL Sub-Branch, for which I have been a patron for a number of years now. The Runaway Bay RSL Sub-Branch currently has 185 members and, like most RSL clubs, offers its members welfare assistance, advocacy and representation on important issues affecting ex-servicemen and women and their families.</Hansard-Body>

However, for most RSL members, being a member of an RSL branch is also about mateship and the opportunity to catch up monthly with fellow ex-servicemen or women to reminisce over a beer or cuppa. The Runaway Bay RSL Sub-Branch is well known for being a friendly sub-branch and very supportive of its members. What is not so well known about this sub-branch is that, whilst some could consider it small, it is a very active branch in our community and in its efforts to continue the tradition of supporting serving troops.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153321"></A>
The Runaway Bay RSL Sub-Branch is one of the biggest supporters of the parcels for troops program. This program is a Gold Coast district RSL project and involves the packaging parcels filled with specialty food items such as lollies, cheese sticks and of course vegemite for our serving officers overseas. They also remember man’s best friend, putting together parcels for the explosive detection dogs that include dog treats and tennis balls.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153322"></A>
People are invited to donate to the parcels for troops program. The Runaway Bay RSL Sub-branch members will be packing all day on 3 March at a stall to be located at the Runaway Bay shopping centre outside Rockmans clothing store. The next batch of parcels, I understand, will be going to serving troops in Afghanistan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153324"></A>
This sub-branch has also been dedicated to helping the local community and in particular the youth. To date, the sub-branch has distributed around $15,000 for scholarships, bursaries and donations to local schools, local scouts and also the local SES unit. It has formed strong relationships with the local police, ambulance and fire station staff.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153326"></A>
The strong association the RSL sub-branch has with the Runaway Bay Junior Leagues Club has stemmed from an invitation that was extended to it to hold its meetings at the junior leagues club. That has now been extended to offering a room on site for office space for the RSL sub-branch. The Runaway Bay RSL Sub-Branch provides sponsorship for junior rugby league representatives, and many of the sub-branch members help out as volunteers for the Australian Rugby League Masters event held every year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153327"></A>
It is very clear that the Runaway Bay RSL Sub-Branch has a very important place in our local community, and since its inception has been a strong force in ensuring RSL clubs are relevant in our community now and in the future. </Hansard-Body>

 Non-conforming petition in relation to 100% fly-in, fly-out workforce plan. </Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153337"></A>
The size and scope of this petition shows the significant public angst caused by this proposal. My view is--and I have expressed it many times--that there has to be a choice for the workers and that a fly in, fly out operation should only be a percentage of the total workforce. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153339"></A>
Mining operations go through many phases of development--refurbishment, rebuilding et cetera--and the number of workers on site can vary greatly from time to time. During shutdown operations, for instance, contractors can bring hundreds of workers with different skill sets on to the work site for varying lengths of time. There is a real need to cater for the change in conditions, and the only way to do that in most cases is through fly in, fly out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153340"></A>
Our communities in the mining towns--including the essential services such as schools, police, emergency services, councils et cetera--rely on a stable population base to remain sustainable. For instance, for secondary schools to provide a comprehensive curriculum, they need a critical mass of students to effectively achieve that. It is also true that business outlets are in the same boat. They need a critical mass of residents to be profitable, and if they cannot achieve that they will pack up and leave the community. This is the reason why there is a huge concern about the application for 100 per cent fly in, fly out and, once approved, it will become a precedent for further expansion into other mines. Therefore, I totally reject the imposition of 100 per cent fly in, fly out. </Hansard-Body>

I would like to thank the people and organisations who gave up their time freely to provide information to locals in my electorate: Annette Lourigan from Metropolitan Funerals; Katharine Macleod from DonateLife; Alicia Loakes and Sean Ryan from Turner Freeman Lawyers; Ian Mellor, who is the coordinator of Queensland University of Technology’s Body Bequest Program; and celebrant Ruth Watson, who also volunteers running the free justice of the peace sessions at the Bribie Island Library. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153360"></A>
This forum was all about providing information on issues we often do not want to talk about. And, while talking about death can make us uncomfortable, it is important to make sure we are well informed and prepared.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153361"></A>
Annette Lourigan from Metropolitan Funerals discussed the funeral industry in general and particularly talked about her passion for environmentally friendly and sustainable coffins and funerals. This is a passion that I share, and I believe that we have an opportunity to improve the environmental outcomes of our funerals and to minimise the environmental impact of our passing. I will continue to encourage my constituents to consider environmental options when it comes to funerals and will work towards more sustainable funeral services across Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153362"></A>
Katharine Macleod from DonateLife talked about the process of organ and tissue donation. I am also very passionate about this because I am an organ donor and I feel it is very important for all of us to think about donating our tissue and organs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153364"></A>
Alicia Loakes from Turner Freeman Lawyers talked through many of the legal issues that can arise after death and took a large number of questions regarding wills and estates. I would like to take this opportunity to particularly thank Sean Ryan. Sean is a partner at Turner Freemen Lawyers. During the forum he generously offered his firm’s services free of charge to assist one of my constituents look further into a legal issue.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153367"></A>
It was particularly good to have David Dart, the President of the Queensland Funeral Directors Association, at the session and taking an interest in the session. Finally, I would like to thank the Toorbul-Donnybrook Pensioners Association for their assistance in organising this forum. The association are a key part of the Toorbul and Donnybrook communities, and they always make everybody feel very welcome in their hall. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153368"></A>
My electorate includes a number of areas which have a large population of older Australians, and this group is growing. People who attended the forum were keen to know about more environmentally friendly disposal of body methods, and I have undertaken to get information out as soon as possible. The fact that the funeral industry is not regulated and continues to use conventional methods of burial and cremation, which have significant environmental concerns, has disturbed some people. They believe these issues should be investigated, with more environmentally friendly choices being made available. For further information on environmentally friendly burials, you can log onto: www.direct.gov.uk/en/environmentandgreenerliving/greenerlifeevents/dg_178752 or https://sustainableburials.discussions.nsw.gov.au/. </Hansard-Body>

In the first instance people were very supportive and they signed up to have wind towers put on their properties and were quite content. Then they started to receive a lot of information garnered from various other areas in Australia where wind farms are, in South Australia and Victoria predominantly but also right around the world. There have been quite a few forums now in Cooranga North at the little hall there, and they have been very well attended considering this is a very small farming community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1153381"></A>
What worries them the most is the growing worldwide concern about health issues and the wind turbines. I had a meeting with AGL’s Adam Mackett and Nigel Bean and there was another lady, but I cannot remember her name. What concerned me most about that particular meeting was that, regardless of what arguments, concerns or considerations were put forward, it always came back to the simple fact that AGL’s representatives--in this came Adam Mackett and Nigel Bean--seemed to be sticking steadfastly to the fact that they will abide by state legislation with regard to the proximity of the towers to any particular dwelling. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158669"></A>
That concerned me because there is very little buffer between the house and the tower. Victoria is moving towards a two-kilometre buffer. That state has a particularly long history with regard to wind towers. If it is moving towards a minimum two-kilometre buffer then I believe it is imperative that Queensland also consider moving to such a buffer. There has been a precedent set in Victoria. It would be appropriate that Queensland take a little interest in what is happening down south and protect the communities of Cooranga North and the surrounding areas in the Coopers Gap area. I thank Minister Kate Jones for the decision that was made recently with regard to UCG in the Burnett. </Hansard-Body>

The stories of tragedy and triumphs, of loss and effort, have made us all take stock of just how fortunate we are to still be here and still have our homes and our loved ones. While I know that many areas have severe damage and face massive reconstruction, I want to take a couple of minutes tonight to talk about some of the issues in my electorate. </A></Hansard-Body>

We have ongoing issues with water levels in North Pine Dam. The residents fear that there will be another rain event that may send a large flood down the river. This will obviously impact on those already damaged properties and the recovery efforts. There is already damage to the AJ Wyllie Bridge, which crosses the river at Petrie-Lawnton and is the main arterial for residents travelling between Strathpine and Kallangur, Dayboro and points north. This means that there is only one lane open each way, to the frustration of commuters and businesses alike. Any further rain will mean a river rise which may damage the bridge further, delay repairs or even result in more closures.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158682"></A>
There are concerns that more rain will close Young’s Crossing, the only other crossing nearby other than the Bruce Highway, and cause further congestion and traffic chaos. Our lovely parks and recreation areas are washed away and we cannot get to work fixing them for fear of more inundation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158683"></A>
There has been rainwater damage in many public buildings, not least at the fabulous Dakabin State High School, which has had so much water damage that the stage is warping, there is mould growing in several rooms and the gutters are so full that there is no way to protect their walls and roofs in the next downpour. Union members at Dakabin have met to consider the mould and have concluded that the rooms are unsafe for the students and the staff and have, quite rightly, banned use of the rooms until they are repaired.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158684"></A>
The school has been battling for some time to get funding for amenities. For example, there are only 71 seats for 1,000 students. The young people sit on the ground, near ant nests and on the uneven concrete. Buildings need painting, lots of maintenance is needed and massive upgrades of resources are required to deliver a quality education. Just as the P&amp;C, staff, principal and I joined forces to try to get all of these problems sorted and get more resources allocated, the state faced the worst natural disasters in our history. We are all mindful of the shocking damage done to schools in the flood and cyclone areas and understand the huge cost but wonder again at the bad luck of Dakabin and its long campaign to get the school looking its best and to have the same resources as other schools in Brisbane.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158685"></A>
Many wonderful people in Kallangur collected goods, donated money and volunteered in the recent floods. I sincerely thank them for their generosity and hard work. The comparatively small problems in our electorate will be faced with the same generosity of spirit and a steadfast commitment to overcoming them. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(11.12 pm): I rise to report to parliament about a fishing event in the Redlands that raises concerns about the way this government is treating the fishers of Cleveland and surrounds and the 750,000 individuals across Queensland who fish. On Monday, 14 February Fisheries Queensland hosted a meeting at the Redlands Bowls Club, Victoria Point to explain the government’s four options in the snapper regulatory impact statement. </Hansard-Body>

</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158693"></A>
The meeting was attended by 150 local people including members from recreational fishing groups such as Sunfish and Ecofishers; charter boat operators; commercial fishers; Fisheries Queensland staff and the managing director, Jim Groves; the shadow fisheries minister, Ray Hopper; the member for Redlands, Peter Dowling; the federal member for Bowman, Andrew Laming; and me. No Labor MPs or Greens representatives were in attendance.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158694"></A>
During a lengthy Q&amp;A period, the mood in the room became one of mistrust towards the government, disbelief of the government’s claim that the science shows that snapper are overfished, anger, frustration and rejection of the future four-month snapper bans in the options. The impact of regular four-month bans would be significant. The bans would decimate the charter boat small businesses in my electorate and elsewhere and deeply hurt recreational fishing tourism in Moreton Bay. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158695"></A>
Fisheries Queensland could not rule out the four-month bans starting in June this year. This is at a time when local tourist operators and marine industries are struggling to recover from the worst floods in our state’s history. This would be kicking Queenslanders when they are down.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158697"></A>
Dr Barry Pollock, president of Queensland’s peak recreational fishing body, Sunfish, was at the meeting. His views are outlined in a Sunfish brochure that individuals can fill in and send to the Premier. The brochure reads--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Dear Premier,</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1158699"></A>
I am extremely concerned by the proposals released by Minister Mulherin for the management of Snapper and other rocky reef fish species.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1158700"></A>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1158701"></A>
2.	It is misleading for the Minister to state unequivocally that Snapper stocks are severely depleted</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1158702"></A>
3.	Claims of good Snapper catches by recreational Snapper fishers have been disregarded by Fisheries Qld</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1158703"></A>
4.	Snapper stocks must remain sustainable through sensible management measures</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1158704"></A>
I urge the State government to reconsider the validity of this extreme and unwarranted management plan.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158705"></A>
Finally, the government has been caught out trying to sneak the current six-week snapper ban into Queensland just days before Christmas. It did this to escape public attention and avoid appropriate debate in the parliament. I urge the government to not delay the debate on the LNPs disallowance motion related to this ban. It would be a cowardly and cynical thing to postpone the debate until after the current six-week ban is over. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158706"></A>
In closing, like the tremor before the full earthquake hits, the greater concern among Queensland’s 750,000 recreational fishers is that Labor’s six-week ban is just the beginning of tougher measures to come, as early as June this year. </Hansard-Body>

I know that the principal, Debbie Driver, and the student leaders were very excited about meeting the Premier and the ministers. I would also like to thank the education minister, Geoff Wilson, for taking the time to walk around the school and visit new preps on their first day of school. It was a very exciting day for the school. </A></Hansard-Body>

I would like to talk about a few other things that the schools in my electorate have been doing, in particular some of the work that has been done by the schools in relation to the recent floods. Whites Hill State School, under the leadership of principal Karl Shrubsole and the staff, did a lot of work during the flood clean-up. The school helped to clean up Rocklea. It assisted the Brisbane City Council with letterbox drops and donated two car loads of food, cleaning agents and hygiene items to the relief centre at Yeronga. Today the students also had a flood relief appeal at which they collected further money. The Whites Hill State School has just opened its fantastic new BER building. The school is looking terrific. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158720"></A>
The Belmont State School, under the leadership of principal Noel Seawright, donated some furniture that they had to some of the schools that had been flood affected. There has been a lot going on in my electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158721"></A>
I would also like to give recognition to one person who lives in my electorate. Mr Richard Gorey is a friend of mine and we joined the airport fire service together many years ago. He is still a firefighter serving in the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service. He spent many weeks away in different parts of the state as part of the rescue teams that travelled the state. He was part of the rapid assessment team. They are the guys who went around and drew the Ns and Ys on the houses that the member for Hinchinbrook spoke about earlier. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158723"></A>
Not only did Richard spend many weeks away during the flood effort; he was away in Far North Queensland, in places like Tully and Tully Heads, for a number of days after the cyclone. When he came back he swapped his fire brigade uniform for his Navy reserve uniform and spent a week diving in the Brisbane River clearing the Brisbane River. He put in a fantastic effort. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158726"></A>
I would also like to acknowledge four-year-old Jade Nicholson, who is the daughter of my assistant electorate officer. She was quite upset watching the floods on TV. She did not like the idea of kids having to sleep in a wet bed. She was very upset that some kids’ beds were wet and they would not have a dry bed to sleep in. She wandered in to my electorate office with her mother and her piggy bank. She tipped it out and counted it up and then walked next door to the Bank of Queensland to make a mighty donation of $8.75. Congratulations to Jade and everyone else in my electorate who helped out during the floods. </Hansard-Body>

I am sure that most Queenslanders--in fact, most Australians--are familiar with the surname Walker when it comes to weather analysis and forecasting. Lennox Walker returned from the Second World War after serving Australia on the Kokoda Track. He worked as a surveyor with the Queensland and New South Wales forestry commissions. In 1953 Lennox became an understudy to world renowned weather forecaster Inigo Jones. Lennox learned as much about forecasting as he could from Inigo Jones. He developed his own theories on how sunspots affect weather patterns. A combination of these studies, correlated with the particular time of year, provided the basis of his forecasts. He went on to make many extremely accurate weather predictions, including that of Cyclone Tracy on Christmas Day 1974. At the age of 68, after 41 years of weather forecasting, Lennox Walker retired and his son Hayden stepped into his shoes. As his website states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1158784"></A>
Hayden also uses his knowledge of the sun, combined with the tendencies to cyclic patterns of sunspot activity and energy flow, to predict both the short- and long-term future of our weather.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158785"></A>
In October last year Mr Hayden Walker came to my electorate office and spoke at length with my staff and I. Among other things, Hayden said, ‘In relation to rainfall and floods, it’s going to be quite spectacular. And at the same time, with the increase in subdivisions, increase of roof area and loss of vegetation, the run-off will be increased. So, therefore, if you get run-off increase and a high tide, well, it’s going to be absolutely out of control. It’s going to be the biggest storm season we have seen for quite some time.’</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1158786"></A>
I say again that Hayden Walker told us that in October last year. It is time the government started to seek out weather forecasters such as Hayden Walker, listened to what they have to say and embraced their ideas. If this man got it right and he has predicted what is going to happen in the not-too-distant future, we need to start to listen to these people. </Hansard-Body>

With the help of </A><Hansard-Italic>
Albert and Logan News</Hansard-Italic>
, I asked Albert residents to lend a helping hand to ensure students in flood affected areas could begin their school year on time and on track. As the backpacks overflowing with lovely school stationery items were brought into my office by pensioners, schoolchildren, businesspeople and friends and relatives, I was genuinely amazed by the wonderful generosity of my constituents during this time of need. As many members of parliament this week have commented, the natural disasters of our state have not only brought devastation to families and businesses and farms but with it we have seen an outpouring of incredible community spirit. On behalf of my constituents, I offer my sincere condolences to those families who have lost loved ones.</Hansard-Body>

Many of those donating had already pledged significant financial support to the Premier’s disaster appeal, but were still ever-willing to dig deeper and give more. Not only were those in Albert offering needy students support; they were giving top-quality materials. One constituent delivering the donations from her mother to my electorate office joked, ‘Mum never spent this much money on my school supplies!’ When my husband, Peter, and my electorate officer Natalie Main hand-delivered the donated goods to families in Ipswich, Esk and Fernvale, we saw firsthand the severe devastation caused by the floods. In a time of disaster, loss and grieving, parents appreciated that a brand-new backpack with matching lunch box and folders and colouring-in pencils could go a long way in putting a smile back on their children’s faces.</Hansard-Body>

I wish to pay tribute to my husband, Peter Keech, who did a sterling job in leading the Department of Communities’s flood recovery effort in Esk. I know that Minister Struthers is very proud of the very tough work her departmental staff have done in providing financial, practical and emotional relief to affected families in the Lockyer Valley. In their generosity to help flood affected students of the Lockyer Valley get back to school, my constituents in Albert stood out as a shining example of the community spirit which swept the state. I am so very proud to represent an electorate prepared to dig deeply when our fellow Queenslanders are in need. On behalf of all of the children and families whose lives they have touched, I sincerely thank my wonderful constituents for their kindness, generosity and compassion. </Hansard-Body>
