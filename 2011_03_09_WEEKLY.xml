Yesterday during the debate on the Mines and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) the House was entertained by the member for Redlands, who gave a rather spirited defence of a Mr Karreman, the man who allowed his grandson to operate a 30-tonne piece of equipment.

Last year I referred statements made by the Minister for Community Services during the estimates committee process to the Speaker for his consideration in forwarding the matter to the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee. During estimates the minister made a number of misleading statements concerning the Office for Women, one of which was the number of calls received by Women’s Infolink. Yesterday in this House the minister stood and apologised for that inaccuracy. However, by ignoring the other matters referred she compounded the gravity of the original misrepresentation of the status of the Women’s Infolink. </A></Hansard-Body>

Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Order! I say to the member for Burdekin that this matter is already before the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee. It is being determined there. This is a debate on a matter before the committee. Put it in writing to me. I will explain to the House why I allowed the minister to give an explanation yesterday. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001218"></A>
It has always been my contention--and I have said this before--that I would rather have a minister correct the record as soon as practicable. I found out yesterday that that is what the minister wanted to do, even though the matter was before the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee, because it does not stop the matter being determined by that committee. However, there is an overriding principle that a member will correct the record in this House as soon as practicable. I am not going to entertain a debate on this matter. Put it in writing to the committee under standing order 269. </Hansard-Body>

This morning many are continuing to face down nature at its worst as further heavy rainfall deals yet another cruel blow and again brings heartbreaking floodwaters to the region. This morning the people of towns such as Cardwell, who are still in shock and trying to put their lives back together in the wake of Yasi, are waking to ongoing floods that started to invade their homes yesterday. In fact, as the people of Cardwell wake to a new day they could be forgiven for thinking, ‘What’s next?’</A></Hansard-Body>

Today in Ingham six schools will be closed as rain continues to fall. Emergency Management Queensland and the Hinchinbrook Shire Council are maintaining a watching brief on rising river levels. Current predictions are that, thankfully, the Herbert River will not rise high enough to inundate homes. However, the situation could change dramatically as more rain is expected. Flooding in and around schools has prevented them from opening and cuts to the highway have prevented staff from arriving at work, so they are unable to operate today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999354"></A>
Over the past 24 hours Cardwell has received about 200 millimetres of rain. That has resulted in some of the homes that survived Yasi being inundated. Others which are still covered in tarpaulins after Yasi took away their roofs have sustained further water damage. It is fair to say that the thoughts of all members of the House are with our fellow Queenslanders in the far north, particularly in the communities of Ingham and Cardwell.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002529"></A>
It is a timely reminder that, after our last three months of floods and cyclone devastation, our wet season is not over yet. While it is heartbreaking for them and for all of us, at the same time we hope that they can stay strong, keep their spirts up and get through this latest traumatic event. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002534"></A>
I commend the Cassowary Coast Local Disaster Management Group and the local council for their foresight late yesterday to open an evacuation centre to assist those residents affected by the rains. I understand that at this stage no residents have had to avail themselves of the centre, but given that there are still floodwaters around town, they may need to. I congratulate them on that work. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1002536"></A>
A sandbagging machine was dispatched to the community yesterday. The state government departments are on standby to provide further support. We are hopeful that today a State Emergency Services team from Cairns will be able to make it across the highway and into Cardwell to provide support to local crews who have been working around the clock. As I said, they are all in our thoughts this morning. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for Reconstruction) (9.41 am): The Queensland tourism industry is one of the hardest hit by the recent natural disasters. Our state’s $9.2 billion tourism industry was already doing it tough, hit hard by the global financial crisis, and suffered further problems due to the high Australian dollar. However, the combined effect of the floods and Cyclone Yasi has really knocked it for six. That is why the state and federal governments have pledged a total of $12 million for a recovery package for this vital industry. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1002545"></A>
Last week the federal tourism minister Martin Ferguson and Queensland Minister for Tourism, Jan Jarratt, announced an additional $2 million package following the joint $10 million fund that we announced on 28 January. This additional $2 million package is designed to help operators get back on their feet and make their businesses more profitable. That money will go towards professional advice, new skills and greater awareness of emerging markets to boost this vital industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002546"></A>
Today I am very pleased to advise that the work that has been undertaken on the $10 million package is now ready for announcement. I can advise that Nothing Beats Queensland is the message that will be promoted to Australia and the world as part of this $10 million global tourism strategy. The campaign will harness the unbeatable Queensland spirit to promote our state to locals, Australians and the world. Just as these disasters have not beaten us, we are out to tell the world that nothing beats Queensland. Nothing beats our beaches, nothing beats our rainforest, nothing beats our Great Barrier Reef and nothing beats a Queensland holiday just as nothing beats us Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1002548"></A>
The Nothing Beats Queensland--Where Australia Shines campaign will be one of the largest coordinated tourism marketing initiatives that Australia has ever seen. The campaign will target potential visitors and domestic and international media to come to Queensland and see for themselves that Queensland is open for business. The $10 million fund will comprise a number of initiatives including a $4.5 million interstate marketing campaign. This will include a range of competitive holiday packages. It will roll out by March in time for the peak Easter booking period. It also includes a $1 million intrastate--that is within Queensland--marketing campaign encouraging Queenslanders to support their mates by holidaying at home and incorporating a ‘Queensland pledge’ from the state’s tourism operators to tell the world that they are staging a comeback. This will start later this month. There will also be a number of very targeted marketing activities across a number of areas including international markets. We want the nation and the world to know that nothing beats the resilience of Queensland’s tourism industry despite everything that Mother Nature has thrown at us. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002550"></A>
As I have stated, Tourism Queensland and Tourism Australia are about to embark on one of the largest coordinated campaigns in Australian history, incorporating a massive publicity, advertising and promotional blitz. This blitz will use activity such as television specials; major radio promotions; extensive newspaper and magazine coverage; sales campaigns in partnership with airlines, travel companies and major hotel chains; online promotions via Facebook and YouTube; and other creative initiatives. In short, over the next few weeks Queensland will be everywhere. Step 1 is to drive bookings for Easter and the school holidays in the interstate market. Step 2 is to encourage Queenslanders to get out there and support their mates by taking a holiday at home this year and step 3 will be to drive more bookings from international markets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002552"></A>
The gravity of our natural disasters attracted worldwide media attention. Now we want to blitz that very same media through TV, press, online and social networking channels to bring visitors back to beautiful Queensland so they can see for themselves just how fantastic our state now looks. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for Reconstruction) (9.44 am): Our push into these interstate and international markets will no doubt be given a boost by a decision announced this morning that Prince William will pay a visit to New Zealand and Australia on behalf of the Queen. Prince William will visit following invitations extended by the Prime Minister of New Zealand and the Prime Minister of Australia. The prince will visit those affected by recent disasters as well as meeting members of the emergency and other support services. </Hansard-Body>

Prince William will first visit Christchurch on 17 and 18 March. He will attend a national memorial service on the Friday as well as undertake other engagements in the area. The prince will also visit Greymouth near the site of the recent mine disaster at the Pike River Mine. He will then arrive in Australia on Saturday, 19 March where over two days he will visit a number of areas and towns affected by the recent cyclone and flooding in Queensland before going to north-west Victoria to view the area recently affected by flooding. Prince William’s itinerary will be further confirmed by the palace and I will certainly be advising--</Hansard-Body>

 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for Reconstruction) (9.46 am): Reconstruction and recovery from these natural disasters is the Queensland government’s No. 1 priority for 2011. That is why I am pleased today to be able to announce that the National Partnership for Natural Disaster Reconstruction and Recovery between the state and federal governments has been signed. This agreement defines the roles and responsibilities of each level of government during the reconstruction. It is the overarching structure on which our respective contributions to the reconstruction effort are based. This agreement also means that the huge amounts of money needed to reconstruct our state can start to flow. It paves the way for the delivery of the $2 billion to Queensland from the federal government so that we can get infrastructure funding out of the door in the reconstruction of our state. It also paves the way for an advance payment of $400 million to local councils, as previously announced. The national partnership agreement also includes an additional upfront payment of $50 million from the Commonwealth to facilitate the recovery process in North Queensland following Cyclone Yasi. </Hansard-Body>

We are determined to get on with the reconstruction of Queensland as quickly as possible, and this agreement gives us the framework that we need to do that. It also makes sure that the audit processes are in place to provide the highest levels of accountability and public confidence around the expenditure of reconstruction funds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002576"></A>
The national partnership recognises that there will be instances where infrastructure needs exist outside of the traditional NDRRA eligibility arrangements and it makes provisions for special principles in those circumstances. These principles of value for money, relative priority and cost-benefit analysis will be applied to the $315 million package that we have announced to help Queensland’s local councils repair water and sewerage utilities as well as transport infrastructure such as Brisbane’s ferry terminals. We are progressing the recovery and reconstruction, and the signing of the national partnership is a key step in that process. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The Urban Land Development Authority has a busy year ahead. By the end of the year it is estimated that there will be more than 5,600 lots or dwellings approved for development across the ULDA’s 14 declared urban development areas. By mid next year, work will be underway on more than 30 projects within these UDAs, with a total end value of almost $3 billion. This means local jobs, improved housing affordability and well-planned, new communities that will take the pressure off our growth hot spots. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003799"></A>
Less than 12 months ago the government tasked the ULDA with delivering major new satellite communities at Flagstone, Ripley Valley, Yarrabilba and Caloundra. Between them, these greenfield sites will eventually provide a place to live, work and play for more than 340,000 people. Since taking charge, the ULDA has moved these major development areas forward with the release late last year of interim land use plans for each of these four sites. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003803"></A>
Today we reach the next major milestone in the delivery of these greenfield sites. I am pleased to inform the House that the ULDA has today approved the first development application for these new communities--a 126-lot residential development at Newbeith in the Greater Flagstone UDA. Land prices within the development will start from around the mid-$90,000 mark for a 225-square-metre terrace lot, increasing to around $130,000 for a villa lot and $190,000 for a traditional lot of over 800 square metres. House and land packages are expected to start from under $300,000, making the area affordable and attractive to a range of buyers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003806"></A>
The developer, MTAA, expects to begin construction in mid-April. By the end of the year, further lots are expected to be approved for Ripley, Yarrabilba and Caloundra South, and the final development schemes will be in place for each of these new communities. The ULDA continues to demonstrate that good planning can be completed quickly without compromising community consultation. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Commonwealth Grants Commission, GST</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for State Development and Trade) (9.52 am): The distribution of GST money to the states always creates lively debate among state treasurers. And so it should: the GST makes up around a quarter of every state’s entire revenue base. Tinkering at the edges of payroll tax and stamp duty--so often the focus of many interest groups--pales in comparison to getting the distribution of the national GST pool right.</Hansard-Body>
<DIV>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003814"></A>
The Commonwealth Grants Commission is the independent body responsible for the GST carve-up, and recently it released its 2011 update report. Our allocation builds on our policy victory of 2010 which, for the first time, sees the Grants Commission recognise the infrastructure pressures of growth states like Queensland and Western Australia. The 2011 update includes several changes--and revealed a fundamental flaw. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003815"></A>
The distribution reflects the challenges Queensland has faced from the lingering effects of the global financial crisis on the property industry in particular. Our allocation has increased from 18.6 per cent to 19 per cent of the total distribution. This is likely to lead to a slightly improved net position for Queensland in the 2011-12 allocations. However, this will not be confirmed until the release of the federal budget in May. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003816"></A>
As members will recall, the percentage share is but one factor. What matters more is the size of the GST pool, which was forecast lower by around $5 billion late last year by the Australian Treasury. One thing that has not changed is the grossly unfair nature of the mining assessment--in other words, how states like Queensland and Western Australia are penalised for having wealth-producing mining sectors.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003817"></A>
Queensland remains a donor state. As one of the stronger, prosperous states of the federation we acknowledge our obligations--that is, Queensland will contribute $1.2 billion to the national pool. However, we do not see our role as propping up the likes of New South Wales and Victoria.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003818"></A>
Next year around 90 per cent of the net redistribution from Queensland’s revenue assessment will be due to mining, which makes up less than 10 per cent of government revenues. The fact that Victoria and New South Wales earn far greater revenue from their higher stamp duty and payroll tax regimes does not get a similar treatment from the Grants Commission. The end result is that next year every Queenslander will donate $154 to the national GST pool--$60 more than every New South Welshman.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003819"></A>
In fact, the situation means that the Victorian Treasurer is the person with the highest stake in the success of the mining industries in Queensland and Western Australia. Given that Victorian taxpayers do not do a hell of a lot to fund the economic and social infrastructure to support mining industry expansions, the result is pure risk-free, free-riding profit for Victorians--at the expense of Queenslanders and Western Australians. It is a smash-and-grab job in proportions that most thieves would only dream of.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003820"></A>
In my view, the resource states are being pillaged by the two big southern states--and it is being sanctioned by a Grants Commission methodology obsessed with royalties and almost ignorant of other states’ burdensome payroll tax and stamp duty regimes. I have already had discussions with the Liberal Treasurer from Western Australia, and it is a matter we intend to pursue with the Grants Commission </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003821"></A>
At present the Grants Commission proposes not to revisit this matter until their next five-year methodology review. Queensland and Western Australia should not and cannot abide another five years of this inequity. I implore those opposite--the great knockers of the Queensland economy--to rise above their negativity on this occasion, put aside the politics and enjoin this debate to support Queensland’s and Western Australia’s case. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(9.59 am): Many residents of Far North Queensland have had their lives torn apart by Cyclone Yasi. The state government wants to provide whatever assistance it can to help them rebuild. That is why residents in some of the hardest hit areas like Tully, Cardwell and Mission Beach are being given access to free TAFE courses. The practical training is being offered at the Innisfail and Tully campuses of the Tropical North Queensland Institute of TAFE. </Hansard-Body>
<DIV>

</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005007"></A>
The free construction and building courses include courses in bobcat, front-end loader, backhoe and crane operation, truck licences, chainsaw operation, construction white cards, traffic control and food hygiene. So far, 149 people have taken advantage of the scheme in Tully, undertaking traffic control, white card and chainsaw courses. Another 48 people are registered in courses that would normally cost between $50 for a chainsaw ticket and $800 for bobcat or backhoe licences. This means local workers can take part in the local recovery effort and gain important employment skills, experience and qualifications. We have recognised the immediate need to run these practical courses to enable these residents to physically rebuild their lives and to rebuild safely. That is why the free training courses are running over half and full days. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005008"></A>
The free TAFE courses offered in Far North Queensland are in addition to other great work being carried out to help Queensland recover. At the same time as offering assistance to communities, we are getting on with the very important business of making sure skilled workers are available to take advantage of employment opportunities being created across Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005009"></A>
At the weekend, the state government announced a joint $83 million jobs and skills package with the Commonwealth government to help disaster affected communities. The package includes help to provide more than 1,500 placements through the Green Army; support 2,500 apprentices or trainees to continue their training; provide training to ensure there are enough people ready to enter apprenticeships and traineeships once the economy picks up; and 30 jobs skill development officers across the state to work closely with local governments, organisations and businesses to coordinate skills training and provide job opportunities for Queenslanders in the recovery areas. The measures the Bligh government is putting in place to help Queenslanders now will help create jobs and skilled workers well into the future. <Hansard-Speech-End>

But let us not forget our other cultural icons like the Queensland Tennis Centre at Tennyson, the cultural precinct at South Bank and the nearby Queensland Maritime Museum.

The Queensland Tennis Centre is a great asset in my local community. It is hard to believe that just one week before the floods, the centre court was the focal point in the Brisbane international tournament. Seeing the images of the centre court submerged under 3 metres of water just days later was heartbreaking. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005021"></A>
But, amid this devastation, we did not lose our determination to rebuild. Our workers began the massive repair and rebuilding task at the centre on 17 January. They got on with the job of repairing flood damaged courts, electrical switchboards and air-conditioning units. They carried out repairs to the players’ changing rooms, stores and gymnasium and removed debris from the centre. I am pleased to say that today the centre court resembles something of its old self and the Queensland Tennis Centre is on track for a full recovery.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005022"></A>
Department of Public Works staff also carried out remediation works on the Queensland Cultural Centre which was damaged during the floods. These workers helped restore essential power and services before completing the clean-up and initiating remedial works. These works are on track to be fully completed by early April. The Queensland Performing Arts Centre’s Lyric Theatre reopened for performances on 25 January following a two-week closure due to flood damage. Performances at the Concert Hall and Cremorne Theatre commenced shortly afterwards. The centre’s Playhouse Theatre remains closed after sustaining significant damage to its fire, air-conditioning and electrical systems, with works continuing to get the theatre up and running as soon as possible.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005023"></A>
QBuild staff also helped with efforts to restore the Queensland Maritime Museum, which sustained damage in the floods. In addition to these high-profile icons, my department is also helping residents and local councils throughout the state recover from the floods and cyclones. We are getting on with the job of helping these communities rebuild. I want to assure all disaster affected communities that they can count on our full support. <Hansard-Speech-End>

I have seen the mental anguish on people’s faces in the cyclone ravaged Cassowary Coast. For many people, mental trauma can be but a heartbeat away from mental illness. As a government, we need to reach out to people right now and wherever possible give them the support and services they need to turn their lives around. </A></Hansard-Body>

I commend the federal government for putting a national disability insurance scheme on the table. We welcome the Productivity Commissions’s draft report. This is an historic opportunity to bring about great change. I look forward to working with the federal Labor government so that together we get the best outcome for our community.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1005033"></A>
Ageing carers in particular need to know that when they are gone someone, somewhere will be able to look after their autistic son or daughter, their nephew, their niece, their friend. That is what the insurance scheme is all about. As the father of an almost two-year-old, I have had to use the phrases ‘inside voice’ and ‘listening ears’ a fair bit. In terms of our government’s response, I plan to establish a working group of key stakeholders and I will certainly be putting on my listening ears so that we get our response right, so that we can put Queensland’s case to Canberra and ensure people in our state get the best deal. </Hansard-Body>

Gone are the days when governments simply locked the door and threw away the key. In a few months time, Queensland’s first forensic mental health service will be open for business--a purpose-built secure facility at Wacol. There has long been a need for non-hospital based secure care for people with a cognitive or intellectual disability who are on forensic orders. Apart from post-construction modifications, the centre should be up and running by midyear. Its chief focus will be to provide services, counselling, rehabilitation and the right kind of care to clients to help them turn their lives around.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005035"></A>
My focus as minister will be to break down the barriers around mental health--to remove the stigma, to engage with the community, business and industry and to say ‘It’s okay to be different.’ Take the staff I met at WorkLink in Cairns. Their job is to encourage employers to take on someone with a mental illness. They know that when clients walk through their doors, it is because they want a hand up, not a handout. I commend Dorothy Dunne and her team for the work they are doing in the far north and I encourage others to follow their lead.</Hansard-Body>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110309_100708" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Health) (10.07 am): The Bligh government is responsible for the single most significant public dental health initiative in our state’s history--fluoridation of Queensland’s drinking water supplies. The Queensland government’s public dental services are the most comprehensive in Australia. Our oral health budget per capita is Australia’s most generous, with the Queensland government spending equal to that of New South Wales. We invest the same budget for only half their population. More than 50 per cent of Queenslanders are eligible for free dental treatments from our clinics. Our clinics provide nearly two million treatments each year.</A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1005045"></A>
By contrast, sadly, those opposite have no dental health policy whatsoever except to try to roll back water fluoridation through a referendum. Their only dental policy is to try to destroy the program that the Australian Dental Association described as ‘effective, efficient and equitable’. Make no mistake: this government’s commitment and record on public dental health services is better than any government in Australia. Not only do we lead the nation in providing dental services, we lead the nation in transparently reporting the performance of our dental services. We provide more dental services than any other state and we report our waiting lists more comprehensively than ever before. There has in the past 24 hours been some misinformation in the media on this issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005046"></A>
In 2009, the government committed to publishing waiting list data half yearly. We have done so twice a year since that time. The data is on the Queensland Health website. It is published in exactly the format that was used when the commitment was given. We publish the number of patients treated, the number of children treated, the percentage of patients waiting for each category of treatment and the average wait times across our districts for each category of patient. What the data shows is that fewer than two per cent of patients waiting for appointments are categorised as urgent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006382"></A>
The government’s record on dental health is the best in the nation. By contrast, the Liberals and Nationals have a lot more work to do. If the opposition were even slightly serious about getting people into public dental clinics faster, they would have supported the federal Labor government’s bill in the Senate, which would have delivered $52.8 million in dental funding to Queensland over four years and provided 187,000 extra treatments. LNP senators, unfortunately, failed to step up for Queensland. They voted against that extra funding for dental services in the public arena in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006385"></A>
Those opposite have failed time and time again to lobby their federal LNP colleagues to support this vital funding for Queensland, showing they have no credibility when it comes to dental health. This government’s record shows that we are providing the most comprehensive public dental health service in the nation. We introduced fluoridation, the single most significant public dental health initiative in our state’s history. There is always more to do and we are happy to do it, but this is a record that everyone can be proud of.<Hansard-Speech-End>

I was in Innisfail, Tully and Mission Beach last week. Local people, including the members for Mulgrave and Hinchinbrook, councillors, the mayor, local businesspeople and residents, all told me the same story--that is, they want local people to settle back in the local area as quickly as possible to power up those local economies. That is why my department’s focus is on doing whatever it takes to house people locally. We have been using private accommodation, motels, factory-built housing and ensuited caravans. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006399"></A>
Locals were thrilled last week to see the quality of that temporary housing organised by my department, and more is on the way. For Tully caravan park owners Peter and Angela, whom the member for Hinchinbrook would know well, the new housing is as much a lifeline for their business as it is a home for the tenants and residents in that local area. They are quality homes. I walked through two 4-bedroom family homes. They are very good quality housing. They have a large timber deck outdoor living area for those families, they have built-in cupboards; they are very comfortable houses. It is temporary and it is not their own home but people seem pretty happy with them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006400"></A>
In places like Tully and Mission Beach, where more than one in four properties have received serious damage, I was able to see firsthand the single units as well as the two-bedroom units and some of those four-bedroom residences that I mentioned. To date, 93 family groups have been housed in emergency accommodation at local motels, at resorts at Mission Beach that withstood the cyclones, such as Castaways and others, at apartments and at caravan parks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006402"></A>
I do understand, though, that the temporary arrangements that people have made with family and friends can put people under a lot of strain, and I have discussed this with the member for Hinchinbrook. If you are living with family and friends for a few weeks or a couple of months, sometimes those relationships can get a bit scratchy. We are aware of that and our departmental staff are doing a lot of outreach work. In fact, they have done about 4,000 outreach visits to families and individuals to make sure they are getting the financial and housing assistance they need. That has been a mighty effort. We have had great support from our colleagues from the Northern Territory, and I met some of them when I was in Tully last week as well.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006404"></A>
In Tully and Tully Heads alone, 70 different forms of housing have been delivered or will be delivered within the next day or so, including 40 ensuited accommodation facilities and four ensuited caravans. This housing is supporting people like the two age pensioners from Hull Heads. The husband has some very serious health issues. We have housed them in an ensuited caravan near the hospital. Again, that is temporary; it is not home. They would be desperate to get back into the home they have lived in for 18 years in that area, but that is not possible at the moment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006407"></A>
While I am on my feet, I would like to pay tribute to the Red Cross, Lifeline and my departmental staff. We have had 3,000 staff deployed around the state and we have been moving them around as the disasters have moved around the state. They have done a mighty job, as have our non-government agencies as they have worked with my department, the emergency services staff and the police. It has been an incredible effort and I pay tribute to all of those people.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Bruce Highway, Flood Immunity</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

We are looking to the future, and that means doing what we can to flood proof our communities and safeguard the road network for the people of regional Queensland. Coming from regional Queensland, I know just how important the Bruce is. That is why I am pushing hard to get action after a federally funded study looked at cutting congestion in Rockhampton and boosting flood immunity on the highway. </A></Hansard-Body>

The study looked at current and future demand on the Bruce and the north coast rail line. After 18 months and over 180 submissions from the community and road users, we took three road options for the Bruce Highway and two rail corridor options for the north coast rail line to the community last week. Now we are asking for feedback. Two hundred locals turned up to have their say in Rockhampton and I want even more people to give their feedback by 1 April. I personally thank the member for Keppel, Mr Hoolihan, who also attended that session and who provided valuable feedback. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006416"></A>
We want to choose the route and we want to get it right. The options will now undergo technical, engineering, environmental, cultural heritage, social, safety and community analysis. All the options have the potential to make significant improvements to traffic flow and to reduce the impact of flooding on the Bruce Highway through Rockhampton. I well remember in 1991, after another big flood event in Central Queensland, that the Bruce Highway south of Rockhampton was closed for 13 days on that Yeppen flood plain. That stopped essential medical and food supplies getting through not only to Rockhampton but also to points north.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006417"></A>
Over 20 years there has been a lot of talk about upgrading the Bruce south of Rockhampton but, unfortunately, there has been very little action. We are working shoulder to shoulder with the federal government and we are taking action right now. We are taking steps to flood proof our communities and we are going to safeguard this vital highway for the people of regional Queensland. <Hansard-Speech-End>

That is almost $1 million a day to support the recovery of our industry and its operators and small business owners. This includes the $10 million joint state and federal tourism marketing campaign discussed by the Premier this morning. In the wake of recent natural disasters, this campaign will promote the state to Queenslanders, Australians and the world. It will be one of the largest coordinated tourism marketing initiatives Australia has ever seen. It will call on Queenslanders to continue their flood and cyclone efforts by holidaying at home. It will ask travel, accommodation and service providers to turn their service levels up to 11 and provide random acts of upgrade. It will ensure that interstate and international visitors know that our beaches, islands and many other tourist attractions are unharmed and looking better than ever.</A></Hansard-Body>

 The release of details of the $10 million marketing campaign follows the 3 March announcement of an additional $2 million in state and federal government tourism funding.

In the last two weeks, I have announced additional tourism campaigns and initiatives worth more than $2.3 million.

In excess of 30 racecourses across Queensland were affected by flooding and Cyclone Yasi, and I am pleased that my first announcement as the new minister responsible for racing is for funding to repair this damage. I want to acknowledge the former racing minister, the member for Southport, for his work in securing this funding for Racing Queensland. Some $1.45 million will be spent to undertake flood and cyclone remediation work on a number of key racecourses primarily at Rockhampton, Emerald, Warwick, Townsville, Cairns, Albion Park and Ipswich. This funding will assist by covering the shortfall from insurers for damaged clubs so that racing can get back to normal as soon as possible.</A></Hansard-Body>

As an example, the government will provide up to $235,000 at Rockhampton to resurrect the grass track and greyhound track, which were both under water for 10 days and covered in silt; $100,000 at the Emerald racetrack to fix the sand training track and repair the perimeter fencing and road infrastructure; and $150,000 at Warwick to resurrect the sand training track. In addition to the $1.45 million allocated for key racecourses, an additional $900,000 has been specifically allocated to assist country thoroughbred race clubs. Some $200,000 will be provided to address workplace health and safety related damage caused by the recent floods and Cyclone Yasi and $700,000 will be given to assist clubs in meeting the minimum venue and equipment standards required to ensure the health and safety of racing participants. Country racing is an integral part of community life in rural and regional Queensland. This funding will ensure racetracks and meetings are back up and running and local communities can enjoy a day out at the races. I also thank Racing Queensland for its leadership on this issue, ensuring facilities are returned to racing order as quickly as possible and enabling participants to remain in business. <Hansard-Speech-End>

The Queensland government will be highlighting the significant investment we have made into creating new economic opportunities for traditional owners in Cape York, including skills development through the wild rivers program. In total we have 40 wild rivers positions and already some wild rivers rangers who have benefited from this training have moved on to employment in the mining sector, defence forces, Main Roads or other positions in the private and public sectors. It is also an opportunity to once again debunk the myths that Tony Abbott and others are spreading about wild rivers to the detriment of the economic development in Cape York. The government’s submission to the inquiry outlines 141 development approvals that have occurred in declared wild rivers areas. These approvals are for activities including mining exploration, mining, roads and other infrastructure, vegetation clearing, sewage treatment and other activities. In wild rivers areas grazing, fishing, tourism, camping, hunting and gathering can continue unaffected. Wild rivers does not stop development; it ensures sustainable development and will help avoid mistakes of the past.</A></Hansard-Body>

Today I am announcing a new package of actions that the Queensland government will undertake to work with Indigenous people on the cape. The next plank of our wild rivers agenda--sustainable cape communities developed in consultation with Indigenous representatives--is aimed at further increasing their involvement in wild rivers decision-making processes and the economic opportunities that follow. Under the sustainable cape communities initiative we will be establishing an economic development mentor support network where successful entrepreneurs will work with Indigenous communities to establish new businesses in wild rivers areas. We will also be building the capacity of Indigenous local governments to quickly and effectively progress development applications in these areas. We will also be initiating a strategic economic development plan to create real jobs in growing sectors that provide economic opportunities, capitalising on the cape’s outstanding natural values. The government is also committed to extending Indigenous water reserves from the cape wild rivers to the gulf wild rivers, the first such allocation in Australia. Further to our economic initiatives, we will also be establishing new Indigenous reference committees to provide direct feedback to me as the minister from those who speak for country in areas proposed as a new wild river. We want to work hand in hand with Indigenous people to ensure that our wild rivers declarations provide the right protections for our pristine waterways while also supporting the communities that live and work around them. Wild rivers is not a threat to development, but talking down the cape is.</Hansard-Body>

While I am on my feet talking about wild rivers, I had the pleasure of going to the honourable member for Gregory’s electorate last week to meet with graziers, landowners and locals to discuss the Cooper Creek wild rivers declaration. Significant impacts have been experienced throughout the Cooper Creek Basin due to the summer flood events and people who have been busy coping with flooding issues have not had the time or opportunity to properly consider the wild rivers proposal declaration. Given the delays and the importance of informing stakeholders about the wild rivers declaration proposal, and taking into consideration the wishes and what I heard while I was out there on the ground in Longreach, today I announce an extension to the consultation period for the Cooper Creek Basin wild rivers declaration proposal to 30 June this year.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr Speaker, I note your ruling on 24 November 2010 in which you advised the House that the bills are in fact so similar in part that the same question rule would be enlivened for some sections of the bill. Therefore, I consider the most appropriate way of dealing with these bills is in the form of the cognate debate, which is why I am moving this motion today.</Hansard-Body>

Inquiry to formally review the report of the 2010 strategic review of the Queensland Audit Office to consider the recommendations made and comment on other findings where appropriate</Hansard-Italic>
. The 2010 strategic review of the Queensland Audit Office was completed and tabled in the parliament by the Premier in March 2010. Under the Auditor-General Act, the report is deemed to be referred to the committee. At the time the strategic review report was tabled, the committee was undertaking its own review of the Auditor-General’s performance management systems audit mandate. A number of recommendations in the review report addressed issues already being considered by the committee and we elected to consider those recommendations as part of that inquiry. The committee tabled its report in September 2010. This report addresses the remaining strategic review recommendations and also comments on conclusions where applicable.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1099359"></A>

 (10.33 am): My first question without notice is to the Premier. The Premier would be aware that the success of the royal commission into Dr Patel was only made possible because victims could appear at that inquiry. I ask: will the Premier explain why under her terms of reference for the royal commission into floods victims are being formally advised that they cannot appear and only people about whom adverse findings are likely to be made can appear? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for his question. It is absolutely imperative for the government, and I believe for the public of Queensland, that an independent inquiry be allowed to conduct its business into questions that are legitimate about our disasters and questions that, frankly, I want the answers to as much as any other Queenslander. I live in this city and my family lives in this city. Some of the questions in relation to the operation of Wivenhoe Dam are as critical to me and my family as they are to the broader public of Queensland. They are legitimate questions and I want them answered. I want them answered in time for us to be able to take on board any lessons out of this event that might assist in protecting people and their property further in any wet season that we might experience next January and February. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009406"></A>
In relation to the allegations by the member that there are people seeking to provide submissions or speak to those submissions and being denied any opportunity to do so, I would invite him to provide me with information about that and I would be very happy to consider it. The member might recall that, in fact, I and the minister for communities have spoken in this House now about a program that we are funding to actually assist people to prepare submissions and provide them to the commission and to assist them in appearing before the commission. So it is certainly our intention to ensure that people are able to do that. In fact, it is not only our intention; we are funding a program that will assist people and enable them to do that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009407"></A>
I go to the terms of reference, which basically require the commission to--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1009409"></A>
Take into account the regional and geographic differences across affected communities </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1009410"></A>
and to--</Hansard-Body-Continued>

Seek public submissions and hold public hearings in affected communities. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1009413"></A>
So if there is some misunderstanding or concern on the part of anybody who has contacted the Leader of the Opposition, I would be very happy to not only take up their concerns but also ensure that they are provided with information about how they could get assistance to appear before the commission. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My second question without notice is also to the Premier. In the last session of parliament the Premier was asked on two occasions whether she would publicly release for Queenslanders the actual cabinet minutes from the meeting held on 18 October 2010 when the Premier and ministers were briefed by the Bureau of Meteorology. Those minutes have still not been made public. I ask the Premier for a third time: will she now put those cabinet minutes into the public domain so that Queenslanders can see the government decisions that were taken as a result of the briefing or will the Premier be keeping those minutes hidden? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As part of our right to information reforms put in place I think two years ago now, which made Queensland and our government the most transparent in Australia, we established a website. What that website does is provide cabinet decisions within months of them being made. I do not know whether that particular decision is yet on the website, but there is no reason it would not be if it is not. I would invite the member to peruse that website, which is publicly available, more often. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs ATTWOOD:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Premier. Can the Premier update the House on the significant increases in the uptake of solar energy throughout Queensland? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009424"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. As the member for Mount Ommaney knows only too well, we have experienced unprecedented rain and it has wrought unprecedented havoc. Nevertheless, we are as determined as ever to make Queensland the solar state of Australia. We do not anticipate the rain that we saw in January to in any way diminish our reputation for great, high-quality sunshine.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009425"></A>
Queenslanders are following and taking up solar at an unprecedented rate. They are doing the bright thing in towns and cities right across Queensland. I said last year that our aim was to create a virtual power station across the roofs of Queensland, with a 500 megawatt generating capacity target by 2015. Today, we are at 375 megawatts, with an astounding 63,000 solar PV systems on Queensland roofs. That figure compares to just 1,000 five years ago. So five years ago we had 1,000 solar panels; we now have 63,000. At this rate, we will reach the target next year--three years ahead of schedule. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009426"></A>
All of that has happened because Queenslanders want to take up clean energy. But it has also happened because our government worked to make it possible. We worked to make it happen. We put in place a Solar Bonus Scheme, where people who are generating power from their own roofs can actually be paid for the excess that goes back into the grid and there are many Queenslanders who are now receiving the benefit of that. We also put in place a solar hot-water cash rebate so that homeowners could take up solar hot water and bring down their bills. We made it happen by giving an opportunity to sporting and community clubs to come on board and to join the solar revolution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009428"></A>
We have made the Gambling Community Benefit Fund available specifically to clubs that want to install this sort of equipment. I am pleased to advise that our clubs and community centres have jumped on board as well. In the first round we had 186 applications and 118 of those were approved, with more than $1 million going out the door in that very first quarterly round of the first identification of $10 million over three years. We anticipate that most normal size sporting clubs in the community could save around $415 a year on their power bills. That is money they can put straight back into the operation of their clubs. We all know that the little football clubs often do not operate on a very big margin, so if they can be part of this effort then it brings down their costs but it also means they are part of our virtual solar power station. On the roofs of Queensland, whether it is in our streets, our suburbs or our community centres, we are seeing Queenslanders doing the bright thing and I congratulate them. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Finance. After it was revealed that this Labor government failed to take out flood insurance, the Premier claimed that the government had shopped around for insurance in 2004 but found the cost to be too prohibitive. Will the minister give a commitment to publicly release for Queenslanders all tender documents or expressions of interest, along with any analysis that the Labor government claims it undertook for flood insurance, or will it also be hidden from Queenslanders? </Hansard-Body>

Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The Queensland government announced two weeks ago that it would now engage in a process to go to market to get a 2011 price on the full cost of reinsuring Queensland’s assets--all of our assets including roads, bridges, tunnels, schools, hospitals; the gamut of our assets--for the impacts of a full range of natural disasters, including flood. It is not, frankly, my intention to put into the public domain any commercial material which may influence the price which we are now seeking to get from the market. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
It has never been the case that other states have had the gamut of insurance that is now being spoken about in the national arena. Indeed, the Queensland Treasury’s investigations have revealed that Victoria is the only state that covers its roads and that other states have a whole range of different levels of insurance. For instance, South Australia, which Senator Xenaphon has widely spoken about in this national public debate, does not cover its roads; it covers only its bridges. I do not think any Queenslander would find it hard to imagine that the state with the most devastating history of natural disasters, the state that is the most prone to cyclones, for instance, and the state that has, unlike Western Australia, by far the largest network of regional infrastructure, would not find it cheap to get this kind of insurance coverage. Indeed, I do not think anyone thinks that little councils in regional parts of Queensland should have to pay those kinds of insurance premiums. Why, if you live in Cardwell, should you be subject to a higher insurance premium as part of your day-to-day rates than a council in western Victoria, for instance? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009472"></A>
It is a fundamental of being Australian that we help each other out in times of need. We will go to the market, we will get an informed price, but there has been a system for covering our assets under the NDRRA.</Hansard-Body>

 My question is directed to the Premier. I know that the three soccer clubs in my electorate are excited about this Sunday’s A-League grand final featuring the mighty Brisbane Roar, who have had a record-breaking year.</Hansard-Body>

 Come to your question.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009478"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Can the Premier update the House on another award for Suncorp Stadium, the venue for the grand final?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009480"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Everton for his enthusiasm for ‘the beautiful game’, which we will see on centre stage at Suncorp on Sunday night. I am very pleased to advise the House that Suncorp Stadium has received yet another accolade as a great spectator venue. Professional Footballers Australia voted Suncorp Stadium the best pitch in the A-League for the second year in a row. This is a great achievement, particularly given the floods that so badly affected Suncorp Stadium. I really do take my hat off to the grounds team and the stadium staff. They pulled out all stops to make sure they could get it operational as quickly as possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009481"></A>
I want also to acknowledge the efforts of the A-League players who have raised $70,000 for the Premier’s Disaster Relief Fund. I very much thank them for their efforts. This Sunday we will see the Roar out there on centre stage in the grand final. The Roar will be versing the Central Coast Mariners in the A-League final. I understand that ticket sales are continuing to be very strong. They are expecting a crowd in the 40,000s but I hope that a late surge will see a full house and a house decked out in orange. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009482"></A>
This has been a record year for the Roar. They have been undefeated for 27 games. Members can see the Minister for Energy and Water Utilities proudly wearing the tie. He has been there for many of those games. To acknowledge the accomplishment of this team, this is a record for the longest unbeaten streak in a major national football competition in any code--league, union or Aussie rules. The previous record I understand was set more than 50 years ago by Geelong in the VFL. They went undefeated for 26 matches in 1952-53. It really does stand out as a remarkable sporting accomplishment. I hope that it will be matched by a win on Sunday night. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

What the Roar are hoping to do on Sunday night is break with routine and travel to Suncorp Stadium by bus. They may, in fact, do a State of Origin style bus trip down Caxton Street. They deserve to revel in the moment. It is not only a record-breaking streak; the last time a football decider was held in Brisbane was in 1997, when the Brisbane Strikers defeated Sydney United. Now it is the Roar’s turn. </Hansard-Body>

Having just celebrated International Women’s Day, I want to note that the Brisbane Roar women’s team won the final last week against Sydney Football Club 2-1 to claim their second title in three seasons. We hope that the men’s team can emulate their success on Sunday night. We should all be very proud of what is being achieved in the A-League by Queensland’s team, the Roar. I also note that the Gold Coast team came very close as well. It is important that we support all of our codes and I look forward to them doing well on Sunday night.</Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Minister for Energy and Water Utilities. Good news just in, Minister. At last night’s Brisbane City Council meeting bipartisan support between the LNP and Labor councillors ensured a motion was unanimously passed. The motion read--</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1009488"></A>
This council calls on the state government to immediately cap wholesale bulk water prices in line with CPI. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

 I think a far better thing for the Brisbane City Council to do is back our lord mayoral candidate’s policy of providing a rebate from the profits that Brisbane City Council will receive from Queensland Urban Utilities.

Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Order! Minister, resume your seat. Member for Clayfield, you have asked the question in a certain spirit and the minister is answering it in the same spirit. Therefore, I would ask that you desist and allow the minister to answer the question. Minister, you will stay relevant to the question that was asked. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011563"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As I was saying, the best thing that the Lord Mayor of Brisbane can do is follow his counterpart in the Moreton Bay Regional Council and provide a rebate from the profits that the Brisbane City Council will earn from the sale of water to ratepayers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011564"></A>
Let this difference be understood: this year alone, $407 million of subsidy is provided by the Queensland government. That is $407 million that we do not get back in terms of the sale of bulk water to councils. Unlike the Queensland government, which subsidises $407 million to the ratepayers of South-East Queensland, in addition to the $100 rebate that we provide to pensioners and in addition to the downward pressure that we have put on water prices, the Brisbane City Council and other councils like that of my good friend the Mayor of the Gold Coast refuse to provide satisfactory rebates from the profits that they earn. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011565"></A>
From memory, I think the Brisbane City Council will earn a profit of about $195 million this year. It is around that figure. That is the profit that the Brisbane City Council will take out of the back pockets and the wallets of hardworking ratepayers in Brisbane. The best thing that the Lord Mayor of Brisbane can do is to use the profit that he receives and give it back to the ratepayers of Brisbane through rebates. That is the policy that Ray Smith, our Labor candidate and next lord mayor of Brisbane, has already announced. In the spirit of bipartisanship, perhaps the Lord Mayor can join with him in offering exactly the same rebate. That is the best way that those profits can be returned to the good people of Brisbane. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011567"></A>
I will say this: each and every day, up to the next council elections, when it comes to hands in the back pockets of ratepayers there is no-one better than the Lord Mayor of Brisbane. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms CROFT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Deputy Premier and Attorney-General, Minister for Local Government and Special Minister of State. As the Deputy Premier knows, I have a strong working relationship with the Animal Welfare League in my electorate and the RSPCA of Queensland. I ask the Deputy Premier to update the House on the implementation of the Animal Management (Cats and Dogs) Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011576"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am more than happy to assist the honourable member with her inquiry. On 1 July 2009, new uniform state-wide requirements commenced for the management of declared dangerous dogs. In fact, the honourable member and the House might like to know that since the commencement of the act 1,773 dogs have been entered on the register, including 114 restricted dogs, 1,447 dangerous dogs and 212 menacing dogs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011578"></A>
However, one attack dog that you will not find on that register is the Leader of the Opposition. Yesterday members may have heard the Leader of the Opposition’s MPI speech or read it subsequently, at page 341 of <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
. I do exhort everyone to read it. Certainly, it is worthwhile reading it or watching the video link that Mr Speaker had. The Leader of the Opposition reached new heights of wackiness. He was not unlike a Surfers Paradise attack poodle. Traditionally, the Tuesday MPI speech is a leader of the opposition’s set piece for the week. It is his or her opportunity to set the agenda and to guide the team by providing leadership and by delivering an inspirational speech. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011579"></A>
In my 15 years in this place I have never heard such a rant. In fact, one of the media outlets said that, upon hearing the speech, his colleagues were cringing. It was a tirade that had water, it had Wivenhoe, it had fantasies about factions, it had ‘Big’ Bill Ludwig, it had zombies. The only thing he missed was tiger blood and the international conspiracy. It was like a Charlie Sheen conspiracy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011580"></A>
We know that the Leader of the Opposition is under pressure, but surely no-one in his office wrote that speech. Surely no-one there would have written that, unless they were trying to get at him. Surely the Leader of the Opposition did not write it himself, because he does not do angry very well at all. It is not in his character to do it and when he does it it does not come off. I can only conclude one thing about his contribution. There is only one person who could have written it; there is only one person who could have supplied it. He has outsourced it to the member for Burnett. </Hansard-Body>

 I thank the member for Pine Rivers for her question and for her support of businesses in her electorate so vital to producing jobs for the people of Pine Rivers. Today I can announce that the Bligh government is providing a further round of funding under the Proof of Concept Fund. Four new projects totalling $186,000 will be funded under this round, including a new project for a southside Brisbane company looking at thermal panel manufacture to take house design to the next level--to an eight-star standard--as well as another company looking at a new test for metabolic diseases that potentially has worldwide application in the detection of metabolic diseases. This is our commitment to providing the funds to support businesses, to support new innovation, to prove up concepts, to commercialise new products and to create the jobs of tomorrow. That has been our clear economic agenda. That has been our policy in action. It stands in contrast to the base politics being practised on the other side of the chamber. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013486"></A>
Of course, as the deputy has already alluded to, what we saw yesterday was a bizarre contribution from the Leader of the Opposition. It did not belong in this sandstone building; it belonged next door at the university. It was a student politics speech that could only have been written by the bovver boys up in the opposition leader’s office. The point, however, is that he was likened to Charlie Sheen, and just like Charlie Sheen these days he is incapable of even delivering a scripted line without crumbling. The opposition leader is a man under pressure. How do we know he is under pressure? We need to look no further than the great transcript that the ‘pineapple’ has given us about a recent long chat with the Leader of the Opposition in which he admitted that there are divisions in the LNP, in which he admitted that he faced criticism over his leadership in recent months and in which he had a crack at the long-serving members on his own side. Is any of this ringing a bell for anybody who has watched Queensland politics for the last generation? Of course, the best part of that contribution was when the journalist put to the opposition leader that names like ‘Springborg’ and ‘Nicholls’ have a higher currency.</Hansard-Body>

 Sure. To quote from the interview transcript, the opposition leader’s reply was, ‘They know Nicholls?’ What we do not know is whether he asked that in jest, in horror or in fear. Of course, we know that daily the shadow treasurer is counting up the numbers of a different sort. We know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is doing the circle for the Yelarbon barn dance. We know that ‘Uncle Bruce’ has let him go and we know that the member for Gympie and the member for Indooroopilly have positioned themselves in the outside barriers ready for a run. What do we find in the last 12 months of the term? We find the same old manoeuvring, the same old divisions, the same old leadership tensions, the same lack of policy, the same policy-free zone which the LNP in this state has been in forever, and that is why they are unfit to proclaim. </Hansard-Body>

Mr RICKUSS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Deputy Premier. I refer the minister to the 2003 State Planning Policy 1/03, mitigating the adverse impacts of floods. The State Planning Policy requires a flood plain advisory committee to be established in each local government area to comprise elected, administrative and community members. Will the minister explain why not one of these committees has been formed in the eight years since the Labor government introduced the State Planning Policy in 2003 to improve safety during flooding? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Fine. What I will say in relation to the State Planning Policy is that, generally and in the past, individual flood levels have been matters established by local councils. Off the top of my head, the State Planning Policy has a requirement that councils adopt a Q100 or higher policy. Some councils such as the Brisbane City Council have done that, one in excess of that and indeed they have had a recent review which they are revisting as well. I suspect that the royal commission will recommend that those matters be done on a more uniform basis and at an even higher level. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013507"></A>
I note that a number of councils have done this quite extensively. Bundaberg, for example, undertook very accurate flood mapping in the old Bundaberg area. Similarly, I think Emerald invested fairly heavily in that sort of mapping, as did Mackay. A number of other councils have also done that. Frankly, I look forward to what the commission believes is probably best practice in each of those areas. If there are better ways for us to establish how we might undertake those planning initiatives then I am happy to hear about them. However, in the past not all councils have welcomed state planning initiatives. Not all councils have welcomed state government involvement in those planning matters. Indeed, people such as the member for Warrego have made it their life effort to have the state not take an interest in those sorts of matters. </Hansard-Body>

I say to the honourable member that I will revert back to him on that particular aspect. However, the State Planning Policy does set a flood height and individual councils have an ability to raise it. Some individual councils have and some have not. One thing we do know in Queensland is that not all floods are the same. One size does not always fit all. I am more than happy to hear of those deliberations from the royal commission. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you for your protection, Mr Speaker. Last week I was briefed about Queensland’s large shark tagging program, which is based at the Queensland Boating and Fisheries Patrol headquarters at Southport. The program is tracking some of the world’s most dangerous sharks as they move along our beaches. The member for Waterford and I had a conversation earlier about the incidence of bull sharks in the Logan River. So it is an important program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013521"></A>
The program will help improve bather safety by giving exact information about shark movements. Acoustic tags are fitted to the sharks’ dorsal fins and send a series of pings underwater. Each shark has a unique ping signature which can help experts follow them. We hope to tag about 150 sharks from two metres to four metres by the end of the project. The species being tagged include great whites, tigers, bull sharks and dusky whalers. They are some of the most dangerous species of sharks that we find along the Queensland coastline. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013524"></A>
I have a suggestion, however. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition should consider walking down to Southport and getting some of these tags. He would then be able to keep tags on the LNP sharks that are circling him at the moment to take his job. He will be able to identify the unique ping for each LNP man-eater and see when they are meeting in a pack. The most dangerous species he will come across is the ‘Clayfieldeous’, also known as the tiger shark. There is also the ‘Warregoeous’, or the fossil shark, the ‘Noosaeous’, also called the wobbegong, and then there is the ‘Toowoomba Southeous’. It looks fearsome but really is the dummy shark. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013526"></A>
The Leader of the Opposition should really tag the nastiest shark of the lot, the ‘Bruce McIvoreous’, or the great white shark. It is circling at the moment. It smelt the blood in the water--the ‘Bruce McIvoreous’, or the great white--and it is ready to take him out. </Hansard-Body>

The Leader of the Opposition’s disastrous reshuffle of his shadow ministry and the insulting appointment of a junior shadow minister for flood recovery shows that the feeding frenzy is underway. The member for Surfers Paradise needs to put those tags on his LNP predators to know where they are, to keep track of them. The opposition leader is, unfortunately, an endangered species. He is out of his depth and the LNP predators are closing in for the kill. </Hansard-Body>

Ms JONES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As the Minister for Environment and Resource Management, I hold regular meetings with all of my senior executive staff. That includes, of course, the head of the Office of Climate Change. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013600"></A>
Let me talk about--as we have done for some years now--the work that we are doing in regard to preparing Queensland for the threats of climate change. If the member had actually read any of the information that has been released by me in the last two years in regard to what we have done to set Queensland up to be in the best position possible for if and when any price on carbon is built into the Australian economy, he would know this. What we did was focus on the things that we can do to help businesses, to help farmers, to help ordinary Queenslanders adjust to any price. Instead of waiting for the bickering to be sorted out at the federal level, what we did was get ahead of the game and actually put in place new policies and new programs to help ordinary Queenslanders, ordinary businesses and farmers to prepare for that. So let us talk about that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013601"></A>
One of the most popular programs that we have put in place to ensure we are helping ordinary Queenslanders work with climate change is the ClimateSmart Home Service, which many members from the opposite side of parliament have written to me about, congratulating that service--although probably not the new shadow minister. We have also been working very closely with CSIRO and AgForce--this is work that we are doing out of the Office of Climate Change. We are the only state in Australia that has scientific experts based here in Queensland to look at the effects of climate change and how we can ensure farmers in Queensland can gain from that. What did we do? We released new research with CSIRO which shows how we can lock up carbon in our landscape and how we can build into any carbon tax or CPRS system a way for farmers to actually gain income from their land. That is the work we have been doing. That is the work the Office of Climate Change does. It is leading the world, as the Premier said. It has actually been used now in America. California, which has a very similar economy to ours, has looked at it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013602"></A>
I am very proud of the work that we have done at a state level and through the Office of Climate Change. We are leading the way, as Professor Garnaut recognised last week when he was in Brisbane announcing a new initiative to help the people those opposite are meant to represent--farmers in Queensland--to ensure they are not ripped off. </Hansard-Body>

Cyclone Yasi, Restoration of Electricity Supply</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013608"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms JOHNSTONE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Energy and Water Utilities. Can the minister please update the House on progress with electrical repair work following Tropical Cyclone Yasi, which left a path of destruction in North Queensland last month? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013611"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. Restoring power and other essential services to Queenslanders affected by natural disaster is a priority for this government. Ergon Energy, I am pleased to report, has now restored power to all customers affected by Tropical Cyclone Yasi where it is safe to do so. To reconnect more than 200,000 customers in three weeks is an amazing effort by Ergon crews and their comrades from the south-east corner and of course interstate. I applaud the 2,000 staff members involved. I also thank the community for their support and patience while the repair work was being done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013614"></A>
The Bligh government is committed to reconstructing Queensland and delivering on vital government services like electricity. The stark contrast with those opposite is that customers would still be in the dark, with a bigger electricity bill to pay if the LNP were in power. For years those opposite have been calling for the whole network to be put underground. Putting powerlines underground, as is LNP policy, is up to 15 times more expensive than the traditional overhead method. Faults to the network are harder to pinpoint underground. It could take months longer to repair than easily accessible overhead lines.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013616"></A>
Treasury estimates that the cost of replacing Queensland’s existing overhead network with underground power would now be in excess of some $62 billion. Can you imagine how much electricity prices would have to increase to fund that? It just so happens that I can tell you, Mr Speaker. Based on the Queensland Competition Authority figures from September 2010, it equates to an extra $30,926 on the power bill of every household and business in Queensland. Let me say that again: $30,926 on each and every Queenslander’s power bill. The LNP want to not only bury powerlines but bury Queensland under crippling debt and higher electricity prices as a result. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013618"></A>
Earlier in an answer to the member for Clayfield I mentioned--and I was going from memory--that the profit the Brisbane City Council would receive from Queensland Urban Utilities was $195 million or $198 million a year. I have now been informed that the accurate figure is indeed $129 million this year. It will be $171 million next year and $179 million the year after that. Based on the fact that there are about one million households in Brisbane, what the Lord Mayor could do this week is announce a $100 rebate for every household in Brisbane that would come out of that $129 million profit. That would still leave him with $29 million to put in his back pocket. But that is the profit that the Lord Mayor will pocket and not put back into rebates for the good people of Brisbane who are suffering higher water bills as a result of decisions by those councils that make up the shareholders of those distributor-retailers.</Hansard-Body>

Gladstone, Public Trustee Office</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013624"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Deputy Premier and Attorney-General, Minister for Local Government and Special Minister of State. The Gladstone Public Trustee office provides a wonderful service. However, residents have advised me that more and more of their requests for services are referred to Brisbane and that staff numbers in Gladstone have reduced. With the population in Gladstone expected to double in the next 15 years or so, will the minister review staffing and services in the Gladstone office to ensure services can grow with demand? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013628"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for her question. I am more than happy to look into the matter personally for her. As usual, the honourable member asks questions in good faith about issues and I will attempt to examine current staffing levels there. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013629"></A>
I have to say in relation to the Public Trustee, or indeed the legal profession, that things have changed over time. When I was first an articled clerk we had a telex machine and someone had to know how to operate that. Then we went to fax machines and most people could operate those. Indeed, what we have sought to do in the legal profession is change over time how things might be done remotely. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013630"></A>
The other thing I should say is that the Public Trustee performed a traditional role in communities, as did the clerk of the court, that has actually evolved over time. With the growth and extent of the legal profession in regional Queensland, the legal profession in many instances has been the organisation that has played a greater role. That is no bad thing necessarily if it is there ready, willing and able to do that. I do not think honourable members would quibble with the private sector providing those sorts of services if they can do them appropriately. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013631"></A>
Having said that, the Public Trustee does have a very important role when it comes to independently managing, for example, estates. I know that people can get quite frustrated in an estate situation if they do not have the ability to talk to someone face to face so that they can have that relationship in terms of managing that estate. I understand the honourable member’s concerns in that regard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013632"></A>
These days the Public Trustee provides a service in relation to the preparation of wills, but so do many private solicitors as well. </Hansard-Body>

Understanding the rules of anticipation, I was about to note that I am mindful of the rules of anticipation given the notice of motion before the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013683"></A>
I would like to reassure the member and his constituents that the Queensland government has implemented a suite of policy initiatives to help ensure the long-term future of Queensland’s mining and petroleum industries is balanced with and contributes to the economic viability of our local communities, the environment and the agricultural sector. Specifically, this government has very strong laws in place in relation to companies and individuals accessing private land to conduct advanced exploration activities. Legislation put in place last year makes it absolutely necessary that companies have agreed with landowners when it comes to conduct and compensation before advanced exploration activities begin. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013684"></A>
Permission to explore in no way gives a company or an individual permission to mine. In short, permission to explore allows a company to find out what is in the ground, not to dig it out. Historically speaking, when permission to explore is granted it is rare that land is ever to be mined. Less than one per cent of land explored for mining has a mining lease placed over it. Even if exploration reveals that a commercially viable operation may be possible there are still a number of boxes that a company must tick before operations can start. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013686"></A>
I am talking about assessing the project against legislation like the Environmental Protection Act, the Nature Conservation Act and the Vegetation Management Act, if it applies. The important thing is that there will be several chances for public input along the way and it may even require Commonwealth approval. Any mining application that does not uphold the strictest environmental standards will not go ahead. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013689"></A>
The LNP must have a very short memory when it comes to some of the issues that it has been going on about. This has been the case for a very long time. We need to balance the needs of the mining industry, which brings benefits like jobs, with the needs of communities. That is why rigorous processes and strong laws are in place. </Hansard-Body>

Mr HINCHLIFFE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Beaudesert for his question. The Bligh government has put in place very strong laws to manage the development of the coal seam gas industry. We understand that there are some members of the community who are concerned. That is why we have held dozens of community forums on the ground to inform the community about their rights and what we are doing as a government to get the balance right. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013700"></A>
I watched with great interest the <Hansard-Italic>
Four Corners</Hansard-Italic>
 documentary a couple of weeks ago. I am certainly seeking more information and advice--and I know that some of my colleagues are too--about some of the things that were reported in that program. Getting to the nub of the truth of these matters is vitally important. That is what we will do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013701"></A>
It is important for people to understand that coal seam gas has been safely produced in Queensland for the domestic market since the 1990s. The expansion of this industry into the export markets brings enormous opportunities in terms of jobs and investment. But this cannot come at any cost. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013702"></A>
I noted an editorial in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 yesterday about CSG. I could not agree more. If the projections are right this is the beginning of a new and prosperous era for the state, but we do need to get it right. That is what we are doing, as acknowledged by the member for Callide yesterday. He said in this House yesterday--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1013704"></A>
... commend the Labor government. I do not often commend the Labor government and I grit my teeth when I do. However, I commend the Labor government for acting decisively ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013705"></A>
The problem is that sometimes nobody really knows where the LNP stands on some of these issues. While the member for Callide supports CSG and the resources industry when it is done properly, as we do, the member for Condamine is out there calling for moratoriums at times. Our priority is to strike the right balance between the needs of the community and the environment and industry and economic development for regional Queensland. This government is working hard to provide legislation and other assistance to achieve that outcome. We have a series of initiatives on record and we will do more to get the balance right. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs SMITH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am pleased to ask the first question of the Minister for Tourism, Manufacturing and Small Business. Tourism supports more than 222,000 direct and indirect jobs throughout the state and is the lifeblood of the Gold Coast. Could the minister inform the House what is being done to support operators in the wake of the global financial crisis and recent natural disasters? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013711"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms JARRATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Burleigh for her question and for her acknowledgement of the importance of tourism to our state’s economy and say how delighted I was to spend some time with her and other Gold Coast members during my first week as minister. Tourism Australia has today released the latest international visitor numbers for Queensland. The figures show international tourist numbers to Queensland have increased for the first time in three years, with 1.4 million foreign holiday makers visiting the state in 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013712"></A>
International visitor numbers to Queensland rose roughly four per cent compared to 2009. Chinese tourist numbers increased to 23 per cent, making China Queensland’s fastest growing international market. The 188,000 Chinese visitors who travelled to Queensland in 2010 spent $338 million, a massive 18 per cent increase on 2009 spending levels. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013713"></A>
The Tourism Australia statistics released today show that Queensland also enjoyed its best results from the Japanese market in five years. The number of Japanese tourists travelling to Queensland in 2010 increased by nine per cent to 223,000, with increased spending of one per cent to $375 million. Visitor numbers from Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand also increased. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013714"></A>
However, there is no doubt that the lingering effects of the global financial crisis coupled with the strength of the Australian dollar have had an impact on our international markets. This is reflected in the fact that, while international travellers spent an extra 725,000 nights in Queensland, their overall spending decreased by three per cent. Visitation from key European markets, France and Germany, also decreased one and nine per cent respectively. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013715"></A>
In the wake of the global financial crisis and recent natural disasters, the Bligh government is committed to supporting our important tourism operators and small businesses. That is why we have rolled out $14.3 million in just over 14 days. This commitment includes a $10 million state and federal marketing campaign to promote Queensland to Australia and the world. It also includes an additional $2 million in joint Commonwealth and state funding to help tourism operators tap into and benefit from growing markets, such as Chinese visitors. Our commitment to this important industry has never been stronger. </Hansard-Body>

 My question without notice is to the Minister for Government Services, Building Industry and Information and Communication Technology. The minister would now be aware that from Bundaberg to Badu none of the structures built through the federal government’s Building the Education Revolution program were built to category 5 cyclone standards.

 I thank the honourable member for the question.

We do have a commitment to cyclone safety and the construction of cyclone evacuation centres throughout Queensland. In relation to the question of cyclone safety shelters, what we have learnt from this event is that we have a whole lot of new data about the impact of these severe storms on our coast on buildings constructed under the BER and buildings constructed as purpose-built shelters. We have seen a fairly good rate of stand-up to the storm that hit the coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016183"></A>
It is important that we gather all of the data that we can from this event and determine how we best apply that to future cyclone safety. When I was in Tully Heads, there were researchers out on the ground measuring storm surge impacts, measuring the impacts of that cyclone and gathering a range of data to enable us to inform the future buildings and cyclone safety plans. The last cyclone of that size was in the early 19th century, and our data on those impacts is significantly old. What we have seen is a very good performance in Innisfail of the building structures that came following Cyclone Larry. We will be able to use that data as well to inform our future cyclone safety strategy.</Hansard-Body>

It would appear that the same fate awaits any person or group of people who may have been adversely affected. Victims of the floods are being denied the right to appear at the inquiry and ask legitimate questions of those people who made decisions that had major impacts on their families or their businesses. </A></Hansard-Body>

We have secret cabinet minutes, secret water releases and secret pages of dam manuals, and now victims of the floods are prevented from having leave to appear and cross-examine government officials. This is not the way the Patel inquiry operated. This is not the way the Victorian bushfire inquiry operated. Victims in Victoria were granted leave to appear. When I sought the reassurance of an extra term of reference for the commission of inquiry to investigate any other matter that the commissioner should seek information about, the Premier rejected that and said everything was on the table. </Hansard-Body>

Queenslanders cannot have confidence in an inquiry where victims are silenced or restricted to only making written submissions. I will not have confidence in an inquiry that stifles the voices of victims. The Queensland flood inquiry should be focused on allowing a full, frank and unfettered examination of the events that led to the floods. I expressed my extreme disquiet and unease at the flood commission’s refusal to allow leave to appear to those who have been severely affected by these floods. This ridiculous situation needs to be rectified immediately and I urge the Premier to amend her terms of reference to guarantee victims a right to appear at the flood inquiry.</Hansard-Body>

There were many families who were displaced and are still trying to piece their lives back together, and the government is doing all that it can to restore people’s lives to some sense of normality, particularly where insurance companies have failed to measure up to their responsibilities. The Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport, the Hon. Phil Reeves, and I visited the Centenary Rowing Club, the Jindalee and Oxley bowls clubs, the Jindalee and McLeod golf clubs, the Jindalee Jags and the Centenary Little Athletics Club soon after the floodwaters receded. My office provided applications for grants under the Sport and Recreation Flood Fightback Plan, and only a few weeks later clubs were advised that they would be receiving funds to assist their recovery. The Corinda Pony Club and the Jindalee Swimming Club also received these grants.</A></Hansard-Body>

I am happy that the Lord Mayor is now also assisting some of these clubs with grants. However, I am appalled that the Centenary Stormers Soccer Club were advised that the upgrade of Atthows Park and their playing fields would be further delayed because they were not flood affected. This makes no sense because it means they cannot play their competitions on their home fields this year. Money was set aside for this project by council two years ago to be completed by June 2010, with 25 per cent of the funding by the state government to assist with the remediation works. Now the upgrade has been stopped by the BCC and players have to share other fields in Brisbane for the season. The cost of this delay is enormous to these clubs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016207"></A>
Isn’t the reason why funds are being provided to flood affected areas so that the players can get back on their fields? Yet the opposite is happening for the Centenary Stormers and the Western Districts Baseball Club because their grounds were not flood affected. They have families who were personally traumatised by the floods and they want some normality in their lives and in their children’s lives. </Hansard-Body>

I urge the Lord Mayor to take a good look at this situation and reason it out. He is getting a lot of money from the state and federal governments for infrastructure rebuilding in flooded areas. He should not be robbing Peter to pay Paul, so to speak, when all clubs should be supported to keep kids active. I seek leave to table the BCC’s time line for the upgrade of Atthows Park, dated 4 December 2009. </Hansard-Body>

Any Labor member or minister who tries to defend this as being acceptable has a question mark over their own competence. Gaffer tape and garden ties: this is shoddy, yet this is typical of the Labor Party’s maintenance programs for roads in this state. It is almost four months now since this bridge was damaged--well before the floods, well before the cyclones--yet the best the Bligh Labor government can do is to nip into the garden shed, take some gaffer tape, get some garden ties and bung it together and say that it is good enough.

 (Sandgate--ALP) (11.41 am): Animal cruelty is a blight on society and perpetrators must be dealt a strong message and a stronger sentence that reflects our community’s abhorrence of such acts. I am proud to be sponsoring a petition organised by my constituent Gloria McClymont. The petition calls for much stricter laws governing the sentencing of culprits found guilty of cruelty to animals. So far Gloria has accumulated 4,883 signatures and is still collecting support. I completely understand this call for change. Who was not moved by the story of the joey koala whose small body was riddled with gun pellets? Who was not sickened by the story of a horse dragged along behind a car? When one compares such despicable acts with the huge effort put in to save pets and livestock during the recent natural disasters, it is difficult to comprehend the motivation behind such cruelty.</Hansard-Body>

Research shows that people who are cruel to animals often go on to torment women and children in domestic violence situations. There is nothing domestic about violence. Every adult and child has the right to feel safe in their own home. Pets and wildlife should be the focus of our care, not our torment. It is time to shine a light on the dark practices of violence and intimidation, and that means strong punishment for offenders. I believe that the maximum sentences for animal cruelty must reflect the seriousness of the offence, and today I am supporting my petitioners 100 per cent and am calling for an increase in penalties and maximum sentences under the Animal Care and Protection Act. As it is, the act has significant penalties compared to equivalent legislation in other Australian states and territories and maximum penalties were increased in January 2009, with a maximum $100,000 fine or two years imprisonment for breach of cruelty. But it is not enough. I have discussed my concerns with Deputy Premier Paul Lucas and Minister Tim Mulherin and I look forward to working with my government to update these laws.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Caloundra--LNP) (11.43 am): On 16 February I rose in this House to make a short contribution to the condolence motion. I made it clear that natural disasters have a psychological impact on the people who go through them and such impacts can vary from person to person, with short-, medium- or long-term effects. Stress, depression, anxiety and even post-traumatic stress disorder are possible outcomes and it is important that we assist those who are suffering to understand that help is available. There will be those who are close to the sufferers--indeed, their family and friends--who will be the first to notice traits or changes in behaviour that raise concerns of how they are coping in their time of emotional crisis. For society’s wellbeing, the return to work, the return to school and the return to an active life is important not just for the sufferer but for the family and as part of the economic recovery of this state.</Hansard-Body>

Queensland, and in particular this government, must commence a public campaign across media outlets, print, radio, television, the web and the balance identifying telltale signs of mental health issues for a period of some two to three years, ensuring as best we can people can identify the early warning signs. In addition, it is important people understand help is available and, if a person believes their loved one is suffering from symptoms, contact telephone numbers and trained experts are advertised to assist with their recovery. In my opinion we cannot simply allow recovery to be solely related to roads, bricks and mortar. Important as they are, the mental stability and recovery of those suffering is equally important. Two bodies that may be considered in a partnership of this nature will be the AMAQ and the Royal College of Psychiatrists. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Cook--ALP) (11.44 am): While the Premier was governing the state from Far North Queensland two weeks ago, it was great to be able to host her in the jewel of Queensland’s tourism crown, Port Douglas. Port Douglas and the Daintree area have been particularly hard hit by the global financial crisis and the aftermath of this summer of natural disasters, which have clearly scared off some potential visitors. This has occurred despite the fact that the region was largely--thankfully--unscathed by the ravages of Yasi. There is a real need to get the message out that places like Port Douglas and the Daintree are open for business, and the Premier has stepped up to the plate to achieve this end. While she was in the region she announced an additional $530,000 to attract people from the critical Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane markets to Far North Queensland. This comes on top of the $2 million announced afterwards of joint state and federal money to promote the state, which in itself comes on top of the $10 million, the details of which the new tourism minister announced this morning with the Nothing Beats Queensland campaign. Port Douglas is a special place.</Hansard-Body>

 It is why I live there. Its natural beauty and village feel make it a place people of all backgrounds--from backpackers to movie stars, from families to presidents--choose to visit. There is, however, a need to ensure Port Douglas keeps moving forward. Cairns Regional Council has prepared a master plan to revamp the waterfront area, and this has received widespread public support for what is being proposed. While the Premier was in Port Douglas she was able to announce $30,000 to assist the council to fast-track the approval process to build a lagoon, which is a central part of the waterfront revitalisation. Importantly, while at a luncheon organised by the Port Douglas Chamber of Commerce the Premier gave in-principle support to return any money raised from the possible freeholding of two waterfront leases into the waterfront project. I want to thank Port Douglas Chamber of Commerce President Ken Dobbs and his committee for hosting this event, which over 120 people attended. I table a copy of the <Hansard-Italic>

 The final report of the BER implementation task force said that, of the $3 million spent at the Mount Crosby State School, the project fails the value for money assessment and in fact that federal government report scored this project zero out of 10 for value for money. People are sick and tired of the spin. They want results. The Mount Crosby State School has written to the new incoming minister, and I support its call that he reconsider this and allocate the funds to complete this project.

The new Minister for Education must reconsider this undersize, non-enclosed and inadequate hall.

It will not serve any purpose in a natural disaster in this community that has just recently been cut off by natural disaster. It will not serve any community purposes because it is not enclosed. It cannot be used for after-school care. It will stand forever as a monument to the folly and incompetence of those opposite in education. I call on the new minister to make good in this very large and rapidly growing state school and to allocate the funds necessary to at least complete the walls of an enclosed hall at the Mount Crosby State School.</Hansard-Body>

Its epicentre was in Lyttelton Harbour, over the hill from Sumner, the cosy seaside valley where I grew up. I watched the news in horror as rocks and hills crumbled, smashing homes, community buildings and roads. Along with the iconic cathedral in the city square, Shag Rock--one of two iconic Sumner Beach rock formations--is no more. </A></Hansard-Body>

 Two weeks on, many homes only have electricity because of huge generators feeding power into the grid, portaloos still line the streets, the world-renowned artesian water still needs to be boiled and the aftershocks keep rocking the town, further damaging homes and nerves. It is with pride that, only a little after I was able to ensure that my sisters and their families were safe, Queensland’s specialist recovery teams were joining the New Zealand teams in the search for survivors in the rubble of the city centre. These brave Queenslanders were our hands stretching across the Tasman in support of our New Zealand cousins in their time of need. </Hansard-Body>

Like many close friends and relations, we have our jokes and compete in the sporting arena but we are bound by ties of blood and culture. My heart goes out to all Cantabrians at this time of crisis, particularly to those who have lost their loved ones and to those who will be unable to live in their homes for some time to come. Living through two devastating earthquakes is difficult, but it takes even more courage and a sense of humour to endure the continuing tremors. I say to all Cantabrians: kia kaha. Stay strong. We in Queensland stand with you. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110309_115109" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Burdekin--LNP) (11.51 am): I call on the Minister for Fisheries, Mr Wallace, to heed the concerns of the coral finfish industry. Since Cyclone Yasi, reef line fishers in the Bowen area are very concerned about reduced catches, with one fisher put out to sea returning with one coral trout for the entire trip. The total unloads of coral trout in Bowen for February 2011 were 643 kilograms. In the corresponding period in 2008, prior to the cyclones, it was 26,133 kilograms. This year the catch was as a result of a similar effort being expended for this reduction in catch. Reduced catches have put a strain on individuals and the industry as a whole since Cyclone Hamish in March 2009. Since that time, cyclones Ului, Anthony and Yasi have impacted on these fishing grounds. </A></Hansard-Body>

A Tropical Cyclone Hamish working group was formed with a number of research bodies and they gathered data on catch rates and effort patterns, with some heavily impacted fishery grids confirming that catch rates were down by more than 30 per cent. The Bowen reef line fishers support the district with their flow-on work to other industries and the call for government assistance has gone unanswered, apart from some wage subsidy relief where it was applicable. The industry has been advised that it does not meet the strict natural disaster assessment criteria. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018842"></A>
Minister Mulherin is on record as saying that there is nothing available to help Bowen fishermen restructure their businesses or get compensation for loss of income. He has stated that the department has assessed it and ‘it just does not qualify’. Fishers are left in a quandary. Their own patch is barren and they are reluctant to go elsewhere due to the expense and potential for overfishing. Many fishers are coming to the belief that the Fisheries (Coral Reef Fin Fish) Management Plan needs to have a whole-of-industry review. Many feel that the objectives of the plan and its achievement are no longer sustainable. Whilst undertaking a review, there is also the belief that best practice measures from other states need to be scrutinised for consideration. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Yesterday in Caboolture, BPW Caboolture held its annual candle-lighting ceremony. This ceremony is held every year on the same day by every BPW club in the world and coincides with International Women’s Day. I commend BPW Caboolture for its contribution to International Women’s Day and for its contribution to the advancement of the status of women in our region, our nation and our world.</A></Hansard-Body>

Honourable members would certainly be interested to know that BPW Caboolture is the largest BPW club in Australia and that one of its members, Debbie Rychvalsky, serves as the national secretary of BPW Australia. BPW Caboolture also has the youngest BPW member in Australia, Aleisha Gubesch, who is in year 12 at St Columban’s College. I am very proud of the work of BPW Caboolture.

I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the Queensland government’s Office for Women for its good and hard work in supporting women right around our state.

This hotline service provides to Queensland women a free and confidential information and referral service about community services and government agency support services. The Women’s Infolink hotline service can be accessed by calling 1800177577 during business hours. <Hansard-Speech-End>

It will provide job growth, wealth growth, new opportunity growth and new skills for Queenslanders now and in the future. That is why it is stunning that the state Labor government has snubbed Queensland’s information technology industry with its recently appointed Skills Queensland Board. Of the 10 board members, there is no representative from the state’s IT industry. The irony here is that, when announcing the new board, the Premier claimed in a media release that it would work ‘to ensure Queensland was equipped to meet current and future skills demand’. The Premier claimed further--</A></Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018870"></A>
Can there be any industry that is better positioned to meet current and future skill demand than the IT industry? Can there be any industry that is better positioned to skill up Queenslanders for the jobs of today and tomorrow? Yet the IT industry is snubbed by the Labor government and, instead, a majority of those appointed by the Labor government to the Skills Queensland Board are either union officials or public servants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018871"></A>
But perhaps the snubbing of the IT industry by Labor is not surprising. This government has taken little constructive interest in this industry, which will play such an important role in the state’s future. The government seems to have no understanding of how important a role the IT industry is already playing in our state’s economy. The local IT industry comprises almost 6,000 businesses, employs a direct workforce of 70,000 and generates revenue of approximately $29 billion and exports of $1.15 billion. Yet, when the government has a chance to put this industry front and centre on its key Skills Queensland Board, it snubs it in favour of union leaders and public servants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018872"></A>
I challenge the government’s newly installed ICT minister to reverse this decision. If he does not, it just shows that he will be treating IT just like his predecessor did--as a second-class industry. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Many residents are fed up with the secrecy, buck-passing, inaction and incompetence of the Gold Coast mayor and the Gold Coast City Council on this matter. The paltry $50 rebate that Mayor Ron Clarke has offered to some ratepayers for their water and sewerage bills is simply not enough, particularly in light of the news today that it would be null and void after their rates bill will rise by $50. My Gold Coast Labor colleagues and I have called on Councillor Clarke to increase the rebate. </A></Hansard-Body>

The Gold Coast City Council is set to profit $98 million this year alone through council owned water and utility retailer Allconnex. Its own figures project that this profit will grow to $218 million in five years. If the mayor agreed to a $100 rebate to each household to help pay for water bills, he would still have $70 million left over from profits. Instead, Councillor Clarke is going to give a paltry $50 rebate but only to some residents, leaving the council to pocket more than $85 million. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018883"></A>
Council charges make up 76 per cent of the average Gold Coast water and sewerage bill. The fact is--and we have been saying this all along--councils are making huge profits from water bills. The state government understands the current pressure on household budgets. The state government sold water to South-East Queensland councils last year for a $407 million loss. That means that the state is effectively providing a saving of nearly $350 per water connection in South-East Queensland. Despite that, in December we announced a reduction in water price increases that will grow from $5 to $30 per year per household by 2017-18. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018884"></A>
The Bligh government also already provides a $100 water rebate for pensioners. We are doing what we can do to help. It is now time for the Gold Coast City Council to do the same. If the Moreton Bay Regional Council can offer its residents a 50 per cent rebate then so can the Gold Coast City Council. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(12.00 pm): This morning I tabled a petition of 1,976 signatures from the residents of the Atherton Tablelands calling for a government commitment that there are no plans to cut back chemotherapy services at the Atherton Hospital. The petition also calls for a government commitment to continue funding these services as the loss of the chemotherapy unit will impact severely on cancer sufferers, their families and the community. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018930"></A>
This petition was initiated in response to feedback that the service was going to be phased out and moved to the Cairns Base Hospital almost 100 kilometres away. In November last year I questioned the previous minister in relation to this and he replied that there were no plans to phase out chemotherapy services at the Atherton Hospital. However, Tablelanders are very sceptical and rightly so. Residents have seen many health services removed or delayed with no consideration for the negative impact on the Tablelands community. They want to ensure that vital services such as the chemotherapy unit remain and are funded adequately into the future so that they can continue to provide the quality care that the chemo unit at the Atherton Hospital gives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018931"></A>
The scepticism of Tablelanders is entrenched in the long list of promises by the Labor government regarding services on the Atherton Tablelands. It is entrenched in a six-year promise for a CT scanner which we are still waiting for; it is entrenched in the promise of the west wing at the Mareeba Hospital that lay idle for years until a recent positive announcement; and it is engraved in the promise of an upgrade of the ambulance station and healthcare centre in Ravenshoe that in 10 months has got no further than being pegged out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157628"></A>
This petition is reflective of the deep scepticism that these communities have towards this government’s policy to centralise health services. This petition shows that any inkling of a removal of the chemo unit at the Atherton Hospital will spark massive revolt. The previous minister gave a halfhearted response that there are no changes planned for the removal of the chemo unit at the Atherton Hospital. Tablelanders want and deserve an iron-clad guarantee from the new Minister for Health that this vital service will not be removed and a firm commitment that the chemo unit will continue to be adequately funded in the future.<Hansard-Speech-End>

(12.01 pm): For 28 years Chatswood Hills State School has been caring for the environment. In that time they have created a beautiful rainforest area, ensuring that there are trees in their grounds to maintain the koala corridor. This is extremely important as the school is a neighbour to the Springwood Conservation Park. The school is also a member of Land for Wildlife and it is committed to preserving and protecting our land and natural resources for our wildlife. They are great recyclers, have won national awards for their environmental programs and liaised internationally with universities and other environmental educators about their programs. There is no doubt Chatsworth Hills is a leader when it comes to being green. In fact, I bet any of the students could come into this chamber and teach us all a thing or two about how to do it better when it comes to being green. </Hansard-Body>

On visiting Chatswood Hills State School one can very clearly see how seriously they are taking caring for the environment. Last week when I had the pleasure of presenting the school with their waste buster packs I also had the pleasure of seeing a beautiful koala in the school grounds. The koala crawled along school paths, past the administration, past classrooms and then to a tree which it climbed and in which it had a rest. It possibly could have been the oohs and ahs from some of the younger students in the school that may have caused the koala to find a resting spot high up in that tree. It was a very special moment to see the joy and wonder on the faces of the young students and to see this beautiful koala wandering around as if it was part of the school community.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1018940"></A>
As I said before, I presented the school with their waste buster packs as the school is among 150 schools in the state to become part of the Do the Right Thing, Use the Right Bin program. By having a recycling and waste management program, Chatswood Hills State School will be helping deliver a greener, cleaner future for our state. The principal, Mr Keith Graham, believes the program fits in well with the school’s tradition of promoting environmental conservation and sustainability. He said that it is important to educate our children in literacy and numeracy, but it is also important to educate them in environmental awareness and responsibility. The school has a number of rainwater tanks and lots of other programs and I look forward to visiting the school soon. <Hansard-Speech-End>

That the report of the Committee System Review Committee, titled <Hansard-Italic>
Review of the Queensland parliamentary committee system</Hansard-Italic>
, tabled on 15 December 2010, be noted. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018962"></A>
I have had the good fortune to effect many legislative and policy changes as a minister in many different portfolios over a 12-year period and hopefully they have been of benefit to the people of Queensland. I regard the work of the committee I chaired and its outcomes as one of the most valuable contributions I have made to this parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157668"></A>
At the outset, let me thank my fellow committee members. The opposition members--the member for Southern Downs, the member for Callide and the member for Toowoomba South--collectively have 51 years of experience in this parliament. The member for Nanango has been here for 10 years. My colleague the member for Rockhampton and I were first elected over 21 years ago and the member for Pine Rivers, the member for Yeerongpilly and the member for Waterford each brought newer perspectives to our deliberations. Four of us had been ministers and served in this parliament both in government and in opposition. Between us we represented over 130 years of parliamentary experience. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018964"></A>
We produced this report in record time--10 months, in fact--which is the time frame we gave ourselves. Members came to committee meetings as individuals. There was no sign that people had caucused along party political lines or in any other sense. I do not think I would offend any members’ sensibilities in saying that it was a regular occurrence that members frequently disagreed with their colleagues from their own party. I have to say that this has been my experience on other parliamentary committees on which I have served. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018965"></A>
Our committee gained valuable insight from visiting the New Zealand parliament. The committee system they have fashioned for their unicameral parliament is regarded by many as amongst best practice. The member for Southern Downs and I learnt a tremendous amount from talking to members of various Canadian parliaments and their officers. Their unicameral provincial parliaments have committee structures that are much more powerful than our own. I was also very fortunate in a private capacity to visit the new Scottish parliament and the Irish parliament and talk about these matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018966"></A>
It is easy to become comfortable and assume that other Westminster parliaments operate in the same way as ours and it is a learning experience to examine the differences in their operation and priorities. I think it is fair to say that the member for Southern Downs and I were quite taken with the practice in some Canadian parliaments to save all the parliamentary votes and have them in one block period every morning. We resisted the temptation to include that in our recommendation, but it is differences such as these which make us take one step back and question our own practices and the possibilities for change. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018967"></A>
At the end of the day you are never comparing apples to apples when you are comparing different parliaments, and we were never going to copy other jurisdictions’ models and adopt them as our own. The recommendations in this report have been crafted to fit our own unique parliamentary circumstances, our geography, our history and our priorities. They could only have been framed by members of parliament because we know what is workable and achievable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019010"></A>
The fact that we have delivered a unanimous report is significant on many levels. We all became excited by the prospect that it was time for change and that, indeed, there was sufficient maturity and goodwill around the table to negotiate compromises. Probably there have not been many other times in our state’s history when unanimity for such parliamentary reform could have been reached. Our blueprint for reform represents the most significant change in the way that the Queensland parliament operates since the upper house was abolished 90 years ago. It will represent the most significant reform of any state parliament in Australia. </Hansard-Body>

Because the senior members of our committee have been occupied as ministers, shadow ministers or opposition leaders for the past decade or so, we all realised that we had not taken a sufficient interest in the way that the parliament was being run or, indeed, how effectively the committee system was operating. Some of us, and I was one, were committee chairs in the early 1990s when we hired our own research staff, controlled our own budgets and set our own agendas. In those days we made recommendations that the government of the day did not like but nevertheless accepted. I well remember being on the public works committee and recommending that we knock down the wall of the Townsville prison. It was the first time that we recommended replacing that fixed structure with barbed wire. The minister of the day and, indeed, the prison officers thought that the world was going to end and that the prisoners were going to escape as a result. That recommendation did not make the government happy, but it proceeded with it. I can give members lots of other examples of the powers of the committees in those days. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019014"></A>
Those were also the days when the media and academia were interested in our work. I think it is fair to say that, although our present committees have been producing many valuable reports, much of their influence, independence and status has been eroded. There are many reasons why this has occurred, but in my speaking entitlement today I do not have the time to examine them in detail. However, we do believe that giving committees of the parliament decision-making control over the budget, policies and other matters concerning their operations will make us all pay more attention to their work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019015"></A>
We also believe that the creation of parliamentary secretary positions with superior entitlements to committee chairs has led to some of the most ambitious, enthusiastic and capable backbenchers to chase those positions, when once those same individuals sought to put their energies into the position of committee chair. We must again elevate this position. In New Zealand, many former ministers who are now in opposition are using their expertise to chair committees. It has been a worthwhile career path for them to use their skill and exercise accountability over the government of the day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019016"></A>
When we saw the dedicated committee facilities, with public and press galleries and broadcasting facilities, in every parliament that we visited, we asked ourselves why, after 20 years of a modern committee system in the Queensland parliament, we do not have even one dedicated committee room? We realised that we have all taken our eye off the ball when it comes to this important part of parliament’s work. Other parliaments have gone paperless. Other parliaments broadcast all committee proceedings. Other parliaments have dedicated rooms for the exclusive use of each committee. The fact that we do not have videoconferencing facilities is a sad indictment on our present state of affairs. On parliamentary sitting days my own committee often had trouble finding a satisfactory meeting room. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019017"></A>
I do not know what the opposition’s present position is on the creation of an upper house, but I believe that the blueprint we are offering is superior to an upper house in every aspect. Our system will mean that every piece of legislation is explained in detail to a committee. Every piece of legislation will have the possibility of having public input and that input will be publicly broadcast. For the first time, every Queenslander can have a say in the laws that we make in this state. The committee will have to listen to those views before that legislation is debated and voted on in the parliament. This is unprecedented for an Australian parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019018"></A>
In addition, the committees will be able to examine petitions, initiate their own inquiries and take up matters on behalf of ordinary Queenslanders. I think in our honest moments we would all acknowledge that--and, let us face it, we are all directly elected--the most important role we perform is as our community’s ombudsman and our role as legislator comes a poor second. Consequently, we all speak and vote on legislation without a good understanding of its detail. That is why, in future, it is important that members of parliament, through this committee system, examine the detail of the legislation. I am concerned that the parliament’s role as a check and balance on the executive is not as strong as it could be, because we have not been paying attention to the detail. The system we propose will mean members of parliament will scrutinise and understand legislation, and restore the balance to their role as legislators and representatives of the people. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1019019"></A>
It is human nature to resist change, but change is an irreversible feature of our modern world. I am aware that in this report we have put forward far-reaching and bold reforms that will give anxiety to some public servants who will, for the first time, have to appear before committees; to some ministers, who may not want every detail of their work examined; to some members of parliament, who will be challenged by the workload that we will put in front of them in the future; and, indeed, to some officers of this parliament who will not want to see change. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019020"></A>
There has been some commentary on our report and I feel that a lot of that commentary has been misguided. Late last year, a <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 columnist described the changes that we are proposing as ‘a canny plan that would result in the most opposition friendly parliament we have ever known.’ This is hardly consistent with the claims of a former Speaker, Jim Fouras, who has said that the changes will place parliament under even greater executive control. In Tuesday’s <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
, Mr Fouras also incorrectly stated that nowhere in the world is there a standing orders committee that does not include the Speaker. One only has to look at the House of Representatives where the Standing Committee on Procedure, the equivalent of Queensland’s Standing Orders Committee, does not have the Speaker as a member. After last year’s cliffhanger election, Julia Gillard’s government proposed changes to the standing orders after negotiations with Independents and other members of parliament. Those changes were accepted by the House of Representatives without reference to the procedures committee. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019022"></A>
There is no reason why the Queensland parliament should resist evolution when other parliaments around the world are moving to make the most of society’s changes in the 21st century. As I have indicated, the nine members of our committee had to make compromises to reach unanimity on many matters and I think we are all mature enough to consider other points of view. Since the report was tabled, I have spent considerable time talking to the Premier and my colleagues, the Speaker, the Clerk of the Parliament, the Integrity Commissioner, journalists and academics about our proposals. I am prepared to accept advice that having the Committee of the Legislative Assembly, the proposed committee, undertake all the functions of the ethics and privileges committee would not represent best practice and that the consideration of members’ breaches should be retained by a back bench committee formed specifically for this purpose. I know that the government will indicate this direction in its response to our report. I also note that in the past 50 reports on ethics and privileges complaints, only one has not been unanimous. Therefore, I accept retaining an IEPPC in some form to hear breaches of privilege matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019023"></A>
I also accept that it would be preferable for the Committee of the Legislative Assembly to take responsibility for the management, construction and maintenance of the parliamentary buildings and electorate offices, rather than the Department of Public Works. I remind members that for over a century members of parliament had committees such as a parliamentary buildings committee, a library committee, a refreshments committee and a printing committee, which undertook those kinds of responsibilities. Clearly, it is preferable to have a group of parliamentarians continue that function. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019024"></A>
Other recommendations that have caused consternation in some quarters include our proposal to have an opposition member chair the Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee. I am pleased that the government is intending to support that recommendation. There are a number of precedents in other Westminster parliaments for having opposition members chair committees. When I was in the UK I spoke to members of parliament who were genuinely surprised that we did not have that tradition in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021877"></A>
We are asking the government to also consider putting laypeople on the Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee. I note that the House of Commons in the United Kingdom is working to appoint lay members to its Standards and Privileges Committee. The committee chair, Kevin Barron, stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021881"></A>
... I am confident that lay members will bring to the Committee an external perspective that it currently lacks, as well as providing it with greater credibility outside Parliament. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021882"></A>
The report which led to the recommendation of appointing lay members to two parliamentary committees, which is called the <Hansard-Italic>
Twelfth Report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life</Hansard-Italic>
, viewed lay membership as a way to widen the committees’ horizons, increase their experience base and strengthen their legitimacy with the public. Indeed, they were the sentiments behind my committee’s recommendations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021884"></A>
The proposal by the review committee was that the Committee of the Legislative Assembly comprise the Premier, Deputy Premier, Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Leader of the House and Leader of Opposition Business. We expect that the Premier, Deputy Premier and, indeed, the two leaders of the opposition may wish to appoint permanent alternates, but we believe that they have the right to attend the meetings if there are discussions in which they want to participate. The review committee, which included the Independent member for Nanango, did not recommend that there be an Independent member on that committee, nor did it recommend that the Speaker be a member. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021885"></A>
Checks and balances in a Westminster system are designed to avoid undue concentration of authority in a single set of hands. The proposed Committee of the Legislative Assembly shares responsibility for the oversight of the parliamentary buildings and the setting of policies for managing the parliament. We do believe that in the future those decisions should be made by a committee of our peers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021886"></A>
Queensland is probably one of the few places in the world that has adherence to fundamental legislative principles embodied in legislation. These FLPs are important principles, but they are not complex. They are simply a short, non-exhaustive list of rights and liberties which should not be breached in laws. These include things such as ensuring legislation does not reverse the onus of proof without adequate justification, does not confer immunity from prosecution without adequate justification and does not impose obligations retrospectively. These are principles with which every legislator should be familiar. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021887"></A>
Firstly, there is a number of layers already acting as safeguards on FLPs. There is an independent examination from the Office of the Queensland Parliamentary Counsel, acting in an independent capacity, which is required to advise ministers and cabinet on a bill’s consistency with fundamental legislative principles. Secondly, there is the executive, where the Attorney-General advises on all FLP matters on proposed legislation brought before cabinet. Thirdly, we have parliamentary scrutiny. Explanatory notes for bills and significant subordinate legislation are required to be assessed as to their consistency with fundamental legislative principles and, if inconsistent, to state the reasons for it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021888"></A>
The changes that we are proposing will strengthen the level of parliamentary scrutiny of bills. Portfolio committees will be required to undertake the role currently performed by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. I would expect that the portfolio committees will produce Legislation Alerts for their examination of legislation. These committees will be assisted by the staff who currently assist the scrutiny committee and the panel of legal experts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021889"></A>
By having portfolio committees examine any potential breaches of FLPs, those committees can examine in detail the government’s justification for any potential breaches of FLPs. Portfolio committees will also be able to follow up on matters raised in the Legislation Alerts and justification for any potential breaches of FLPs by allowing them to question the minister or departmental officials directly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021890"></A>
One of the strong recommendations in our report is that in future committee reports which are not about legislation should receive some attention and debate in this parliament. I am pleased that we have followed through with that strong recommendation today. I note that there is a rather long list of people who would like to contribute to this debate. I am pleased that all members of parliament are showing such interest in this report and our recommendations. I look forward to hearing the views of my colleagues over the hours ahead. <Hansard-Speech-End>

It is a change that is going to benefit all Queenslanders. Indeed, I think it will make the executive more accountable to this parliament and it will make members more focused on the role of legislator. It will also allow them to be more understanding of their briefs. </A></Hansard-Body>

I start by thanking the chair of the committee, the member for Sunnybank, who did a very good job. Her enthusiasm for the task at hand was without question. Her passion and commitment to bring about this reform deserves to be acknowledged. I say the same with regard to the other members of the committee--opposition, government and Independent--who approached this particular process in an extremely bipartisan way. They took off their partisan hats, looked at the reference given to them by the Premier and set about making significant reforms and recommendations for this parliament for the long term. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021898"></A>
Indeed, the people of Queensland will be the big winners because they will get more from this process. They will have the opportunity to participate in the scrutiny of legislation, to give their views and to provide their expertise. The committee examination process will provide them with a practical overview of the way legislation may affect them and it will allow members of parliament to judge this better. This will result in better legislation coming through this parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021899"></A>
I do not think we necessarily always get good legislation through this parliament. Sometimes legislation is rushed through this parliament. Sometimes, as we have all witnessed, legislation is introduced into this parliament and by the time we debate it a raft of amendments almost as significant as the original bill has been placed on the table. That occurs because the work was not done in the first instance. These reforms will result in increased responsibility for the executive to get it right in the first place. We will see ministers hastening cautiously. Bills, particularly contentious bills or those that relate to major policy matters, will go out for consultation and will be deliberated on by committee members who will have more expertise. They will look at this and feel their worth as members of parliament engaging their communities. This will result in amendments--changes to those bills--which will address many of their concerns. Sometimes governments have been embarrassed to bring back bills to this place for amendment because they did not get it right in the first place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021900"></A>
That is not to say that some sort of bipartisan utopia will be automatically created through this process. There will still be a place for the normal argy-bargy of politics. Everyone understands that we live in an extremely partisan world. Despite the fact that 80 per cent of the legislation and the decisions of this place have unanimous support in this House, in the future there will be issues of contention which will be pursued through that process--and so there should be.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021902"></A>
When the committee as a whole travelled to New Zealand and the chair of the committee and I travelled to Canada, members of parliament, whether they were government, opposition or independent, and members of the community said that this process brought about better legislation and better decision making. Those in opposition did not always agree with the outcome, but they had a better chance to scrutinise it and sometimes achieve amendments which enhanced the operation of the bill around its intent. Whilst we might not necessarily agree with something, sometimes it can be wrong not only in principle--and that can be subjective--but also in its implementation or mechanics. This process allows debate about the principles, which may result in significant change, enhancing the application. That is extremely important as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021903"></A>
I want to thank all of those people involved. I want to thank the people who saw us with such openness and enthusiasm in New Zealand and in the various Canadian jurisdictions. I want to thank all of those people who actually bothered to take the time to put in a submission and to give us their views on how we could make this parliament better for them. I want to also thank the committee staff for the role they played. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024793"></A>
We know about the establishment of the committee and how it came about last year. We operated within our charter. Maybe sometimes we could be accused of going a little broader than that. But we felt that it was important to achieve this once in a lifetime reform--it is not once in a lifetime; it is actually the most significant reform, I believe, since 1922 and possibly one of the most significant reforms going back to when this parliament was established in 1859. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024796"></A>
It is going to completely change the way that we operate. This is going to make members of parliament not only ombudsmen for their electorates but also legislators who are going to be across their brief. If anyone is worried about what this will mean for ministers, if you are a shadow minister you will need to be on your toes as well, because when you go into a parliamentary estimates process you are going to be there for a much longer period of time and so you will need to make sure that you are across your issues as much as the government ministers. I would say that there is justifiably a level of nervousness that will permeate across not only the government but also the opposition about this, and I think that is a very good thing as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024797"></A>
As the chair of the committee said, and I think this is one of the most intriguing things, when we went into the process--and we have to be very careful about talking about the happenings and discussions within the committee, so I am not going to individualise it--we took off our partisan hats and we looked at this with a view to how it could be improved. Ironically, when it came to the issue of establishing the committee, we had opposition members arguing about needing to recognise that a government has a mandate and needs to be able to implement that mandate and we had government members arguing probably more vociferously than opposition members for opposition chairs. That shows the way we approached this particular process. I am probably overstepping--</Hansard-Body>

 We are trying to be kind to you.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024799"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Seeney:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Why is everyone looking at me?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024800"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No-one should think that that reflects on anyone--on the member for Callide or anyone else. I use it as an illustration of the way members of the committee approached this process. They analysed every particular facet--the pros and the cons. I think it is of great credit to the committee that it was able to do that. On that committee we had three former opposition leaders; we had a long-term former minister of the government; we had somebody who is a current serving and very senior minister of the government; we had other very intelligent new members of the government who were enthusiastic about this particular process; and we also had a long-term Independent member. So we had a lot of people on that committee who had an enormous amount of parliamentary experience, and that was alluded to by the chair of the committee. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024802"></A>
The important thing again is that we have had to overlay this on a unicameral parliamentary system. We have heard a lot of people over the years say, ‘The upper house was abolished in 1922. Wouldn’t it be great to bring back an upper house in Queensland?’ That was 1922. It was a long time ago. It was a very, very, very long time ago. We also looked at the issues of the expenses of upper houses in other jurisdictions which could variously be up to $30 million or $40 million. We made a judgement when we were looking at this that, if we have a proper, functioning committee system which is well resourced and takes its role seriously, then this could be an extremely cost-effective way of delivering the scrutiny of legislation and the oversight of the executive which would otherwise be provided by an upper house. I think we can do that far more cost-effectively and we can get a better outcome when it comes to this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024805"></A>
This will be a paradigm shift to the way we approach our operations. I note that in some of the other jurisdictions that we visited--and also the chair of the committee said this a moment ago--in many ways a member of parliament has become little more than a glorified ombudsman. They come in here and ventilate their particular views in this parliament. They look for a piece of legislation on which they can ventilate some sort of community view without necessarily understanding completely what the legislation is about. Certainly from an opposition perspective we look at legislation and think, ‘Gee whiz, we don’t have much time to debate certain things in this place, so what’s this bill? Okay, there is a chance to come in here and raise those things while speaking on that bill.’ Government members stand up and praise the minister and all of those sorts of things, and that is their role. But have any members of the government or the opposition had a practical role in making sure that it is good legislation? No, they have not. I know we have a Scrutiny of Legislation Committee, but a lot of legislation just goes down the line and that is what we get. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024806"></A>
This reform will provide an opportunity for the community and their expertise to come to the fore and will provide an opportunity for non-executive members of the parliament to do what they should do--and that is scrutinise and hold the executive to account. I think it is somewhat ironic that since the 1688 Bill of Rights, which has underpinned the Westminster system of parliament, and the way that it was fought for to engage and to establish the supremacy of the parliament, we have probably seen a watering down of the role of the parliament vis-a-vis the executive. I am not pointing at any one particular party, but that is what has basically happened. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024807"></A>
If we look at the history of the Westminster system and the way our democracy has developed, there were extremely strong checks and balances on the executive through that parliamentary process. Indeed, the role of the parliament has become subordinate and has been subjugated to the interests and what has been the growing power and supremacy of the executive. I am not idealistic enough to say that we can roll all of that back, but this reform provides an opportunity to be able to recapture some of that so that the parliament has a greater role--that is, the non-executive members of the parliament--in ensuring better outcomes with regard to legislation and better checks and balances on the executive of the day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024808"></A>
So what is the role of an MP? We have the role of being an ombudsman in our community. Maybe that is not a bad thing but, more or less, that has become the main role of members in this place. We are an advocate on behalf of our communities. We are a representative and we are a legislator. But how many members in this place could go out there and honestly say, ‘I’m a legislator’? We are members of the Legislative Assembly. The Legislative Assembly makes legislation. The Legislative Assembly makes the laws. The Legislative Assembly lays down the rules and regulations by which our society must function. Yet, if we look at the way things happen, this chamber is a chamber which more or less consents absolutely to what the executive is seeking to do. But this reform will make sure that we get back to the role of being legislators. I will touch on some of those points a little more in a moment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024809"></A>
This committee has recommended the establishment of a Committee of the Legislative Assembly. I know there has been some debate around that, whether that impugns the role of the Speaker and all of those sorts of things. I think the role of the Speaker can be extremely complementary to this committee. I understand--and I will not go there because the chair of the committee has not gone there--that there may be some other considerations around that issue and that the Speaker has concerns in regard to the standing orders. But it is a matter for the government to decide how it will respond to that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024810"></A>
Members of parliament should be in charge of their parliament. The Speaker is a person who makes sure that he or she maintains the order of the parliament and makes sure that the parliament is appropriately refereed without fear or favour. I think we are privileged to have a truly excellent Speaker who does that very well. It is also very important to understand that the Committee of the Legislative Assembly will be involved in laying down and setting the business for the parliament. We understand and we respect--and non-government members of this committee respect--that at the end of the day the government has the numbers. The government can decide. If there is a matter which cannot be resolved through negotiation, the government members have the right to resolve that issue because they are the ones who have been elected to govern. They are the ones who argue that they have a mandate, and they genuinely do have a mandate. Sometimes the term ‘mandate’ is bandied about, but the members opposite have the responsibility of forming the government in this place, and we understand that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024811"></A>
A Committee of the Legislative Assembly will provide an opportunity for a lot of the day-to-day concerns and considerations of members of this House to be properly dealt with. There is a whole range of issues with regard to broad entitlement concerns that members have--the rules by we which we operate with regard to conflicts of interest, our pecuniary interests and all of those sorts of things--and a whole range of other matters that go to the day-to-day running of the House. That is what a Committee of the Legislative Assembly should do. The jurisdictions that we looked at in Canada all variously had a part of that model. It was called a bureau in some places. It was called a house committee in some places. But it was about making sure that the interests of the members were looked after in the parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032145"></A>
Regardless of the hat we wear in this place, we have many common concerns about the way our electorates need to be looked after, how our electorate staff need to be resourced and those sorts of things. There are fundamental things that we all seek to do. There is very little contention when it comes to those things. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032146"></A>
Another recommendation of the committee is the establishment of nine portfolio committees. It will ultimately be up to the government to decide how many portfolio committees it establishes. The only rider I would place is that if there are going to be fewer than nine committees--and I believe there should be nine--we need to make sure that those committees that will have a lot of work to do, particularly those in the areas of health and justice where there is a lot of legislation, do not get loaded up disproportionately. Ultimately that needs to be decided by debate and resolution of this parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032147"></A>
The committee has also made the recommendation that we retain the role of the Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee. We think that is very important. It has an oversight role. That oversight role, given the nature of the CMC, should be handled by a stand-alone committee. There were certain recommendations made about the involvement of lay members on that committee. There were strong reasons given for that. A lay member could provide external expertise from time to time to assist the committee in its deliberations. I certainly hope that is something the government considers, either as part of the adoption of this committee report or in any subsequent introduction of a statutory instrument into this parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032149"></A>
The role of those portfolio committees would be to scrutinise legislation, to scrutinise the expenditure of government and, through the estimates committees, to scrutinise the proposed expenditure for the year. They would also ensure that when it comes to the appointment of statutory officers of this parliament there is greater bipartisanship than exists at the moment. Given the importance of the role of the Ombudsman, the Information Commissioner, the Auditor-General and various other office holders there should be bipartisan support for the selection, approval and appointment of people to those positions. That happens in many jurisdictions overseas. It may indeed happen interstate, but we were given the charter to look at unicameral parliaments, which we have done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032150"></A>
The estimates process is going to be a different process and it should be a different process. The member for Rockhampton would remember a notable quote in this place by a former member for Crows Nest, Russell Cooper, who described the estimates process some years ago--and I will not repeat it. I think we need to reform the estimates process. This recommendation would actually allow the committees to drill down, deal with a lot more of the issues without strict time frames and, ultimately, question senior public servants in Queensland. We are not suggesting that junior public servants be questioned but that senior public servants be questioned. We have made the suggestion that it be DG level and associate DG level. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032151"></A>
At the moment in Queensland we have associate DGs who are in effect DGs because of the superdepartment structure. Within DEEDI, for example, there is an associate DG who is in effect the DG for the primary industries section. Under them we have the SES level. We do not believe that we need to go below the associate DG level, but it is important that we have the ability to question senior public servants in Queensland. I have seen ministers who were prepared and open enough and comfortable enough to allow that in the past, but that has not been readily available to all estimates committees. It should be. I think it is of no detriment to the government if that actually happens. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032153"></A>
If we do this right and bring in the other things that the proposed CLA should look at recommending, it would truncate the time of the House debating things that committees could consider. It would free up more time for members to air issues in parliament on behalf of their constituents. There should be more private members’ time. This proposal would allow more private members’ time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032154"></A>
The other part of the paradigm shift, if these recommendations are formally adopted, would be that committee work would become a main function of this House. Wednesday mornings would be set aside for committee work, as well as Fridays or whenever committees need to meet. I think that is extremely important. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032155"></A>
In order for these committees to function appropriately it will be extremely important to make sure they are well resourced. That is the point that is made over and over again. Let us not squib on that. Let us not be concerned about that, because we do not have an upper house costing us $40 million. If our committees are going to cost us $3 million or $4 million and we get better democracy, better outcomes, better solutions for our communities, then it is worth it and it is value for money. <Hansard-Speech-End>

In my time in this parliament they have never been given a proper airing. I think this is a unique part of the process. </A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1032162"></A>
At the outset I join with the two previous speakers in stating that I have served on a number of committees of this parliament--a long time ago, I guess--but I have never served on a committee with greater intent and integrity than this one. I thank the opposition for putting forward three very senior people--capable people, experienced people who have been around this place for a long time in different roles. Two of them have been ministers. The other is the Leader of Opposition Business. They are very experienced parliamentarians who were able to bring a great deal of wisdom and thought to the process. The Independent member also brought a significant body of strength to the committee. Then there were my Labor colleagues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032163"></A>
We did not always agree, as has been said, but that is the way a committee should work. In my experience, that is how they have worked in the past. When I chaired the public works committee the members did not always agree. Back in those days, the executive government seemed to take a bit more notice than has been the case in the intervening years. I think this report does take us a fair distance down the path of ameliorating the situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032164"></A>
Can I say that I was most surprised that, when the committee report came down, the Speaker actually went public and registered his disapproval with it. I think that was improper. I think it was intemperate. I think it was a discourtesy to the members of the committee. I think we were at least owed the courtesy of putting our case in the parliament rather than have it almost vetoed at the outset by the Speaker. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032165"></A>
As for former Speaker Mr Fouras, I had no respect for him when he was in the chair. He was, as far as I was concerned, the worst Speaker that I have ever sat with in this place. He could not command authority from the chair. I remember him once standing up there saying, ‘I’m standing on my seat.’ He could barely get the prayer right in the morning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032166"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Ms Spence:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 They were the days when books got thrown across the chamber at other members. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032167"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes. I remember the mayhem in here one day when people were throwing things at one another as a result of his incapacity to chair the House. I would discourage anybody from taking seriously anything Mr Fouras had to say, especially when he said that he got rid of the Parliamentary Services Commission. That is in fact not true. Terry Mackenroth was the Leader of the House who got rid of it. That absolute piffle that he wrote for the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 the other day is about as good as we will get from Jim Fouras. Remember of course that he was the person who wanted to sell the seat of the Speaker to the opposition of the day. He did not treasure the independence of the Speaker. What he treasured most was the position that it brought with it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032169"></A>
I know that people have seen this as an attack on the Speaker, but it actually is none of that. This whole business is, in my view, a result of many years of collective change over this parliament. We have almost found ourselves back where we started in 1860. Back then there were committees of members of parliament who ran the functions of the parliament. There was the building committee and the refreshment rooms committee--all those sorts of things that everybody pooh-poohs now. The fact is that the CLA would take over those responsibilities. It would ensure that the management of the parliament is the business of the members of parliament rather than it being the unilateral decision-making process that we have seen with various Speakers over the years which cannot be questioned. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032199"></A>
I hold the very strong view that this building, a heritage building, ought to be maintained by the executive, just the same as every other building in the state. The Department of Public Works has an excellent record at maintaining Government House, for example. The suggestion that somehow or other the Speaker’s independence is compromised by this building being managed by somebody else is a lot of rot actually. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032203"></A>
If you look at the mother of all parliaments, you will see that the land on which the mother of all parliaments stands is owned by the Duke of Westminster. It is a privately owned piece of land for which the Crown has paid rent to the Duke of Westminster since Henry VIII’s time. The Lord Chancellor was, until the 1960s, responsible for that building. So even if you look at the mother of all parliaments, you will find that over its long history for the most part the Crown has had to maintain that building, and so it should here now. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032204"></A>
I can understand that people may have a different view about that, but it has nothing to do whatsoever with the independence of the Speaker and everything to do with ensuring that the responsibility rests squarely with the executive to maintain this building to a standard that meets the current legislation. The public works department has done that. It built it in the first place and there is no reason the public works department cannot continue to do that. I do not believe that having another set of management here for a heritage building, while you do not have that at Government House, is appropriate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032205"></A>
I also want to talk a bit about the estimates processes. I have been through more estimates as a minister than most people in this parliament. I have always from day one viewed the estimates as departmental estimates and I have always encouraged the department to take them very seriously because I did not see them as necessarily my whole responsibility. I saw them as a bit of a spring-cleaning exercise to get people sharpened on their focus of what they were supposed to be doing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032206"></A>
I always welcomed the estimates and I never hesitated to refer questions to public servants, especially those who got paid twice as much as I got paid. I did not see it as a responsibility necessarily that I should bear on my own. I was criticised by the member for Currumbin for doing that but I did it every time and I would still do it if I was a minister because I firmly believe that the bureaucrats in departments have got to take responsibility equally with the minister of the day for some of those estimates that are put forward and for the expenditure of the department. I do not see anything wrong with that at all. In fact, when the report came out, Mal Grierson, the director-general of the public works department, said to me that he had no problem with it because it was the system we had always used and it was a system which the department was very comfortable with. I do not think anybody needs to be concerned about that. As I said, I went through more estimates as a minister than most people in this parliament and I never, ever saw them as anything other than an accountability to this parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032210"></A>
In relation to the committee inquiries, I think I am the only minister who ever referred a matter to the public works committee. I referred two matters actually--one was for housing for aged people and the other was for backflow. Unfortunately, with the backflow one, my own side let me down when two of the Labor members of parliament did not bother showing up for the committee hearing and Kevin Lingard had a field day with me. It was a totally political exercise and I was accused of trying to hide something in the committee system to try to get away from backflow. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032212"></A>
What I was actually trying to do was to get the public servants who had been there previous to me cross-examined to find out exactly what their role was in this backflow, which has now been proved to be fatally flawed and disgracefully executed and something that the public works department should never have been involved in. The people involved in this have since been called down to the courts to give evidence in trials on the basis of them paying money to politicians. The committee did not get to the bottom of that and I think it was a chance lost.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032214"></A>
 The housing one was very successful. It actually proved that the previous model used in funding aged pensioner housing, seniors housing, was flawed. I welcomed that report, but I do not know of anybody else who has done it. So as a minister I see nothing to be afraid of in that regard. In fact, I see a lot of things to be gained out of a committee investigating matters that the government is considering. Let us take the snapper review at the moment, for example. I think the parliament would be better informed if scientists came before a parliamentary committee and actually put their case. At the moment, people are questioned about whether the science is right, wrong or indifferent. I think the parliament would be able to form a much better view on this very touchy issue that has aroused so much concern in the community if the committee system looked at this in a proper way. If that happened, the public might better understand the need to protect this species. That is just one example. There are plenty of others. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032215"></A>
I would have liked to have forwarded the whole health payroll issue to a parliamentary committee because I do not believe the people who sat around that table and made those decisions to send it up and go live put the right attention into it. I do not believe the contract was right. There are a whole host of things that could have been looked into in that regard. That could have been a due process of the parliament, rather than it being politicised through question time each morning. I do not think the parliament was well served by that process at all.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032216"></A>
This is going to cost money--there is no risk about that--and the public needs to understand that if they want a greater democracy. They have got out of it on the cheap because we have not had an upper house since 1922. I doubt they could ever be convinced that they need another heap of politicians in an upper house up the road here scrutinising this place just because of the cost alone. This is going to cost a lot of money over a long period of time, and so it should. That is one of the reasons that I do not believe the Speaker has the role in advocating for funds for this parliament. I think it is far too easy for the executive government to ignore the Speaker, and I have seen that happen from both sides. I remember Speaker Turner picking up rocks over here that were falling off the annexe and taking them up to plead for money with Treasury. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I think he might have been throwing them by the time he got up there; he was pretty angry about it. He was reduced to that indignity. The CBRC is a place where ministers go, and I believe that the ministers who will sit at the helm of the CLA will have some accountability in that regard. I think that is part of the process that we need to explain to people. Everyone is terrified of spending a dollar on this place lest the public out there think we have got our snouts in the trough. The public have got to understand that this place is their place and that any move to diminish this place by a lack of expenditure is at their expense. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032220"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is our most important heritage building for a start. I think we have been too timid in putting forward what we really need to do in terms of restructuring this place. In relation to committee rooms, I am sure the reason we do not have committee rooms is that we are frightened of what people will say when we have the expense of more committee rooms, even though it would allow them to come in and use this parliament. I think we can get that message out to people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032221"></A>
At the moment, this could not come at a worse time because of the financial strain on the public purse, but over a period of years we need to make this commitment and in the meantime we need to find alternatives. There are plenty of alternatives for committee rooms and so on in public buildings that are near this place. I see no reason why we should not go down that whole process of determining the proper priority that this place will have.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032222"></A>
Parliament House is a function centre. You can barely get around parliament sometimes because of the number of people who are using rooms that used to be for the media or the room that once held a large temporary chamber that was an ideal committee room. That has vanished and it has become a function room. That decision was made with no consultation whatsoever with members of this parliament. The renaming of those rooms was made with no consultation with any member of this parliament. The destruction of the media room, as I understand it, was not made with any consultation with the media or with members of this House. Those decisions have been unilaterally made.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032223"></A>
The fundamentals of this place are quite simple--that is, it is supposed to be the people’s place, it is supposed to be the parliament, but we shy away from ever wanting to spend any money on making it a place which the public will get more benefit from. This system will give the public and the executive government, in my view, greater transparency and as a result greater strength.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032259"></A>
As I sat around that table with all of the people I mentioned, I saw nothing in any of this that did not create a better outcome for government, for the parliament and for the members of parliament who serve in it. I saw nothing that did not have a greater vision of legislation that comes before this place. As a former minister I have not put through as much legislation as the member for Sunnybank, but I have put a fair bit through over a lengthy period of time. Some of it was profound stuff in the building industry. I know that that legislation would have been served better by having stakeholders in this parliament going through it. Through people having an opportunity to have had their say on the legislation, it would have benefited me greatly--and all of that legislation on building that has gone through this parliament unanimously I might add. But it would have been done better, especially in recent times, to have had a process that helped elevate that legislation in the minds of the public through a process like this.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032265"></A>
When I overhauled the Housing Act--I totally revised the Housing Act after 60 years--it was a dramatic piece of legislation. Again, I relied on stakeholders that I knew about to consult with, but there really was not a public process for it and I am sure we could have done that better. So there is nothing to be frightened of from a minister’s point of view in terms of legislation, because it is of great embarrassment to a minister when they have to bring legislation back into the parliament and have it amended. I have had to do that. I think most ministers have had to do that. That is not a minister’s fault. That is simply a process that goes through Parliamentary Counsel. In fact, the Housing Act was so complicated that it was bound to happen. But it might have happened to a lesser degree by having some better scrutiny throughout the process.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032268"></A>
I see this as a red-letter day today. I urge the commentators out there to look a bit further into this than simply dismiss it, as I have seen some of the academics do. I noticed Fouras referring to it as a Trojan horse and how it would give the executive more power. I do not know how putting the most senior people in opposition in a management committee of this parliament gives the executive more power! I fail to understand that and it shows how out of touch Fouras really is.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 He never understood and he never respected the parliament in my view. He just saw it as a creature or a plaything for himself. I actually believe that the CLA is a way forward. It should not be confused with the Parliamentary Service Commission. That did not work because the Speaker and the Leader of the House were on it, so there was an immediate conflict. This way will provide absolute clarity between what the role of the Speaker is and what the role of the management of the business of the parliament is.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032278"></A>
For my last little effort, I think it is time we looked at the independence of the Speaker. I think the people whose electorate elects a Speaker are pretty well denied a voice in this parliament. The Westminster system is worse because it disempowers people because they do not get an opposition person to run against them, so their vote is worthless. I think that in the next 10 years we ought to be talking about how you get an independent person who is not a member of parliament to be the Speaker. There would be a howl if the Broncos suddenly put on the ref as one of their own, and that is effectively what the government of the day does. It is always hard for a Speaker to sit in that chair, but I congratulate the current Speaker on the way he manages this parliament. It is excellent. He gives everybody a fair go. Nobody could complain about that at all. With regard to every member of parliament who is ever going to be a Speaker--and I do not suggest for a moment it should be an Independent person because they are no more impartial than anybody else; they are an elected member--I think it is time that we looked at other possibilities and be the first parliament in the world to have a non-elected Speaker. You could have a former member. You would not have Fouras of course. There might be former members who have nothing better to do with their time who want to do it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032293"></A>
I would happily have Turner there. He was a very good Speaker I thought, and the current one also. I really think it is worth the debate and I think it is something we should turn our attention to. This is groundbreaking stuff. I will not be here to see the effects of this, but I will certainly be looking very carefully at it over the next few years.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Like all state planning policies, the SPP has effect when development applications are assessed and when planning schemes are made or amended by local governments. SPP 1/03 states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044015"></A>
A natural hazard management area (flood) is land inundated by a Defined Flood Event (DFE) and identified in a planning scheme. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044016"></A>
I refer to page 8 of that document. Let me say that again to be clear: SPP 1/03 requires that local governments identify natural hazard flood areas in their planning schemes and put in place mitigation strategies. That is at page 9. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044017"></A>
A 10-year review of SPP 1/03, which, of course, is due to be done by 2013, is now underway and is being led by the Department of Community Safety. The timetable for this review is to be aligned to benefit from the work of the floods commission of inquiry. The associated guidelines for SPP 1/03 include procedural advice for local governments in identifying natural hazard management areas--flood.

According to these guidelines, natural hazard areas should be determined from a comprehensive flood plain management study based on--and I quote from page 33 of the guideline--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044022"></A>
... the process outlined in <Hansard-Italic>
Floodplain Management in Australia: Best Practice Principles and Guidelines</Hansard-Italic>
 (the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Resource Management (SCARM) Report). </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044023"></A>
The standing committee guideline does suggest the establishment of a local flood plain advisory committee as one step in the process, but it also notes that the full SCARM process can be time consuming and expensive and it may be beyond the capacity or needs of some local governments, particularly those with low growth and a low rate base. It says that at page 33 of the guideline.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044024"></A>
The guidelines also outline the process for local governments when they are undertaking flood studies to inform the identification of a natural hazard management area--flood. So it is a local government matter.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044025"></A>
As I said in my earlier response, this is the key point. Defining the flood line is properly the role of local government and this is, for example, exactly what the Brisbane City Council has done. As members would be aware, the BCC has now, in fact, also commenced a process to increase the height of their planning flood line. The Lord Mayor’s joint flood task force’s report, released yesterday, highlighted the fact that local government has responsibility for these matters. The report states at page 17--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044027"></A>
The State Planning Policy 1/03 states the Queensland Government’s default position is that the 1% Annual Exceedance Probability ... flood or Q100 is generally suitable as the DFE--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1044028"></A>
that is, defined flood event--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1044030"></A>
for a Local Government. However, there is a provision to allow a Local Government to define the DFE as higher than the Q100. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044031"></A>
If local government wishes to establish a local flood advisory committee, as suggested by the SCARM guidelines, that is its prerogative. If it wishes to define a higher DFE, that is its prerogative. But SPP 1/03 places a clear obligation on local government to ensure that planning schemes appropriately manage and mitigate the risk of flood hazards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044032"></A>
The LNP has traditionally opposed state intervention in local government planning matters, but clearly the member for Lockyer seems to be supporting a greater role for the state in overriding councils. I look forward with interest to the views of local governments and the LGAQ and, most importantly, the findings of the royal commission in this matter. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110309_143458" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for Reconstruction) (2.34 pm): It is a pleasure to have an opportunity to speak in this debate on the consideration of the review by the committee that was established by this parliament last year to consider the operation of our committee system. This process was born out of our government’s determination to ensure that we have the highest standards of accountability and integrity. </A></Hansard-Body>

There was a substantial debate about these issues during mid-2009, during which time there was some discussion about whether or not Queensland should reconsider the establishment of an upper house, as prevails in the other state parliaments of Australia. At that time a public discussion paper was issued and there was no real substantial support for the idea of the reinstitution of an upper house in Queensland. Nevertheless, a number of commentators made the astute observation that in a unicameral system there is an even higher obligation on the parliament to ensure it has the appropriate checks and balances in place to ensure checks and balances on the executive of government and to ensure the rigorous processes of the legislature. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044044"></A>
There was a recognition by the government that our committee system had become perhaps less than it could be in relation to modern parliamentary processes, so we charged a bipartisan committee of this parliament with the task of going and having a look at other parliaments in the Westminster system--in Australia, in New Zealand, which is a unicameral system, and in other relevant jurisdictions. I am conscious that systems in both the UK and Canada were visited and were part of what informed this committee’s report. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044045"></A>
I would like to congratulate every member of the committee and thank them for not only the hard work that they did--and I think we expect them to do that when we appoint them to these jobs--but also particularly two things: the truly bipartisan attitude that they brought to the task and a recognition that what we were doing was a root-and-branch reform that should stand the test of time, that should withstand changes of government and, therefore, should only be put forward if it enjoyed some bipartisan endorsement. I understand that there was a great deal of genuine debate in the committee meetings that were not conducted along party lines but were genuine attempts to find the appropriate way forward for our parliament and its unique circumstances. So I thank the committee members for that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157529"></A>
I also thank them for rising to what I think was a challenge that I set for them. I did not want a report of a review that recommended simply tinkering around the edges. I challenged the committee to think big, to see this as an opportunity. In the same way as this parliament a century ago was having spirited debates about whether or not an upper house was necessary, we should be having an equally challenging debate about how we can best ensure an appropriate system of committees in our parliament--not as a replacement of an upper house but to play some of those roles in a very effective way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044047"></A>
So we have before us this report of the committee, very ably led by the chair, the Leader of the House, Judy Spence. I thank Judy for the work she has done and I thank each and every member of the committee, because I do believe that there has been a very genuine effort made. I have seen a lot of committee reports in my time and they have all had varying degrees of merit, but I would have to say that I think this is one of the best reports of any committee that I have seen in a very long time. I think that speaks to the diligence with which people applied themselves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046864"></A>
I would like to turn now to some of the major components and recommendations. I hope to be able to table the interim government response during my contribution, but at this stage I will refer to the major architectural changes that have been recommended and outline the government’s view in relation to them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046865"></A>
Firstly, the report proposes to establish a Committee of the Legislative Assembly. This would be an all-party bipartisan committee that would provide for a number of new roles to be undertaken by the parliament itself. They are not new roles, but new roles for this committee to undertake. It would be a committee that would have oversight and responsibility for the governance of the parliament, not just when the parliament is sitting but the running of certain components of the parliament. So it is proposed, and the government supports, that this committee would have responsibility to determine the business of the House, the weekly business of debate times et cetera, and it would also have oversight of the standing orders of the parliament. It is not proposed by the committee, and nor does the government support, that the Speaker should be a member of the committee, although the government’s view is that the Speaker should be identified as an ex-officio member of the committee whenever it considers standing orders. I understand that everyone would be in agreement with that. It is also proposed that the committee would have responsibility for overseeing the operation of all of the committees, their resourcing and the facilities that might be made available to them. The government supports that as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046866"></A>
Finally, it is proposed by the committee that this Committee of the Legislative Assembly should also take on the role of overseeing the matters that are currently undertaken by the committee for integrity, ethics and privileges. That committee undertakes a variety of functions. One very clear function is to consider complaints of a breach of privilege against a member of the House. The other major function of that committee is to consider broader matters of parliamentary entitlements and integrity related issues such as the register of interests and matters pertaining to it. It is the government’s view that that broader role can amply be undertaken by the Committee of the Legislative Assembly, but that the specific role of hearing and determining complaints of a matter of breach of privilege would not appropriately sit with this committee largely because many of the people on it are likely to be the ones most often referred for these matters given that there is a little bit of politics on these issues.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046867"></A>
The government does not have a firm view on how that could be managed adequately and is referring to the Committee of the Legislative Assembly for further consideration the issue of how we can best ensure that we have a very robust system by which we can determine complaints against a member in relation to a breach of privilege. Having indicated that sometimes those things can be done for political purposes and have from time to time been frivolous, I think we would all acknowledge that when they are serious they are very, very serious. We have had a couple of those in recent years. I do think we have a long and well-established tradition that that committee hears those matters on a very strict bipartisan basis and the reports of those committees by and large enjoy the confidence of the House and we would want that to continue. The government will be referring that question back to the Committee of the Legislative Assembly for some further consideration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046868"></A>
Secondly, the committee basically recommends the abolition of almost all of the other committees of the parliament and their replacement with a series of portfolio committees, although it does recommend, and the government supports the recommendation, that we retain the Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee. In relation to portfolio committees, the government endorses the recommendations that we should have a series of portfolio committees. The recommendations from the review indicate their view that there should be nine. The government has reserved its position on the number and the areas of responsibility while we look through the whole of the budget implications of that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046869"></A>
But in terms of the intent of the committee’s recommendations, the government supports the view that we should replace our existing committees with portfolio committees and that those portfolio committees should have three major functions: firstly, they should examine legislation within the portfolios for which they have responsibility, they should examine that legislation thoroughly between the introduction of a bill and prior to its second reading and they should not just be examining it in depth in relation to scrutiny of legislation matters and fundamental legislative principles. The government’s view is that these committees should be required by the standing orders in every bill that they examine to report on FLPs but, secondly, they should look beyond FLPs and examine the merits, the impacts and the public issues surrounding the bill. It is proposed that the committees will be entitled to have public hearings on legislation and that members of the public can make submissions to these committees about the legislation. It is my view that this will lead to better legislation being considered in the parliament and that will be a good thing for the people of Queensland. I will come back to that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046870"></A>
Secondly, it is proposed that these committees should take over, for the portfolios for which they are responsible, the current role of the Public Accounts and Public Works Committee--that is, they should examine projects of public works and public accounts within whatever portfolio they have, and the government supports that proposal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046871"></A>
Thirdly, it is proposed that these committees be charged with the responsibility of conducting estimates hearings in the portfolio areas for which they are responsible, and the government supports that proposal as well. The government also supports the proposal that during estimates committee hearings senior public servants should be able to be questioned directly by all members of the committee. However, we do acknowledge that this is a significant change for our Public Service, and we propose that in the first instance that be restricted to the right to directly question CEOs and statutory office holders within the portfolio. That is something that the government would be prepared to consider further after this year’s estimates. I am not saying we would not consider going further down the line, if you like; it is just that, given that this is a significant shift, we think it is better to stage its introduction. The CEOs and statutory officers are the accountable officers for the budgets of the portfolios for which they are responsible, so it is only reasonable that the committee should have some opportunity to question them directly. We do make the point, however, and I understand this would be accepted by the committee, that in all jurisdictions where this occurs there are very strict provisions that it is not the role of a public servant to make comment on the merits or otherwise of a policy or a program. That is a matter for a minister. Any public servant should be able to decline to answer something that is seeking an opinion from them on the merits or otherwise of a government policy. They are there to answer factual questions related to the budget papers and the operation of the organisation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046872"></A>
They are the three main roles that the government believes are being proposed for the portfolio committees, and we endorse that. There is a fourth proposition in the committee report that indicates these committees should also be able to undertake investigations within their portfolio areas of any events, incidents et cetera. The government has indicated in its interim response that we accept this in principle, but we do think there are issues that we will be referring to the Committee of the Legislative Assembly for further consideration before we move to implement it. I am referring to broader questions about how we would ensure that people, for example, cannot go forum shopping--that is, they have a matter considered by the CMC, they have it considered by the health complaints tribunal or the ombudsman and at the same time they want a parliamentary committee to consider it. There are a range of statutory provisions that this parliament has put in place over a long period of time under different sides of politics that establish appropriate complaint mechanisms. The parliamentary committee should not be seen as an alternative or a duplication of those. We would want to see how we might ensure that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046873"></A>
Equally, I think further consideration needs to be given to whether or not these committees would ever look into individual or personal cases, for example, and what sort of privacy issues there are and how we would protect the privacy of individuals in those circumstances. I think there is some more thinking and work to be done and we will refer that to the committee but, as I say, we are supporting it in principle. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046874"></A>
It is proposed that the committees will have a significantly bigger role than they have now in the day-to-day operations of this House. If the committees are not doing their work and doing it on time, then the legislation will not be coming back into the House. So we need to recognise and accommodate the time that it will take for committees to do their job properly. To that end, it is proposed to change the standing orders to allow for a specific session on Wednesday mornings for committees to meet, to have public hearings and to do their work. The government will be supporting those proposed changes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046875"></A>
Equally, given that bills will now be considered in much more detail and in a much more public way prior to coming back to the House for second reading debate, it is proposed by the committee that there be some constraints put on the speaking times of members of all sides of the chamber in the second reading debate. The government supports that recommendation as well. There are a number of other recommendations that I will not go through in detail. I think they are the major ones that the government either supports or where we are proposing a change or further work that I have tried to outline.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046904"></A>
I will conclude by making some broader comments. What this report is asking of us, as legislators and parliamentarians, goes far beyond making changes to the legislation that governs the parliament, or the standing or sessional orders. It is asking for a significant cultural shift. It is asking us to do things in a very different way. I will be honest and say that for those of us in government that is a very confronting challenge. However, when I look at the recommendations, even those that give me cause for nervousness, I see that they operate very functionally in other parliaments, that this is considered the norm in other parliaments, and that other parliaments would be surprised that significant pieces of legislation are not the subject of public hearings or public debate. We need challenge ourselves to rise to that and to meet it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046907"></A>
However, this system will stand or fall on the ability of people on all sides of the chamber to move to that different culture. For example, a bill goes to one of the committees. It passes through the process of a public hearing and debate within the committee. Amendments are proposed and the government agrees to accept those amendments--and I am talking about any government. If that process comes to be seen as a huge political point-scoring exercise rather than a value-adding improvement to something that matters to the people we represent, I predict that over time any government would start to walk away from accepting such amendments. I do not believe that that is the intention of the committee. Therefore, some of this is about changes to the standing orders and some of it is about changes to the legislation, but beyond all of that it is about changing us. It is about changing the culture of how we think bills should proceed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046908"></A>
In every parliament it is inevitable that things will get adversarial a lot of the time. It is inevitable that there will be robust debate. However, it is fair to observe that other parliaments in Australia manage legislation in a much more collegial way. Some of the adversarial nature is exacerbated in a unicameral system where the government and the Leader of the Opposition inevitably go head to head every day at times like question time. In contrast, in the Senate, for example, a lot of the work is much more likely to be done through committees and long-term political relationships develop around a legislative process. This gives us the opportunity to do some of that. I would hate to think that we could put all of the structures in place without taking the opportunity to change culture. If that were to happen, all of the hard work of this committee will have been for nothing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046910"></A>
We saw exactly the same zeal for reform when our current committee system was put in place in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a result of Fitzgerald, the reforms of EARC and the Goss government, and other political processes. They were equally motivated by a desire to ensure a parliamentary system that had a thriving and robust committee system that involved members of parliament from all sides of politics in a very rigorous legislative process, resulting in legislation that better matched the needs of the people who are represented in this chamber. It is also fair to say--and I think the committee report says this between the lines, if not explicitly--that some of the early hopes for our current committee system have not always been realised. This is another opportunity for us to realise them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046911"></A>
I conclude my remarks by again thanking all members of the committee. I particularly acknowledge the work of the chair, Judy Spence. This would not have been the report that it is if all members had not applied themselves with their considerable experience. I was not able to listen to the contribution of the Leader of the House--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Down>
Ms Spence:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Over 130 years experience.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046913"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would have been surprised if she did not take another opportunity to mention that between them they had 130 years of parliamentary experience. That is important and I think it shows through in this report. It is a thoughtful and careful report. A good functioning and rigorous committee system, as we see in other parliaments of Australia and other jurisdictions of the Westminster system, will only survive if it is actively engaged in by both the government and the opposition. They do not change every time there is a change of government. They persist and they last the test of time, regardless of who is on what side of the chamber. That will be the test of these reforms. Now we are looking back on the reforms of EARC. In two decades time when we look back on these reforms, if they meet the test that the committee is setting for all of us, they will still be operational and they will still be regarded as strong and robust checks and balances on the government of the day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046914"></A>
With those few words, I commend the report. For the benefit of the House, I table the interim government response. As I have indicated, there are a number of parts of this that the government is giving further consideration to. As members would expect, those are matters of a budgetary nature and some issues that we are referring back to the CLA. </Hansard-Body>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110309_145448" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Waterford--ALP) (2.54 pm): It was a great privilege, throughout much of 2010, to join the chair of this committee, Judy Spence, and my fellow members in exploring the opportunities to improve the democratic processes of government in Queensland. Unfortunately, democracy has a sad history in Queensland. When this parliament first began, obviously there was limited franchise with no votes for women and no votes for the first Queenslanders, the Indigenous Australians. I think that we should be careful about suggesting that the legislative council, which was abolished in 1922, was some sort of bastion of democracy and accountability. It was of a very limited franchise and did a great deal to frustrate a reformist government, which had majority support in the lower house. Since the 1922 reforms, the state has taken on a winner-takes-all approach. Between elections, this place and our committee processes have not been as good as they could have been in ensuring robust debate and strong accountability of government. </A></Hansard-Body>

When I was looking at the history of Queensland, I found a great quote about what parliament should be. With the indulgence of members, I will take a little time to read it. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1046925"></A>
Parliament is meant to be the forum in which the necessity and worth of proposed laws, including those raising revenue and appropriating funds, can be debated. It should also serve as an inquest in which all or any aspects of public administration can be raised. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1046926"></A>
The effect of modern practice is that the law is shaped outside Parliament. Ministers present bills to the Parliament which are the products of resolution in Cabinet and sometimes the Government party room (or both). Similarly, policy on executive and administrative matters is largely formed and developed outside Parliament. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1046927"></A>
Laws and policies often address highly complex matters. Formulating them requires expertise. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1046928"></A>
No Government will have all the ideas, expertise and insight on any particular topic. As well, Governments are not the only bodies which have these attributes. Whatever the expertise required, the solution to any problem is something about which people can and do reasonably differ. The best result will be produced from rational debate by those with opposing views. The community is entitled to such a result. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1046929"></A>
That is a quote from the 1989 Fitzgerald report, commenting on what the parliament should be. Unfortunately, that report also commented on how parlous the state of parliamentary democracy was in Queensland, as the state was run by the executive with limited accountability to the parliament. This committee report is based on much hard work by its members. I believe that that concise statement from Fitzgerald is the underlying principle of the final committee report. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046930"></A>
The committee’s report is based on the principle that the openness of debate and the opportunity for public participation provide not only a democratic process but also good outcomes. They provide good government for the people of Queensland. Like many other parliaments, for decades we have struggled with the issue of executive dominance of the legislature. This proposal empowers the parliament, particularly those members who are not part of the government front bench--the government and non-government backbenchers, including the Independents--to examine the government, its budgets and its legislation. It also gives backbenchers the chance to contribute their expertise. To think that government is a repository of all knowledge is short-sighted. We should be taking advantage of the vast experience and diverse backgrounds of the people who are elected to this place. That is what the reforms in this report will do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050020"></A>
However, that of itself is not enough. We should be very careful that we do not get caught up in thinking that changing the structure is enough. Democracy will only be improved, and good government will only result, when people care about the parliamentary process. We need the people who elect us to care about the debates we have in this place and we need to ensure that what we are discussing is relevant to them. I do not think the answer is to install more politicians to oversee other politicians. The answer is to create a right of participation for Queenslanders through a committee process. This process gives every Queenslander the right to make a submission to the parliamentary process and contribute to the legislation of this state. It also brings issues into the public domain and ensures they are discussed in a transparent way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050021"></A>
When the committee travelled to New Zealand, what struck me more than anything else was the fact that the political culture in New Zealand accepted that parliamentary committees would provide the public with a right to participate in these processes. The members of parliament to whom we spoke said that, even though they have a unicameral legislature, the people of New Zealand would be outraged if their right to participate in the process was taken away. We in Queensland need to have that culture whereby the people are outraged when the debate in this place is shut down. Unfortunately, the history of our state has not shown that to be the case. We do need to make sure we can harness the ideas and expertise of all Queenslanders, but that requires a culture in which that input is valued. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050022"></A>
These reforms require a brave government to implement them. For years executive governments have avoided a process such as this because, in essence, it provides a higher bar for government in this state, particularly when it comes to the question of whether committees should be able to investigate events and incidents. In the long run, we must put our short-term political ambitions aside and say that this process will deliver better government for Queensland and will mean that we can continue to ensure that people have faith in our parliamentary process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050023"></A>
Of course, when we talk about issues like the investigation of events and incidents, we do need to realise that these processes do not occur in a vacuum and there must be balance--a balance with the resources of committees and a balance between the competing priorities of committees. I am sure some people will ask the committees to examine their individual circumstances. The committees that I have been involved in have seen that situation occur on a number of occasions. If there are more appropriate processes, they should be followed. If committee processes and investigations can shine light where light has not been shone previously, that is something they should do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050024"></A>
The Leader of the House described this reform as evolutionary, and I think that is true. This is the next stage of what Fitzgerald envisioned about an empowered parliament. We even saw a process such as this proposed by EARC in the early 1990s. At the time the Queensland parliament was not ready for a committee system that provided such a robust debate as we have now. I am glad to see that our parliamentary process and government have matured since the days of Bjelke-Petersen and Fitzgerald and we are now in a position to deliver Fitzgerald’s vision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050025"></A>
I do want to address some of the concerns raised in the public debate about the proposal that the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee no longer be a stand-alone committee. I participated in the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee in my first term of parliament. It was something I thoroughly enjoyed and thought made a very important contribution to this place. The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee has always been restrained by the fact that its consideration of fundamental legislative principles has been divorced from the policy consideration of the bill. This process will make every committee responsible for those scrutiny of legislation responsibilities. It will ensure that those fundamental legislative principles are considered in the light of the actual policy outcomes proposed by the bill rather than this process that we have had for many years with scrutiny reports where the committee decision was that the matter be referred to the parliament for consideration. The allegation was always, yes, the fundamental legislative principle has been breached but it is justified in the circumstances. In the past it has been only parliament that could consider whether those FLP breaches were justified. Now, putting the two processes together gives more weight to those fundamental legislative principles, not less. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050028"></A>
The other particular matter I would like to raise is an opportunity for reform in the future, and that is in relation to the estimates process. In the New Zealand parliament the estimates process has two distinct parts: a process of examining budgetary estimates to consider how budgetary priorities have been determined and how the expenditure for the coming year was considered; and a separate process of examining the annual reports of departments and going over with a fine toothcomb what happened over the previous year, how the money was spent and what the outcomes were. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050029"></A>
At the moment, both of those functions are rolled into one process. That has meant that the estimates debate has revolved entirely around exploring the past actions in minute detail and there has been no consideration of the expenditure for the year going forward. The process should be that we come to the estimates process in July and say, ‘Minister, why did you decide to fund the road upgrade in my electorate rather than the road upgrade in the neighbouring electorate?’ and determine those priorities. Then we can come back later and say, ‘You said you would deliver this but you did not.’ At the moment we only undertake that latter consideration and not the former. I hope that is something that can be considered once this process is in train and we have developed that stronger culture of estimates processes. It is an important role. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050030"></A>
The other specific element that I want to consider is the recommendation from the committee that the Auditor-General be given an opportunity to assist the committees in their consideration of estimates. I think that is an important one. The Queensland Audit Office does take the fine toothcomb approach. Its officers are the people who can advise committees where to start their examination of what are quite detailed budget estimates. I understand that the government response would be to support that where there is an Auditor-General report in place. I think that is a great move, and I think the Audit Office has the ability to get that detail so that members have the resources at their fingertips to ensure government is held accountable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050031"></A>
I thank the other members of the committee, particularly the chair and those members on that committee who have been able to put aside the political machinations of this place and put in its place a consideration of what is good for democracy in Queensland but what is also good for better government of the people we represent. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110309_150804" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition) (3.07 pm): It is my pleasure to rise to speak to this committee report on the review of the parliamentary committee system. I note the contribution of the member for Waterford and all the contributions of members of the committee. I understand that this process was conducted in great spirit, with a genuine interest in reforming the parliamentary committee system, which is something that is certainly long overdue and which should hold the executive to account. </A></Hansard-Body>

Looking at the experience of the three members of the opposition who served on this committee, I note that we put very experienced members on it. The members for Toowoomba South, Callide and Southern Downs have contributed over 50 years in combined parliamentary service. I know that, on the government side, the Leader of the House, the former Minister for Public Works and the member for Yeerongpilly--and the Independent member for Nanango--also contribute a significant amount of experience. There was a genuine attempt, which has obviously been achieved, to come up with a better system to show that we do believe in open and transparent government--the LNP certainly does--that is accountable to the parliament and the people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052920"></A>
We welcome the review. I know that since it was first put into the public arena there have been significant issues that have been publicly aired. We support the recommendations. I know that there have been issues with the present Speaker, who has raised his concerns. Whilst he was criticised today in the contribution of the member for Rockhampton, I think it is interesting that consideration is being given to changing some of the recommendations in relation to which the Speaker has expressed concern. I think it is only fair that the Speaker should have been able to express those concerns and issues about the standing orders and their application and whether he should have some sort of input in that respect and also the issue of the maintenance of the parliamentary precinct. It was disappointing to hear the contribution of the member for Rockhampton--one of the most experienced members in this place. I see him scuttling back to his chair now. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052923"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Schwarten:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Absolutely. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052924"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Here he comes. I am happy to take it, because let us have a look at some of the things the member for Rockhampton had to say in that charming contribution just before lunch. The former member for Ashgrove was in his last term when I came here. You can only take people as you find them. All I know is that when I expressed an interest in the standing orders the former Speaker, the then member for Ashgrove, was happy to impart some of his knowledge to me. The point is that when Jim Fouras made his contribution in the paper the other day it certainly led to some issues that have been addressed or will be addressed by the government in considering what they are going to do with the recommendations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052927"></A>
It does not add anything to the debate to have a former minister of the Crown now on the back bench carrying on like that and making reflections on the current Speaker. It needs to be said that the former minister’s contribution, the member for Rockhampton’s contribution, before lunch was a disgrace. It was a disgrace from a long-serving member of this parliament. Someone should tell the member for Rockhampton that Sir Les Patterson was a caricature, not a model for how you conduct yourself in public life. In his contribution he was having a go at the present Speaker and former Speakers because of some sort of bias and anger he has about things that happened in times long gone. He should put that behind him when we are looking at a committee like this that has made recommendations for the future of our parliament--long after he and I will be gone.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052928"></A>
We saw contempt of the parliament shown by this former minister just last sitting week when the business of the House was suspended so that the then minister could come in here and give a valedictory. We have seen the erosion of parliamentary powers, and it is important that parliamentary committees are given authority in this place and have more powers, as we are going to see, so that members can appreciate their importance in our parliamentary system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052930"></A>
I note that committee members were unanimous in stating that ‘our present committee structure is under resourced, does not have sufficient influence over the executive of government, does not receive sufficient attention in the parliament and is largely unknown to the majority of Queenslanders’. That is a damning indictment from a bipartisan committee. In a unicameral system--one of course given to us by the Labor Party as a result of it having abolished the upper house--a strong parliamentary committee system provides a much needed check on unilateral actions by the executive. I think that many people are concerned at the number of MPs who are part of the executive and that leaves fewer to independently represent the community. This community has doubled in number since the last increase in the number of MPs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052931"></A>
Let us have a look at Labor’s track record. It does seem that the Beattie and Bligh Labor governments have set out to deliberately dilute committee powers. In the process they have effectively eroded the integrity of the committee system. I have served on the public accounts committee and it was a privilege to do so. It gave me an insight into many of the issues of the Auditor-General, but the democratic process has not been accorded the respect that it should have been in Queensland. Members have spoken in here before about the estimates committees, which have been described as a farce. Even the member for Waterford in his contribution just now acknowledged that they could be improved. We know that estimates committees have provided only a token opportunity for investigation. I have sat on those estimates committees and have seen that those reports and proceedings are soaked in layers of government self-justification and back patting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052935"></A>
The former member for Waterford, who was the minister for industrial relations at my first estimates committee, did not answer questions. We had very little ability to cross-examine or none at all, and half of the time available was allocated to government Dorothy Dixers. A great example of that is following the sale of Queensland Rail only 15 minutes were allocated to opposition members for questioning the Minister for Transport on this matter. In reality, even less was available as the shadow minister was thrown out by the committee chair. The reason was that she dared to try to press the minister to actually answer her questions. It was a disgrace that such a major government decision--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr O’BRIEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to a point of order. I was the chair of that committee. I find the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition offensive and I ask that he withdraw them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052939"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>

(Ms van Litsenburg): Order! Will the member withdraw. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052940"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask for your ruling as to whether that is a personal reflection. I made no reflection on the chair of that committee.</Hansard-Body>

Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Order! Will the member resume his seat. I ask the member to withdraw his statement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052943"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I withdraw. It is a disgrace that such a major government decision--one which the current government deliberately did not disclose during the last election--was not subject to cross-examination. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052944"></A>
Time and time again we have seen major legislation introduced into this House and debated without in-depth consideration by an appropriately resourced committee. The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee has attempted to perform a difficult job well, but the limited time and powers to properly consider complex legislation has hampered its performance. Those on the other side of the House should hang their heads in shame. They should hang their heads in shame for their continued trampling of open and accountable government. This review has shown that the committee system is not just failing; it has failed. It has become too dominated by the government, too remote from the public and representative groups, too limited in their use and too restricted in reference and powers. The time is long overdue for reform. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052946"></A>
So let us have a look at some of the committee recommendations. The LNP is committed to real transparency in our democratic system. We welcome the recommendations of the Committee System Review Committee. It is a pity that the government has only moved to restored the parliamentary committee system now, but we support a rejuvenated committee system. I know that the former leader has always asked for more rigorous estimates processes and other reforms that until now have never been considered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052947"></A>
We also need a committee system that has the ability and powers to investigate issues in more detail than can be accommodated here in the House. Committees should allow the opening up of important topics to wider consultation and input through submissions and hearings. I know committee members found that when they went to New Zealand. That is a significant matter that I have heard about from New Zealand members of parliament through their processes and through the way they look at legislation before it comes to the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052948"></A>
These committees should provide a link to the people most affected by the issues in the formulation and consideration of legislation. By working in a bipartisan manner--and that is what has come out of this review--the issues can be examined more fully, tested more strenuously and the result can better reflect the needs of the community. I welcome the expansion of the committee system to include a number of statutory portfolio based committees. I heard the contribution of the honourable member for Southern Downs before lunch and I understand that is still to be finally clarified. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052949"></A>
The review recommends the portfolio committee being able to report on ‘all aspects of government activities, including investigating and reporting on events, incidents and operational matters’. Queenslanders deserve best practice in parliament just as we do in fields such as science and manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, education and health in the 21st century. For example, the health committee would be able to investigate the management of our hospitals and the pay debacle. The LNP also supports the expanded consideration of legislation with opportunities for public input from stakeholders and citizens. I hope the government will take on board the recommendation that any exceptions to referring legislation be transparent, narrowly defined and extraordinary in nature. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1052950"></A>
In addition, I welcome the proposal to refer budget estimates to the relevant portfolio committee. This will allow committee members to develop a depth of understanding for complex matters--something that I have already pointed out does happen under the current committee system but certainly could be extended so that MPs from both sides and/or Independents could understand many of these matters better than they currently do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055946"></A>
I welcome the proposal that appointments to key statutory roles will require bipartisan support, including the roles of the Auditor-General, the Crime and Misconduct Commission chairperson and commissioners, the Criminal Organisation Public Interest Monitor, the Electoral Commissioner, the Information Commissioner, the Right to Information Commissioner and the Privacy Commissioner, the Integrity Commissioner and the Ombudsman. These are positions that over the years, including in the years that I have been in this place, have been subject to questions. When members have asked about particular positions they have just been told who is going to be appointed as opposed to there being proper bipartisan consultation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055949"></A>
I support the establishment of the Committee of the Legislative Assembly. I understand the concerns of the Speaker about his exclusion from this committee. There is conflict when it comes to the honourable Speaker’s role in referring matters and his possible inclusion. This may be an issue that deserves further consideration. I understand that is happening when it comes to standing orders matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055950"></A>
The LNP welcomes the recommendation that the time allocated for ministerial statements be reduced to allow for more consideration of committee reports. The opposition understood that we had to give as well in order to make these reforms possible. As a result, for legislation considered by a committee the recommendation is that members of parliament who are not on the committee have a reduced time to speak on the bill. In addition, the review calls for Wednesday parliamentary sittings to be delayed to allow committee business from 9 am to 1 pm. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055951"></A>
I am disappointed to see that one of the important issues of reform for this parliament was expressly excluded from consideration in this review. That is the issue of truth in parliament. I want to reiterate that the LNP is committed to reinstating section 57 of the Criminal Code to make it an offence for any person to tell a nontruth to a parliamentary committee. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055952"></A>
Queenslanders deserve their parliament and its committees to deliver real scrutiny of the executive government. The LNP welcomes this report. However, these proposals should just be the start of bringing back honesty, transparency and accountability to the management of this state. I am committed to providing Queenslanders with a real choice at the next election--a choice for them to get their Queensland back. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110309_152135" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Callide--LNP) (3.21 pm): I am pleased to make a contribution to the consideration of the report of the Committee System Review Committee that is before us this afternoon. I was a member of that committee. I would have to say at the outset that I probably found my membership of that committee one of the more rewarding roles that I have had since I have been in this parliament. It was a rewarding experience to work with a group of senior parliamentarians, all of whom had the same aim, all of whom had the same commitment--that was a commitment to making this parliament better. </A></Hansard-Body>

I endorse the comments that have been made by the members of the committee who have already spoken--the Leader of the House, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the member for Rockhampton. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055962"></A>
Everybody approached the job that was given to us in a way that was about getting a better result for this parliament. We all sat on that committee as parliamentarians rather than members of particular parties or members coming from particular political philosophies. It was a gratifying thing to be part of. I cannot remember any instance where I would suggest that any member was jockeying for political advantage. I think the parliament will be better for that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055963"></A>
I have seen some comment in the media from people who want to express a view about the committee’s report. I wonder whether those people who seek to express a view fully appreciate the parliamentary experience of the people who made up that committee, not just in terms of years served in this place but in terms of understanding how this place works. When one gets a group of senior parliamentarians--some of them were relatively newcomers to the parliament--like the ones we had on that committee, I wonder about people who have never been a parliamentarian, who have a job as a journalist, for example, and then seem to think that they know better than the collective wisdom of that group of parliamentarians, that group of senior people who have a wealth of experience and all of whom demonstrated a commitment to making this parliament better. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055964"></A>
I say at the beginning of my contribution to those who will inevitably criticise whatever this parliament decides to do with the report of this committee to temper that criticism with a realisation that there was a group of people involved, a group of people who have a wealth of experience in the parliament but all of whom shared a common desire, a common motivation, to make this place better, and not just for those of us who sit in here now. I do not think members would take offence at me saying that some of the members on that committee probably will not be here for too much longer; there are people who are reaching the end of their careers. We did not do it for the benefit of the members of the committee. I think the reforms that this committee recommended, if they are put in place the way they were recommended, will be reforms that the next generation of parliamentarians will come to fully appreciate. I think it is a generational change. It is without doubt a fundamental change. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055965"></A>
I think we almost need to stop referring to it as a reform of the committee system because it is a reform of the legislative system. It is a reform of the legislative process. The way that legislation is processed through this House will fundamentally and absolutely change. That is something that is not fully encapsulated by the terminology ‘a review of the committee system’. This really is a review of the legislative process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055966"></A>
It will produce a process that will provide a great deal more scrutiny of the legislation that comes into the House. It will provide a great deal more involvement from members of this parliament. It will provide long awaited opportunities for members of the public to have an input into that legislation. Those three things will certainly contribute to some better outcomes and some better legislation, I think. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055967"></A>
I reflect on the years that I have spent here in the parliament. I have often been frustrated by the legislative process. It is a frustration that I think has been shared by members on both sides of the House. I have shadowed a number of different ministers over the years and dealt with a number of different pieces of legislation. We get into what we call the consideration in detail stage where we start to consider the clauses and any number of times I have heard from the minister’s response that they realise that the debate has produced an alternative outcome that I understand they cannot accept. Once a minister gets in here with a piece of legislation that has been provided to them by their department they are locked into defending that piece of legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055968"></A>
I have seen a number of examples of ministers sent in here with pieces of legislation that they have had difficulty defending. That is just the way the system works. In saying that I am not criticising the particular ministers. It is an outcome of the way the system works. Once the legislation comes into the House the minister who is responsible for it has the job of defending it and the shadow minister--</Hansard-Body>

 It certainly is a system that is all about--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Schwarten:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 No compromise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055972"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 There is absolutely no room for compromise, irrespective of how obvious it is that compromise should happen and compromise is warranted. I have seen the farce here on numerous occasions where the minister wears out the carpet running backwards and forwards to get advice from the advisers who sit over there to try to explain what the legislation means and to try to answer questions that are being raised, and the inability of those often junior bureaucrats who sit there and are given the job of providing that advice to the minister.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058977"></A>
It is a legislative process that does not produce the sorts of outcomes that we saw from the process that has been adopted in the New Zealand parliament. One of the things I was saying to some of my colleagues at lunchtime is that it is a great shame that every member of this parliament who gets to consider the report of this committee cannot go to New Zealand and watch their committee system in progress. I think that was a great experience. It was a transformation, if you like, in terms of understanding how a legislative process should work. It is certainly impossible for everybody to go to New Zealand to see that committee work in operation, but I would commend it to any member of this parliament. If you have the opportunity to go, you should take that opportunity and appreciate how the New Zealand system works.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058978"></A>
As the Premier said in her contribution--and I agree 100 per cent with what she said--this is proposing a new process that will require a cultural change. It will require a change in culture on the part of members of this parliament irrespective of where they sit in the parliament. It will be a challenge for the people who are appointed to the legislative committees, especially the chairs of those committees, to ensure that the culture of the old committees is left behind. The culture of the old committee system that we have known will have no place in the new legislative process that we are seeking to put in place.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058980"></A>
As the member for Southern Downs indicated, the new legislative process will certainly put a whole lot more pressure on all of us. It will mean that all of us will work a lot harder. Ministers will have to work a lot harder; shadow ministers will have to work a lot harder. I often criticise ministers, but I will also say that I have seen shadow ministers sent down here to read a speech that they know nothing about and stumble over words. They will read a speech that has been written by somebody else. I have seen plenty of government members do it, too; don’t you worry. That sort of thing will no longer be possible in the legislative process that we are putting in place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058981"></A>
A minister who does not have some knowledge of the legislation that they are responsible for will very quickly be exposed before a committee. Similarly, a shadow minister who sits on a committee and who does not have knowledge of the legislation that they are supposed to be shadowing will very quickly be exposed. So it goes for individual members of that committee. The legislative process will put a lot more pressure on members of parliament. It will require members of parliament to work a lot harder, and so it should be. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058982"></A>
The other side of that is that it will provide members of parliament with a great deal more input into the legislation. It will mean that members of parliament will have input into making the laws. That is something that people out there in the community think we have under the current system but, after being here for almost 13 years, let me tell you that I have not seen too many opportunities to do that. Some of the government backbenchers have indicated to me that even they do not get a heck of a lot of opportunity to have that input. The opportunity to have input will be guaranteed under the new legislative process that this puts in place. It will give all of us as members of parliament more opportunity to be law-makers and to influence the legislation that passes through this parliament. The extra workload will well and truly be worth the rewards that can be gained from those types of opportunities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058984"></A>
The other people that this new legislative process will put more pressure on are the public servants. It did not surprise me one bit to hear on the grapevine that the public servants down on George Street really do not want this change to happen. It did not surprise me one bit to hear over the Christmas break that there was a degree of panic in some of the offices on George Street. The public servants were shooting memos around, recommending ways to try to stop this from happening because they, too, will come under a lot more scrutiny. The instigators of legislation down in the bowels of whichever department it is will be subject to a heck of a lot more scrutiny and will have to answer questions and justify the legislation that they have put together and given to the minister and sent into the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058985"></A>
I note the Premier’s comments that the ability to examine public servants will be limited in the first instance. I accept somewhat reluctantly the Premier’s justification for that. I am reluctant to water down the ability of committees to examine the public servants and the people who are responsible for putting legislation together. I really think everyone who is responsible for a piece of legislation should be answerable to the committee. I do not mean in an aggressive way, but they should be there to explain why that legislation was put together in the way that it was. They should be there to explain the concepts that have been encapsulated in that legislation and why the legislation was written in the way it was. That is an important part of the process. While I note the Premier’s comments that the limitation that is being placed on the committees to examine public servants will be a temporary thing, I certainly hope that it is a very temporary thing. From my perspective, that change in the legislative process is the most important and the most valuable change that is being proposed by the report of this committee. It is a fundamental change to the legislative process. It is a fundamental change to the way legislation is passed--a change to the process that takes an idea and causes it to become a law. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058986"></A>
This process will allow another set of people to have an input, and that is the general public and the interest groups. The importance of that should not be underestimated. Once again, the New Zealand experience was a valuable one. We went to New Zealand and met with interest groups who regularly prepared inputs into the legislative process. They understood the value of that opportunity to them. It reinforced to me the need for this sort of process to allow that type of input by interest groups and individuals here in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058987"></A>
Once again, reflecting on my experience in this place, I can think of a number of examples where that opportunity for public input would have made for much better legislation. I understand, and everyone who has been in politics for a while understands, that governments have agendas and philosophically driven programs that they need to engage. However, this process will provide interest groups with an input and influence on a government’s program and agenda at that informative stage, and that is an incredibly valuable thing. It is an incredibly valuable thing when you see it in operation. In Queensland, the general public and the interest groups will come to understand in time how valuable that opportunity is. That in itself will provide a huge incentive for us as parliamentarians to make the process work properly and make the legislative process so much better. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061974"></A>
I also want to reinforce the comments that have been made by other committee members about the role of the CLA, the Committee of the Legislative Assembly. I have listened to alternative points of view that have been expressed since this report was made public and I have read some of the interchanges between a number of players in that debate. Can I say that I think much of the concern that has been expressed is unwarranted--very much unwarranted. The overriding principles in the report are to ensure that the running and the activities of this parliament are directed by us as parliamentarians, and that is the way it should be. All of us in political life are well acquainted with the principle of taking responsibility for our own actions--making our own political decisions and justifying them to the general public whom we represent, and that is the principle that has been carried through in the recommendations within this report. Over the time that I have been here I have seen instances where decisions have been made about this parliament that affect members of parliament by people who I do not believe had the best interests of the parliament at heart and who really did not understand the way that the parliament should work and what the parliament is about.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061979"></A>
I conclude by saying that I think that the proposals that are in this report will make this place a better parliament for generations of Queenslanders to come. They are a fundamental change. I would say they are an overdue change. I congratulate the chairman of the committee, the Leader of the House, on the job that she did in guiding this committee to the result that is being considered by the House this afternoon. If this report is adopted--as I hope it will be--I urge every member to engage in the new culture with an open mind and to make the changes in your own mind that are necessary to make this process work for the betterment of this parliament and for all Queenslanders.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Pine Rivers--ALP) (3.40 pm): I rise this afternoon to speak to the motion. I was privileged to be a member of the Committee System Review Committee and I thank the chair, Judy Spence, and all members of the committee for their dedication to the task and for the bipartisan approach to dealing with the issues that surround the operation of our current committees and the parliament. As has already been stated, the current committee system was established in the post-Fitzgerald reform era and was designed to allow for greater scrutiny of the parliament, the government and related community issues. I have been fortunate to serve on a variety of committees since my election in 2001--from the Travelsafe select committee, public works committee, public accounts committee, select committee on organ and tissue donation, various estimates committees and I am currently serving on the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee.</Hansard-Body>

During this service I think it would be appropriate to say that the importance of committees in their scrutiny and review function is undisputed, but the reality of the curtailment of time, resources and content scope has meant that committees are less effective than they could be. I believe it is imperative in a unicameral legislature that we have a strong and effective committee system to review legislation and government decisions and, importantly, to open up the processes of the parliament to allow the people of Queensland to have effective and timely input into the processes and outcomes of parliament.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061993"></A>
By creating portfolio based committees we would be giving members the opportunity to become deeply involved in specific areas of government, hopefully leading to an expertise which would better serve the scrutiny of legislation process as it affects their portfolio, as well as the public works aspect. No government holds the complete collective knowledge and expertise on any particular subject, and by allowing the wider community the opportunity to see legislation before it is presented to the House should ultimately mean better legislation, fewer negative impacts and greater ownership of the outcomes. These committees will also take over the scrutiny of the annual budget through the estimates process. With regard to this last point, we have considered the estimates process and have listened closely to committee chairs, government and non-government members and ministers. It would appear there is a consensus of opinion that the constraints of the strict rules that apply during estimates such as the strict time limits for questions, strict time limits between government and non-government members and lack of ability to question senior public servants means that the process does not flow as effectively as it could. With the opening up of scrutiny of the government through right to information reforms, the role of the information, integrity and privacy commissioners and ongoing publication of information by and about government through websites and other publishing mechanisms, it is time to open up the senior echelon of the Public Service through closer scrutiny of its role in public policy and decision making.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061994"></A>
The committee thought carefully about how committees currently operate with regard to composition, timing, general business, openness to the public and the media. In Queensland our committees find their meetings sandwiched in between legislation debate, other meetings and functions at Parliament House. Other countries have dedicated committee time, dedicated meeting rooms and are predominantly open to the public and the media. There is also the ability for other members of parliament to sit in on committee hearings that particularly interest them or are in their area of expertise. Recommending dedicated committee time on a Wednesday morning of a sitting week and opening the process up allows more interaction between interested members and ministers, and it means that committee business is being placed in a position of prominence and will allow members of parliament to make their own submissions on behalf of their constituencies to legislation that will affect them. I expect the new committee system will place an additional workload on committee members and the committee chair in particular, but it will also mean that local members will also have to consider each piece of legislation much more carefully than they do at present. I think the effectiveness and appropriateness of legislation will improve and I also believe that the level of debate in the House will become more effective and useful and hopefully less repetative.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1061996"></A>
The Committee System Review Committee has made historic recommendations which will impact significantly on the current operation of the Queensland parliament, its committees, its members and its staff. I would encourage all members to embrace this change, be patient and constructive during the process of altering how our committees work and, most importantly, to inform the people of Queensland in their electorates that we value their opinions, we want them to take more interest in the place that makes the laws of the land and we want them to become involved in our democracy. I recall the quote--</Hansard-Body>

When you do nothing, you feel overwhelmed and powerless. But when you get involved, you feel the sense of hope and accomplishment that comes from knowing you are working to make things better.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1061998"></A>
I hope the people of Queensland and the members of the Legislative Assembly grab this historic opportunity for change--that they get involved and make the parliament work in a much more effective manner. To this effect, I commend the report to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110309_154620" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Gaven--LNP) (3.46 pm): Change is inevitable. Organisations that do not evolve stagnate, wither, become irrelevant and either die or are bypassed. The central tenet of the discussion today is that we have been asked to embrace a whole new world of parliamentary legislative review and the processes to achieve that. The 55 recommendations have been available for consideration for three months. The government has responded today and largely supports most of the recommendations. In that time some key concerns have been raised by many parties, including the Speaker, and they have been noted. The members of the committee have in 12 months produced a document suggesting quite a radical change to the committee system and what they must do.</A></Hansard-Body>

There are politically greatly expanded roles for both opposition and government members, possibly including all members, inclusive of backbenchers. It would seem that the review panel has decided that the existing committee structure is really as irrelevant as it seems to be, as external and internal parties have consistently stated. Personally, I can vouch for the irrelevance and petulance of existing committees having been on one occasion affected myself when my confidential submission to the economic committee on microfinance options and the GFC locally was treated with contempt here in the House. It was either leaked or my request for confidentiality until formal reporting was ignored. I have seen too many other submissions treated with similar contempt. This may not be the entire fault of the committee members or the committee process itself but, moreover, due to the failing of the design of the current system of those committees and their functions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062009"></A>
These recommendations propose many things, and I want to discuss some which I believe are both significant and possibly ones where I may be able to offer some constructive comment. I say so because I went to New Zealand myself with the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee last year as a guest of the New Zealand parliament for a week. I went with the member for Bundamba and the member for Brisbane Central. They are not in the House here today, but we have discussed this. Our intention was to see those committees functioning, holding public hearings, scrutinising legislation and effectively doing the consideration of legislation in detail step that we presently do as the last step here in the Queensland parliament. Immediately after the ministerial first reading speech is when these committees effectively deal with that. We saw one committee in complete detail over the week and we observed two other committees operating in lesser detail over a full day and into the evening. We spoke to those consultants who give current scrutiny advice, legislative advice and also received a detailed overview from Sir Geoffrey Palmer, the former New Zealand Prime Minister and Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065200"></A>
Honourable members, we had done this after a most impressive presentation by a New Zealand member and head of their national scrutiny of legislation committee in Canberra 12 months earlier. I was present when that member presented what was an enormously lengthy presentation. I found New Zealand’s process potentially more responsive to the needs of constituents, parliamentarians and the system. They gained greater involvement of members in legislation--also the public--and they probably generated better legislation for all. I congratulate Mr Charles Chauvel, who is the MP for Wellington, for his great efforts in sharing those personal experiences with us and leading us to what were the sort of things we generated out of that experience. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065203"></A>
I think the New Zealand system should be trialled here in full. It is important to say that I believe there are some messy recommendations and there are some extra ones that we might consider, based on my observation and research, and I would think over time it is possible that they may be included. I acknowledge the cumulative years of experience of those on the review committee and I certainly do not seek to undermine anything that they have said. But I believe that they may have missed a few points when they went to Wellington and were observing those committees in action. I also appreciate that the committee visited Canada and reviewed that country’s processes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065204"></A>
Broadly, the committees need to reflect the major portfolio or policy areas and restrict themselves to those areas. We have nine committees proposed here. Of course, New Zealand has a few more, but that is appropriate. The reduction to seven, which has been considered, and condensing some of the portfolios would seem to be inappropriate. I believe that it could defeat the process and the outcomes that we all wish for. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065205"></A>
The specific areas themselves that have been listed--health, education, environment and resource management, finance and administration, legal affairs, police and public safety, social affairs, transport and infrastructure, and the PCMC with the Committee of the Legislative Assembly--all seem appropriate. In New Zealand, of course, they have added the Maori and Pacific Islanders and native title demands, because there is a huge demand for parliamentary consideration of those matters. In some ways we are fortunate not to have to include those considerations to a large extent, but in some ways one might consider that ATSI considerations are probably equally as important in view of what is considered in New Zealand. I would put it to members that ultimately it may be that we should consider ATSI as a separate portfolio. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065206"></A>
I see the list submitted in the government’s response, and I think its response is appropriate. My observations are consistent with many of the proposed recommendations. As I have said, committees are part of the parliamentary process. So an agreed in-parliamentary-week time, as has been described clearly by the member for Pine Rivers and others, set aside for committee meetings and hearings is entirely appropriate. That is what is done in New Zealand. All committees, except in circumstances like the PCMC and parts of finance, should be open to the public, broadcast and recorded for public consumption. People actually listen to them. Public hearings are considered a crucial part of the committee process. You get all sorts of people attending and all sorts of results come out of it. To facilitate these committees they use video links for people to make submissions and representations. That should be encouraged as well. It increases public participation. It also facilitates the process whereby local, regional and national experts might also be involved. Similarly, it allows for consultation by key staff who work full time for those committees to provide advice and who will also take back the legislative response and advice from the committees. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065207"></A>
The homes of the committees and staff need a permanancy. As has been discussed today, certainly we will require additional space, which is what happens in New Zealand, and certainly hearings need to be held close to the public so that there is public transport and ease of getting in and out--particularly for those who might be from all different types of life, different ages and that sort of stuff--to make it easy for people to attend. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065208"></A>
Critically, in New Zealand in many cases the committee chairs are opposition members, with great success and a close cooperative spirit. I repeatedly saw this occurring and it occurs in more than two committees. The recommended proposal is for the government to provide the chair, ostensibly to help facilitate the process of governing. I am not saying that that is not an appropriate step, but in New Zealand what they do seems to work very well. I am not convinced by arguments to date, put forward on the basis of observations other than that of New Zealand, that this may not be the appropriate step. But certainly the issue of the PCMC chair being a non-government member seems entirely appropriate. I say so because, as I say, I sat through multiple committee hearings and I think that when you get to a situation where you may well be disagreeing, sometimes having a person who is trying to be impartial--and that may be an opposition member--means you tend to get a result. Anyway, suck it and see. We might see what happens with our proposal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065209"></A>
I totally agree that the process of the consideration in detail occurring early is the only way forward and that in practice achieves a better result in legislation. Certainly in New Zealand it does. The extra work for us all is considerable. Many members may not always be capable of completing the task. That certainly occurred in New Zealand. So a lot of help is needed and it is appropriate to provide it. It is wide process in that what some people need is different. So you need to get an idea as they go along. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065210"></A>
Do not get a shock: I believe that it is going to cost, at a starting price, based on the numbers that were given to us in New Zealand, about $17 million. That comprises $10 million for the committee itself, $4.5 million for capital outlays and $2.5 million to $3 million for consultants--and I think they are needed. I think the figures are probably the best assessment and they are based on the New Zealand information. We had a thorough presentation on that. It is very expensive but, when all is said, you tend to only get what you pay for. The public seemed to like it, but it makes some members, some public servants and certainly some members of the public uncomfortable. In New Zealand’s multiparty system it is even harder, but they still seem to make it work because the key is that people want it to work. They waste less time in parliament itself and, strangely, they have now moved to a process where they vote electronically and not in person. That seems to work, too. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065212"></A>
Sir Geoffery Palmer, the ex-deputy Labour leader and former Prime Minister, as I said, certainly gave us a great insight into the downside problems. He felt that a professional group of ex-politicians, legal advisers giving ongoing advice with links in, would fill the gaps that occur. They have a regular process of review of outcomes and so do the consultancies. So in other words, they are both being reviewed and then they review one another as it goes along. Like all others, Sir Geoffrey Palmer felt that the system made them stronger, not weaker. I think those things were said here today, particularly by the members for Rockhampton, Southern Downs and Callide. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065213"></A>
New Zealand certainly has two tiers of government, whereas we have three tiers. As a state, we really need to justify the expenditure on a state legislature. Honourable members, the last 10 years may be seen as not justifying much of that cost. I am a federalist and I support the issue of the pre-eminence of the central government, but where states must have that provincial voice, which is needed in Queensland, and that provincial voice must be heard and appropriate outcomes delivered, it is appropriate to have a state legislature that considers legislation in a more compassionate way. In a regional, decentralised state like Queensland, as we have certainly experienced most recently with the floods and the cyclones, we are uniquely better placed to justify that extra need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

There are different eras in parliamentary history: 1859, the separation from New South Wales; 1901, Federation; 1922, the abolition of the upper house and the unicameral parliament; and 1990, Fitzgerald. As stated, in the 19th century committees were very active and had greater legislative input. The 20th century saw states governing almost by decree. Really, the only chance was at the ballot box, where success or failure was determined every three years. Labor was the natural party of government and it saw no need for greater input until the split of 1956. To be fair, at that time Menzies’ style of governing was paternalistic and rhetorically anticommunist, but he was very close to the values that a lot of the Labor Party shares today. In many ways there was the belief that ‘what you don’t know won’t necessarily come back to hurt you’. That was the enduring philosophy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065215"></A>
Committees encourage a diversity of opinion, and that was deemed inappropriate at the time--and that lasted for 100 years. I wonder if 2010 will be another era in Queensland’s parliament in our steps of change and our own history. The fact that a bipartisan group came to these conclusions is testament to the vitality of government here at a time when there is arguably parliamentary decline just south of the border. Remember, we split from New South Wales in 1859. That does not mean that we have done everything right within portfolios and maybe collectively we need this new structure to correct some very serious deficiencies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065246"></A>
The critical three tasks that the new committees have been asked to have under the changes are review, review of the FLPs and wider community consultation. They are the most critical and enduring changes that will come out of these changes. It certainly may well see a far more successful estimates process and may actually allow both government and non-government members to have a more relevant and appropriate system. It may well be just as adversarial but will most likely relate to the real point of debate necessitating clarification, excision or, maybe just occasionally, exposure. I see it as rather fitting that one member of the committee--that is, the member for Rockhampton--has already stated that he is retiring at the next election. The enduring legacy of parliamentary service is not often what one takes away but what one leaves behind. It may be that in time all participating members of this review may be judged very kindly for the production of a series of reforms that both take us back to the aspirations of those who initiated self-government for Queensland and take us all forward in the efficiency and fairness of state legislation in an enduring manner.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Today is history in the making. Earlier today students from North Arm Primary School visited me at parliament. They popped in to the chamber and I shared with them what was happening--the fact that we were seeing a significant change in the way our parliament will operate in the future. Perhaps it is as significant as the day the Queensland parliament voted to do away with the upper house.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065256"></A>
I congratulate the Leader of the House on the report. I note that all 55 recommendations were unanimous. The committee had representatives from the government, the opposition and the crossbenches. My Independent colleague the member for Nanango was on that committee. Whilst sometimes the media wants to promote the parliament as always fighting, what we saw here was all members of parliament, irrespective of their political persuasions, prepared to sit around the table and look at how we can improve the method of how our parliament operates in Queensland. I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that after initial teething problems we will see a significant improvement in the way our Queensland parliament will operate in the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065257"></A>
I note that in the report the Leader of the House referred to how the members of the committee did not just dream up these recommendations; they took time and studied how parliaments around the world operated so that we could learn from their experiences. I think that is what we need to do and always focus on when new laws are coming into parliament. Before we lock ourselves in, let us make sure that there is not another country or state in Australia perhaps doing similar things. Let us see how we can improve what we do in Queensland. I congratulate the Leader of the House on this report. It is great to see how she has come to this House with recommendations after studying how other parliaments operate not only in Australia but also around the world. I note that a number of members in the past have called for--and in this report there is reference to a proposal for--an upper house. I will never support calls for an upper house. I think we are overgoverned in Australia. I see this as a way to respond to calls for better scrutiny and improvement of laws that come through state parliament.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065258"></A>
When I reflect on some of the laws that previous parliaments have passed whilst I have been in parliament--in particular the amalgamation of local governments which was a very contentious matter in Queensland--I wonder whether, if we had had a committee system such as the Leader of the House has proposed, the government of the day would have still boxed on with the amalgamation of councils. I know it is still a very contentious issue in Queensland in many areas, particularly on the Sunshine Coast where there continues to be very strong moves to deamalgamate. I suppose much will depend on the outcome of the next election to see if the government changes and, if an alternative government is formed, if there will be that will to allow a referendum for that issue of deamalgamation to be raised. I believe there is a greater capacity under this new proposal for scrutiny of proposed legislation to make sure that we have the best bills possible.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065259"></A>
Another matter I want to reflect on is the government’s amendment to the regulations on the issue of taking planning away from the third largest council in Queensland and handing that planning for a new community on the Caloundra South area to the Urban Land Development Authority. I maintain that it was a wrong move. I think it was simply the government exercising and flexing its muscle. I wonder what may have happened if we had had a different committee system operating when the government made that decision. I refer the Leader of the House to recommendation No.15, which states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1065261"></A>
The Committee recommends that all committees consist of six members with three members nominated by the Leader of the House and three members nominated by the Leader of the Opposition to reflect the composition of the non-government membership in the House.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065262"></A>
The current practice is that when committee membership is being canvassed the Leader of the Opposition approaches the Independents and the crossbenches to see what committees we would like to be involved in. I understand that this is simply a continuation of that process, but I would like the Leader of the House in her reply to clarify that. It is intended to ensure that under this new proposal there will be an opportunity for members of the crossbenches--for us the Independents--to have fair representation on these new committees.</Hansard-Body>

(4.06 pm): I rise to speak in this debate in relation to the recommendations of the review of the parliamentary committee system chaired by Leader of the House, the Hon. Judy Spence MP, and committee members from both sides of the House. First of all I commend the committee for its very comprehensive report into the parliament’s structure, which was very much in need of a review. As a modern parliament it is our responsibility to ensure that our work is relevant, accountable and current to the issues of the day and to the lives of Queenslanders. I fully support setting aside a specific time period for committees to meet. When a member is not sitting in the legislative chamber there are always competing demands on their time during the intervals through a variety of meetings and events. As one of the more experienced MPs in the House, I have been involved in and chaired a number of parliamentary committees including estimates, members ethics and parliamentary privileges and environment and resources committees. All of these committees are relevant to the work of the House and the government of the day. In relation to the investigations and reports of all of those committees, a great deal of public consultation and scrutiny of the government and parliament have taken place. Consultation with various stakeholders, interest groups and the general public is so important to make sure that changes to legislation into the future are relevant to our economy, our environment and to the wellbeing of Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>

Under the proposed system, giving those bipartisan parliamentary committees the opportunity to look in detail at legislation before the House would mean a member’s time in the parliament would be more effective, ensure more relevant debate, a better understanding and engender more agreement on the finer points of the bill before it is passed by the parliament. This would mean that the opposition would be given an opportunity to comprehensively scrutinise and further consult on aspects of a bill. With that, parliamentary committees may also be able to look at various aspects of public concern within government departments, government activities, current and future policy areas and use of service providers and non-government organisations, for example. Topics that could be examined may include alcohol and drug abuse, disaster management, bullying in schools, project management et cetera. During the estimates committee process the same committees would have better knowledge and more experience in relation to a portfolio area when cross-examining ministers and departmental heads.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065303"></A>
The proposed Committee of the Legislative Assembly, already endorsed by the Premier, will comprise senior members of both sides of the House and will be responsible for overseeing the new committee system, as well as ensuring that into the future the appropriate facilities and resources are provided to support the wide-ranging work of the committees. However, it is important that two current committees remain for the purposes of maintaining the integrity of government, the parliament and its members: the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee and the Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065306"></A>
For many years I chaired the former Members’ Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee, so I realise the importance of having a bipartisan committee as a stand-alone committee. In the past many senior members of parliament from both sides of the House have been referred to the committee by opposing parties in relation to their ethical conduct, particularly during the heat of debate during question time. The work of the ethics committee included examining the arrangements for maintaining a register of interests where members are required to detail property, financial interests, membership of parties, bodies and associations and other interests that could foreseeably raise a conflict between members’ private interests and their duties as members. The committee is also responsible for parliamentary privilege, which is the right to speak freely in the House without the risk of defamation, allegations of contempt, citizens’ rights of reply and monitoring the functions of the Integrity Commissioner. Regardless of the right of privilege of members, the committee needs to ensure that members do not attempt to deliberately mislead the House in the course of their debate. These checks and balances are required to ensure that elected members recognise that honesty and morality are standards that are expected of them. This should not be the role of a committee that monitors the overall effectiveness of the entire committee system and provides the facilities and resources for the committee system. The integrity committee has a specific role in relation to an individual member’s behaviour in the House and it is important to maintain that status as a committee of backbenchers for this purpose only. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Likewise, the specific functions of the Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee, the PCMC, are to monitor and review the performance of the functions of the CMC. The CMC is unique in that it has overall responsibility in relation to major and organised crime investigations, police and official misconduct investigations, complaint resolution research, corruption prevention and witness protection. The parliamentary committee has a continual role in monitoring and reviewing the CMC, and also conducts specific inquiries in respect of matters pertaining to the CMC. It is through the committee that the CMC is accountable to the parliament and to the people of Queensland. Therefore, it is very important that this function remain independent of other committee processes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065309"></A>
I am concerned that the role of the Speaker and some of the functions undertaken by the Speaker’s office may be unduly modified. I trust that issues will be resolved through further discussions with the Speaker’s office and the Office of the Clerk of the Parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065310"></A>
These reforms are certainly visionary, and some aspects of the report and recommendations require examination in relation to the future workings and deliberations of the parliament, and the machinations and effectiveness of the government of the day. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (4.13 pm): At the outset I acknowledge the tremendous amount of work that has been done by the members of the committee. I congratulate them for the effort that has gone into the report that we are debating today. This is an historic review and an historic report. It is important to realise that what we adopt of it will apply for generations to come. Therefore, it is important that we consider very carefully the recommendations, because they will apply not just to this parliament, in which the Australian Labor Party is the government, but also to other parliaments. With the passage of time, different parties will be in government and different points of view and different personalities will prevail. Therefore, it is important that we get the principles right. If we look back through history to what parliaments did 50 or 150 years ago, we cannot know what the personalities involved were like. Therefore, it is important that today we concentrate on the principles. </Hansard-Body>

The crux of the recommended reforms is that we adopt a committee system similar to that which operates in New Zealand. I walked to the chamber with an honourable member who will make a contribution later. He told me that this is not quite the same as the New Zealand system as some aspects of that system are missing. I will be interested to hear his contribution later on. Nevertheless, I am somewhat familiar with the New Zealand system as some time ago the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee, which I chair, travelled to New Zealand to look at other aspects for our committee work. Whilst there, we came across the system that operates and were informed about it. As a result of that, I think everyone on our committee has turned out to be a supporter of this type of committee system, which operates similarly to the estimates system in the Senate, et cetera. However, this goes further than that as the committee will deal extensively with every piece of legislation that comes before the House, except urgent pieces of legislation, as I understand it. That is quite significant. As a former minister I wonder how someone in that position will view the world knowing that their legislation is to be examined with great scrutiny by all sorts of experts and will not become law for at least six months. However, I am sure ministers will adjust to that, as they have in New Zealand and elsewhere. </Hansard-Body>

I was pleased that the committee did not recommend the resurrection of the upper house, the Legislative Council. I think that would be most unpopular. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SHINE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The honourable member mentions a particular party. I recollect in 1967 handing out how-to-vote cards for a referendum. There were two issues: one was the important one that we all remember in relation to Aborigines being counted in the census; the other one related to the nexus between the numbers in the Senate and the House of Representatives. A party, then called the Democratic Labor Party, was the only party that voted against that and urged the no case. Its campaign was, ‘No for no more politicians’. Despite the Liberal and Country parties, the ALP and others, including the Communist Party no doubt, all favouring that referendum, it was defeated notwithstanding that the party opposing it had a small percentage of the vote. Therefore, the idea of having more politicians and another house of parliament is not popular. I am sure the committee did not take too long to work that out as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065321"></A>
My major concern relates to the role of the Speaker. It is proposed that he be left off the major committee that will oversee all of the other committees. I have concerns about that because the Speaker has played an integral role in the running of this parliament since its inception, which is a model followed by the House of Commons and parliaments in other parts of the Commonwealth and other democratic countries throughout the world. Before we discard that past role, we have to look very carefully at why we are doing so. If there is a defect in the report, it is that it does not give an explanation as to why the role is being discarded. It is pretty light on in relation to that aspect of the matter. That is a mild criticism but, nevertheless, before we toss the baby out with the bathwater it should be explained in great detail why we are casting aside decades, if not centuries, of tradition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065346"></A>
I asked the Parliamentary Library to do a little bit of research. I notice from the appendix provided by the committee that in Queensland, from 1860 to about 1988, we have had various kinds of select committees and committees of that nature. It seems that there has always been a parliamentary building committee. I asked the library to do some research to see whether or not the Speaker or the President was a member of that committee. In the short time I gave them they discovered it is likely that either the Speaker or the President was a member of that committee from its inception in 1860 and certainly until the last one in 1987-88 as well as several in between which were picked at random. It appears to me that it has been our tradition to always include the Speaker or the President as the chair of that committee, no doubt holding both a deliberative and a casting vote. That is something that our forefathers--or foremothers for that matter--were happy with over a long period, in my submission to the House, for no doubt good reason. From the point of view of our own Queensland history, it is important that we are conscious of it and no doubt adhere to it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065349"></A>
I also refer to the committee’s own research, particularly to pages 13 and 14 of the report. The committee itself quotes the example of the parliament of Canada and the National Assembly of Quebec where the presiding officer appears to be the chair of the relevant committee in those two instances. There is no explanation given as to why then he should be dropped from our committee when those two examples were given. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065352"></A>
On page vii the foreword from the chair of the committee states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1065354"></A>
The committee members who worked on this current review of our committee system were unanimous in their concerns that our present committee structure is under-resourced, does not have sufficient influence over the executive of government--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1065355"></A>
And it goes on. I think we can all agree that the executive of government does have all power over the legislative functions here, including the committee system, and that is not a desirable thing. In my view of the world, having the Leader of the House--irrespective of the personality and perhaps looking at it in 10 or 15 years time--as chair of that committee instead of the Speaker merely entrenches the executive’s control over that committee. The Leader of the House is primarily in charge of government business to see that it gets through, whereas the Speaker has always had a bipartisan and impartial role. It seems to me that the committee itself, through its own research, should support my contention, as would our own history of Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065356"></A>
I also have concerns about the lay membership of the PCMC. It sounds like a good idea on the face of it. However, we are a parliament, we are parliamentarians, we are representatives of the people. Therefore, it is inconceivable in that notion that laypeople or people other than parliamentarians should form part of the parliamentary group to oversee this body. That is our duty. That is why we are elected. We are here to represent 30,000-odd people each. We should not escape our responsibilities by appointing other people to do that for us. That is our responsibility. That is our democratic system. We should not pass it on to people who are selected by us as opposed to doing it ourselves--ourselves being people elected, not selected, by the people of Queensland. To my mind, it is contrary to our democratic system that we should do that notwithstanding that the motives in themselves may well be commendable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065358"></A>
Parliamentarians can be dealt with by our integrity committees far more easily than members of the public can. If the integrity committee or the House, on a recommendation of the integrity committee or its own motion, were to deal harshly with a member of the public that would not be perceived well in the public domain. I think it is much easier for us to self-discipline fellow members of parliament. There is a number of reasons why we should proceed with caution in terms of laypeople sitting on parliamentary committees. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065360"></A>
Finally, I make some comments in relation to the existence of the Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee itself. I note that the thrust of the report--and I do not think it gave too many reasons--is that it be abolished and its function be taken over by the CLA. As I understand it, because of such discussions and considerations, that is unlikely. I hope it is not proceeded with because it is not appropriate. I listened carefully to the comments of the member for Mount Ommaney, who is a former chair of that committee’s predecessor, and I agree with her entirely. Why is that? There is a number of reasons. The Integrity, Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee and its predecessor the Members’ Ethics and Parliamentary Privileges Committee have operated continuously with differing membership in every parliament since 1995 and they have been most successful. During this time the committee has produced 112 reports, including 50 relating to complaints of an ethical or privileges nature not including a citizen’s right of reply. In all but one instance of those 50 ethical or privileges complaints the report of the committee has been unanimous. The reality is that these committees have worked hard to bring down unanimous reports on often very difficult matters infused with political implications in a very non-partisan manner. In this way the objectives of the parliament have largely been met by the enforcement of a transparent ethical machine without undue politics intruding. Importantly, individual members have not been mistreated by the committees without expense to the ethics regime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065361"></A>
Under the recommendations in the report there lies an inherent, continuing potential conflict of interest with senior party leaders, in particular senior ministers, shadow ministers or their delegates, comprising the membership of the ethics and privileges committee. This is so because it is the conduct of their cabinet or shadow cabinet ministers that they are most often called upon to judge. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065362"></A>
The other point of course is that most other Australian lower houses have a standing membership of their ethics and privileges committee. For example, the Commonwealth House of Representatives, the New South Wales and Western Australian lower houses do not have current ministers serving on their ethics and privileges committee. New Zealand, the jurisdiction which the proposed new committee system most closely resembles, has a separate privileges committee along with a separate business committee and a separate standing orders committee. An examination of the reports of the ethics committee over the past three years indicates that all but one of the 15 matters referred to the ethics committee regarding the conduct of members reported on during that period were the result of an allegation by or against a minister, a leader of the opposition or a deputy leader of the opposition. So the main players are the ones most often likely to appear before such a committee. To have them comprise the committee is contrary, in my submission, to common sense. It has been successful. As I indicated, it is not broken and does not need to be fixed. However, it avoids conflict of interest and is consistent with practice in other states and in the Commonwealth. In my humble submission, it should stay the same. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1065363"></A>
Finally, I place on the record my disappointment in the criticism of the Speaker this morning. To my knowledge, this Speaker has been extremely highly regarded inside this House, on both sides of this House and outside this House since he took over that very responsible position. He is a person of the highest calibre and character. To my mind, he deserves the support of this House, including the people in leadership positions in this House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110309_162852" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Indooroopilly--LNP) (4.28 pm): In my maiden speech to this chamber almost two years ago, I referred to one of my predecessors in the seat of Indooroopilly when it was known as Toowong and the MP at the time was Ian Prentice, who was a member in this House from 1980 to 1983. I mention Ian Prentice because he is probably best remembered as being part of that ginger group of Liberal MPs at the time who crossed the floor over the establishment of a public accounts committee. The fact that a public accounts committee was such an important issue in the 1980s indicates how important a strong committee system is to the effective working of this parliament and to good governance of the executive government. Obviously that public accounts committee was not formed at the time. It eventually came in the late eighties, and obviously we had a far more comprehensive committee system established post the Fitzgerald reforms in the nineties. For many years I covered this chamber as a journalist. I can say that the lack of an effective, functioning and inquisitive committee system was a great frustration to me as a journalist because there were many things that obviously were not being disclosed in relation to the functioning of parliament and government. </A></Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068953"></A>
A good committee system is important to ensure that scrutiny of the executive government is appropriate. Good and effective governance does require the power of executive government to be tempered. It needs to be restrained by appropriate democratic processes, procedures and institutions. Through that kind of scrutiny alternative views can be heard. Government decisions can be challenged and there is an ongoing process of evaluation and review of government policies and practices. This is even more important, of course, in Queensland, being the only state in Australia with a unicameral parliament. The absence of an upper house, as we have seen throughout Queensland’s history since it was abolished in 1922, has seen governments that have dominated parliament often with very large majorities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068954"></A>
While there are external bodies that have been established to scrutinise many of the activities of parliament, there are two clear limitations to these bodies. One is that they are established through legislation with clearly limited powers and functions. The other is that who appoints people to those external bodies is often the government that they are appointed to scrutinise. That raises quite legitimate questions in terms of independence. As I said, with the absence of an upper house we do need to have an effective committee system. As Fitzgerald said in his reforms, it is one way to ensure a far better functioning executive government. As I said, while those committees were brought in post Fitzgerald, today what we are seeing are fundamental reforms to beef up that committee system and to improve the failings and inadequacies of that committee system as it exists at the moment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068955"></A>
To demonstrate the reality of how ineffective that current committee system is, I think the majority of Queenslanders would be completely ignorant of the fact that we do have a committee system in this parliament. The fact that it remains underresourced and limited in its powers may be a consequence of having such little notoriety amongst the public. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068956"></A>
So today we are taking note of the report, the <Hansard-Italic>
Review of the Queensland parliamentary committee system</Hansard-Italic>
. As I said, these are fundamental reforms and I do welcome many of these reforms that we are discussing. These reforms will give an unprecedented opportunity for MPs to comment and to scrutinise government legislation before it is debated and voted on in parliament. It will also give the public much better access and improve its scrutiny of the legislative procedures and processes. Hopefully, that will provide a much better opportunity for better legislation, and better laws hopefully mean better government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068957"></A>
Inevitably, as politics is part of the parliamentary process, some people will look at these reforms and look at who are the winners and who are the losers. Does it favour the government? Does it favour the opposition? The reality is we should ask the question: are Queenslanders the winners out of this, irrespective of who may be in power at the time? I think what these reforms do is produce a better government and a better parliamentary process, and that is better for the Queensland public. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068958"></A>
There are two points in the report itself that I would like to particularly mention. One is that, while there is greater scrutiny and the establishment of these committees does provide greater opportunity to scrutinise legislation, it is important that a government that wins power has the ability to function and to administer effectively. Therefore, it is important to have a look at that and ensure that the legislation going to committees is not held up unduly. There is a process and provisions here to provide urgency for legislation and also the six-month limitation. It is important that that is maintained. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068959"></A>
The other point in the report that I would mention specifically is in relation to the Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee. I am currently a member of that committee. I do note the comments by the chair of the committee, the Hon. Judy Spence, where she says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1068961"></A>
... we are concerned that the public has little understanding of the work or scrutiny function of this committee--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1068962"></A>
that is, the PCMC--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1068963"></A>
or indeed its capacity to undertake its responsibilities. Consequently, we are recommending the inclusion of lay members on this committee and a greater use of open and publicly broadcast proceedings of its meetings. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068964"></A>
Can I just raise one concern about that. While I am in favour of greater scrutiny of all committees, the reality is that the scrutiny by the PCMC is often of many confidential matters--matters that are raised with us by members of the public in the belief that they will be held confidential. Obviously common sense, I am sure, will need to prevail in terms of the public broadcasting of any of the deliberations of that committee. The issue of lay members also needs to be carefully clarified in terms of those members appearing on that committee. It is a Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee, a review by parliament of the CMC. It is not a question of the broader public being members of that committee and scrutinising the dealings of the CMC. There are other avenues for that to occur. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068965"></A>
Finally, in terms of the limitations on members speaking in this chamber following scrutiny of legislation by a committee and the reduction in the time limits for speaking, it was Mark Twain who once said that he would have written less but he did not have the time. I encourage members to realise that sometimes being more efficient in what they say can make what they say more effective. Given those comments on the importance of efficient speaking, I will conclude my remarks there. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Glass House--LNP) (4.37 pm): I, too, rise to speak to this report on the Queensland parliamentary committee system. Whilst I am very cognisant that I remain one of the inexperienced, newer members of this chamber--particularly compared to many of my colleagues and certainly those who sat on this Committee System Review Committee--and that I am still learning about the operations of the parliament, I do know enough to know that what we are debating and discussing this afternoon is probably one of the most significant reforms in the Queensland parliament in recent decades, certainly in the post-Fitzgerald era. </Hansard-Body>
<DIV>
<IMAGE xml:link="simple" href="2011_03_09_WEEKLY-58.gif" show="embed" actuate="auto"/>
</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068972"></A>
New, as I am, I agree wholeheartedly with the Committee System Review Committee members and some of the comments just made by the member for Indooroopilly. Our present committee structure is certainly underresourced and does not have sufficient influence over the executive of the government, nor does it have sufficient attention within parliament itself. As the member for Indooroopilly just pointed out, the committee system probably remains all but an unknown to the majority of Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068973"></A>
All of this is in the rather unique environment of being a unicameral parliament--that is, having only a lower house and not an upper house. I must support the comments made by a number of members whom I have heard speak in the House that this is probably a far more beneficial response than reinstating the upper house. It is certainly more cost-effective for Queenslanders and for the taxpayers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072273"></A>
Combined, these deficits have led to scepticism and cynicism by not only opposition parties but also certainly the broader community, particularly with respect to accountability, transparency and scrutiny of legislation, public policy and public administration. This cynicism is perhaps best exemplified through the farce that is the current budget estimates process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072274"></A>
In what I can only describe as a highly risk managed piece of theatre, shadow ministers ask a range of questions from the serious to the scuttlebutt while ministers dodge, weave, prevaricate, stall or simply blatantly refuse to answer them. The majority of questions asked relate to previous expenditure, not to examining the budget for the year to come. The time allocations--for example, two hours of questioning for a Health portfolio of some $8 billion--mean that the real focus for both sides becomes nailing that seven-second grab for the media, not seriously questioning the operations and expenditure of the public administration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072276"></A>
Reform is needed. Change is needed. But change can be unnerving for many. Whilst I lean to the side that embraces change, I do not believe in change for change’s sake, which is why I do cautiously study any elements of change. In studying the review of the Queensland parliamentary committee system I see much to be applauded and certainly a lot to adopt. At the outset I, too, commend the committee members who prepared this committee report for their bipartisanship and their openness. If that sentiment and the sentiment of this report is translated into practice, it certainly could herald in a new era of cross-party cooperation on ensuring the legislation passed in this House is of the highest quality. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr POWELL:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am certainly not holding my breath, member for Nanango. The establishment of statutory portfolio based committees will ensure greater parliamentary scrutiny of bills, subordinate legislation, regulations, public works and public accounts by those who understand these portfolios best. For instance, the opposition will now be able to place shadow ministers and shadow parliamentary secretaries on portfolio relevant committees. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072281"></A>
I do at this point want to raise a word of caution and a word of warning. As a current member of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee, I cannot stress enough the importance of examining legislative compliance with fundamental legislative principles--principles we all hold dear; principles such as natural justice, the rights and liberties of the individual, rights to privacy, the onus of proof, retrospective operation of legislation, Aboriginal tradition and Islander custom and the delegation of legislative power. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072282"></A>
As the review committee identified, every jurisdiction they studied has some form of legislative scrutiny against fundamental principles and/or human rights. I understand that the review committee was impressed by the New Zealand model. I note that the member for Gaven went into some detail regarding that model. I also note that the review committee has not chosen to implement the complementary New Zealand bodies of the Legislation Advisory Committee nor the Regulations Review Committee. It has chosen to put the scrutiny under these portfolio based committees without establishing the necessary bodies to assist those committees in conducting that sort of scrutiny. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072285"></A>
In New Zealand the Legislation Advisory Committee is not actually made up of parliamentarians at all. It includes law commissioners, academic public law specialists, senior private and public sector lawyers as well as senior policy advisers, parliamentary counsel and senior members of the judiciary. Although it is serviced by the Ministry of Justice and reports annually to the Attorney-General on its activities, its varied membership facilitates independence from the executive and another level of parliamentary and legislative scrutiny. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072286"></A>
The Regulations Review Committee, on the other hand, is a specialist committee dedicated to the technical scrutiny of subordinate legislation using criteria set out in the standing orders. This scrutiny in New Zealand is not an add-on; it is an intrinsic part of ensuring the legislation they pass is of the highest quality possible. It should be the same for the Queensland parliament. Scrutiny of legislation against fundamental legislative principles should not be an add-on. It has to be an intrinsic part of ensuring that legislation that we pass is also of the highest quality possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072287"></A>
These new portfolio based committees must ensure this scrutiny occurs, as directed by recommendations 6 and 7 of this report. I would ask that the committees ensure that scrutiny against fundamental legislative principles becomes a specific standing agenda item at all of their meetings and that committees report annually on their compliance with these recommendations and against those principles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072288"></A>
Returning to the other recommendations, I applaud the establishment of the Committee of the Legislative Assembly, the CLA, incorporating the most senior members of both the government and the opposition. I am also pleased to hear that the government potentially is flexed and is proposing, or at least talking about, including the Speaker as an ex officio member of this committee and that this committee, rather than the Department of Public Works, will oversee the construction and maintenance of the parliamentary buildings and electorate offices. These were certainly some concerns of mine from my initial reading of the report. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072290"></A>
I am pleased to hear that the CLA will also determine the budget and the resources of committees and make submissions to government to ensure the committees of parliament are sufficiently resourced. There were some conversations occurring about this here earlier. If the government is intent on making these changes cost neutral then I have serious concerns. My hope is that as part of this reform we are actually going to resource the committees to the level that they actually require to do the job properly. That may not be cost neutral. Either way, it is certainly going to be far cheaper than reinstating an upper house, as the member for Toowoomba North highlighted earlier. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072291"></A>
The proposal to allocate time within the parliamentary week for committees is eminently sensible and embeds the role of committees well and truly into the work of the parliament as a whole. The restructuring of standing orders and speaking times in particular also makes sense given the level of discussion and debate that will now occur through the portfolio based committees. The opening of committee proceedings to the public is also commendable. I hope that this will go a long way to addressing what both the member for Indooroopilly and I have previously stated--that is, people really do not know that committees exist let alone understand what they do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072292"></A>
The recommendations that budget estimates be considered by portfolio committees without restricted, structured time frames for questions and answers will go a long way to turning farce into functionality. By allowing the attendance of officials before committees, estimates will potentially become truly transparent and accountable, as they should be. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072293"></A>
As I said earlier, reform is needed. Change is needed. Change can be challenging though. But in this instance change will deliver more transparent and accountable public administration, higher quality legislation and ultimately better outcomes for Queenslanders. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(4.46 pm): It is with great pleasure and a sense of anticipation that I rise to contribute to this debate about the review of the Queensland parliamentary committee system. At the outset, I would like to thank and commend the members of the committee for their thoughtful and thought-provoking report. I think it is very possible and desirable that the report will lead to some very far-reaching reforms to the way this parliament operates. </Hansard-Body>

Strengthening the role of committees through the changes recommended in the report of the review committee will, I believe, produce a better democratic system overall, a better parliament, better MPs, better government, better legislation and more opportunity for effective scrutiny of executive government. I have confidence that a strengthened committee system is warranted, based, at least in part, on my own experience in this place as a member of three estimates committees, a member of the Legal, Constitutional and Administrative Review Committee, a member of the Investigation into Altruistic Surrogacy Select Committee and currently as a member of the Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072301"></A>
Leaving aside the way in which estimates committees currently work for the time being, I can say that some of the most rewarding work I have undertaken as a member of parliament has been in those committees. By and large, committee work provides an opportunity for MPs to consider important matters of public policy and administration, less fettered by partisan consideration than in other settings and forums where an MP undertakes their work. In some cases, such as in the exercise by the Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee of certain statutory functions, the resolutions of the committee are required to be bipartisan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072302"></A>
Whilst I am on the topic of the PCMC, I might just mention, because the observations of the member for Toowoomba North are fresh in my mind, that I agree with his remarks about the proposed incorporation of lay members on the Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee. I can understand why the review committee has given consideration to that proposal. I think it is a proposal, in those circumstances, worthy of consideration. But in my experience--limited as it is as a member of that committee--having regard to the very sensitive and highly confidential nature of much of that committee’s work, it is difficult for me to imagine circumstances where a lay person would be able to take part in the committee’s deliberations in a way that would add to its effectiveness. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072338"></A>
In most cases, the work of the committees in which I have been involved has been achieved without bringing partisan politics into those debates and considerations. That is, for the most part, a good thing. Not only does it produce better reports, but it provides opportunities for MPs to bring their education, their qualifications, their values, their personal opinions and their experience of life to bear on the matters before them. Happily, my experience of committee work has been a positive one and has possibly led to some major reforms. That is why I see so much potential in expanding and strengthening the role of committees. In particular, giving portfolio based committees a role to consider bills before the second reading is one of the most important reforms contained in the recommendations of the committee. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072341"></A>
I have no doubt that subjecting bills to the scrutiny of MPs in committee will produce better law. This will occur because they will detect and rectify minor or technical defects through to more substantive amendments. Of course, not all amendments will necessarily be agreed to by the government of the day or be passed by the parliament, but the debate will be more informed and the public will have an opportunity to better understand the pros and cons of proceeding in a particular way.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072342"></A>
Affording members of the public an opportunity to take part in this process is a significant and historic reform. Neither ministers, their advisers, their departmental officials nor MPs themselves can claim a monopoly of wisdom in the development and formulation of legislation. I acknowledge already that there are many ways in which stakeholders and members of the public can be and are consulted and provided with opportunities to give feedback on proposed legislation. That is a good thing that that occurs, but formalising those arrangements within the context of committee hearings is a significant step forward. It will broaden the range of people and organisations that will take part in the process and it will improve the quality of the submissions. Therefore, it will enhance the ability of us as legislators to frame good law.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072343"></A>
As well as establishing portfolio based committees to examine legislation, it is proposed that the committees will incorporate the role of the Public Accounts and Public Works Committee and also become the estimates committees. These changes make sense and will enable the members of those committees to develop expertise in those portfolio areas that will in turn enable more effective scrutiny and more effective representation of their constituents and constituencies.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072345"></A>
The reform of the estimates process to enable CEOs and statutory officers to be asked questions will give effect to one of the very important objectives of the estimates process, which is to provide opportunities for accurate information to be elicited in connection with the expenditure of public moneys. Provided that the power to ask questions of public officials is exercised responsibly and respectfully and the exercise does not become a witch-hunt, this reform will tend to reduce the imperative for defensive responses and significantly improve the flow of information which is at the heart of the estimates process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072346"></A>
There are many other worthy recommendations in the report. I am delighted that this parliament has the opportunity to consider the report today and debate and discuss its recommendations. I think it is one of the most significant and fundamental historic set of reforms this parliament has had to consider for a very, very long time. I consider it a great privilege and matter of good fortune that I am able to take part in that debate and consider those reforms. Ultimately, I hope to be in a position to see their implementation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072347"></A>
I would like to conclude on this note: to make these reforms work and to make them effective, many of them--although not all of them--will require a considerable degree of resourcing. The members we have heard from so far in this debate have indicated that the essence of those reforms are supported across both sides of the House and that there is a need for resources to be brought to bear. That gives me confidence that that level of support will continue in a bipartisan way when those decisions are to be made, which will thereby make the decisions the government will need to make to resource these reforms that much easier and that much sooner. That is something which I think we can all look forward to. With those remarks, I once again thank all of the members of the committee for their thorough work and thorough consideration of the matters that have been brought forward. I commend the report.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110309_165627" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Everton--ALP) (4.56 pm): I too rise to speak in support of this motion. The last couple of decades have seen tremendous reforms to improve the accountability of government in Queensland. This approach to accountability has been a hallmark of the Goss, Beattie and now Bligh Labor governments. The Goss government, beginning in 1989, established estimates committees, fair electoral boundaries, freedom of information laws and the Criminal Justice Commission. Following it, the Beattie government established the Crime and Misconduct Commission, the Integrity Commissioner and the Information Commissioner. Over the last couple of years, the Bligh government has introduced refreshed right to information laws, restrictions on lobbyists and, more recently, restrictions on political donations. </A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1072356"></A>
The reforms that are foreshadowed by this motion are another fantastic step in improving the accountability of government in Queensland. I am pleased that in this instance the opposition has been a willing partner in undertaking those reforms. It is a feature of Westminster parliaments, such as the Queensland parliament, that there is a system of committees of parliamentarians to inquire into the activities of government. As a first-term member of this House, I cannot compare the current committee system to what has come before, but many more experienced members have spoken today about the deterioration in influence and effectiveness of the committee system. Certainly, my own experience since I was elected and in my time as a ministerial adviser is that on many occasions committees have had limited impact on the operations of government. Personally, I do believe that this is at least partly due to the less than diligent attitude shown by some members of those committees, but I do accept that there are probably also some systemic barriers to committees functioning effectively as well.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072357"></A>
As has been mentioned previously, the reforms proposed in this motion arise from the recommendations of a bipartisan committee of parliamentarians. Like many other speakers, I commend that committee on its work. I understand that its work was undertaken in a cooperative and bipartisan spirit, and that attitude has led to some constructive suggestions that will improve government accountability. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1072358"></A>
I am going to touch on a couple of the recommendations of the committee. The first is its recommendation that the current committees be replaced by nine portfolio based committees, the Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee and a Committee of the Legislative Assembly. I think it does make sense to expand the committees to give them more of a portfolio focus. I think this move will allow for greater specialisation among parliamentarians and the nature of their inquiries. It will allow committees to delve into greater detail when approaching things at a portfolio level than is currently the case when a committee’s activities are spread across a number of portfolios.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075875"></A>
I also support the committee’s recommendation that the new parliamentary committees have a greater role in interrogating bills prior to them being debated in the House. I think we all have to admit that the current system does not allow for particularly detailed consideration of bills to determine their impact on a member’s electorate or how they accord with a member’s own values or those of their political party. I believe that empowering the new committees to scrutinise bills will result in better legislation and it will allow members of parliament to better do the job they all came here to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075876"></A>
To conclude, our system of democracy functions only when it has a competent, diligent opposition and effective transparent systems of holding the government to account. These reforms are another plank in establishing such systems. They will go a long way towards continuing to make the Queensland government more accountable. I commend the motion to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs PRATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 But it was never debated in the House as such. I think that this could be the first step towards something great for Queensland. But there is something I would like to correct. The chair stated that I have been here for just over 10 years. In fact, I was elected to this House in 1998 with Jeff Seeney. So come June, I will have been here for 13 years. So if the chair does not mind, and just to get the record straight, those years could be added to make our experience that little bit more. Believe me, you remember every year you have been here. It can be one of those journeys in life. I do not think there are many jobs quite like this one. Every year has memorable events. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075888"></A>
I am going to be very honest here--and I hope I have always been as honest as I possibly could--and say that I came to parliament with a very naive view of how parliament worked, and I believe a lot of people in my electorate also believed parliament worked that way. That was it. We thought that parliament worked in a certain way. I can tell members that probably within three months I was totally disillusioned. I can also say that, since I got on to this committee, I now have a little bit of hope. It took a long time. This new committee system should work well and it needs to work well with the goodwill of everybody in the House and of future politicians to come. In fact, I would rather not see politicians but statesmen and women, because then I know the committee system really would work. But like I said, I am a naive person in a lot of ways and I am probably going to prove that in my speech today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075889"></A>
As the chair said, there were compromises made and I believe that everyone came in knowing that the committee system, as it has existed in the time I have been here and probably since everybody else has been here, had perhaps deteriorated in its value to Queensland and really was in need of reform. I am under no illusion that we have it 100 per cent right, but I believe this proposal is a great foundation and a great step forward for this parliament. It can be built on and changes made when needed. But as I said, this proposal relies on the goodwill of everybody in this chamber to change the mind-set. To make this new committee system work requires a huge, fundamental change in our way of thinking. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075890"></A>
We all saw the committee system in New Zealand. For me, at that point I could see the reality of what the committee system could be and I will work very hard in the time that I am here--and I hope everyone who was on the committee will do the same--to try to make it work in the best possible way. In saying that, I do not believe that the committee system should be jeopardised in any way, shape or form by not being funded correctly. It is going to need extra dollars. As has been stated before, there has to be dedicated committee rooms, there has to be the research staff and the allocation of funds to do the job properly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075891"></A>
If and when this proposal gets through, everybody in this chamber will have to pull their weight. I can say that I am pretty sure that everyone in this chamber could say that they have not pulled their weight every minute of every day that they have been here. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs PRATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is exactly right. I know that in the country for every dollar we spend we expect at least $5 back in effort, and I think that is what we have to do. The thing I like about this proposal is that every single member of this chamber will be working hard. They will be having to read and study the legislation. They will have to communicate with the general public and with each other. Without the adversarial carrying on that goes on in the chamber, members can put forward their ideas to the committee knowing that there is not just going to be a blank minister’s face in front of them. We all know that in here, once a bill is tabled, it is going to go through anyway with virtually no change at all. It is a fait accompli. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075896"></A>
The question I often ask myself--and I ask my husband--is, ‘Why do I even bother?’ ‘Why does a person come down here and sit here just to go through a show?’ That is exactly right. It is because I care and I do not believe that all legislation is correct. I do not believe that it is all wrong, either. If we do not have a say, then the legislation goes through as though everybody is happy. Everybody is not always happy. Under this proposal, everybody has a chance to have a say. Everybody can put in their two bob’s worth, get it considered and possibly have it incorporated or get changes made. If this committee system works even half as well as it does in New Zealand, I think we would have made a major leap forward. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075897"></A>
Often over the past almost 13 years that I have been here I have been at meetings where opposition members have attended. The very first time I went to a meeting Rob Borbidge was the Leader of the Opposition. I was very green then. We were sitting there and I said, ‘No, let Rob talk first,’ because I wanted to hear what he had to say--mainly because I was so green. He said, ‘We can do this and we can do that’--meaning the opposition. At the end I could not stand it anymore and I said to him and the other people at the meeting, ‘With all due respect, Rob, you cannot do anything until you are in government. So you are as ineffective as anybody else in the chamber.’ That is how it has really been. We can yell and we can rant and rave in this place, but it is just hot air going around because we know that when that legislation is tabled it is a done and dusted deal. To me, that has been the most disillusioning part of being in this chamber. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1075898"></A>
Under this proposal, everybody has a chance to make an input. There is no loss of face, if you want to call it that, because something has had to be changed. It is beholden on every one of us to make sure that the best possible legislation comes into this House. Often we come into this House and legislation is tabled. At times the amendments to the legislation can be greater in volume than the actual bill. We should have got it right in the first place. Hopefully under this proposal that will occur. There are so many things that a few members of government cannot come up with. A few bureaucrats cannot always get it right. But when you have everyone in the chamber working for the betterment of Queensland for the best legislation, when you have every interested party outside these walls also being able to contribute their ideas, we must get closer and closer to getting the best possible legislation for the state. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1079334"></A>
There is no doubt that I have concerns about certain parts of the report. As has been said, there were compromises made and it may not necessarily be as good as it possibly could be. We have looked at other jurisdictions. I believe that we have taken what was the best of those jurisdictions and hopefully it will work. That is all part of growing. It is about not being afraid to look elsewhere and to pick up other people’s ideas. A saying I have always liked is that a good idea is worth stealing. I have no problem with that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079335"></A>
To reform the Queensland parliament is a good idea. I think it is very sad that a person like myself, who had such faith in democracy and the system, could be so disillusioned by being part of the system for so long. To me, that is probably the saddest thing of all about this parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079336"></A>
The majority of speakers so far have supported this change. The government is supporting it and those who have spoken from the opposition are also supporting it. Hopefully most of the Independents will support it, although there may be reservations. That is what this chamber is for. There were only nine members on that committee and there are 89 in this chamber. All 89 members need to make a contribution to the process. I will not go any further. I was proud to be on that committee. I enjoyed working with the chair and the members of the committee. I thank them. We had great staff who worked hard on this. They put in a lot of effort. Every committee needs staff of that quality. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079337"></A>
In the past, committee reports have been lost in the ether. I cannot remember any report that has been tabled in parliament about which I have heard what happened subsequently. Was there any progress made in the areas where we tried to help people? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079338"></A>
I have to be quite honest and say that I find estimates committees as frustrating as all get-up. They were frustrating to me because there were times when I wanted to question people for a long time and there was no time at all. In New Zealand, if I recall correctly, if a committee had very little to be questioned on it only went for an hour or so, but if they had a lot to be questioned on it did not just finish at the end of that day; it was brought on the next day and the next day, too, until everyone was happy. There is much that we as a parliament can learn. I hope that we have picked out the best of what we have studied and that every member of this House will give their ideas and their opinions here today because we need them. That is what it is all about. Hopefully we have made a huge leap forward for Queensland when it comes to democracy and this the people’s parliament.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1079349"></A>
The Committee System Review Committee members believe we can transform the way the Queensland Parliament operates by giving members greater responsibility for the scrutiny of the executive; by using the parliament to enliven the executive to their constituents concerns; by ensuring that every Queenslander has the opportunity to have a say on laws that may affect them; and by giving the parliament a committee system that is strong and dedicated to the purpose of scrutiny, review and deliberation. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

I must say that in the two years I have been in this place that certainly has not happened. I take the point that the member for Nanango made in relation to the disappointment in the way the place has worked in the past. I could go on about that but let us move forward. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079355"></A>
If one was going to create a new parliament today, how would one do it? Interestingly enough, it is probably very similar to the one that we are in the midst of creating here today. I have visited several parliaments, including the Scottish parliament. As members would know, the Scottish parliament has been in existence for about 11 years and it has a very strong parliamentary committee system. In fact, I must admit that when I did the tour--a very special tour of the parliament laid on thanks to the Clerk of the Parliament here arranging it for me--I was most impressed with the committee rooms and the way those committee rooms are set up. I was thinking then, ‘Am I missing something here? There is something very wrong here.’ A unicameral parliament with the committee system that the Scottish parliament has and the facilities that the Scottish parliament has is certainly very, very impressive. The executive summary in the report states further--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1079357"></A>
It is now time for committees to take on a greater role in examination of executive action across all the policy areas of government and in considering proposed legislation, building on the moves made in this direction in early 2009. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1079358"></A>
How true that is when we consider that we are coming forward in leaps and bounds. The suggestion in the report is that there be nine committees--I have heard that there may be some variation on that and that, of course, will be fleshed out over time--with a subject based jurisdiction, which is absolutely wonderful, mirroring the various portfolio areas of government. It goes on to say that the following functions are part of that nine-committee system--</Hansard-Body>

I think we are all going to learn something as part of this process--something that we probably have not been learning a great deal about certainly in the time that I have been here. I have to confess that I have not studied each and every bill that has come through this place. Continuing with those functions--</Hansard-Body>

Turning to the recommendations that are made in this report, recommendation 1 states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1079371"></A>
The Committee recommends that in place of the current committees there be the following committees: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1079372"></A>
•	nine statutory portfolio based committees to cover the array of government activities </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1079373"></A>
•	the Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1079374"></A>
•	a Committee of the Legislative Assembly. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082928"></A>
Once again, it is a strong structure that is going to be of great benefit to this place as we move forward. It will deliver what the people of Queensland deserve, which is appropriate legislation properly researched and properly fleshed out in that committee system. Recommendation 21 states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1082932"></A>
The Committee recommends that all bills, with the exception of those deemed ‘urgent’, be referred to portfolio committees for inquiry and report, using a model that achieves the following:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1082933"></A>
•	there shall be a presumption that the Legislature will refer legislation to a committee, and any exceptions must be transparent, narrowly-defined, and extraordinary in nature</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1082934"></A>
That is a very powerful sentence: ‘narrowly-defined, and extraordinary in nature’. The people of Queensland will not bear this committee system being used on an ad hoc basis when, in reality, it should be used for the majority of legislation that comes through this place. The recommendation goes on to state--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1082935"></A>
•	committees shall scrutinise legislation referred to them and have the power to recommend amendments</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1082936"></A>
•	opportunities shall be given for public input into the legislative process.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082937"></A>
That is all very well and fine, but I do have one question. I note that in the committee system in Scotland, which I was referring to earlier, the committees have the opportunity to initiate legislation. I wonder whether or not that possibility will exist in this place for our committees. They will end up with a wealth of knowledge and experience from the various testaments that come to them and the various people who talk about their needs. I wonder whether it will be possible for the committees to initiate legislation in their own right. Of course, all individual members have the capacity to do that, but a well-resourced and staffed committee would be perfectly positioned to see any holes in legislation. I believe consideration should be given to that proposition. Recommendation 31 states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1082939"></A>
The Committee recommends that the maximum timeframe for committees to inquire and report on bills be six months.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1082940"></A>
Is it anticipated that that be the exception or the rule? Six months is a long time. We expect most legislation to be dealt with fairly quickly. I note that recommendation 32 states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1082941"></A>
The Committee recommends that Standing Orders be amended to provide that committees must report on a bill within six months of the bill being referred to it or by such other time as fixed by the Committee of the Legislative Assembly.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1082942"></A>
Does that mean that it could be longer? Does that mean that, in most cases, we will see them turning things around in a four-week or six-week period? I am curious about that recommendation.</Hansard-Body-Continued>

<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Schwarten:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 You have to manage your own workload.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082944"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CRANDON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is absolutely right. I take the interjection. They will be managing their own workload, but how will that recommendation be fleshed out? That sort of consideration should be taken in hand. It seems to me that there might a conflict in the terminology used in recommendations 33 and 34. Recommendation 33 states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1082946"></A>
The Committee recommends that bills be set down for the second reading a minimum of three sitting days after a committee reports.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1082947"></A>
In effect, that would probably mean the next sitting week. Recommendation 34 states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1082949"></A>
The Committee recommends that Standing Orders be amended to provide that following the presentation of a committee report on a bill, the bill is set down for second reading on the third sitting day following.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1157073"></A>
Recommendation 33 refers to a minimum of three sitting days and recommendation 34 states that it will be set down for second reading on the third sitting day. Is there a conflict there in the terminology? Having asked those few questions, and hopefully they will be answered, I finish simply by saying that I look forward to working in this place in this new paradigm and to making a difference for all Queenslanders.<Hansard-Speech-End>

One of the key functions of a parliament is scrutiny of the executive. Proper scrutiny of the executive helps to ensure accountability and transparency and in turn better administration.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082959"></A>
In Queensland we have a parliament that is essentially a two-party system, with 89 members elected from single member consistencies through an optional preferential voting system. The levels of scrutiny that are provided in other jurisdictions in Australia by upper houses has not been available in Queensland since 1922. As other members have observed, I do not think we would be able to sell the Queensland people on more politicians by reinstating the upper house. Certainly, I would be opposed to that. Therefore, the parliamentary committee system is more important in Queensland than in any other jurisdiction. In Queensland we had an ineffective committee system until the advent of the Fitzgerald inquiry which established the modern committee system, with some variations in 2009.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082960"></A>
This report recommends nine committees. Their functions would be to monitor and review all issues and executive actions, including operational matters and events; the consideration of proposed legislation, both from a policy point of view and to ensure compliance with fundamental legislative principles; the scrutiny of the estimates; and the ability to consider petitions. The government intends to form, by resolution of the House, a Committee of the Legislative Assembly to consider issues surrounding the implementation of the review’s recommendations, including the formation of the committees. It is proposed that each committee have six members and that the chair have both a deliberative and a casting vote. I agree with many of the comments that have been made in this place, but I particularly agree with the comments made by the member for Toowoomba North about the problems that could be created by having lay members sit on the Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Committee. Certainly that step should be approached with caution.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157547"></A>
The new structure proposes greater consideration by the parliament of committee reports and that those committees be supported by adequate funding, staffing, accommodation and other resourcing. Proposed amendments to the committee system will lead to a more efficient use of the time available to this parliament. Recommendation 26 proposes that following the first reading stage, the introducing Member shall move that the bill be referred to a particular portfolio committee. Recommendation 31 proposes that the maximum timeframe for committees to inquire and report on bills be six months. That can be varied by the Committee of the Legislative Assembly pursuant to recommendation 32, assuming that in most cases that may well be shortened.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082964"></A>
Given the lengthy and exhaustive consideration of bills by the proposed new committee structure, recommendation 35 proposes a reduction in the time limits for the second reading debate. In this particular report I was most attracted to recommendation 36, because it would allow the following time limits during a second reading debate: the Leader of the Opposition, one hour to reply; members of portfolio committees, 20 minutes; all other members, 10 minutes; and the mover in reply, 30 minutes. That will be a huge step forward and will lead to a great saving of time for parliament. Too many members seem to think it is compulsory to speak on bills for 20 minutes. In fact, many do not even deliver a 20-minute speech; they deliver a five-minute speech four times, just to use up their 20 minutes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082965"></A>
I support the motion to note the report. I commend the committee on the excellent work that it has done, which has resulted in this report. The committee has worked hard and obviously with goodwill, as evidenced by this unanimous report. That is commendable given the make-up of the committee, which included both members of the LNP, the government and an Independent member. They have certainly worked with goodwill. I commend the committee on the report.<Hansard-Speech-End>

It was an honour to serve as a member on the Committee System Review Committee and to participate in developing a reform program for the functioning of the parliament and, in doing so, recommend changes that deliver great input for all Queenslanders in the legislative process. This forms the parliamentary and democracy reforms of the government’s integrity review which also includes the recently announced campaign finance reforms. </A></Hansard-Body>

The debate about whether Queensland should retain its unicameral structure emerges regularly. Whilst there is a range of views on this matter, the debate usually revolves around the greatest benefit being an upper house and more elected representatives or a more rigorous and better informed committee system. For the record, I do not believe that Queensland would be better served by the re-creation of an upper house. In fact, I do not believe there is community benefit in upper houses at the state level in the Australian democracy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086646"></A>
State governments are service delivery and administrative arms of government which effectively prioritise expenditure that has been raised and allocated by another level of government. This differs from the federal level, where the government has vast revenue powers including collection and expenditure of income and consumption based taxes for all Australians as well as determining signatures to international covenants and decisions to commit Australian troops. It is reasonable that these fundamental decisions on the rights, freedoms and prosperity of a nation be made with a check and balance that includes elected representatives of the states. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086647"></A>
The report we consider today will change both the culture and functioning of the Queensland parliament. The most significant reform is the development of portfolio based committees which will consider legislation in the period between its introduction to and debate in the House. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1090867"></A>
5)	Ensure no more exploration permits or other mining authorities are issued and no existing permits or other mining authorities are renewed for the Darling Downs region until a statutory regional plan is established identifying appropriate land uses across the region and giving statutory legal protection for prime agricultural land and establishing statutory separation distances between all resource industry authorities and urban areas.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086658"></A>
I want to consider the motion before the House in two separate parts. The first part of the motion condemns the incompetence of the former minister for mines and energy in issuing an exploration permit over a closely settled area at Gowrie Junction near Toowoomba and calls on the newly appointed minister to recognise the grave concern, the emotional turmoil and the negative impact on property prices that the EP has caused and immediately make whatever legislative changes are necessary to revoke the permit to ensure that, no matter how remote, a mine can never be established in what is an entirely unsuitable area for mining. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086660"></A>
Anybody who knows that area knows that that last statement is undoubtedly true. It is undoubtedly true that the Gowrie area is completely unsuitable for mining. The minister admitted as much this morning in this House when he spoke about the issuance of exploration permits. There is no question that it is a totally unsuitable area for mining and there should have been no question in the minister’s mind when he issued the exploration permit that it was going to produce a terrible reaction, a terrible effect, a terrible impact on the people who live in that area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086662"></A>
Unfortunately, at the moment there is a heightened atmosphere of distrust of the resources industry--a great industry for Queensland, an industry that I have supported in this place over and over again and will continue to support. There is a degree of heightened emotion out there, especially in this area of the Darling Downs. For the former minister to issue an exploration permit over an area such as Gowrie was gross incompetence, and he should be condemned for that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086664"></A>
The broader issue here is the need to recognise that the impact of mining does not start when the ground is dug up. The minister needs to understand that the legislation needs to change in order to recognise that the issuance of such mining titles has a great impact on people’s lives. The issuance of an exploration permit causes an impact on the people who live in that particular area, especially when it is a closely settled urban area such as Gowrie. We have seen that impact expressed in the anger and the frustration of people who have to contemplate the possibility, no matter how remote, that a mine is going to be constructed in their area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086666"></A>
It is almost impossible to explain to a member of the general public that just because an exploration permit has been issued it does not mean that a mine will be built. As one very angry lady said to me in Toowoomba last weekend, ‘Why would they be looking for coal if they are not going to mine coal?’ It is a logic that is understandable amongst the general public. It is all very well for Michael Roche and the QRC to suggest that people have to go through some sort of a long, convoluted process to identify the impacts. However, the impacts begin when the title is issued. There is no greater example of that than what we have seen at Gowrie, at Toowoomba, at Felton and at so many other places. The issuance of a title causes the impact. People who suffer that impact get no input, get no say and are not even advised before those titles are issued. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086671"></A>
The legislation needs to be fixed; it needs to be changed. At the moment, all of the decision making is at the end of a long, convoluted process that can drag on for years. At the end of that EIS process a decision is made about the social acceptability and the environmental acceptability of a particular mining project. Much of that decision making needs to be moved to the front of the process. There needs to be an assessment at the beginning, when the exploration permit is applied for, of whether or not there is a reasonable chance that a project in that area is going to be socially acceptable, whether or not there is a reasonable chance that a project in that area is going to be environmentally acceptable and whether or not there is a reasonable chance that the exploration is going to produce something of worth that justifies the impact that it has on the local community. That local community has to live with doubt, fear and trepidation for the five, seven or 10 years it takes for that process to be completed. It is a totally unacceptable impact. It causes enormous stress on individuals. It causes enormous doubt. It causes people’s lives to be disrupted. It causes falls in property prices--quite dramatic falls--which people have to endure for years until they receive some sort of a conclusion to the long, convoluted EIS process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086672"></A>
It is bad enough that people have to endure that sort of process in areas that are highly prospective, in areas where there is a real chance that a mine can be developed. In those areas there is no other option. I accept that in those areas that is the reality. However, in areas where it is almost impossible to conceive of a mine being developed--such as Gowrie Junction near Toowoomba--residents should not be subjected to those five, seven or 10 years of doubt, fear and trepidation. There is no justification for that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086674"></A>
This is the result of an incompetent minister who did not understand the impact of the action that he was taking, who did not understand the impact of the mining title that he was issuing. This House should condemn the former minister as being incompetent in that action. This House should insist that the current minister recognise the impact that that absurd issuance of such a title has had on so many innocent Queenslanders and move to rectify that, move to implement whatever legislation is required to take away that doubt, that fear, that uncertainty that is hanging over that community. Unless the minister acts, it will continue to hang over that community for five, seven or 10 years into the future. It is a totally unacceptable situation and the minister must move to rectify it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086675"></A>
The second part of the motion before the House calls on the minister to enforce the provisions of section 147A of the Mineral Resources Act in relation to all of the other exploration permits that exist across the Darling Downs in areas where it is almost impossible to conceive of a coalmine being developed. Yet those permits exist and they cause uncertainty, trepidation and fear for the people who live there. I speak of places such as the Felton Valley, where residents’ lives have been put in limbo for so long now by a project that continues to change in concept every time we hear about it. We wonder how much real chance those projects have of becoming reality. How much real chance does a project such as this one at Felton have of ever becoming a reality? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086680"></A>
What is a reality is the impact that has on people’s lives, the destruction it brings to families, to businesses and to the value of the assets that, in many cases, form their superannuation and their entire asset base. They have to live with that uncertainty and that fear for years while mining companies dither and dream and carry on with projects that, in real terms, could be seen as completely unrealistic. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086716"></A>
The whole issue of prime agricultural land is one that the minister needs to address. He needs to apply this section of the Mineral Resources Act to those mining authorities on that prime agricultural land to give some substance to the government’s words that they are committed, as we are committed, to protecting that prime agricultural land. The best way to protect that prime agricultural land, the best way to address many of these problems that exist across the Darling Downs and the more closely settled areas in the vicinity of Toowoomba, is by a regional planning process that should have been done by now--a regional planning process that ensures proper separation distances between mining industries and urban areas, a regional planning process that identifies the prime agricultural land that should be protected and that identifies the places where mines can be built and where permits can be issued, and a regional planning process that avoids the sort of community impact that we have seen caused by an incompetent government that does not understand the impact of the actions that it takes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086721"></A>
There is a chance in this parliament tonight for the new minister to show whether he understands the impact of the mining authorities that he issues. There is a chance for the new minister to show that he is prepared to take the actions that are long overdue in terms of a regional planning process that should ensure the proper separation distances between what can be competing industries. The mining industry is a great industry but so is agriculture and so is the lifestyle of the Darling Downs, and they all should be protected. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, I know, Mr Speaker, but I am happy to do it because it is that important. It is not just about mining but about agriculture and lifestyle, as the member for Callide just pointed out at the end of his contribution. We are seeking to rectify and remedy these unfair decisions made by the Bligh government that have caused great disquiet and upset in these affected communities. I saw it just last Sunday and Monday when I was in Toowoomba with my shadow cabinet. People were deeply concerned and angry that the government has granted this exploration permit for coal in this area between Gowrie Junction and Kingsthorpe. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086734"></A>
If successful, this joint venture between Australia Pacific Coal and Blackwood Coal could see an open-cut coalmine in operation on the outskirts of Toowoomba just minutes away from Highfields. A couple of hundred people turned up to express their concerns to our shadow cabinet in Toowoomba and, as the member for Callide, the shadow minister, has just pointed out, they are genuine concerns felt by young people, by elderly people, by people who are very upset about the uncertainty that has been put upon them. I expect many more to turn up to protest at the government’s community cabinet meeting in Toowoomba. When they do turn up, as I know they will, I encourage the government to give them a fair hearing and recognise the genuine concerns that these people hold for the future--for the future of their city, for the future of their families, for the future of their economic and financial security as well. </Hansard-Body>

 I say to the member for Toowoomba North who is here that I hope he will be there standing with some of his constituents who are relatives of people in these areas and who are concerned. He needs to be there to respond to this community’s justified anger. The people of Toowoomba have put their faith in the member for Toowoomba North for a number of years now, and it is time for him to stand up on behalf of his community and get this government to revoke this exploration permit at Gowrie. The government should admit that they were wrong and admit that this permit should never have been approved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086740"></A>
Most of the group that came to see us in Toowoomba were from the Toowoomba Coal Mine Action Group, a group of residents and families that was formed in response to this issue. They held a community meeting on 18 February at the Gowrie Junction community hall. More than 700 people attended this meeting--a clear indication of the depth of feeling in that community. These people have a right to be concerned. They have a right to be angry. I understand that the first time they learned of this exploration permit was through one of their local newspapers. That is unacceptable. They live in a beautiful community, a community that they are now worried could experience a similar fate to Acland, which has been deserted since a coalmine was developed there years ago. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086741"></A>
They are worried about the increase of traffic on already bad roads, the impact on local tourism, and the pollution and dust that comes with this type of industry. As I was leaving Toowoomba and drove through the streets of Toowoomba, I was surrounded by B-doubles and trucks that go through the city. As we have heard from the member for Toowoomba South many times over the last number of years, up to 500 trucks every day go through 16 sets of traffic lights. Elderly ladies are concerned about driving because they are surrounded by these huge hulking vehicles. Many of these trucks do not appear to be covering their loads, and that is leading to the dust pollution and pollution from coal affecting people in these communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086742"></A>
I made a commitment to these people that an LNP government would rule out the approval of open-cut mining in environmentally sensitive, urban and prime agricultural areas. Under an LNP government, this type of exploration permit would never be granted. The <Hansard-Italic>
Toowoomba Chronicle</Hansard-Italic>
 conducted a poll asking: is Gowrie Junction too close to Toowoomba for a coalmine? Eighty-nine per cent of people said yes. We in the LNP wholeheartedly agree with that. Toowoomba Regional Council’s Mayor Peter Taylor has said his council is unanimously opposed to the mine and it should not go ahead in such a closely settled area. The area has been identified in council’s planning for future growth. Water has already been laid on and sewerage is also planned in their budget. I quote Mayor Taylor, ‘It is prime agricultural land, the best in the country, and it’s too close to Toowoomba and Highfields.’</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086745"></A>
The LNP made a commitment in March 2009 that we would protect prime agricultural land from mining. We stand by this commitment. We recognise the long-term need to preserve prime farmland for continued agriculture. We welcome the government’s recognition that prime agricultural land should be protected. However, we are still waiting for the detail. People want certainty, and I would encourage the government to release the mapping and identification of relevant areas to provide this certainty to landowners and the mining industry. We want the Mineral Resources Act to be enforced. We want to support and restore the peace of mind to good people whose lives have been affected by these government decisions. </Hansard-Body>

Queenslanders must once again be confused about the LNP’s stance on the mining industry and the jobs it brings to Queensland. Just yesterday the member for Callide stood in this House claiming the LNP supported Queensland’s resources industry. Today we hear that the LNP wants to place ad hoc limits on the mining industry and risk thousands of jobs for Queenslanders. Queenslanders should be confused and concerned. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086762"></A>
In relation to CSG mining, the Leader of the Opposition, whom we have just heard from, was yesterday quoted on ABC saying a moratorium was not the answer. He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086764"></A>
Those things need to be balanced with issues like sovereign risk. Sovereign risk that will say we can’t invest in Queensland because the government is coming out with moratoriums. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086765"></A>
Placing unpredictable and ad hoc limits on mining exploration will create a risk in the eyes of those looking to invest in our state and risk the jobs of the future for Queensland. Figures released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveal that some $990 million is being invested in mining exploration alone in Queensland. So let us be clear about this. This is a $990 million investment in the jobs of the future for a prosperous Queensland. Attempting to create rules and regulations that mean the government of the day can tear up an exploration permit on a whim will lead to uncertainty in the industry and a reluctance to invest in the state. That is why these commitments by the LNP are putting Queensland’s jobs of the future at risk. Not even Russ Hinze would have proposed something as ad hoc and irresponsible as this for Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086766"></A>
We understand community concerns. We certainly do. One of the first people who contacted me when I became minister for mining about these issues was the member for Toowoomba North. I did not hear from too many others. I heard from the member for Toowoomba North. He has been very active in raising questions on behalf of the people in his local area and has encouraged people to meet with me and other ministers this Sunday at community cabinet. I am looking forward to setting the record straight on some of the scaremongering that has come from those opposite. I want to make it absolutely clear. There is no application for a permit to start a mine at or near Kingsthorpe. There is no application for a permit to start a mine at or near Gowrie Junction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086801"></A>
There is a permit to explore an area as broad as 150 square kilometres. Companies are looking for what is in the ground, not proposing to dig it out. I have made that clear to the House. Laws already exclude exploration near places of residence, churches, sporting or community facilities, bores, dams, wells and permanent stockyards. We do not permit undermining in residential areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086802"></A>
Historically speaking, when the permission to explore is granted it is very rare for that land to ever be mined. As I have made clear and as can be seen in the amendment to the motion that I commend to members, less than one per cent of land explored for mining has a mining lease placed over it. Even if exploration reveals that a commercially viable operation will be possible, there are still so many boxes that a company must tick before operations can start. I am sure the Minister for Environment and Resource Management will go through that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086804"></A>
Once again we see the division among those opposite that this motion before the House is trying to paper over. I am sure that moving this motion in the House today left a bitter taste in the mouth of the member for Callide. He has clearly been rolled by the party room. It is all about the divided forces opposite--the old Country Party trying to roll the future for Queensland and overturn the understandings and arrangements that have been around this industry for many years. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 Let me get to it. As we know, all of the legislation that they are now relying on to ensure there are protections for their stakeholders, for their communities and for their farmers and the people they represent they opposed in this House. They opposed amendments to the Environmental Protection Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086817"></A>
Before I became the minister for environment I was actually doing my masters in environmental law. I examined when the Environmental Protection Act first came into play. I read all of the speeches you made where you said that it was going to be the end of the world--that this would stop development in Queensland, that this was attacking the heart of the industry, that mining companies would never be able to operate. You opposed all of those safeguards--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms JONES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The LNP--the then Liberal and National parties; we used to have a Liberal Party in those days--opposed the introduction of that act. Those opposite are now saying that they support those safeguards that we have relied upon and put into law. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086822"></A>
Let us be very clear about the heart of the matter that we are debating here. We are talking about an exploration permit at Gowrie Junction just outside Toowoomba, as members have acknowledged. The granting of an exploration permit, as the minister for mines highlighted and as the shadow minister is fully aware, does not indicate or prejudge automatic approval for a full-scale mine. He knows that. The reason it does not is that the laws I have highlighted, which those opposite opposed in this place, provide protection against that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086823"></A>
Any proponent managing a project of this nature would have to apply to the Coordinator-General to have the project declared a significant project under the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act. It would also be captured by the Environmental Protection Act, which those opposite opposed. This ensures there is an environmental impact statement process to be gone through which we, as the Department of Environment and Resource Management, also have a say in. We provide advice on what the conditions should be. Should this project proceed to assessment then the environmental impact statement would need to describe all the potential impacts on land, water--including flooding, which is one of the issues that the honourable member raised--and vegetation as well as, of course, the impact on the local community. Actions that the proponent would have to take to avoid and mitigate any adverse impacts would also need to be identified and addressed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086826"></A>
Before the project can be approved, the proponent will need to, as we have seen time and time again, demonstrate to the government that it can meet all the legislative and policy requirements that apply to that proposal. Once again these are the safeguards that this side of politics put into law in Queensland that those opposite opposed. They come in here tonight crying crocodile tears because suddenly it suits them. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms JONES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 What I am acknowledging is that we put safeguards in place in legislation for the very reasons you are highlighting tonight and you opposed them. I challenge anyone out there who thinks that the LNP in Queensland is going to safeguard their communities to look at all the promises they have already made to wind back the environmental legislation we have put in place in Queensland. It is a shame the shadow minister responsible for the Great Barrier Reef is not here because the LNP voted against its protection but it has a shadow minister responsible for Great Barrier Reef protection. That highlights where they stand on the environment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086829"></A>
What we are doing is continuing to expand the legislation that we have put in place to not only protect communities but also guard against environmental impacts. We will continue to do that. I note that members were interjecting about the strategic cropping land policy. That is something I am absolutely committed to. I am delighted that now, as the minister for natural resources, I can make that happen in Queensland. I am working overtime to deliver that for the communities that are waiting on that regulation. We will build on our record, not dismantle it like those opposite would. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Exploration permit 1979 encompasses a significant area of the electorate of Condamine, which I represent, including the communities of Gowrie Junction and Kingsthorpe. It is astonishing that the former minister for mines and energy could even consider issuing an exploration permit in this closely populated area, located less than 10 kilometres from Toowoomba’s CBD, less than five kilometres from the heavy populated Highfields area and less than 20 kilometres from the township of Oakey. But issue it he did. </A></Hansard-Body>

Exploration permit 1979 borders the member for Toowoomba North’s electorate. I am sure his office has been bombarded with calls, emails and letters regarding the close proximity of the proposed mine to the residents of Highfields and Toowoomba. These residents share the same concerns as those of Gowrie Junction and Kingsthorpe. There are 125,000 people who reside in Toowoomba and the surrounding districts. Approximately 3,500 people reside in the communities of Gowrie Junction and Kingsthorpe. The issuing of this exploration permit has caused considerable concern to these residents and the neighbouring communities of Highfields, Toowoomba and Oakey--health concerns, financial concerns, emotional concerns; concerns these communities did not have several weeks ago. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086839"></A>
On Friday, 18 February I attended the first community meeting of the Toowoomba Coal Mine Action Group at the Gowrie Junction community hall. Approximately 700 people attended this meeting--loudly and clearly expressing their disgust with the then minister. My office has received countless phone calls and emails and, to date, 543 letters from residents and concerned citizens registering their objection to the proposed mine. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086840"></A>
I add my support to the motion moved by the shadow minister for mines and energy, natural resources and water for the newly appointed minister for mines to immediately make the necessary legislative changes to immediately revoke exploration permit 1979 and to remove any suggestion that a mine could ever be established at this site. Already negative impacts have been experienced on property valuations for residents in Gowrie Junction, Kingsthorpe and adjacent communities. This is attributed to the issuing of exploration permit 1979. Making legislative changes to revoke exploration permit 1979 would provide residents within the EP area with the security that the investment they have made in their homes, properties and businesses will be safe. </Hansard-Body>

I endorse the motion calling for the enforcement of the provisions of section 147A of the Mineral Resources Act to ensure that all of the exploration permits covering the Felton Valley and other areas of prime agricultural land are not renewed.

 Mr Speaker, I apologise for that. This would provide landholders and communities in the region with some much needed security--security that has been taken away from them for a long time--and allow them to be free from the threat of any unsuitable mining development in their region so that they can progress and invest in their businesses with certainly. They cannot sell their farms even if they want to.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091245"></A>
I support the motion to ensure that no more exploration permits or other mining authorities are issued and, furthermore, that no existing permits or other mining authorities are renewed for the Darling Downs region until a statutory regional plan is established. The sustainability and viability of much of the cropping area of the Darling Downs is dependent upon landholders having the ability to continue to invest in the future of their business and their family without the threat of further exploration permits being issued over their highly productive land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091248"></A>
I endorse the motion calling for the establishment of statutory legal protection of prime agricultural land and separation distances between the resource industry authorities and urban areas. The protection of our prime agricultural land resource is essential to the ongoing successful production of food and fibre on the Darling Downs and to providing food security for Queensland. Any industry that is allowed to negatively impact upon the business or lifestyle of other entities will not be supported by the LNP. </Hansard-Body>

We recognise that the best cropping land, defined as strategic cropping land, is a finite resource that must be conserved and managed for the longer term. </A></Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1091260"></A>
Queensland has only a very small area of the best quality agricultural soil resources. This is typically represented by the iconic deep black soils of the eastern Darling Downs. This quality agricultural land is critical to Queensland’s food value chain, which is worth $18.7 billion and employs approximately 267,000 Queenslanders. Agriculture is particularly vital to the economy of rural and regional Queensland, and we want to ensure it grows so that the industry will be worth approximately $34 billion by 2020.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091261"></A>
This is why we are managing competing land uses--such as agriculture, mining and urban development--to ensure balanced outcomes for the benefit of all Queenslanders. The government will conserve and manage our best cropping land for the longer term. This does not mean that all farming land will be locked up and not available for other use. We want to ensure that land use competition is managed in a way that enables agriculture, mining and urban development to co-exist for the long term. Where land use competition exists, we want to ensure the best possible outcomes for producers in dealing with mining or urban development.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091262"></A>
It is understandable that people have concerns about the potential rapid growth of mining and what that means to them and the environment. The proposed strategic cropping land legislation will provide a level of protection for agricultural producers not seen anywhere else in Australia, if not the world. In fact, the Liberal-National coalition in New South Wales has lifted our policy and taken it to the election, so we must be getting some things right. </Hansard-Body>

I want to highlight a couple of things. Of all the exploration permits which have been issued, only one per cent have a mining lease issued over them.

Any mining application that does not uphold the strictest environmental standards will not get the go-ahead. Once again, the LNP members have proved that they are a divided rabble with no leadership.

This is just another pressure point. The member for Condamine is concerned about the Independents and possibly The Queensland Party running against him.

This area of housing is where people go--particularly young families and older people--because the land is at a modest price. It is affordable housing. People live in those townships and the surrounding areas on slightly larger plots of about three-quarters of an acre. It is all residential land in those townships and the surrounding areas. To have an exploration permit over areas like this is simply absurd. What is going to happen to the people at Highfields if the mining ever goes ahead and they get westerly winds blowing the coal dust over them and the people at Wilsonton and Cotswold Hills? Where are the trucks going to go to cart this coal if the mining ever goes ahead? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091291"></A>
Whether it goes ahead or not, the important thing at the moment is that for the next 10 or 20 years these people will have a sword hanging over their heads. If they are workers on modest means and they get transferred, they will not be able to sell their houses because the value would have come down by 50, 60 or 80 per cent. Older people are terrified about what is going to happen. It has put thousands of people and the whole area in limbo.</Hansard-Body>

The people of Toowoomba know and love their farming friends and their rural friends on the Darling Downs. It is an intertwined community of business, education and employment. The people of Toowoomba are appalled at what is starting to happen to the communities around our city, to the beautiful Darling Downs, to the best black soil farming land in the world. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091296"></A>
In the instance of the Felton Valley, the government has been pretty smart with its proposal. It is saying that prime agricultural land will be land that can be double cropped. It has done that so that the beautiful black soil flats of Felton might be safe some time in the future but the proposed development will be on the slightly sloping land that only takes one crop a year that is adjacent to it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095320"></A>
What is going to happen to the beautiful waterholes such as Hodgson Creek, which is one of the few creeks on the Downs that always has magnificent water in it, when they start boring for water or digging down in their open-cut mines? Where are the trucks going to go? At the moment they are just little rural roads. There is no railway line to put the stuff on. So they will trundle through Toowoomba. We are even seeing trucks go through Toowoomba now with no covers on them--not even proper bulk carriers. </Hansard-Body>

Mr HORAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is true. Out in the Norwin area--the blacksoil plains--there is the best agricultural land in the world. There is high-tech farming. These people cannot have CSG wells put into their places willy-nilly, because their areas are laser levelled, set out in blocks with head ditches, with GPS farming and all the rest of it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095324"></A>
This proposal from the LNP makes sense. It says that we should have a regional plan for the Darling Downs, like we have in South-East Queensland and like we have in North Queensland. People cannot mine the suburbs around Brisbane and Ipswich, because they are under a plan that says that that is not allowed. That is what the people of the Downs need. People need certainty. The whole region needs certainty. The people who want to mine the resources need the certainty that they are not going to go on a wild goose chase to somewhere, spend money and then lose that money because it might get knocked back in 20 years time. This motion is about respect for people who live in their modest houses, who live on their little lifestyle blocks and who live on small farms and giving them proper and decent protection. This motion is about protecting the people on the good farmland in the Felton area and the blacksoil plains west of Toowoomba. This motion is also about giving security to mining through proper planning so that people know that they do not have any sovereign risk and they know exactly where they stand. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (6.11 pm): At the outset I want to address an issue that was raised by the member for Condamine. He alleged that I missed a meeting. He implied that I had deliberately missed that meeting. I was invited to the meeting that he referred to just a few days before it was held. I had already accepted a longstanding invitation to attend a function at the Cobb &amp; Co Museum in Toowoomba. Perhaps unlike the member for Condamine, I cannot be in two places at the one time. </Hansard-Body>

The other fact that I want to put on the table fair and square at this stage is the revelation, if you like, that the area over which this permit was issued is, in fact, 150 square kilometres. It is not just the township of Gowrie Mountain; it covers most of the area between Oakey and Toowoomba and north and south of that. So it is a huge area that is involved. We are concerned about here an apparently small part of that. I ask the House to take that into account. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095335"></A>
The first part of the motion before the House condemns the so-called incompetence of the former minister in issuing an exploration permit. There has been no evidence adduced here tonight in support of that contention that he was incompetent in whatever he did. So far as I am aware, on that occasion the former minister followed the law and the practice of Queensland in what he carried out. In relation to paragraph No 2, which calls on the minister to recognise the grave concern, the emotional turmoil and the negative impact on property prices, it has come to my attention that people have concerns, they are upset and they are worried about property prices being affected. I share those concerns and I am determined to do what I can to dissipate them. The rest of the motion before the House refers to other areas on the Downs, where the residential aspect does not apply. It ignores the fact that the state would be wide open to compensation claims and it does not address how we should address that matter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095337"></A>
What do I believe? I believe that there should be no mining at or near Gowrie Junction. I believe that the government should explore ways to achieve the prevention of exploration at or near residences of this nature. I understand that already there is in the law a prohibition against such exploration to the tune of about 100 metres. I think we can do better than that. As a result, in the last parliament I went to the then minister and he was open to getting briefings on the matter. In this parliament I have already had discussions with this minister, as he has referred to, about ways and means by which we can arrive at a satisfactory solution. I understand that this minister is prepared to have an open mind and to look at the situation rationally. I think that is a good thing </Hansard-Body>

Mr SHINE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the minister. I believe that both industries--the mining industry and the agricultural industry--are necessary for Queensland’s welfare. I think there has to be a balance between both. On the one hand, we have the mining and petroleum industry and on the other hand we need to protect local communities, the environment and the agricultural sector. The government already has strong laws in place that were passed last year. I wonder on Monday, when the Leader of the Opposition said he was in Toowoomba, did he tell the people who came to see him about those laws that were passed last year, or did he forget to do so? I wonder last year did the Leader of the Opposition tell those people that there has to be permission to explore before such exploration can take place? I wonder did he tell those people that the permission to explore does not mean that they have permission to dig up any minerals as a result? I wonder if he has made people aware that even where permission to explore is granted that it is extremely rare that the land about which we are concerned is ever mined? I am informed that less than one per cent of land explored for mining has a mining lease placed over it--less than one per cent. So even if exploration reveals some economic viability in relation to the land in question, then it has all of those environmental procedures to overcome that the previous ministers have referred to as well as the Commonwealth procedures. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1095340"></A>
I believe that the opposition has been opportunistic and populist in its approach. I wonder what its approach would be in government. How would it deal with the coalmining industry in government? Would it need the resource industry to support its budget? </Hansard-Body>

However, that support comes with appropriate caveats. We do not see from this government an appropriate process of ensuring that this industry develops throughout Queensland in such a way that high-value farmland is protected and preserved and there is no encroachment into urban areas. That is what we are seeking to do. </A></Hansard-Body>

This government has a willy-nilly, directionless approach to dealing with this issue of resource development in this state. If members believe otherwise, they should look at the situation of where the government has presided over a circumstance where a major resources company is able to get an exploration permit located within a stone’s throw of a major inland regional city and a major community. How absolutely stupid is that? Even if members can believe the contention put forward by the honourable members opposite that there is a difference between an exploration permit and a mining development approval process and that that is not going to happen, then why put those communities through the heartache to start with? Why does the government not support the proposal that has been put forward by the shadow minister of a revocation of these permits in these inappropriate areas and to start concentrating on the areas throughout Queensland where we know that this industry can develop appropriately and in harmony with existing agricultural industries and not conflict with other longstanding urban communities and also strategic cropping land? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095349"></A>
I heard the minister for primary industries stand up and say that the Nationals in New South Wales have now adopted the strategic cropping land policy of the Labor Party in Queensland. I have a news flash: it was this Labor government that followed the LNP, after a shadow cabinet meeting in Cairns two and a half years ago, down the track of a strategic cropping land policy, which moved to protect that very valuable agricultural land. So this government took that policy from us. But haven’t they made a mess of it from then on! We have equivocation over the process. We do not have clarity with regard to what is being defined as strategic cropping land in Queensland. We have nonsensical processes where something that is over a certain grade is not going to be considered strategic cropping land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099411"></A>
That in itself does not consider a whole range of areas around the state where there is high-value agricultural land on a gradient above three per cent that continuously provides high-value agricultural production every single year. The LNP believes that the best way to deal with this issue is through a proper strategic regional planning process that provides that sovereign security which those companies want that clearly says to them that they are able to explore, that they are able to develop here or that they are not able to develop over there because we consider the urban conflict too great or we consider that it is conflicting too much with what is strategic high-value agricultural land.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099412"></A>
The other night at a briefing I listened to Michael Roche, the head of the Queensland Resources Council, say that he and his members know that at least at this stage it is impossible to rehabilitate high-value agricultural land. That is the view of the LNP. This land cannot be rehabilitated. One might be able to rehabilitate grazing land, but one cannot rehabilitate high-value agricultural land. You cannot take it back to being high-value cropping land. Therefore, it should be identified and protected from encroachment and destruction by mining and coal seam gas. This area does need to be ring fenced. It needs to be properly identified and protected. We are talking here about a small part of Queensland--a very, very small part in percentage terms, maybe two, three or four per cent. We need to protect it and look at providing that sovereign certainty that these companies need in other areas where there is less conflict. The LNP will do this through a proper regional planning process that will guarantee the certainty that these resources companies need and it will take away the heartache, concern and stress of members of these urban communities and those farmers who have been farming on these high-value agricultural areas over a long period of time. This government should be adopting this motion moved by the shadow minister, not standing up here tonight without any solutions whatsoever.<Hansard-Speech-End>

(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for State Development and Trade)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(6.21 pm): I support the amendment moved by the minister for mines. This is a debate of competing interests. It is a debate that is not served by absolutism. It also happens to be a debate that has existed inside this state for 150 years--since its development. The history of Queensland is replete with the advancement of the agricultural and mining industries. In many parts of Queensland they have co-existed side by side throughout our development. They compete as they have competing interests, but they have competed and co-existed throughout our history. The notion here that this debate is in any way advanced by the sort of absolutism that is being promoted on the other side of the chamber denies the level of intellect that needs to be applied to adjusting these issues, to getting the policy frameworks right and ensuring that investment certainty can be provided for the agricultural industry and also for the resources industry. It is something that happens to have been achieved for the better part of the last century and a half in this state.</Hansard-Body>

Of course, it will be completely reasonable that individuals who are potentially impacted will have strong views. Those views are completely human and they are going to be presented strongly to the government, by the government and within the government, as the member for Toowoomba North outlined tonight. To suggest that this debate should be reduced to the notions of ‘no coal for breakfast’ as opposed to needing baseload power to poach your eggs for breakfast--the sort of chanting that goes on in this debate--denies the sort of application that needs to be given to the task at hand. What we need to understand is that the licence to operate here is a social, economic and environmental one--that is, that resource proponents need to meet the conditions. It is a truism that would be agreed by nearly everybody across this chamber that any resources industry--any project--needs to meet the environmental conditions that are upon it, just as it would be our view that any farming production needs to also meet those same environmental requirements. I think that there is a denial by some sections engaging in this debate of the reality that chemicals are used in the agricultural industry as well as in the mining industry.</Hansard-Body>

I note in particular and commend the forthright common sense that was put by the member for Callide in a recent letter to the editor article. I commend his courage in putting it. The reality of this is that no-one should for one moment mistake the bellicose advocacy that we have seen on the other side for sincerity. We have seen a conversion on the road from Toowoomba in the last 72 hours. We know that the opposition was in Toowoomba on the weekend and that this issue became hot. At a public meeting the opposition leader was on his feet. There was a report of what occurred next at that meeting in Monday’s Toowoomba <Hansard-Italic>

That speaks volumes about what is going on in here tonight.

Last night the Greens were meant to be running fishing policy in the government. It is clear that the Greens are running the policy agenda in the Leader of the Opposition’s office. Of course both claims are total sophistry, but the Leader of the Opposition should acknowledge the fact that 72 hours ago he had a very different position until the heat was turned up on him. </Hansard-Body>

Everyone needs to understand that the claims and the pretensions of the LNP in here tonight in fact reveal the deep rift within the party--that is, the contest between the knuckle draggers and those who seek to promote sensible policy outcome. There is a contest going on inside which, as ever, is ripping asunder the LNP between those members of the party who know what sensible policy is--that investment security is required both for the resources sector and the agricultural sector--and those who seek to respond on the turn of a dime to the politics of the day. They have adopted a sort of Xenophon diplomacy, the sort of politics one sees practised by Senator Xenophon--that is, if you are loud enough and draw enough attention to yourself you can seek to move the policy debate. What the people across Queensland should know, whether they are facing this in their backyard or have a concern, is that what we see from members of the opposition here tonight is not one tune; it is them crumbling beneath the pressure of three questions to their opposition leader. In that regard he reveals himself as unfit to hold the position.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Noosa--LNP) (7.36 pm): I rise to make my first contribution in this place as the shadow minister for police and emergency services. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your indulgence to take a moment to thank my leader and my colleagues for the faith that they have shown in me.

This debate serves to remind us all of a distraction to which the Bligh Labor government is prone. Generally on a slow news day, but sometimes when the political spotlight is on another of their failures, some spokesman for the government will accuse us on this side of the chamber of a lack of policy. But is this allegation valid? During the life of the 53rd parliament, members of the Langbroek LNP opposition have brought in private members’ bills on matters of critical public interest and concern on no fewer than seven occasions. Rather than allow such a bill to be debated on its merit and in the public interest, the practice of the Bligh Labor government is to procrastinate, to put the private member’s bill at the bottom of the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 and to keep it there. By this political approach, the minister responsible is then given time to address the issue that the LNP has raised and bring it on as his or her own legislation. </Hansard-Body>

There are some matters of such compelling urgency that the opposition must act, even if only to provoke the Labor government into action. The protection of our children from known convicted serious child sex offenders is one such case. That is why tonight we are considering these bills in a cognate debate on a matter of acute public concern. The member for Gregory introduced the Child Protection (More Stringent Offender Reporting) Amendment Bill on 14 April 2010. The public record shows that the minister then introduced his Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Bill on 17 August 2010, almost exactly four months later. Debate on our private member’s bill was suppressed. Children who need not have been put at risk have been, in the name of political expediency. Children have been kept at risk for a further six months while this legislation rose to the top of the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 and to the attention of the House. </Hansard-Body>

Not only did the member for Gregory prick the conscience of the Bligh Labor government with his private member’s bill, but he also tackled the issue head-on during the estimates hearings in 2009. The member for Gregory brought to the public’s attention the fact that the system the government has in place fails to know the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders on a regular basis. This failure to monitor convicted sex offenders adequately is occurring while one amongst those same convicted sex offenders on the register is reoffending--that is, on average, once a week a convicted sex offender on the register is committing another offence of a sexual nature against a child or children. The protection that society expects to be afforded to the most vulnerable within our community is not happening to an acceptable standard, and that standard is the community standard. Had it not been for the forensic questioning by the opposition during the 2009 estimates hearing and our persistence since, the Queensland community would never have had these facts revealed to them. These facts record that a number of sex offenders had gone missing from the register on the Bligh Labor government’s watch and that a known sex offender on the register is reoffending, that is, committing further sex offences against children, on an average of once a week. </Hansard-Body>

We on this side of the House are of the view that the Bligh Labor government has been soft and passive in its approach to sentencing, which in turn returns more and more convicted sex offenders into the community. The risk to our children from this lenient approach is compounded by the fundamentally flawed management regime for convicted sex offenders once they are released. I remind the House that these are not potential offenders identified by profiling; these are offenders who have already been convicted of crimes of a sexual nature against children and have been released into the community after having served only some proportion of the sentence considered appropriate by the courts for their heinous crime. The opposition strongly believes that release is too often too early. The opposition strongly believes that post incarceration the convicted serious child sex offender risk management system is inadequate. As a community we are somewhat blase about the term ‘sex offender’. It is a term somewhat debased in the language in describing the gravity of offences and the long-term consequences of those criminal acts on the innocent little victim. It is perhaps akin to the term ‘collateral damage’ to describe in understatement the death, mutilation and suffering of innocents during a bloody conflict. It fails to describe the terrible wounds which modern weapons inflict.</Hansard-Body>

 We should as a society maintain our collective rage in expecting our government to take seriously the protection of our children and to do everything in its power to ensure that our innocents are safe and not defiled and damaged permanently. This is an area of the law where protection of the rights of potential victims should be more highly regarded than the rights of the perpetrators. It is in this consideration that the key difference emerges between the Bligh Labor government, which we regard as too soft on this form of heinous crime, and the opposition, which sees the protection of innocent children as a paramount responsibility in maintaining law and order. On behalf of the community we seek to hold the government to account on this most important responsibility.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107818"></A>
Prior to last Christmas a Coroner’s inquest commenced in Maroochydore into the disappearance of Daniel Morcombe on 7 December 2003. The inquest heard detailed and chilling evidence from two convicted child predators, one of whom was a person of interest in that kidnapping. Bruce Morcombe aptly described them as ‘monsters’, and it is monsters that we are seeking to monitor through this legislation. It is inexcusable then to learn that a convicted sex offender is required to report once at their initial release and then is not required to report again for 12 months unless their circumstances change. The situation is the same whether or not they breach that. Regardless of the risk they pose, the law as it stands remains ineffective. That is why we have proposed these changes to make convicted serious child sex offenders more responsible and accountable for their reporting and compliance with the law, to make the monitoring task for the Queensland Police Service less onerous, to increase the reporting requirements for convicted serious child sex offenders who fail to comply, and to introduce genuine consequences for failing to comply.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107822"></A>
Our bill had its origins in the Bligh Labor government’s own statistics. They reveal that in the year ending 31 December 2005 18 registered convicted sex offenders had breached their reporting obligations. By 31 December 2009, just a mere four years later, that figure had increased to 545, more than 30 times the figure from four years previous or a 3,000 per cent increase. As at 30 June 2010 the Bligh Labor government held the details of 3,543 convicted serious child sex offenders on the register. Since the commencement of the register in 2005, the Queensland Police Service has investigated 2,006 offences against the requirements of the Child Protection Offender Registry, with 1,523 offenders being charged. That is 1,523 prosecutions against registered convicted serious child sex offenders for breaching laws associated with their registration. To put it in context, one in every three convicted sex offenders routinely ignores his reporting and behavioural requirements under the law as it stands, and that is simply unacceptable.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1107825"></A>
Let no-one be in any doubt that the current system is nothing more than an honour system that relies on sex offenders updating their details. There is no reward for doing so and little punishment for not doing so. In short, there is no deterrent effect from the law as it now stands. Clearly, when we have a system that sees a 3,000 per cent increase in the number of registered convicted serious child sex offenders who fail to meet their reporting obligations there is a serious problem. Of course, the initial position adopted in this regard by the Bligh Labor government was simply this: there is nothing wrong. Further, during the 2009 estimates hearing the Bligh Labor government was forced to admit that it had no idea of the whereabouts of no fewer than eight convicted serious child sex predators. One of these had been missing for more than nine months.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ELMES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The CrimTrac website is very informative on the subject. I commend it to the minister’s attention. CrimTrac is an Australian government agency established on 1 July 2000 to develop the technology required to give police ready access to information needed to solve crimes. It follows on from, and updates technologically, the initiative of May 1990 when the Australian police ministers established the National Exchange of Police Information. It recognises that, while Australian states and territories have responsibility for maintaining law and order within their borders, criminals and criminal activity do not recognise, acknowledge or respect these borders. Accordingly, cooperation is essential to share information to enable and extend the fight against crime on a national basis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112130"></A>
One of the systems by which information is shared by police is the Australian National Child Offender Register, ANCOR. In relation to registering and reporting responsibilities, the ANCOR website informs as follows--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1112132"></A>
•	A registrable offender must be served with a notice to inform them that they need to register. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1112133"></A>
•	Once registered, the offender must also be notified in writing of their continued reporting obligations. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1112134"></A>
•	Offenders are required to at least report annually but some jurisdictions have legislation that allows them to make offenders report more often, particularly if there is a high risk of reoffending. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112136"></A>
It is that final point from the official website of the national agency that debunks the minister’s argument that we in Queensland cannot make stronger reporting conditions for convicted child sex offenders locally when we have the national monitoring body highlighting that the complete uniformity in monitoring regimes is neither compulsory nor a reality. The minister should be upfront with the Queensland people and admit that the Bligh Labor government is soft when it comes to monitoring convicted serious child sex offenders after release and that it releases too many too early. Clearly the approach which we on this side of the chamber are putting forward is not only possible but also responsible, sensible and essential. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112138"></A>
Under the ANCOR regime, a registered offender is required to provide the following information to police: names, aliases, physical description, physical addresses, children of interest, employment, education, vehicles, affiliations, offences, travel and reporting period. Registered persons may also be asked to provide the optional information on ID document details, special needs and associations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112139"></A>
Authorised police use ANCOR to manage persons convicted of child sex offences and other specified offences. A child sex offender case typically moves through the following stages on ANCOR: person is charged with a registrable offence; offender has a custodial sentence; offender has been released from custody but is yet to be served with the notice to inform them they are required to register; the notice has been served and the offender is within the allowable time limits to register; offender has reported and registered in accordance with legislation, or offender has not registered within the allowable time limit--they are in breach of reporting conditions; and reporting period has ended. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112140"></A>
The Queensland equivalent to the national register is the Child Protection Offender Register. The Queensland Police Service annual report 2009-10 informs that the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004 requires particular offenders who have been convicted of committing sexual or other serious offences against children to keep police informed of their whereabouts and other personal details for a period of time. The objective of this reporting regime is to reduce the likelihood that they will reoffend, to assist the investigation and prosecution of any future offences that they may commit, and for other related purposes. I ask members to take particular note that this compliance monitoring of convicted serious child sex offenders is undertaken at a district police level with a minimum of at least one local officer assigned to every reportable offender. It is a very resource intensive activity and one which drains effort from all other forms of policing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112144"></A>
The Child Protection (More Stringent Reporting) Amendment Bill 2010 has five key objectives. Firstly, it requires that convicted serious child sex offenders be required to report quarterly instead of yearly. Secondly, it requires that convicted serious child sex offenders who breach their reporting obligations be required to report monthly. Thirdly, it requires that convicted serious child sex offenders who are convicted of a breach of their reporting requirements be liable to five years imprisonment and that the offence is a crime. </Hansard-Body>

Mr Roberts:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Why did you leave the penalty units at the same level? Why didn’t you increase the penalty units? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112146"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ELMES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 You will get your turn, Neil. Fourthly, in the circumstance where a convicted serious child sex offender has previously breached their reporting obligations and is convicted for a subsequent offence, it invites the sentencing court to consider a term of imprisonment over any other form of punishment. Finally, to recognise the drain on police resources from this enhanced reporting and monitoring, the bill provides, as a simple matter of common sense, for police to publicly name convicted serious child sex offenders who have been reported missing from the Child Protection Offender Register. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112147"></A>
This change puts the onus on the convicted serious child sex offender to take some responsibility for his own rehabilitation. The reporting and monitoring regime is designed to assist child sexual predators who have been convicted of serious crimes of a sexual nature against children to minimise the temptation to commit such crimes again by reducing the opportunities to access potential child victims. In this way, vulnerable children are protected from arguably the most horrible, invasive, barbaric crime known to mankind with lifetime suffering to follow. No victim ever forgets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112148"></A>
This change also introduces genuine consequences for failure to meet reporting obligations. While a convicted serious child sex offender might regard a return to jail as a price for some deviant pleasure, the prospect of being hounded by the community from place to place may serve to force some to reconsider. Public persecution of evil predator and convicted paedophile Dennis Raymond Ferguson should act as a deterrent for those convicted serious child sex offenders who do not want to face the same fate of exposure to public identification, humiliation and vilification. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112150"></A>
I note that the Bligh Labor government has avoided public consultation on its amending bill so as to avoid the inevitable public demand for the public to be involved in the monitoring of where these convicted serious child sex offenders are living, for no parent wants a convicted serious child sex offender, no paedophile, living in their neighbourhood within easy access to their children. Put simply, these proposed amendments to the existing legislation have been born out of the risk posed by convicted serious child sex offenders placed on the register and the need to increase monitoring and keep those on the register accountable and to minimise the risk they pose. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112151"></A>
The basic cause of criminal behaviour is universal--an absence of restraint. Offenders do not learn to commit crimes; rather, they fail to learn not to commit them. No matter what resources the community applies to investigation, international data reveals that only about 30 per cent of crime will ever be solved. So prevention or minimisation strategies must form part of crime reduction. For example, we lock our car and keep our valuables out of sight. We lock our house when we go out. A woman does not walk down dark alleys at night. So it is in the matter of sex crimes against children. </Hansard-Body>

Ms Nelson-Carr:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 They should be able to.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157745"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ELMES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 If we had more police they could. Research shows that the horrendous offence of sex crimes against children stands a greater chance of being reduced by increasing the effort required by perpetrators to offend. By making the offending behaviour more difficult or inconvenient to carry out, children are better protected. In the case of sex crimes against children, this principally means making it harder for sexual predators to access children to abuse. While recidivist child sexual predators may be slowed by this strategy, at best situational and opportunistic offenders are likely to be fully deterred. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116423"></A>
Increasing the risk of detection, as reported by researchers Wortley and Smallbone, is perhaps the most salient variable in the potential offender’s decision making. Increasing risk involves making it more likely that the offender’s behaviour will be observed or detected. Arguably, predatory offenders are most sensitive to risk factors, but they will also have developed the most sophisticated strategies to minimise the dangers of detection. Increasing risk includes extending guardianship, strengthening formal surveillance, increasing natural surveillance and utilising place managers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116424"></A>
Formal surveillance may include tracking offenders’ movements via internet use, credit card transactions and passport control. Awareness of this surveillance may serve as a deterrent, while the records themselves may be used in criminal investigations and prosecutions. Recently in Australia there were mass arrests of offenders who downloaded child pornography from the internet and used credit cards to pay for the downloads. Currently 24 countries have legislation that makes it possible to prosecute their citizens who travel overseas to access children on sex tourism excursions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116425"></A>
Stable dynamic factors which have been found to be associated with sex offender recidivism are positive social supports, especially from family members. That is why we have proposed strengthening obligations to provide more structure to self-regulation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116426"></A>
I will now address the issue of police resources to monitor convicted serious child sex offenders. It was reported in May 2010 that an increasing number of dangerous convicted serious child sex offenders in Queensland were reoffending while living in the community under strict monitoring conditions. More than a third of the 685 sex offenders monitored breached their supervision orders in the past two years, with 30 facing charges of a sexual nature. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116427"></A>
Queensland Police Union spokesman Ian Leavers says that there are not enough police or resources to monitor sex offenders. ‘It has been ad hoc right throughout the state,’ he is quoted as saying. Further, Mr Leavers says that officers cannot monitor all the criminals they are assigned who are on the Australian National Child Offender Register. He stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1116430"></A>
Some police are doing it with their current duties and they are at breaking point. They simply cannot monitor the people on the Register as they should be and what the community would expect. Obviously there are a lot of breaches which offenders have committed--I understand that--and the detection rate is quite good, but I believe it would be substantially higher. If these people continue to commit offences, they should be back in jail because what we need to think of here is not the rights of the paedophile but it is the rights of our children. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1116431"></A>
The police minister’s predictable response is to argue that there is no lack of resources. He said at the time--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1116433"></A>
The advice I’ve received from the Police Service is that there is an ANCOR co-ordinator in every district, every offender is assigned to at least one officer and sometimes more, depending on the level of risk and those people are monitored. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1116434"></A>
As at 1 February 2011 there were 12,478 registered offenders across Australia. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116435"></A>
I welcome the Bligh Labor government’s Child Protection (Offender Reporting) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. I do not propose to oppose it. I will even support it. It brings the Queensland reporting and monitoring regime up to the national standard. However, I genuinely regret that it does nothing to strengthen reporting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116436"></A>
The bill gives courts a wider discretion to make an offender reporting order. It lowers the threshold from the current ‘risk to life or sexual safety’ to simply that the court considers the order appropriate. I welcome the changes that require a reportable offender to make their initial report within seven days in all cases. I welcome expanding the level of personal details required to be reported to include carriage services, internet service providers, any email addresses and/or electronic identifiers used or intended to be used by a reportable offender. I welcome the changes being proposed by the government that require reporting of changes in relevant personal details relating to ‘generally residing’ or ‘regular unsupervised contact’ to within 24 hours. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116437"></A>
I also welcome those further changes being proposed by the government to insert a new section 40A to allow a DNA sample to be taken at limited times--either at initial report or at annual report, subject to certain conditions. It can only be done if a DNA sample is not kept or if the offender remained in a foreign jurisdiction which allows a DNA sample to be taken. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116438"></A>
I welcome the provisions similar to those proposed in the opposition’s bill that increases the penalty for failing to comply with the reporting obligations from 150 penalty units or two years imprisonment to 300 penalty units or five years imprisonment. It also declares that these crimes are a crime. I particularly welcome the change to put beyond doubt that the disclosure or release of personal information from the Queensland Child Protection Offender Register to corresponding registers in other jurisdictions is and always was lawful. I welcome this change to ensure that we always protect and support our police in the fulfilment of their duties. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116439"></A>
I welcome all of the proposals contained in the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) And Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. Anything which serves to protect the most vulnerable members of our society, our children, must be supported. In the true spirit of bipartisanship--this is one area where our children should not be made political play things--I call on the minister to go one extra step, one that will be welcomed by the entire community, and support the LNP’s Child Protection (More Stringent Reporting) Amendment Bill 2010 to enhance the state legislation beyond the national standard in the best interests of Queensland’s children. The risk posed by convicted serious child sex offenders is something that we can do something about. Minister, let us do it together. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1116440"></A>
I also call on the minister to ensure that the additional resources that the Queensland Police Service requires to meet the obligations for making our children safer are provided. It is hard to imagine a more worthy use of public moneys. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116442"></A>
When we talk about the management of convicted serious child sex offenders then clearly the best place for those who pose a risk on a continuing basis would either be in prison or in some other secure facility. We need to consider that additional supports are available to help police monitor registered convicted serious child offenders and reduce the numbers being released back into the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116443"></A>
Future areas for consideration in the management of released convicted serious child sex offenders on the register include the use of the circles of accountability and support model to support sex offender reentry as practised in Colorado in the United States. The Circles of Accountability and Support Volunteer Program is a justice initiative designed to safely reintegrate sex offenders into the community. The circles program serves as an integral component of a coordinated, interagency team which utilises the Colorado Sex Offender Management Board model for supervising and monitoring sex offenders and is a partnership with the Colorado Department of Corrections’ Sex Offender Treatment and Monitoring Program and local communities. It was inspired by and has been adapted from the Circles of Support and Accountability Program in Ontario, Canada. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1116448"></A>
Volunteers for the circles program undergo a thorough application process, including a criminal background check and training with the Department of Corrections. They receive professional training focused on secure justice principles, the dynamics of sex offending and specialised treatment concepts and are educated and supervised about creating and maintaining appropriate boundaries while providing support to sex offenders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120833"></A>
After completing the training, they are matched with other volunteers and a participating sex offender--known as a core member--to create a circle of accountability and support, which is comprised five to seven volunteers and is supported by professional staff. The core members must have made a commitment to change their offending behaviours and are recommended to the circles program by their treatment providers after they have made some significant progress in treatment. They are identified because they lack appropriate supports in the community who can assist them during their transition and reintegration following release from incarceration. The circle provides that much needed support. Core members are carefully screened to reduce risk to the community and the circle volunteers. Volunteers are fully informed of the core member’s pattern of thinking errors and offending behaviours that could lead to committing another offence. By using specific guidelines, circle volunteers seek to hold the core member accountable in an effort to prevent reoffending. The volunteers commit to one year of service for a few hours each month. This is a methodology worthy of further investigation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120836"></A>
In conclusion, may I stress that I will be bitterly disappointed if the Bligh Labor government refuses to support the positive strong improvements to the reporting and monitoring program and onus on offenders as I have proposed. What is wrong with moving from a 12-month reporting process to a three-month reporting process if they fail to register? What is wrong with requiring them to report on a monthly basis if they fail to register? Surely as a society we would be much more comfortable if we knew where these people were basically every minute of every day, and that is what we have to move towards. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157767"></A>
The primary argument which the Bligh Labor government has used against supporting the bill is not valid--no less an authority than CrimTrac says so. I sincerely hope that the Bligh Labor government does not wish to be remembered for failing our children. Until it accepts that we need to hold these convicted serious child sex offenders accountable for their actions post release and manage their risk, offenders will go on reoffending and our innocent children will continue to be victims. That is not good enough when we all know we can do much, much more. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110309_201210" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Kawana--LNP) (8.12 pm): I rise to contribute to the cognate debate on the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 that was introduced by the government and the Child Protection (More Stringent Offender Reporting) Amendment Bill 2010 that was introduced by the opposition. Again we see a debate in this House tonight with these cognate bills which the opposition has led the attack on. In April 2010 the former shadow minister introduced his bill. Then in August 2010 the Labor Party came trodding into this place and whacked down its own bill which deals substantially with the same issues as our bill and claimed it as its own. Ultimately, we know that ours will fail tonight and that the government bill will pass. Those opposite will go out to the media tomorrow and say, ‘Look what we’re doing for the victims, the children, in our society.’ We will go out and we will say, ‘The Labor Party always calls on the opposition for policies.’ Time and time again we have come into this place and introduced bills, only to see the government get its act together some months later and introduce a similar bill. If you want policy, there it is. There is no clearer distinction than the cognate debate we are having tonight with an opposition bill that was introduced in April 2010 and a government bill that was introduced four months later in August 2010.</A></Hansard-Body>

The debate on these bills focuses on the important task of protecting our children from predatory sex offenders who lurk in our community. Predatory sex offenders are the scum of society, the scourge and slime on our community. I was contemplating calling them rodents but that would be an offence to all of the rodents in our community. Long-term Labor mismanagement of Queensland sex offender laws has not served the community in protecting our vulnerable children. Simply, the reporting requirements under the government’s system are not strong enough--they never have been strong enough. In fact, I put it that the Labor Party and its inaction on these sorts of laws over many, many years has put our children of Queensland at risk. Again the opposition has come in here with some foresight to debate laws that try to protect our children from these scum of our society, and the Labor Party has come in and virtually copied our legislation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120845"></A>
In my role as shadow Attorney-General and shadow minister for justice and corrective services I have met with various stakeholder groups to engage in discussions and open dialogue on policy matters. Some of the specific issues that were raised in these meetings obviously related to child protection matters. In particular, some of the issues that were raised related to sexual offenders and paedophiles and how certain aspects of our current system are simply not working. Between 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2009 the number of registered sex offenders who had breached their reporting obligations had soared from 18 to 545--more than 3,000 per cent. We need to send the message that any registered sex offender who fails to comply with their reporting obligations will face tougher consequences and be dealt with in a manner which maintains the integrity of the register.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120847"></A>
Questioning from the former shadow minister revealed in estimates that some 99 dangerous sex offenders on the register have committed further sex crimes since being released back into our community. Clearly, these figures indicate that the current system is not working. The introduction of the government’s bill on amending the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004 again follows the LNP’s lead in this matter. We on this side of the House understand that the current system is not working and we have a real plan to strengthen the reporting requirements and bring veracity back to the register. The LNP’s bill before the House seeks to strengthen the reporting requirements of sex offenders and provide police with the powers to name the sex offenders to assist in locating them in the community. Quite frankly, this is in the best interests of our community. The community should feel safe in knowing that registered sex offenders are identifiable and that the police know where they are living.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120848"></A>
If a registered sex offender fails to report or update their details, as is their obligation, the LNP bill ensures that this is an offence. The key difference between the opposition’s legislation and the government’s legislation relates to the inclusion of a declaratory provision which establishes a lawful disclosure or release of personal information from the Queensland Child Protection Offender Register by the police to locate missing sex offenders who cannot be located on the register.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120849"></A>
We on this side of the House put the protection of our children first. In discussions I have had with organisations such as Bravehearts, stronger sex offender registration laws are urgently needed to be able to monitor and manage the integrity of the register. I would like to take this opportunity tonight to commend the work undertaken by Hetty Johnston and Carol Ronken from the Bravehearts organisation. The mission of Bravehearts is to stop child sexual assault in our society. Its vision is to make Australia the safest place in the world to raise a child. The organisation also provides confidential counselling services, information and support to children and young people who have experienced or are at risk of child sexual assault.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1120852"></A>
Our courts can sentence sex offenders to community based orders which may include probation or intensive correction orders. As outlined in the bill, sex offenders who are under these orders are supervised by probation and parole officers for the duration of the order. Like any other offenders, sex offenders are able to apply to the parole board for early supervised release into the community. If a release is granted, the conditions of parole ensure that an offender must report and receive regular visits from probation or parole officers and may be tested for substance abuse. In research that I have undertaken there are a range of different methods of rehabilitation for sex offenders. In my opinion, good behaviour should not be an easily acceptable reason for a parole board to grant an early release from prison for convicted sex offenders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129546"></A>
In April 2010, the Bligh Labor government refused to publicly release a Queensland Corrective Services report on the effectiveness of the existing rehabilitation programs in this state. When asked to release the report on the effectiveness of the programs the minister at the time claimed cabinet-in-confidence. I ask the minister: what is the government trying to hide and will he now release the report in full so that an informed debate can take place? As part of this process the government needs to ensure that adequate penalties are in place to appropriately punish convicted sex offenders and enact a strong deterrent in the first place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129549"></A>
There also needs to be appropriate punishments for breaches of the reporting requirements for those sex offenders who are on the register. While the sex offenders are in prison, the government needs to ensure that sex offender rehabilitation programs are working effectively and reduce recidivism rates for such crimes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129550"></A>
Ultimately, it is in the best interests of the broader community and of our children to protect their safety from those who are prone to committing crimes of a sexual nature. It is also an important preventive measure to ensure that, when sex offenders are released back into our community, an effective rehabilitation program that reduces the recidivism rate is used to identify if a sex offender should be released back into the community. The research suggests that it is often the case that these people simply cannot help themselves. Whether there is a psychological deficit of some sort or an issue of sexual self-confidence, the government has an obligation to maintain the safety of Queensland children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129552"></A>
In the state of Texas in the United States, the Department of Criminal Justice has instigated two sex offender rehabilitation programs. These programs are the Sex Offender Education Program, SOEP, and the Sex Offender Treatment Program, SOTP. The SOEP consists of a four-month curriculum to assist sex offenders determined to pose a lower reoffence risk or who may be released to a lengthy term of supervision. This curriculum is provided in an instructive format, providing information on a variety of topics--healthy sexuality, anger, stress management, interpersonal relationships and cognitive restructuring. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129555"></A>
The SOTP consists of an 18-month intensive treatment program to assist sex offenders determined to pose a higher reoffence risk. The SOTP involves three treatment phases employing a cognitive behavioural model. The primary goal of the program is to reduce the rate of reoffence and to move the participant towards a more prosocial lifestyle. All three phases occur in a community environment, providing necessary behaviour modifiers that allow offenders immediate feedback about their behaviour and treatment progress. The primary objective of these two programs is to reduce the potential for further deviant behaviour. In 2007 the state auditor released a report indicating that sex offenders who completed the Texas SOTP were 61 per cent less likely to commit a new crime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129556"></A>
Although I am not advocating that Queensland adopt a Texas style model for the rehabilitation of sex offenders, it is important to review our system to ensure that successfully completing adequate rehabilitation courses should be a precursor to releasing the sex offender back into our community. The Parole Board should have confidence that the offender will be extremely unlikely to reoffend.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129557"></A>
Other options in various jurisdictions around the world include chemical castration, which is reversible, as opposed to physical castration, which is obviously permanent. At the federal level, the Australian National Child Offender Register provides for the registration of child sex offenders residing in or entering Queensland. The Australian National Child Offender Register keeps details of all registered child sex offenders. A national register is vitally important to maintaining the interstate relocation of sex offenders throughout Australia. The offender must apply to their relevant state authority in order to transfer across state boundaries, and it is the responsibility of corrective services in each state to maintain the integrity of the national register. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129559"></A>
An additional way to monitor and supervise released sex offenders is a prohibition order. For a prohibition order to be made against a child sex offender, the court must be satisfied that the offender has engaged in contact that poses an unacceptable risk to the lives or sexual safety of our children in our community. The conduct may not amount to a criminal offence. All offenders who are given a prohibition order are placed on the ANCOR. As of March 2011 there were 12,596 registered offenders across Australia. The register is the responsibility of the federal Minister for Home Affairs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129562"></A>
 The Bligh government has neglected this issue over the past five years. The register is rendered impotent if it is not maintained and breaches are not rectified and are left to exponentially spiral out of control. The idea of a register is that sex offenders who are released back into our community can be monitored effectively by the police. If the police do not know where the offender is and the offender fails to report as obligated then the register is a waste of time. The collective interest of the community should be paramount and of the utmost importance in the minister’s mind, particularly when we are protecting the most vulnerable members of our community, our children. As the father of three young children I want to know that they and their friends are safe in our community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129563"></A>
I am pleased to see that on this matter yet again the government has taken the lead from the LNP. I believe that the government’s bill should also include the naming of registered sex offenders who have breached their reporting obligations in an attempt to locate them within the community. I would implore the government to revisit the issue and put the interests of child protection at the forefront of this debate and absolutely listen to the argument made by the shadow minister tonight. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129564"></A>
As legislators, it is vital that we constantly review our policies and procedures in the interests of best practice and to observe other jurisdictional practices, both domestically and internationally, to see whether we can improve the way we operate our justice system and corrective services system. That is why transparent reporting is paramount. I fail to see why a report on the rehabilitation program undertaken in our correctional facilities would be shrouded in secrecy if there was nothing to hide. </Hansard-Body>

I would like to thank Vaughan Johnson for the work that he put into this bill. I rise to speak in support of this bill and its proposed amendments which seek to strengthen the reporting requirements for offenders on the sex offender register. In September I spoke about Robert John Fardon, the sexual predator, parole violator and repeat offender who committed sex offences whilst on bail and under a supervision order. Sadly, Fardon is not the only paedophile out there in the community with a pre-disposition to re-offending. Dennis Ferguson has been secreted in another state by the Queensland legal system. He is a vile creature by any measure and now he is out there somewhere in the Australian community. As one crime writer wrote in 2009--</A></Hansard-Body>

There are two Dennis Raymond Fergusons--it just depends on who you ask. There is the victim, the man who was abused when he was a child, who attended a school for the blind due to poor vision, who suffers post-traumatic stress disorder from a lifetime of beatings and victimisation. Then there is the predator. The evil man Ferguson seems intent on forgetting he ever was. Such vile criminals don’t come much worse. As one judge put it, Ferguson is a ‘cunning and scheming man--not without some intelligence--a danger to children and foolish parents’.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

During this parliament’s estimates hearing in July it was revealed that eight sex offenders were missing from the sex offender register and that at least one offender had been missing from the radar for more than nine months. On 25 February 2010 the Police Commissioner was asked--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1129612"></A>
How many offenders currently listed on the Child Protection Offender Register are being managed by the Queensland Police Service? How many have failed to report or been unable to be located for more than 12 months as of 24 February 2010? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1129613"></A>
The minister was also asked--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1129614"></A>
How many have been charged with further sexually related offences? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129615"></A>
The police minister’s response to that question revealed that almost every week for the previous two years a sex offender known to the system has committed further sexual offences; 99 dangerous sex offenders on the child protection offender reporting register have committed further sex crimes since being released back into the community. It was reported during 2009 that of more than 3,100 sex offenders on the register, more than 1,000 prosecutions had commenced against registered sex offenders for breaching the laws associated with their registration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129616"></A>
The purpose of the bill is to strengthen the reporting requirements of sex offenders and also give police the power to name missing sex offenders on the register so that they can be located. Within this bill clause 70A will allow the police to publish the details of missing sex offenders listed on the register who cannot be located. Under the current secrecy provisions, police commit an offence if they release this information. This is an absolutely ludicrous situation. These monsters are wandering around in public. They comply with their conditions for a little while and then they just fall off the radar. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157773"></A>
A recent case in the UK highlighted the worth of publicising the details of missing paedophiles. The missing paedophile was arrested in Dublin after a member of the public ticked off detectives. The child sex offender was spotted in the city after someone recognised him from a photograph posted on an online most wanted list. His details had been posted on the government funded Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre website. It might not be a bad idea to do that here. He had last been seen boarding a ferry in Northern Ireland earlier this year and had been on the run for months.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157774"></A>
Clause 70A deals with the release of information if reporting obligations by the offender are not complied with. Section 1 applies if the reportable offender fails to make a report within three months after either three months or indeed one month if the offender is so required to do so. Section 2 applies despite the other provisions of this part or any other law. In such case the Police Commissioner must publish the following personal information about the reportable offender on the Queensland Police Service website: the offender’s name, an image of the offender, a statement that the offender is alleged to have committed an offence about complying with the offender’s reporting obligations; and a statement that the offender is wanted by a police officer for questioning about the alleged offence. </Hansard-Body>

I anticipate that there will be a lot of crying from the do-gooder bleeding hearts seated opposite. They are the same bleeding hearts who care more about the rights of criminals than the victims, the same bleeding hearts who were more concerned for the rights of people like Dennis Ferguson to live amongst us in the community than for the parents and their children and those living in our very communities. This bill proposes a very sensible amendment and I feel that we will have the support of all parents in our community.

(8.34 pm): This bill, the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010, further toughens the requirements on an offender’s reporting and monitoring regime to increase the protection of our very vulnerable children. Queensland has some of the toughest sex offender laws in the nation. It is at the forefront of the national register scheme to monitor the whereabouts and activities of convicted sex offenders. The opposition lacks credibility when it comes to sex offender laws. When last in government the National Party let sex offenders walk free from prison with no monitoring and no supervision.</Hansard-Body>

Mrs SCOTT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 You need to go back to those <Hansard-Italic>

 records. It took this Labor government to introduce tough reporting legislation in the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004 and dangerous sexual offender legislation in the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003. The Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act requires sexual offenders to regularly report personal details, such as address, vehicle and place of employment. The Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act enables the court to keep dangerous offenders in jail past their release dates or release them under strict supervision orders. The Labor government also introduced the Child Protection (Offender Prohibition Order) Act 2008 which enables the police to apply to a court to restrict where sex offenders can live, the places they can visit, their club memberships and the circumstances of their employment. These new laws were enacted in June 2008.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129634"></A>
To further strengthen these already tough laws, last year the government introduced the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. This bill is being debated in cognate with a private member’s bill. The opposition’s private member’s bill is a piecemeal proposal which falls short of the comprehensive overhaul of reporting obligations outlined in the government’s bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

The government’s bill increases the penalties and the reporting obligations of offenders. Our bill includes measures to increase penalties for failure to report and the giving of false information from a maximum of two years imprisonment and 150 penalty units to a maximum of five years imprisonment and 300 penalty units. It expands the matters to be reported by offenders, tightens the reporting time frames relating to completing initial reports in circumstances where an offender resides or has unsupervised contact with a child, and it also requires offenders to provide DNA samples. It expands the range of offences which will require reporting and also introduces provisions to protect special needs offenders. </Hansard-Body>

This bill places an obligation on a reportable offender to obtain the Police Commissioner’s written permission before making application to change his or her name under the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 2003 or a law of a foreign jurisdiction. This is considered a critical amendment and is intended to prevent reportable offenders from changing their identities to avoid compliance management and monitoring in the community thereby potentially enabling them to re-offend.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129673"></A>
We all know that many child molesters are devious and opportunistic. In the event that a reportable offender is able to change their identity without the permission of the Police Commissioner, the bill allows the Police Commissioner to apply to the registrar under the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act for the cancellation of the registration. This amendment also contributes to national consistency in the approach to compliance management and monitoring of reportable offenders. As more of our state laws come into line across the Commonwealth, we eliminate loopholes, anomalies and, in this case, opportunities for criminals to move about the country, escaping detection and committing further crime. I support the government’s bill before the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 April 2010. When was your bill?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129684"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs KIERNAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I know; I heard it a couple of times. It is very interesting that our Labor government introduced legislation in 2003 and 2008, so this attempt by the LNP is a botched attempt because it has missed out on the most fundamental requirements. This is not a new bill; it is an amendment to a bill. I am proud to have come into this government. Some of these bills came to this House before my time. I am very proud of the Labor government that introduced tough reporting legislation in the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004--not 2010, but 2004--and the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003. That was way before my time. However, I would not presume to come into this House tonight and act as if we were the keepers or the guardians. This Labor government has some of the toughest sex offender laws in the nation. We are at the forefront of the national register scheme to monitor the whereabouts and activities of convicted sex offenders. It can be rightly observed that the opposition lacks credibility when it comes to sex offender laws. When last in government--and I remember those days--the National Party let sex offenders walk free from prison without monitoring or supervision. As I said, it took a Labor government to introduce tough reporting legislation. As the years have passed, it is fair to say that the Labor government has continued to strengthen child protection laws across-the-board.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129687"></A>
This private member’s bill is botched simply because it looks at only one part of the measures--the penalties--but does not look at penalty units and prison time. It is important that our bill includes new measures and strengthens what was already in place. It increases penalties for failure to report and for giving false information from a maximum of two years imprisonment and 150 penalty units to a maximum of five years imprisonment and 300 penalty units. I will conclude shortly, because I know other members from our side of the House wish to speak. The reality is that the opposition does not hold the floor on this issue. This sickens each and every one of us. We will not be attacked because opposition members think that they are the guardians of the morals of this House. As I said, the reality is that we deal with the mundane, the mechanical and the sickening. In reality, none of us has the right to suggest that we are not all concerned about our children, our children’s children and their future. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(Brisbane Central--ALP) (8.46 pm): I rise to support the government’s Child Protection (Offender Reporting) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 and to oppose the opposition amendment bill. If one had been listening to the contributions of the member for Kawana and the member for Noosa, one might think that they had come in here with a comprehensive amendment bill that they had really thought through. One might think that they had thought about national consistency and how to better protect children. However, they have introduced an amendment bill that contains two minor amendments that, in reality, do absolutely nothing.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms GRACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will address my comments through the chair. If they had taken the time to actually read our bill and understand its contents, they would know how their bill is completely empty of any proper policy to protect children in this state. Their bill contains absolutely nothing when compared with the government’s bill. It is a disgrace that Laurel and Hardy over there can stand up and make outlandish comments about how this government’s bill does not adequately protect children and that the only saviour of children in this state was a government that, despite being in power for 32 years, never introduced such a bill. It was a Labor Party that first introduced an offenders’ register. So what if, in April, they introduced an inadequate amendment bill? After extensive consultation, having looked at the recommendations of the committees that provided the reports, this government has brought in a much more balanced and comprehensive amendment bill that will actually do something to protect children in this state. In this House nothing gnaws at you more than hearing the high moral ground being taken by members opposite, as if members on this side of the House do not care about children. We take great offence at that. That kind of talk should stop, because nobody in this House owns the defence of children in this country. It is absolutely pathetic and, honestly, members on that side of the House lose respect by saying that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134599"></A>
I return to the bill and I will address my comments through the chair. There are two minor amendments to the requirements to report to police. One of them is about offenders reporting not every 12 months, but every three months. Members opposite ignore all the stuff that is contained in this bill, and I know a number of speakers will go through it. Let me remind the House once again that it was a Labor government that introduced into Queensland some of the toughest sex offender laws in this nation--this government. The opposition has brought in a piddling amendment bill so that somehow it can now claim the moral ground. It is offensive and ridiculous and I am just about to point out how ridiculous it is. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134602"></A>
This bill requires extensive reporting now, with a number of changes incorporated in this legislation. It brings about consistency not only in Queensland but throughout Australia. It has taken on board the recommendations of a number of committees that have reported. It takes into account the vulnerable nature of the children. Rather than prolong the time limit in which these offenders are to report when they have had three days of contact with children--not necessarily consecutively--they have to report not in three months as the opposition bill says, but within 24 hours. That is the difference between our bill and the opposition’s. Under the opposition bill, offenders would only have to report every three months. Our bill requires that, if they are in contact with a child, the reporting time is to be reduced from 28 to seven days. In one week they have to report--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms GRACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In relation to contact with a child in any one day, once that reaches three days, they have 24 hours in which to report it. Members opposite come in here with a provision for contact every three months and claim that theirs is going to protect children. It is utter rubbish and we all know it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134609"></A>
The government bill goes even further. The bill requires the reporting of telephone carriage services, internet service providers, email address and other electronic identifiers used or intended to be used by a reportable offender. That is not contained in the opposition’s bill. The LNP does not even address the issue. This overcomes a significant deficiency in the existing legislation that we have identified--and the LNP has not--whereby such devices are used to facilitate the kinds of crimes committed by child sex offenders. There is not a word of it in their amendment bill; it is very strong in ours. The obligation for reportable offenders to provide these particular details will also assist in deterring reportable offenders from accessing child exploitation material and engaging in predatory behaviour such as grooming via the internet. I repeat once again that it is not included in their bill. A failure to comply with reporting obligations--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ELMES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I rise to a point of order. I detailed, point by point, through my presentation the provisions that are in the government’s bill that we welcomed and we will support. To have the member for Brisbane Central casting over that old ground is just not acceptable. I take offence at it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 There is no point of order. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134613"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms GRACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 A failure to comply with these reporting obligations will result in an offence committed under section 50 of the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004, the penalties for which have been significantly increased.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134615"></A>
This government has left no stone unturned in identifying the ways that a reportable offender might communicate with potential victims to commit offences. The bill amends the existing legislation to require the offender to provide details of any carriage service, internet service provider or carriage service provider within the meaning of the Telecommunications Act 1997--very extensive in modern-day social media techniques. Reportable offenders will be required to provide details of the type of any internet connection used including whether the connection is a wireless, broadband, ADSL or dial-up connection and details of any internet user names, instant messaging user names, chat room user names or any other user name intended to be used by the offender through the internet or other electronic communication services. It covers all grounds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134617"></A>
The bill also requires reportable offenders to present valid passports--another issue which has been ignored by the opposition--when reporting personal details and, subsequently, when returning from travel outside Australia along with any travel documents in their possession. This measure is for verification of reported travel and deters child sex tourism while also supporting the investigation of it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134618"></A>
Our bill is comprehensive. There are many other areas that it covers. It increases the penalties from a maximum of two years to five years. It expands the matters about which offenders need to report. It tightens the reporting time frames related to completing initial reports in circumstances where an offender genuinely resides or has an unsupervised contact with a child. It even requires offenders to provide DNA samples. It expands the range of offences which will require reporting and it introduces provisions to protect special needs offenders. This is a far more comprehensive amendment bill than the opposition’s bill. I fully support and congratulate the minister on its introduction. I support our bill and claim that the LNP bill is glaringly lacking the necessary amendments to make children in this state safe and also in Australia. I commend the government bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

I have let all honourable members know in no uncertain terms what I think of child sexual offenders and my opinion has not changed. I do not often get very angry in this place, but when it comes to this subject and the absolute stupidity of such a conflict, when both sides are working together to try to belittle the other side, it just does not cut any ice. It does not cut any ice with anyone else, either. This is the kind of bill that should be going to the committee that we were talking about today. We would get good ideas from both sides of this House. We would make it a workable thing or we would work our guts out to make it work and protect the children. Yet here in this adversarial arena honourable members are playing pure politics and it makes me really, really sick. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134626"></A>
As I said before, the object of these two bills is to protect the children. There is not an MP in here who does not feel for the children, who does not relate to the children and what they would be going through. There is not one person here who would condone a sexual offence against a child. It is just so sad that members carry on like pork chops. Quite frankly, I agree with both of the members who spoke before me. </Hansard-Body>

Sexual offenders are devious and opportunistic, as was said earlier. It is a despicable crime to commit upon a child. I do not agree with a lot of the views of the Labor Party.

These types of offenders will be sorry if they are caught because they did not report, but I do not have faith that they will take much notice of the legislation. </Hansard-Body>

 It is not wasting the member’s time. However, she has to recognise the reality that we are dealing with perverted people, and perverted people are not law-abiding people. Those who are not law-abiding people do not really give a stuff whether there is a law or not; they just go out and break it. Let us get realistic here. We are dealing with people who really do not give a toss what we think. They only care about what they care about and that is the next offence against a child. They are adults and we are protecting the children. It is the children who are the victims, not the predator. That is why I can never quite get my head around this. </Hansard-Body>

Every time I have to speak about child sex offenders my heart races. It is an involuntary thing because I know a bit about it. It is not pleasant. If anyone thinks these individuals--these animals--are going to take a bit of notice of a piece of paper, well, believe me, they are wrong. If it is true that one in three sex offenders breaches their reporting requirements then there has to be a change. It is not right. It does not matter if we have to change the law to protect our children every single day that we are in this chamber. It does not matter if the opposition, the Independents, The Queensland Party or Labor brings in legislation. It does not matter. We should just do it, because every time we make a change hopefully one more child is protected from a predator. I have hopefully let members know how I feel about this. I feel very strongly about it. Both parties have a great idea, so let us just get on with it and pass both bills. </Hansard-Body>

You can assist by making parliament aware of the anomalies in our situation and help to remove this unfairness because of where we live.

These Queensland icons are an important part of our history and who we are today. But earlier in the year we lived through a series of history-making natural disasters--disasters that will, like the 1974 floods, be an even stronger landmark in Queensland’s history, a history that will sculpt the bones of the Queensland we will be in the future. Strong in our memories and the stories that we pass on to our children and their children will be those of the mud army and how those committed volunteers brought hope to many victims and also the generosity of Queenslanders who have donated to the Premier’s disaster appeal. A couple of weeks ago my local Redcliffe RSL put on a concert featuring a variety of musicians, including headliners Wickety Wak, after which president Gary Nolan presented me with a $15,000 cheque for the Premier’s disaster fund. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139316"></A>
Another strong feature of these historic natural disasters has been the strong, effective leadership of the Queensland Premier. Queenslanders continue to talk about her leadership during this terrible time. Her management of these disasters in the preparation time, during the disasters and in the clean-up will also go down in history, and her work will become a benchmark for how other leaders will manage any disasters in the future. This is what good government is all about, and that is what Queenslanders expect from their Premier and the Queensland Labor government. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Straight on the back of the flood levy, the Labor Prime Minister has announced that there will be a carbon tax. Yes, the federal Labor government is going to turn every power point and light switch into a branch of the taxation department. And for what? It has nothing to do with climate change, which we all know is real. The climate has been constantly changing for millions of years, and always will. Long before there were power stations and petrol refineries, the climate changed. No. We know why we are going to have a carbon tax. Bob Brown told us a couple of Sundays ago on TV. He said that the Prime Minister is following through on a promise made in negotiations to form a minority government. As I said, it has nothing to do with climate change and everything to do with the Primer Minister staying in government. </A></Hansard-Body>

Also, the carbon tax is about trying to get back some of the voters Labor lost to the Greens in the federal election. I wish to quote the Prime Minister. Days before the federal election in August the Prime Minister said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1139325"></A>
There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139326"></A>
Technically, I suppose the Prime Minister’s statement is correct, because Julia Gillard is not really running the government; Bob Brown is. The loonies from the Greens are running the show in Canberra.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139327"></A>
Just have a look at what has happened over the flood levy. The Prime Minister said that $1.8 billion would be found in the budget as part of reconstruction funding. But that would have meant canning a couple of the dodgy green promises made by the PM during the election campaign, like cash for clunkers. So Bob Brown and co. said to the Prime Minister, ‘We’ll just see about that.’ In order to get the Greens on-side and get the flood levy through the parliament, the Prime Minister has had to reinstate a heap of dodgy promises worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1139328"></A>
What about Wayne Swan, the federal Treasurer from Queensland? When asked about a carbon tax, he said on <Hansard-Italic>

 six days before the election--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1139330"></A>
... what we rejected is this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1139331"></A>
Three days before that, Mr Swan said--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1139333"></A>
We have made our position very clear. We have ruled it out.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144210"></A>
It was reported on 24 February, ‘Queensland Premier Anna Bligh supported the carbon tax announcement.’ It is likely that electricity will go up by $300 per year, petrol will go up by at least 6c per litre and the Premier thinks a carbon tax is great. I have said it before and I will say it again: when the people of Queensland go to the ballot box at the next state election they should take their electricity bills and their fuels bills along with them and use them as their how-to-vote card. I understand the people of New South Wales will be going to the polls on 26 March. I think that could be a bloodbath. I am pretty sure the people are going to take their power bills and their fuel bills along with them and are going to use them as their how-to-vote card. I think that how-to-vote card is going to say, ‘We are not voting for Labor.’ <Hansard-Speech-End>

(9.10 pm): Giving recognition to students for their effort and improvement is so important, and nowhere more important than in schools such as Woodridge State High School where hundreds of students who may speak two or even up to five languages other than English come from many lands, some of which are wracked by war, many of them having lived for years in refugee camps and witnessed scenes no child should ever have to be exposed to. Many have no English language at all and some have had no schooling or very little.</Hansard-Body>

It was my pleasure recently to attend their biannual honours ceremony for second semester 2010. Merit, attendance and improvement awards were granted to students from communities such as the Chin and the Karen from Burma; Burundi, Somalia, Sudan from Africa; others from Afghanistan, Iraq, Thailand, Laos and many more; and, of course, our own Indigenous students and those from the Pacific Islands and New Zealand. Sprinkled throughout the student body are our home-grown Aussie students. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144219"></A>
Of great interest to me were the final honours awards. These were presented to students who had increased their achievement level in all subjects by a whole grade--a white bar for their first award, a green bar for their second award and a purple bar for those who had for a third time increased their level of accomplishment. I later spoke to some of these honour students and found a number of them had been in Australia for two years or less. </Hansard-Body>

Several days later I visited the Intensive Learning Support Centre, which is housed in two new demountables joined by a timber deck with shade cover. Ms Amy Sullivan, year coordinator, and Ms Pat Dore, acting head of the intensive learning support and English second language departments, explained their programs and introduced me to each class. With almost 100 students in the ILS class and 86 in the ESL class, this area is a hive of activity. Some of the students read to me and one class sang the national anthem beautifully. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144221"></A>
When we consider the script of a language such as Thai and the different sounds within the language, many of these students have to learn a whole new change in how they use their tongue and facial muscles as well as a new alphabet and sounds--no easy task. With six teachers in ILS and five teachers in ESL plus aides and volunteers, this is a very rewarding and happy place to teach. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144222"></A>
Apart from language, writing, reading, numerics, many practical skills are taught such as cooking, computing, beach safety and swimming, how to use public transport and, as funds allow, visits to places of interest. Woodridge State High School is a mini United Nations and students are so privileged to have as friends students of many lands. I congratulate Mr John Norfolk, his deputies and staff for the exceptional school this has become--connected to every world with opportunity for all.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.13 pm): Times are tough, there is no doubt about it. But it has come to my attention that there is a small group of families in my electorate and from across the Sunshine Coast that are doing it far tougher than the rest of us. Late last year I was contacted by three families from Glass House. Each of these families has the challenging but rewarding responsibility of raising a young person with a disability.</Hansard-Body>
<DIV>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144230"></A>
Jude and David Mannix’s son Levi is typical of these young people. I had the opportunity to meet Levi last week. He is a great kid. We shared stories of shaving mishaps. Until the age of 18 Levi received wonderful care through the education system. He attended a Sunshine Coast special school and did so five days a week--like any kid his age. The education was not only a positive for Levi but for his parents who could use the respite offered by the schooling to pursue careers and earn the wages required to continue caring for Levi.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144231"></A>
But all that changed when Levi graduated, as it did for the children of the other families. Suddenly their parents had to apply for post school funding through Disability Services Queensland. After talking up their children’s progress for the previous 12 years, parents like Jude and David had to talk down Levi’s abilities. They had to prove, again, Levi’s disability in the hope of securing some post school funding. The application process was distressing and lengthy, and in the case of all of these families ultimately unsuccessful.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144232"></A>
So in one fell swoop Levi has gone from five days a week support through the education system to zero support through the disability system. His disability pension of less than $10,000 per year does not even offset the lost income his parents have incurred through now having to care for him full time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144234"></A>
Levi had hoped to attend a life skills and Get Set for Work program offered through a local disability service provider, Compass in Palmwoods. The program is offered three days a week at a cost of $15,000 per participant per year. So rather than dash his hopes, Jude and David are covering the cost out of their own pockets. Not all families with a young disabled adult are so fortunate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144235"></A>
The really distressing element to this story is that when I wrote to the disability minister I was told the investment in post school funding would be increasing through budget announcements later in the year, but that it would not be applied retrospectively. So families like the Mannix family would continue to miss out. It is distressing because all these families are looking for is $15,000 per year. For the 24 young people who graduated from special schools on the coast last year that would amount to a paltry $360,000. When we consider this government has wasted $400 million on a pipeline to nowhere, our heart breaks.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144236"></A>
Even Labor’s basket case, New South Wales, has got this one right. It offers banded community participation funding ranging from $21,000 for young people with moderate disability needs up to $54,000 for exceptional needs. They also offer $18,000 for transition to work programs. Minister, I know you are new to the position; here is an opportunity to get some runs on the board.<Hansard-Speech-End>

(9.16 pm): I wanted to advise the House tonight of some recent events in my electorate, particularly involving the BSA, the Building Services Authority. It has done a fantastic job after the floods that affected my whole electorate. We have had two BSA sessions in my electorate--one at Fernvale and one at Karalee last Monday night. These sessions are run by BSA staff. They also involved staff from Master Electricians, Workplace Health and Safety Queensland, the Electrical Safety Office and many others. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144248"></A>
They talked about things like when repair work should commence; choosing contractors and the importance of these contractors to be licensed; the importance of homeowners signing contracts and paying home warranty insurance so they are covered by the BSA; the BSA’s new natural disaster repairs contract, which I found very interesting; drying requirements in relation to specific building elements--and that is very interesting when we consider that some of the wood in houses that were submerged six weeks ago is still not really ready to be sheeted--timber framing, wood products, lining and cladding issues; floor and wall furnishings and products; septic tanks and effluent systems. I found it remarkable to learn that some of the septic systems in my area are not covered correctly and certainly need to be redone. They also talked about electric and gas installations. Building planning and approval and plumbing approvals were talked about by council staff who were present on the night. The types of construction and the availability of products for kitchens and wet areas was also discussed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144250"></A>
People who contributed to these events were Lyn Shanahan, Sharon Hopkins, Nick Davies, Doug Sparkes, Dave Benson and Michael Chesterman from the BSA; Peter Steven from Workplace Health and Safety Queensland; David Hine from the Master Electricians; and Graham Nyman and Casey Kendrick-Ward from the Electrical Safety Office. The electrical people provided expertise in relation to trying to rewire houses and when it is safe to do so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144251"></A>
On the night I also made sure that we had some people along who were about to provide other types of support, particularly legal aid support. Loretta Kreet from Legal Aid was able to provide advice in relation to insurance issues, specifically those issues where people were not responded to in the correct fashion by insurance companies. We also had Department of Communities staff from the recovery centre who were there to help individuals affected by floods complete forms and explain them to them. Our counsellors from Lifeline were also there. These counsellors have been around for a long time now. With the communities staff they have been doing a fabulous job. The minister visited Ipswich recently and we spoke to some of the people involved, particularly with the Salvation Army. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1144253"></A>
I take my hat off to all of these people. Without these people and the support of the government, people in my electorate would not be where they are. I know that a lot of them would like to be back to where they were before the floods, but, unfortunately, that will not be able to happen at this point. I also noticed yesterday the Premier’s announcement of further flood assistance, which I think is outstanding. I am sure that people really do appreciate that. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<A href="http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/docs/find.aspx?id=0Mba20110309_211916" xml:link="simple" show="replace" actuate="user" CLASS="URL"> (Cleveland--LNP) (9.19 pm): The rising price of water in the electorate of Cleveland and the broader Redlands has become a major concern to the rate-paying population. The ongoing issue stems from the fact that Redlands water, which once was cheap, is now on a pathway to more than double over the next seven years under this Labor government’s mismanagement. This government has proven, in its poor water management policies alone, that it is not worthy of another term in office. Four years ago, Premier Bligh claimed that she would ensure water was ‘not priced beyond the reach of ordinary Queenslanders’. Today it is clear that she has failed to live up to that promise. Water has become another Labor broken promise.</A></Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149105"></A>
The problem in the Redlands is exacerbated because Redlanders remember what low-price water was like, and they have a good memory. Previous Redland councils planned well for the future water needs of the area. Redlands had control of its precious water seized, however, by the Labor government, and Redlanders have watched as this government has not done well with it and attempted to cut and run from its responsibility, leaving behind a price path that Redland residents would never have dreamed of.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149106"></A>
The most recent manifestation of Labor failure to manage water is the utility Allconnex. Allconnex was never welcomed from the beginning in Cleveland and the Redlands by the general population. It was tolerated by some in the hope that it could not be as bad as something directly run by this incompetent government. However, Allconnex to date has not turned out to be such a good deal for Redland ratepayers. The Redlands council holds only a 10 per cent equity in Allconnex, and this is far too low. It should have been somewhere around 15 per cent.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149107"></A>
Allconnex has not responded well to local concerns, and recent inconsiderate comments from Allconnex have further infuriated local residents. Something needs to be done to deal with this. Allconnex is a state government creation and the government cannot just wash its hands of responsibility. A major review of Allconnex operations is required before the people of Redlands will be happy. In fact, many in the Redlands are calling for it to be scrapped and for water management to again be placed under council control. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149108"></A>
The LNP has committed to policies that drive state bulk water prices down. The Leader of the Opposition, John-Paul Langbroek, has committed the LNP to a policy of capping increases in the bulk water price to CPI. We will also thin out Labor’s fat cat water bureaucracy. The LNP has also committed to preventing councils from price gouging water. The Leader of the Opposition introduced a policy to prevent price gouging and in recent days the Premier has been dragged into supporting our policy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149109"></A>
Residents are so angry at this government that they are deciding to do something about it. Ordinary citizens like Rose Doyle have become active locally by launching petitions. I have sponsored this petition as an e-petition in the Queensland parliament to bring down the cost of water. I commend the e-petition to the Queensland public, particularly the people of Cleveland and the Redlands. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Multicultural Communities Council Gold Coast partnered with Training Tailor Made to deliver these Productivity Places Program courses. Whilst the primary target group was intended to be people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, this group were in fact from highly disadvantaged backgrounds. The aim of the project was to help meet the demands for assistants in nursing, aged-care workers and children’s service workers on the Gold Coast, with certificate III being the entry level qualification for these sectors. All participants undertook appropriate vocational placements at local aged-care and child-care facilities in addition to the classroom training. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149122"></A>
There are many employment opportunities in child care and aged care on the Gold Coast, and that is why the state government has provided funding of $192,000 to the Multicultural Communities Council. That means that they will be able to help 60 job seekers complete accredited training in aged care, children’s services or disability services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149123"></A>
Of the 23 graduates, over half had already found a job. This Productivity Places Program is about making sure Queenslanders have the best chance possible of finding a job and providing the training to make that happen. Many of the participants have overcome health, domestic, financial and transport issues to complete and graduate from these programs. The feedback from the vocational placement organisations was very positive, and the employment outcomes already achieved are indicative of the success of the program and the hard work put in by the participants. </Hansard-Body>

However, proposals in the draft Fitzroy River plan have caused widespread community concern in the area. The issue of water allocations is always an emotional and highly charged one, as access to water is the very basis of many rural farming businesses, and urban and industrial supplies are very important. However, in all systems, having physical access to water is a very different thing to having a water allocation, and in the Callide Valley especially the two things are a long way apart and mean very different things. </A></Hansard-Body>

</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149137"></A>
It has become obvious to most local people that the government’s current proposal for reform to the allocations is an inadequate way to address the issue and has the potential to create significant injustices if it is adopted in its current form. I urge the new minister and the department to consult closely with local water users, who understand the system better than anyone else. Unfortunately, the public debate has been too much influenced so far by a small number of people who do not have allocations in the system and are inflaming the issue with nonsensical conspiracy theories about Callide Valley water being sold on some worldwide water market in the new world order. I hope the minister and her department can ignore all of that nonsense and ensure that any change is focused firmly on ensuring a better deal for the genuine irrigators and water users in the system and a better future for the Callide Valley community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149138"></A>
There is a huge difference between water allocation holders within the benefited area who must pay the part A allocation price and those outside that area who do not pay anything at all. There are a number of sleeper licences where no development has ever occurred and a number of dozer licences where irrigation has ceased for a range of reasons. That all adds up to a very complex situation that will not be solved by any simplistic solution. It has been made more complex by the long dry spell that has seen very little recharge to the system for many years, with the Callide Dam at critically low levels. Now, however, the dam is full and the recent floods have been a welcome boost to water levels, but the extent to which the water levels will recover throughout the valley is still unknown. It may well be that this situation is too difficult to resolve and that the best approach may be to just leave it alone, but I believe that decision priority needs to be given to the genuine irrigators whose businesses make up a valuable part of the local economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1149139"></A>
Whether the government decides to proceed or leave the allocations as they are and manage the actual use through announced allocations, it needs to consider first and foremost the impacts of its decision on the genuine water users, the genuine irrigators, not the people from outside the area who are making lots of noise about things they do not understand. I will work closely with the new minister and her departmental officials to ensure the views of those genuine water users are foremost and that the best outcome is achieved for their future.</Hansard-Body>

It is a big issue for my constituents, and as a father I know that every minute spent in traffic is a minute not spent with our families. The electorate I represent is one of many that faces the challenges of dealing with the population growth we continue to see in South-East Queensland. As more people settle in the north-west of Brisbane and in the South Pine area, we see more traffic on the roads. </A></Hansard-Body>

One of the worst areas for congestion in my electorate is the intersection of Stafford Road and South Pine Road at Everton Park. Commuters regularly face long delays at this intersection, and anyone who has travelled through that intersection will understand that their frustration is only heightened by the fact that they have to stare at a billboard of me, since my electorate office is located at this very intersection. For the last 12 months I have been lobbying ministers to improve this intersection. </Hansard-Body>

I was pleased that, after a deputation at the Albany Creek community cabinet in December, the Premier insisted the Department of Transport and Main Roads bring forward planning work on how this intersection could be improved. I will obviously continue lobbying to improve this intersection, but something else has arisen that threatens to make the congestion there even worse. Woolworths owns a massive site on one corner of the intersection. It is the site of its former northside distribution centre and Woolworths is currently applying to the Brisbane City Council to redevelop the site into a supermarket, specialty stores, a hardware superstore and 170 apartments.</Hansard-Body>

 My consultation with Everton Park residents has told me that most residents support some form of development on that site. That is not surprising, as it is currently an eyesore, with the grass regularly overgrown and graffiti all over the derelict buildings on site. However, most people in the area share my concern that the development will make the existing congestion even worse. There is no doubt that a development of this size and nature will attract a huge amount of traffic seven days a week. I think the council should make its approval of Woolworths’ development application conditional on Woolworths funding the improvements to the South Pine Road-Stafford Road intersection, or at least make a substantial contribution towards it. I have no problem with Woolworths making money out of redeveloping its site, but the least it can do is put its hand in its own pocket and contribute to improving traffic in the area. </Hansard-Body>

Recently, I lodged a submission with the council outlining my position. As part of that, I requested local residents to sign letters demanding that Woolworths fund the improvement of this intersection. I have been overwhelmed with the response. Already I have received back hundreds of letters supporting my position. </Hansard-Body>

I will keep working hard to improve traffic congestion at Everton Park and I will certainly keep working hard to make sure that Woolworths pays its fair share and to make sure that we make this terrible bottleneck better for local commuters. <Hansard-Speech-End>
