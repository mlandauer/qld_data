This register has been tabled annually since 2007 to enhance openness and accountability and will continue to be tabled under my government. As of 1 January 2010, the threshold for reportable gifts for ministers and parliamentary secretaries was lowered from $300 wholesale value to $150 retail value, consistent with the policy applicable to the Public Service. As in previous years, the number of reportable gifts received is relatively small and amounts to just 38 in total for all ministers and parliamentary secretaries. Some 26 of these gifts fall under the new threshold of $150. Members will be able to see from the list that the majority of reportable gifts received were either donated, placed in the ministerial gift store or placed on display. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.33 am): Can I firstly advise the House that the member for Everton will be absent from the chamber today due to the birth at 4.43 this morning of Abbie Catherine Watt. Mum and baby are fine and dad is recovering. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000897"></A>
The Queensland Council of Parents and Citizens Associations is one of the largest stakeholder groups that the Queensland government works with and is certainly by far the largest stakeholder in the education portfolio. The QCPCA represents the interests of almost 490,000 students and their parents in over 1,200 schools in our state education system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998694"></A>
The QCPCA is our major education partner in the state school system and a very strong relationship with this group is essential. Every one of these members is active and every one of them is a volunteer. I am sure I am joined by other members of the House when I pay tribute to all parents who, after a busy day, set off for the monthly meeting at their local school, who take the time to support school events and contribute to the ongoing education debate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998784"></A>
Today, on the eve of the QCPCA state conference, I want to particularly put on record my appreciation for the constructive and robust relationship the government has with the QCPCA at the school level and at the executive level. I want to make particular note that the QCPCA state president, Mrs Margaret Black, will be retiring at this year’s conference. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998847"></A>
Margaret Black will be known to many in this chamber on all sides of the House. She is someone who has given a lifetime to this organisation not only here in Queensland but also, prior to her family moving to Queensland, she was an active member in the Northern Territory. I have met few more passionate and remarkable people who have devoted such a significant portion of their life to the representation of parents and the interests of children in the quest for great education outcomes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-998940"></A>
As a former minister for education I can attest that you will not ever die wondering about the QCPCA’s position on any education issue. Over the last four years Margaret has led the QCPCA through some significant education reforms. We thank her for her wise advice, her constructive criticism and for being an active champion for the children in our schools. I know that Margaret has formed a very good working relationship with the current minister for education, and I am sure he would join with me in acknowledging what a fierce advocate she can be when she is on the other side of the table. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999049"></A>
The bulk of Margaret’s 30 years as an active parent representative has been in Queensland and for the last 20 of those 30 years she has been an executive member of the QCPCA. It really is a remarkable contribution to public life. I am pleased to put on the record today our appreciation. I know that members of the House will join with me in wishing Margaret Black all the best as she moves to the next phase of her very busy life. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Caloundra Aerodrome</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.36 am): I am pleased today to update the House on the state government’s position on the Sunshine Coast Regional Council’s proposed relocation of the Caloundra Aerodrome. After considerable assessment, the Queensland government has formed the view that the Caloundra Aerodrome should not be moved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999169"></A>
This decision provides certainty for the 220 workers and 20 small businesses that are operating at the aerodrome. I note the nodding from the member for Caloundra. I think he would agree with me that it provides certainty for all of those businesses and it also provides certainty for the iconic air museum which attracts thousands of visitors every year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999231"></A>
I know that this is an issue of great importance to the local community and we have listened to their concerns. Shifting the aerodrome simply does not stack up for the community and it does not stack up economically. We have looked long and hard at the options on this issue. The studies we have undertaken reveal that the cost of relocating the facility could easily exceed $100 million. Clearly, in the current tough economic times, that is a cost that Queensland taxpayers should not and cannot bear. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999331"></A>
These studies have also found that the cost to assist the 20 existing businesses, 13 leaseholders and the air museum to relocate could amount to a further $15 million. Aerodrome businesses, the museum and the Sunshine Coast Regional Council have sought certainty on this matter. I hope for all of them that this decision provides that certainty. The decision also provides the certainty the council needs to finalise the Caloundra South Structure Plan. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.38 am): I am very pleased to confirm that the international supergroup U2 will be performing at Suncorp Stadium--in the electorate of the youthful member for Mount Coot-tha--on 8 December this year.

The Deputy Premier is very pleased that Bon Jovi will also be playing at Suncorp on 14 December, treating Queensland music fans to two world-class acts within a week. Major concerts and sporting events inject more than $300 million into the Queensland economy each year, providing a significant boost for local businesses and jobs and the state’s economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001055"></A>
In addition, major sporting venues themselves employ more than 2,000 people each year. The usual 10.30 pm curfews and other controls as approved by the government will apply to both of these concerts to minimise noise impacts on local residents. Suncorp Stadium is a world-class venue and I am sure it will continue to demonstrate its value to Queenslanders for many years to come.<Hansard-Speech-End>

I am pleased to advise the House that the way has now been cleared for the construction of a new and larger helipad at Bowen Hospital. Last year over 15,000 patients across Queensland benefited from aeromedical retrieval services and were transported for safe treatment to one of Queensland’s public hospitals. Queensland’s public hospitals maintain over 70 helicopter landing sites. Helicopter retrieval is an integral part of that service, particularly where distances are not too great. Hosting helicopter landing sites on or nearby hospital campuses minimises patient handling and enables rapid emergency responses. Bowen needs a larger helipad to cater for the large Bell 412 choppers that are now based in Townsville and Mackay. The new Bowen helipad will benefit not just the residents of Bowen but also residents from surrounding districts who might be transported to Bowen for treatment. It was all part of our $7.33 billion infrastructure building program which is modernising Queensland and providing jobs for Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002630"></A>
In 2005 a neighbouring developer had purchased blocks of land from Queensland Health adjacent to the helipad site. At the time the land was considered surplus to Queensland Health’s requirement. However, the developer subdivided the land for residential development. As a result, it has subsequently become evident that an additional buffer zone is required around the helipad to ensure an abundance of safety and so that nearby residents can have quiet enjoyment of their homes. Therefore, it was necessary for Queensland Health to re-acquire from the developer a small number of blocks of land immediately adjacent to the hospital site. Agreement was reached with the developer in February 2009 and Queensland Health sought my approval for the transaction.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002633"></A>
This situation should never have happened. Proper and thorough planning should have ensured that the health service district did not dispose of the land it might later need. I am already on the record saying that this is unsatisfactory, and I say so again today. Unfortunately, this is one example of the poor planning that had occurred in Queensland Health before service and infrastructure planning responsibility was taken out of district hands and consolidated into the Health Planning and Infrastructure Division. It is a clear example of the need for centralised and coordinated planning policies in Queensland Health and a clear argument against giving even more unfettered planning power to individual parochial hospital boards.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002637"></A>
At my direction, in November 2009 Queensland Health referred the transactions to the CMC’s Ethical Standards Unit for investigation. This step was taken not because I believed any individual had acted wrongly but because there was the appearance of a bad deal and the potential for individuals to have profited from it. Transactions of this nature must be transparent in the public interest and they must be seen to be transparent. I am pleased to pass on to the House that I am advised that investigations have cleared all parties concerned of any suggestion of misconduct and cleared the transactions by implication. The path is now clear for Queensland Health to proceed with the construction of the new helipad at Bowen Hospital, delivering better health services to the region and jobs for local workers.</Hansard-Body>

On another matter, September is Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, after skin cancer prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. One in five Australian men will develop prostate cancer by the age of 85. Remembering that by 2050 the population of Australians over 85 will quadruple, we know that there will be a significant increase in prostate cancer in the future. Around 20,000 Australian men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year. The same number of men die from prostate cancer as women die of breast cancer. According to a study conducted by the Prostate Cancer Foundation, while 78 per cent of women say that they are well informed about prostate cancer, only about 52 per cent of men feel that they are informed. </Hansard-Body>

Throughout this month the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia is raising money for prostate cancer research and awareness.

Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (9.43 am): 2010 has been a year of transition for the Queensland Treasury Corporation. In February the Premier and I announced the retirement of QTC’s inaugural chairman, Sir Leo Hielscher, after 68 years in the Public Service. Throughout Sir Leo’s time at the helm of QTC he has been ably supported by the inaugural chief executive, Stephen Rochester. Upon Sir Leo’s retirement the government also announced, as members would recall, its intention to appoint Mr Rochester as the second chairman of QTC--a position he officially began yesterday. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002652"></A>
Today I can announce that the government has appointed Mr Philip Noble to take up the position of chief executive of QTC. Mr Noble brings a very impressive CV to the job, with significant expertise in treasury and risk management, fixed interest and capital markets. Mr Noble has extensive experience in commercial banking. Most recently, he has been a managing director and the head of the fixed-income division at Credit Suisse in Sydney--a position he will leave to take up the job at QTC. He has previously held positions at Deutsche Bank and at Bankers Trust Australia. Mr Noble has one other attribute, too. I am proud to inform the House that Mr Noble is a Queenslander. He was born here, he went to school here, he went to university here and in recent years Mr Noble has been commuting from Queensland to work in Sydney. I congratulate him on his appointment. This is a prestigious position and indeed a welcome homecoming.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002656"></A>
Mr Noble joins QTC at a very important time. One only needs to look at the continuing issues in Europe and the doubts around the US recovery to understand that we must remain vigilant. I have no doubt that his experience and expertise will enhance QTC’s excellent reputation and allow QTC to make the most of current and new opportunities. A key part of Mr Noble’s new role, as has been the mandate for QTC since its inception, is to promote Queensland’s economic story to domestic and international investors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002657"></A>
The state details released as part of the national accounts released by the ABS yesterday continue Queensland’s historical standing as an attractive destination for investment and provide--at many levels--for optimism and investor interest into the future. The data released shows that state final demand--a key but not-all-encompassing element of economic growth--grew by 0.6 per cent in the June quarter. That is higher than the half a per cent recorded in the March quarter and the strongest quarterly result since June 2008.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002658"></A>
The data shows that business investment in machinery and equipment rose 4 per cent in the quarter, while construction of new dwellings by the private sector also rose--up 2.2 per cent. It is worth noting that on the more volatile seasonally adjusted figures there was a 40 per cent increase in machinery and equipment investment by the private sector. These figures bode well. It is evidence of a comeback from the private sector, which is yet to fully return to pre-GFC investment levels. It shows that confidence is returning and with it a renewed optimism for the Queensland economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002659"></A>
Again yesterday those opposite continued their relentless campaign to talk down the Queensland economy. The government is not interested in their carping, nor are the people of Queensland. We are determined to implement our economic plans because they are delivering jobs--delivering jobs, not job cuts--just like we said we would. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Sunshine Coast, Construction Industry</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002662"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. SJ HINCHLIFFE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Infrastructure and Planning) (9.47 am): The Sunshine Coast needs more housing supply and needs more local jobs. The construction industry is the second largest employer on the coast, but it is tough times at the moment for local labourers and tradies. In fact, the region has the third highest unemployment in Queensland. The Sunshine Coast construction industry has seen a three per cent decline in construction employment since the 2008-09 financial year. These figures, in addition to comments from local industry, clearly indicate that the construction industry is suffering and housing affordability due to a lack of supply continues to be a big problem. The council’s own Affordable Living Strategy 2010-2020 confirms that the Sunshine Coast has a very real housing affordability problem, with housing stress impacting one in three Sunshine Coast homes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002668"></A>
In addition, new Bankwest data released in July found that Sunshine Coast housing affordability was only getting worse. Bankwest’s <Hansard-Italic>
First time home buyers </Hansard-Italic>
report stated that Sunshine Coast homes were the most expensive in the state. The report went on to state that, while it took an average Queensland first-time homebuyer 4.5 years to save for a house, those looking to buy in Noosa and Caloundra had to save for 6.8 and 5.8 years respectively. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002673"></A>
Clearly, housing supply is a very real problem, and finalising the Caloundra South Structure Plan has the potential to unlock 22,000 new homes in a master planned community with green space, jobs and infrastructure. This government understands how tough it is for first home buyers to find affordable homes. That is why we recently announced that the Urban Land Development Authority would take responsibility for delivering three new communities at Flagstone, Yarrabilba and Ripley Valley. This major step will help improve supply in the south-east growth corridor. Equally, the community plan for Caloundra South will make a real difference to housing affordability and jobs on the Sunshine Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002679"></A>
I have formed the opinion that the Queensland government needs to act. That is why we have secured the future of the Caloundra Aerodrome today and that is why I am foreshadowing the use of ministerial powers, including a call-in of the preliminary approval development application for Bellvista 2 and a ministerial directive in relation to the Caloundra South Structure Plan. As required by law, I will consult with the Sunshine Coast Regional Council and the landowners on the use of these ministerial powers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002683"></A>
The delivery of housing and jobs in this part of the Sunshine Coast has taken too long. The Bligh government will act decisively to ensure that key workers, first home buyers, families and existing and new residents can be part of the Sunshine Coast community. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (9.50 am): The Queensland building industry is far from being out of the woods as it struggles to recover from the global financial crisis. Indeed, according to industry experts the industry may get worse before it gets better. We are providing Australia’s largest infrastructure program to build new hospitals, schools and roads but we are also creating around 106,000 jobs through this recession-busting $17 billion program to help support the construction industry through its darkest days. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002730"></A>
It is instructive to see what some industry participants have said about this government’s infrastructure program and its effect on the construction industry. As far back as October 2008, Steve Greenwood of the Property Council of Australia said--</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1002747"></A>
Mr Jones said further--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002749"></A>
In the past 12 months, building work done for the public sector has more than doubled, offsetting a big fall in private work. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1002751"></A>
Finally, Paul Bidwell, director of housing for the Queensland Master Builders Association, had this to say in June--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002753"></A>
... the Queensland Government’s commitment to spend $17.1 billion on capital works will help bolster the fragile commercial sector, which is still reeling from the effects of the economic downturn. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1002754"></A>
Mr Bidwell said further--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1002756"></A>
The commercial sector is doing it very tough, propped up by state and federal government spending on social housing, schools and infrastructure. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

As I have said, my father died with this disease that comes from asbestos and I am delighted that in our schools we have a great deal of awareness. Unfortunately, out there in the industry that awareness is not there. I have seen and heard of some pretty shoddy practices that occur in everyday life. But let me say that, in terms of asbestos, the department through QBuild has developed, I think, the best practices in Australia for dealing with asbestos. In that regard I congratulate QBuild for its efforts. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Moreton Bay</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002774"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. KJ JONES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ashgrove--ALP) (Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability) (9.54 am): Moreton Bay is a favourite spot for thousands of South-East Queenslanders to enjoy relaxation and recreation right on Brisbane’s doorstep. It is also home to many aquatic species. Eighteen months ago our government introduced a new zoning plan to balance the needs of Moreton Bay with those who use it now and into the future. Our plan is to ensure that we have sustainable fish stocks for the long term. Of course, we were derided by those opposite, even though 84 per cent of the bay is still available for fishing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002775"></A>
The first results are in and they are showing that this government’s actions to protect our magnificent Moreton Bay are already paying off. Later this month I will be releasing the first update on the effectiveness of the zoning plan from data predominantly collected by respected scientific body CSIRO. While the data is preliminary, it certainly is encouraging, with mud crabs already larger and more abundant in the green zones than they are in adjacent non-green zones. The longer a green zone has been in place, the more effective it is in protecting mud crabs. Male mud crabs of legal size--15 centimetres--were found between three and five times more frequently in the old green zones than they were outside the protected areas. In the new green zones, the numbers of legal size crabs are increasing. For example, in some parts of the bay catch rates outside the green zones are less than half a crab per pot, rising to over one crab per pot in the new green zones and more than two crabs per pot in the old green zones. There are also indications that some fish species are becoming more abundant in the new offshore green zone around St Helena Island and Tripcony Bight. The number of snapper recorded per hour in the green zone at St Helena Island rose from 3.5 in the summer of 2009, before the new plan, to 6.7 in the winter of 2009, after the rezoning.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002782"></A>
Bream numbers in the old Tripcony green zone remain higher than they are in the new zones or the control sites. In the new green zone at Tripcony, the number of bream caught per hour went from two before the rezoning to five today. These are the same positive changes that have been observed in other marine park areas across the world and here in Queensland, such as the Great Barrier Reef, which received bipartisan support from the then Liberal federal government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002783"></A>
We will be undertaking longer term analysis to take into account seasonal effects and climatic variations as well as levels of spawning success. But the early indications are clear: the green zones are working. That is not only good news for the environment but also good news for everybody who loves fishing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002784"></A>
An LNP government would rip out the green zones and destroy the long-term future of Moreton Bay. It is thanks to this government’s policies that future generations will be able to drop a line in Moreton Bay, because we are protecting our marine life.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport) (9.58 am): Two days ago the Premier announced an ambitious target for cycling in South-East Queensland under the government’s 20-year integrated regional transport plan. This includes a 3,000-kilometre network of cycleway by 2031, end-of-trip facilities like bike storage, showers and lockers in public transport centres and trials of green pods at selected rail stations to provide end-of-trip facilities for cyclists. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1002788"></A>
The Bligh government is committed to promoting cycling. We want to see more Queenslanders riding bikes for transport, recreation, tourism or sport, and that is what this strategy is about. We have proved that we are committed to getting more people out of their cars and on to their bikes. Last financial year we spent more than $100 million expanding cycle networks in regional and metropolitan areas across Queensland. Today I am also announcing that another 30 major bike projects are to be delivered as part of this year’s bike grants for South-East Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004528"></A>
The amount of $14 million has been provided in joint funding from the state and local governments to expand the regional cycle network by a further 19.6 kilometres. This funding will deliver a network of cycle routes and supporting facilities such as cycle centres, forming a strategic cycle network stretching from Noosa down the Sunshine Coast through the greater Brisbane and Ipswich regions to the Gold Coast and extending out to Toowoomba. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004531"></A>
Projects include completing the full length of the Wynnum Road bikeway linking Wynnum West to Tingalpa and conducting the first stage of the Goodna Creek regional bikeway to provide a commuter link from Redbank Plains to Redbank. The expansion in cycleways and facilities across South-East Queensland will make it easier for people to avoid traffic congestion by commuting to work and school by bike. The projects are part of the state government’s commitment of $600 million until 2031 for the development of the cycle routes, completing missing links in the South-East Queensland Principal Cycle Network Plan. This is an important part of the government’s commitment to manage congestion, promoting green transport options to get more people cycling more often. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (10.00 am): The Bligh government is committed to reducing the carnage on the state’s roads. Already this year 158 people have lost their lives in road crashes across Queensland. While the current road toll is 81 less than at the same time last year, it is still an horrific toll and one that is avoidable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004535"></A>
In November 2009 the Premier and the former minister announced that the government would fund an additional 106 traffic officers as part of a suite of road safety initiatives which also included new fixed-camera sites, additional traffic branch motorcycles and new hand-held speed detection devices. We are delivering on that commitment. As honourable members would recall, I announced the allocation of the first 53 additional traffic branch officers in April last year. The Police Commissioner advises that the second cohort of 53 new officers was advertised in April this year and recruitment is well advanced to ensure these officers will be on the road by the end of the year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004536"></A>
Today I am pleased to advise the House on the state-wide allocation of the second cohort of 53 officers. Six of the officers will be allocated to the State Traffic Task Force based in Brisbane; five to the Sunshine Coast police district; four each to the Coomera, Gold Coast, Logan and Townsville districts; three to the Caboolture district; two each to the Cairns, Innisfail, Mareeba, Mackay, Gladstone, Gympie, Ipswich and Toowoomba districts; and one each to the Mount Isa, Longreach, Rockhampton, Charleville, Warwick, Oxley and Wynnum districts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004537"></A>
The government recognises that more traffic police on the roads will further deter motorists from engaging in illegal and dangerous driving. Combined with covert and overt speed camera vans, fixed speed cameras and targeted and random breath test operations across the state, these additional officers will increase the chances of motorists breaking the road rules being caught. They will also increase the capacity of the Police Service to deliver on its and the government’s ‘anywhere, anytime’ approach to road safety enforcement.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004538"></A>
With four months left in this year, I would again remind motorists of the fatal four: driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs; driving tired; not wearing a seatbelt; and speeding. Avoiding these dangerous practices will help save the lives of many Queenslanders. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.02 am): More than 40 organisations across Queensland have received a total of $100,000 to host events this coming week to celebrate Child Protection Week. This year’s theme is ‘Protecting children is everybody’s business’. During the week of 5 to 11 September, events will include family fun days, art shows, workshops, educational initiatives and seminars and will be held in every region across the state. These events are an opportunity for all Queenslanders to promote happy, healthy and safe families. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004542"></A>
The week is also an excellent opportunity to acknowledge the special work done by community groups to promote positive parenting and provide crucial child protection services throughout the year. To further reward the dedication of child protection groups, the week will be officially launched here at parliament today with an awards ceremony. I am pleased to announce that the winner of the Professional (non-government) Award is Ms Lisa Hillan, a program manager from the Save the Children organisation here in Brisbane; the winner of the Professional (government) Award is Ms Anne Gray, a health worker in Queensland Health in Cairns; the Volunteer Award goes to Mr Denis Loaney, the executive chairman of ACT for Kids in Brisbane; the Regional Program Award goes to Skirmishing the Youth developed by Sergeant Clinton Ryan and Senior Constable Michael Maguire from the Charleville police; the Education Initiative Award, Student Protection Training Package goes to Mr David Hutton from Catholic Education in the Archdiocese of Brisbane; the Youth Participation Award goes to the Kids Living Safer Lives Program, a collaboration between AFL Cape York, the Indigenous Coordination Centre and Queensland Police Service; and the Media Award goes to Ms Frances Whiting, a journalist from the <Hansard-Italic>
Sunday Mail. </Hansard-Italic>
The Special Recognition Certificate of Appreciation for Valuable Voluntary Work by a Young Person goes to Jessica Ryan, a young consultant from the CREATE Foundation in Brisbane. I invite all members of parliament to attend the ceremony in the Premiers’ Hall at 1 pm today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004543"></A>
It is a sad fact that there are more than 7,200 children in out-of-home care in Queensland. Since the Bligh government has increased resources in the child protection area and people have improved confidence in reporting matters to child safety officers, the number of children in care has risen. The commitment and selflessness of child protection staff to meet this need and look after the safety and wellbeing of children and young people is our No. 1 priority. This deserves recognition during Child Protection Week. Child protection is a big job and not one that government can do alone. I would like to thank all our non-government partners who assist our child safety officers with the care of some of the most vulnerable people in Queensland. This diverse support is vital to maintaining a comprehensive safety net for these children and young people. It only goes to demonstrate that child protection is truly everyone’s business. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004544"></A>
I encourage communities to get involved in the week and show their support by attending local events. My congratulations go to all those who are involved in arranging and running events during the week and I thank them for their efforts in raising awareness of child protection issues. I particularly want to thank our media partners, Channel 7 and the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
, for getting behind this week and getting behind child protection. They know that child protection is everyone’s business.<Hansard-Speech-End>

CSG Industry, Groundwater Monitoring</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004547"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (10.06 am): As part of our comprehensive response to concerns of landholders about possible impacts by the CSG industry on aquifers, I am pleased to announce the release of a new interactive online groundwater portal that provides up-to-date groundwater information sourced from monitoring carried out in the Surat and Bowen basins. This is one of many new initiatives taken by the Queensland government and it strikes an appropriate balance between the rights of rural landholders, CSG companies and the environment. The government has listened to rural landholders and others and understands that one of their key concerns is about the possible impacts of CSG activity on groundwater resources. I am absolutely committed to providing as much information as possible to ensure the community understands CSG activities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004548"></A>
The interactive portal, which can be found on my department’s website, has been developed by the department in partnership with four CSG companies--Santos, Origin Energy, Queensland Gas Co. and Arrow. It shows the locations of private water bores, springs, gas production sites and exploration wells and provides information regarding water levels and salinity levels. Much of that information is provided by the CSG explorers and producers, but the portal also will show water levels and salinity records from departmental monitoring bores in both the Surat and Bowen basins.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004549"></A>
This initiative complements a range of other measures that have been taken by the Bligh government to ensure more information is provided to the public and to also improve government service delivery in relation to the CSG industry. As previously announced, $2 million has been invested to recruit an additional 20 staff in South-West Queensland to boost the department’s capacity to respond to, investigate and resolve environmental and water complaints associated with CSG operations. Landholders can now know more about CSG activities on their properties through requirements on resource companies to notify the landholder of planned activities. This includes outlining any intentions to drill wells or bores, disclosing any plans to undertake technical, scientific or seismic works and advising landholders when work is completed on a particular site.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004550"></A>
There also will be new requirements for resource companies to advise when they plan to conduct hydraulic fracturing, more commonly known as fracking. This strengthens previous action by the Queensland government to ban the use of benzene and other BTEX chemicals in the fracking process. In a further initiative, new CSG stakeholder advisory committees have been formed to ensure rural stakeholders have a strong voice as the CSG industry continues to develop. All of these initiatives will be implemented in close cooperation and consultation with the community and industry as the government is committed to achieving a long-term sustainable and prosperous future for both the Surat and Bowen basins. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (10.09 am): The Bligh government is dedicated to ensuring all Queensland schools remain safe places for students and that every child gets a flying start to learning and life. We have demonstrated this commitment by commissioning Dr Ken Rigby’s report into bullying and taking on his recommendations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005926"></A>
It has been a Bligh Labor government that has released cybersafety brochures for parents to help protect their children from cyberbullying. And it was a Bligh Labor government that formed the Queensland Schools Alliance Against Violence, implementing a key recommendation of Dr Ken Rigby. The Bligh government also recently partnered with leading child psychologist and bullying expert Dr Michael Carr-Gregg to deliver free ‘Action Against Bullying’ education seminars to parents, school leaders and staff right across Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

 I take the interjection. It is well attended in all places, I am told. The response to the series has been extremely positive, and recordings of the sessions will soon be made available online to further increase the reach of this important professional development opportunity. The seminars highlighted the need to support parents to understand bullying, how they can support their child and to work effectively with the schools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005933"></A>
Today I am very pleased to announce the launch of new resources developed by Queensland Schools Alliance Against Violence specifically for parents. The first is a booklet called <Hansard-Italic>
Working Together: A Toolkit for Parents to Address Bullying</Hansard-Italic>
. The <Hansard-Italic>
Working Together</Hansard-Italic>
 toolkit for parents includes information on types of bullying behaviours, roles children can play in bullying, how to detect if your child is being bullied, how to work effectively with your child’s school to deal with bullying and how to protect your child from cyberbullying. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005934"></A>
Supporting this toolkit is a series of six short videos called <Hansard-Italic>
Six Quick Tips for Parents about Bullying</Hansard-Italic>
, presented by Dr Michael Carr-Gregg. Parents can access the <Hansard-Italic>
Working Together</Hansard-Italic>
 toolkit for parents and the six quick tips videos on the department’s website. This is another example of the Bligh government working with independent, Catholic and state schools to deliver real outcomes, real plans and real policies for education. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Thuringowa--ALP) (Minister for Main Roads) (10.11 am): Bridge mania is sweeping across Queensland and our Main Roads crews and contractors are the bridge builders. The old timber Hornibrook Bridge is being dismantled. Its heritage portals and some of the structure will be preserved for the future. The newcomer on the block--the $315 million Ted Smout Memorial Bridge--is one of 40 bridges built in just 30 months under our state-wide campaign to boost safety.</Hansard-Body>

Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Forty bridges in 30 months. I take the interjection of the Minister for Infrastructure. Today I can announce that 15 years of work is being fast-tracked to just 2 years. That means more than $25 million in savings--more bang for our buck. It is a record-breaking delivery, making Queensland Australia’s biggest bridge state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005940"></A>
Queenslanders love their bridges, but our priority has to be to make them safe for motorists. That is why we have embarked on a massive $126 million timber bridge replacement program. We are building new bridges for busy freight routes. They are wider, more flood resistant with lower maintenance costs. Like the old Hornibrook Bridge built in the 1930s, most of our bridges were built more than 60 years ago. They carry much heavier loads and traffic volumes these days and that means high maintenance costs and restrictions for big trucks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005941"></A>
We have built more than 30 bridges from the Southern Downs to the Wide Bay-Burnett. We have opened new bridges on the Queensland-New South Wales border at Boonanga. We have built new ones at Dry Creek on the Gatton-Clifton Road and at Oakey Creek on the Inglewood-Texas Road. Workers are out right now replacing the Ma Ma Creek Bridge on the Gatton-Clifton Road. We are building bridges right across this vast state. I know that the member for Ipswich West supports those bridges. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 When am I going to start in the west? That is a great question from my good friend the member for Gregory. I did a bit of research on the member for Gregory’s electorate. We have spent $1,200 for every man, woman and child on roads in the electorate of Gregory this year. Compare that to the state average of $732. I am proud of what we are doing in the electorate of Gregory. I congratulate the member for Gregory for being such a great advocate for his electorate, and I will work with him for better roads in his electorate, as this side of government will do, because we do not commit to that ‘r’ word. We are not committed to that ‘reassess’ word. We are committed to working with the member for Gregory to deliver better roads in his electorate and to deliver better bridges across the state. I am not going to reassess; I am going to build. <Hansard-Speech-End>

I am pleased to inform honourable members that the quarterly indicators report demonstrates that many Indigenous communities across Far North Queensland set the 2010 school year off with a bang with a solid start in improvements in school attendance. The report demonstrates the hard work being done on the ground by department of education staff and local community leaders and demonstrates the government’s commitment to working in partnership with communities to improve the quality of life for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and that that is paying off. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005956"></A>
The report shows that the majority of schools in these communities reported stable or increased school attendance figures in term 1 this year compared to term 1 in 2009. School attendance in Aurukun, Doomadgee, Mornington Island, the Northern Peninsula area--which is made up of five communities--and Wujal Wujal has improved. School attendance in Aurukun has consistently improved, from 46.1 per cent in term 1 in 2008 to 56.1 per cent in term 1 in 2009 and, I am pleased to say, it is up to almost 66 per cent in term 1 this year. </Hansard-Body>

 Aurukun is on the way to being a star, and the kids are embracing the new educational opportunities, I am told by the mayor and other community members. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005960"></A>
Coen’s school attendance rate--wait for this--is 94.9 per cent in term 1 this year, and that remains above the state average for attendance at mainstream schools across Queensland. Schools in other communities like Hope Vale State School, Western Cape College in Mapoon and Bloomfield River State School in Wujal Wujal have attendance rates closing in on the state average. The quarterly indicators report shows that a lot of work is being done by school staff, local parents and citizens associations and community members to get kids attending school regularly and thereby setting them up, as the new generation, to reap the rewards that an education can bring.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005964"></A>
I mention another dimension of the quarterly report. I am similarly pleased that Aurukun, Cherbourg, Coen, Doomadgee, Hope Vale, Kowanyama, Lockhart River, Pormpuraaw and Wujal Wujal have shown a decrease in the rate of reported offences against the person compared to the 2007-08 and 2008-09 figures. Reducing violence and improving community safety are increasingly high priorities in all of the discrete communities. The Bligh government will continue to work in partnership with communities to see this downward trend continue across all communities and all indicators. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Unlicensed Motor Dealers</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PJ LAWLOR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southport--ALP) (Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading) (10.17 am): I am pleased to announce that the Office of Fair Trading has established a hotline for consumers to report unlicensed motor dealers who are not operating within the law. The hotline was developed as the second phase of the Operation Turner investigation, which we launched in March this year, to target backyard motor dealers and odometer tamperers. It is time for the community to get together to eliminate these dodgy motor dealers--and this new hotline will assist with doing just that. The hotline number is 31151726. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005968"></A>
We are targeting unlicensed motor dealers and odometer tamperers because they put Queenslanders at serious risk. The types of vehicles sold by unlicensed motor dealers are often of a lower quality and may be repairable write-off vehicles that have been significantly damaged in accidents, repaired and then sold to unsuspecting buyers. Consumers spending thousands of dollars to purchase a vehicle deserve to deal with people who play by the rules. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005969"></A>
The Office of Fair Trading issues licences for a range of occupations--from motor dealers to real estate agents--to ensure those working in the industry are professional and suited to the job and, as a result, consumers are protected. Working unlicensed in the motor trade industry is a serious breach of the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act. These backyard motor dealers do not pay licensing fees, have no overheads and so have an unfair advantage over licensed motor dealers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005970"></A>
As I mentioned, this is the second phase of Operation Turner, which so far has prosecuted 10 people and obtained fines of $51,000 for unlicensed motor dealing and odometer tampering. One of the investigations of a backyard trader revealed that 65 vehicles had their odometers collectively wound back in excess of four million kilometres.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005971"></A>
When purchasing a second-hand vehicle, Fair Trading encourages consumers to have it independently inspected by a mechanic. It is important for consumers to carry out a Register of Encumbered Vehicles check, known as REVS, and a Transport and Main Roads Vehicle Check, known as a Vcheck, when considering buying a used car. These checks help the buyer understand the vehicle’s history and whether there is any outstanding money or fines owing on the vehicle. My final message is this: if you are considering buying a second-hand car, then remember this number--31151726. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Homelessness</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. KL STRUTHERS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Algester--ALP) (Minister for Community Services and Housing and Minister for Women) (10.20 am): This morning I officially opened the National Homelessness Conference in Brisbane. Labor governments have put reducing homelessness high on the public agenda and have made unprecedented investments in homelessness services and social housing right across Australia. A question on the minds of participants at the conference this morning was: what will happen to this significant investment? What will happen to these unprecedented national-state-territory partnerships on housing and homelessness if there is a change in the federal government? If we wake up one morning next week to the news that Mr Abbott is Prime Minister, there is no doubt that much of this will be put at risk. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007708"></A>
The Howard government, which included Tony Abbott as a senior minister, relied on pulling the private rent assistance lever to deliver housing, and in the process they starved the states and territories of important capital funds for public housing. They did not even have a minister for housing for their term of government. Mr Abbott himself has publicly said that there is not much that can be done about homelessness when people choose to be homeless. In all my years of working in the human services area, I have not met one person who has said it is a lifestyle choice. Labor governments know that homelessness can potentially affect anyone and that it is definitely not a lifestyle choice and it needs significant government and community attention. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007710"></A>
The National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, which was developed by Labor governments, is providing an ideal opportunity to roll out new ways to tackle homelessness. We have developed a ‘no wrong door’ approach to service delivery that makes sure clients who need a more intensive level of service get the right response at the right time and get the follow-through they need--and it is working. Adrian Pisarski, a board member of National Shelter and who is present at the conference, said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1007712"></A>
<Hansard-Italic>
Queensland has been transforming its response to homelessness, perhaps more dramatically than any other States in recent years. In both the community sector and government, new ways of thinking about and addressing homelessness have emerged.</Hansard-Italic>
</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007713"></A>
In Queensland we are clear about our goals, and we share the national goal of halving overall homelessness by 2020. That is why we are investing in crisis support services and more options to exit to long-term social housing. By the end of this year, we will have 3,000 extra homes for people doing it tough. Warren Entsch, the federal member, wants to undo all of that in his area. He wants to turn social housing into luxury units. He wants to get his hard hat on and his jackhammer out and change these public housing units into luxury units. He wants to take from the battlers and give to the well-heeled. I call on the LNP to do the right thing and stand up for Queenslanders who are doing it tough. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. A PALASZCZUK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Inala--ALP) (Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs) (10.23 am): One of my top priorities is to provide early intervention programs to children with a disability. The Baby Bridges program offers children aged zero to five specialised play sessions to maximise sensory situations and learning capacity. It is designed to give children the best start in life. I have seen firsthand the way Baby Bridges is changing the lives of Queensland children. In July I visited the Horizon Foundation with the member for Capalaba, Michael Choi. It was great to see these children getting the support they need. The state government has provided Horizon with $30,000 to help run its Baby Bridges program.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007717"></A>
The Baby Bridges program enables parents to take part in respite group activities which provide them with up-to-date information, advice on therapy services as well as opportunities to establish support networks with other parents. Parents have reported that the program has helped them to better understand their child’s disability and support needs. But even more importantly, it is a huge benefit to the children themselves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007718"></A>
I am pleased today to announce an expansion of the Baby Bridges early intervention initiative. The state government will provide an extra $960,000 over the next three years to expand this program state-wide. It will go to 14 locations across the state. The expansion of the Baby Bridges program will benefit an extra 1,600 Queensland families. There is strong evidence that early intervention initiatives can help to change and transform the lives of these young people. Early intervention enables the best start in life. I am very pleased that this initiative will be expanded state-wide to benefit Queensland families. It will also help give these families the very best support they need, which means the very best start in life.<Hansard-Speech-End>

This inquiry was commenced by the Public Accounts Committee of the 52nd Parliament which sought public submissions on the inquiry’s terms of reference. The Public Accounts and Public Works Committee completed the inquiry, including holding a public hearing on the issues raised in the submissions. During the course of the inquiry, the 2010 strategic review of the Queensland Audit Office was completed and the committee also had regard to the recommendations made in that report in its consideration of the issues.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007738"></A>
Whilst this inquiry was an examination of the Auditor-General’s performance management systems audit mandate, it became clear early on that there was a strong undercurrent of opinion that the Auditor-General’s mandate should be expanded to encompass the wider performance auditing mandate. The committee heard strong evidence to support this suggestion. The committee has made six recommendations covering various aspects of the Auditor-General’s mandate. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1007739"></A>
I am sure I speak on behalf of both the committees in thanking all of those organisations that took the time to provide submissions and those who met with the committee during the course of the inquiry. I would also like to thank the other members of the committee and the research staff, particularly Deb, Helen and Marilyn, for their valuable contribution and continued support.

<A ID="pgfId-1007760"></A>

Mr LANGBROEK </Hansard-Member-Up>
(10.30 am): My first question without notice is to the Premier. Last week the Premier said on radio that her privatisations were necessary to complete the hospital redevelopments at Cairns and Mackay, despite the fact that the reason for the sale of the Cairns and Mackay airports was to fund the same hospitals. I table the Premier’s press releases stating that the sale proceeds would actually go directly into the redevelopment. Will the Premier explain why the money from the airport sales did not fund the hospital redevelopments? Where did the money go?</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009733"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to advise him, firstly, that all of the proceeds from the sale of those airports are going into those hospitals--completely--and I am even more delighted to tell him that we are spending more on those hospitals than those sales realised. In fact, in relation to the hospital that we will build in Mackay we currently have people on site doing work now. The hospital that we will build there for the people of Mackay and the Whitsunday region will be bigger and better than originally planned and we will be funding it over and above the return from the sale of the Mackay Airport. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009734"></A>
I am also pleased to advise in relation to Cairns. If the member had been paying attention, he would know that additional funds have been put into the Cairns Hospital from the federal government and we have agreed to match, in some cases, or to take on the operational funding of things like cancer services and oncology. Why? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am pleased to take the interjection from the Deputy Premier. Guess what? In Cairns and Mackay, the airports are still there. And guess what? They are getting better and they have more flights. Why? Because they now have private investment and commercial operators. What we are seeing in Cairns is the beginning of a real increase in flights into that very important tourism market, and similarly in Mackay. It is a good example of what private enterprise can do in commercial operations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009737"></A>
I note the member for Whitsunday nodding her head. She knows personally just how much more the people of the Mackay and the Whitsunday region and the tourism operators in her area are being serviced by an airport that is now running on a fully commercial basis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009738"></A>
What do we have? Commercially run airports providing better services to the regions, providing better services to the tourism operators and businesses, and the funds that were realised are building better hospitals and better health care. We are in a position to put in the top-up needed to make those facilities even bigger and better than originally planned. So I thank the member for the question. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My second question without notice is also to the Premier. The Premier has promised to listen to Queenslanders. However, she has ruled out a referendum on privatisation. Given the overwhelming opposition from workers, unions and Queenslanders generally, is the Premier suffering from the worst case of industrial deafness in history, or is it just a case of selective hearing from a Premier who has stopped listening? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009744"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. As I have said on this issue on a couple of occasions--and I am happy to repeat it again--this program is part of the fiscal strategy and the budget program of our government. There is no government in the Western World that I am aware of that puts its budget strategy out for a referendum. That is no way to govern. When you have a difficult decision to make as a government you take into account all of the facts, you weigh up the pros and cons, you take the best advice and you take the decision, just like we said we would. You then implement it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009746"></A>
The proposal by the Leader of the Opposition is akin to running Queensland as an anarchistic collective. What we would have is the government putting the budget out every year and asking people, for example, ‘Which employer do you think would say they want to pay payroll tax? Which mining company would say they want to pay royalties?’ These are the people who want revenue for the services and the infrastructure in their electorate, but they do not want a budget strategy that would actually fund it. </Hansard-Body>

I note this question was asked by a man who comes into this parliament with a background as a dentist.

I remind the member for Maroochydore that the government that she was part of in 1996, 1997 and 1998 did not go to the election promising to privatise Suncorp, but that is what they did. They did not go to the election saying they would privatise the cleaners in Queensland Education, but that is what they did.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms STONE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Premier. Can the Premier please update the House on the government’s latest efforts to secure jobs and deliver affordable housing for Queenslanders in tough times? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009764"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 There is no doubt that job security and affordable housing are very key issues facing Queenslanders today. We are determined, as I have said, to work to grow our economy, to see our economy emerge into recovery. One of the sectors that, without doubt, is doing it the toughest is the property and construction sector. We know that there are a number of very good and potentially very viable projects that are struggling in the new financial realities to get financing, but equally we know that there are projects that do have financing which are being held up, unfortunately, in complicated and complex planning arrangements. That is why I am very pleased to note the ministerial statement made by the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning this morning in relation to Caloundra South. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009766"></A>
This site has been the subject of planning for almost a decade. The time for delay is over and today, with the announcement by the minister, we send a very clear message that the state will step in where necessary to deliver what is needed to secure jobs, to give a real prospect to people and families on the Sunshine Coast that they can aspire to own their own home in their own communities. Business operators on the Sunshine Coast are telling us that they are finding it hard to get workers because they cannot afford the rents that are part of the reality of living there. The Sunshine Coast is now the least affordable place to own a home in Queensland. Places like Caloundra should be places where young people can aspire to have a home. They are great communities. These are great places for young families. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009767"></A>
We know that there are many jobs that are dependent on the construction industry. Figures just this week show building approvals in Queensland down 6.7 per cent in July. Unemployment on the Sunshine Coast is 6.4 per cent, which is higher than the state average. We know that there are building companies and tradies who are simply running out of work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009769"></A>
That is why our government will step in. As outlined by the minister this morning, consultation will now occur on the appropriate use of ministerial powers with regard to this project--a project that over a number of years could ultimately deliver up to 22,000 homes for this region; a mixed use community with more than 200 hectares dedicated to business use. There will be jobs now in construction and there will be an investment in jobs later with business being attracted because of that sort of planning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009770"></A>
Ultimately, this could create 10,000 full-time, long-term jobs. We are very focused on making this a well-planned, sustainable community. I understand that in any community there will be questions about what the new part of their neighbourhood will look like.

 I thank the member for the question, I think.

Let us be very clear that the member for Southern Downs has a very selective memory. The Labor Party conference last year did consider this issue. It had an opportunity to debate the issue, which it did. It passed a motion supporting the government’s actions. The government secured an absolute majority for the course of action that it is taking. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011817"></A>
While I know that there are many in the Labor Party for whom this is difficult--and I understand why--what we have is a party that, when it came together in a formal conference, backed the government’s need to follow this course. It seems extraordinary to me that the member for Southern Downs, for whom policy has never meant anything and who has never been bound by the conference policy that is put forward by his party, would come in here and even want to talk about what the Labor Party might be doing. What I can assure the member for Southern Downs of is this--</Hansard-Body>

 I am very happy to assure the member for Southern Downs--and I appreciate his concern on this issue--that when the Labor Party state conference is held the delegates there will be applying themselves to the challenges of the 21st century. They will be looking at policy to best secure and protect our environment. They will not be looking at how they can rip down more forests--as they do at the LNP conference--and they will not be going back to the social policies of the 1940s and 1950s. They will be grappling with the challenges of the 21st century and applying themselves to policy which we will then take to the next election. I look forward, yet again, to a policy competition with the member for Southern Downs. We know exactly where that will end. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs KIERNAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Premier and Minister for the Arts. Can the Premier inform the House about the progress on energy issues relevant to my electorate, and particularly the north-west minerals province and North Queensland? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011828"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. This is a great example of a question from a Labor member who is prepared to do the hard yards and grapple with the challenges of the 21st century. What is the great challenge in the north-west? In the north-west of our state we have one of the best resource reserves anywhere in Australia. Accessing those resources and providing an opportunity for those communities and for the state and the nation to benefit from that requires a supply of energy that has not been possible to put there in the past. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011829"></A>
As the member for Mount Isa knows, we have been working very diligently with the private sector--with a consortium called CopperString--to bring a transmission line from Townsville to Mount Isa. There is very good news today. I am very pleased to advise that the Coordinator-General has approved draft terms of reference for the proposed 700-kilometre CopperString powerline from Townsville to Mount Isa. This is the first big step in making this project a reality. The environmental impact statement basically starts today with the release of those documents. They are available on the website today. Public consultation will occur until 4 October. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011833"></A>
Of course this project will bring a more reliable energy source to Mount Isa, to the towns along the way and to the member for Mount Isa’s constituents. But the real power of this project is the power it has to unlock the resource sector of the north-west of Queensland. This is a project that will make the Queensland economy stronger and provide opportunities in that part of our state that have simply never been there in the past. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011836"></A>
This project goes further. If this project brings a transmission line across the Cloncurry area it will bring transmission across the great geothermal resources that are located there. Ultimately, this would be the way that we would link those geothermal resources into the grid--into the national electric market. That is many years away, but it is this sort of planning that makes that a possibility and will drive investment in that sort of energy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011837"></A>
I congratulate the member for Mount Isa. This proposal is to construct an alternating current, high-voltage transmission line to the north-west Queensland electricity supply system. The member for Mount Isa has been its chief advocate and champion. This is one of those visionary projects that is right up there with the sort of vision it took to bring the Snowy Mountains scheme to reality. This project unlocks the north-west, unlocks those mineral resources and builds a stronger Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. The member of course represents a very remote electorate in Queensland, and we know that the story of Queensland is very much the story of regional and remote Queensland. One of the things you notice about members of the opposition is their arrogance and hubris when it comes to election results. Each time they have it. Each time they come in here after each result and each time they lose when it is a subsequent election, because we on this side of the House take nothing for granted. But what do you do on your side of the House? Every time you take your position for granted. The arrogance of High Toryism!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013912"></A>
The Bligh government is sticking to our strong economic plan of delivering more jobs, building infrastructure and investing in Queensland’s economic recovery across all of Queensland. Our plan is delivering more capital investment, more services, more staff and more jobs into regional Queensland, including the most remote parts of our state. The annual per capita health spending in areas like the central west and the north-west is much higher than it is in the south-east. Recurrent funding on services staff and beds is higher in remote Queensland than in the city. In the central west it is $3,500 per person per year and in the north-west it is $3,250 per person per year compared to, for example, the metropolitan north at $2,500 per person per year, and that is not taking into account the very significant number of people who are treated in Brisbane or indeed the major centres as part of a state-wide health system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1013917"></A>
We know that our $7.33 billion record health infrastructure program would be subject to reassessment if the member for Clayfield and his cronies got their own way. The Wynnum Hospital project is worth $12.5 million with the tender process underway. Those opposite would reassess that. They would reassess the Barcaldine aged care and private surgery project. They would reassess the Blackall private practice clinic. In terms of the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, you will not guarantee to build it. We brought forward the services. You have been here since before I was elected to parliament and since before the Premier was elected to parliament. You keep on turning up time and time again and you have delivered nothing!</Hansard-Body>

 the other day after the opposition had done a bit of a tour there an article containing comments made by the member for Mudgeeraba--the self-styled health expert--where she indicated that the travel subsidy--</Hansard-Body>

... should also take into account the expenses incurred by the Royal Flying Doctor Service.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

She said, ‘It’s about $7,000 a trip and it doesn’t come off the Queensland Health budget. We just use their money.’ I say this to the member for Mudgeeraba: we put 40 million bucks a year into the RFDS. It is not free. We actually pay for it. People like the member for Gregory know that. When you have to be a health policy expert, check your facts before saying that to the paper, and I table the article.</Hansard-Body>

 Thank you for your protection, Mr Speaker. We have the stringest regulations that apply on asbestos products. We have set up and done some major reforms since last year, and we have the best standards in Australia. But what do we know? We know that there is a dirty secret on the opposition side. There is a dirty little secret: for 15 years the Liberal National Party in government was pumping asbestos products into state schools--for 15 years! It was not until Labor was elected in 1990 that there were no more asbestos products being put into state schools. In 1974 the then government was told that asbestos was a dangerous product. Despite that and in defiance of the National Union of Teachers in 1982 and in defiance of the Queensland Teachers Union in 1984, it insisted on pumping more asbestos products into state schools.</Hansard-Body>

Next time you get on your feet in the public arena be frank with the public, be honest and tell them that we are dealing with the legacy since 1990 of 15 years of your party in government pumping asbestos into state schools and that we are managing that difficulty--that legacy--with the best standards in Australia. </Hansard-Body>

 My question without notice is to the Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development. Can the Treasurer update the House on recently released economic data for Queensland? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016157"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As it happens I can, but I know someone who cannot--someone who is having a bit of a spot of bother in updating the people of Queensland about the economic data that has been released over the past 24 hours. As I mentioned this morning, the ABS released the state accounts yesterday and they showed that state final demand--a measure of the domestic economy here in Queensland--grew. It grew positively by .6 per cent in the last quarter--a strong result. So it went up. Growth was good. Growth was there in the last quarter. What about underneath that? Machinery and equipment investment by private business is up. What about investment in private new housing? It is up. Growth or positive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016158"></A>
But, of course, what would we expect from those opposite? Would we expect a release heralding this result? No, we would expect a full negative and that is what we have got. Yesterday afternoon the shadow Treasurer went out with the full negative, bagging the Queensland economy. Their relentless campaign continues. He said what? He said that growth had declined by half a percentage point. In fact, the truth of the matter is that growth went up--‘He got it upside down, Miss Jane.’ So ‘Old Lord Barnaby upon Clayfield’ over there has had to rush out this morning, spin his way out of it and put out another press release in which he says, ‘Growth has grown.’ So he has it right. He got a tip from the press this morning to look at pages 7 and 44 of the ABS data. So I have collected them for him. Because the releases are so good, I want to table them for the parliamentary record and, just to help out for the future, I want to make sure that he has the Treasury brief that was published also.</Hansard-Body>

In reality, while the member has had to reassess his own press release, this guy should reassess his position. He should reassess the view that the Capital Works Program should stop. He should stop the reassessment of thousands of people whose livelihoods depend on the capital program. He should reassess the fibs he tells in here about not supporting privatisation and actually admit to the view that he has always held, and that they have all held, about supporting privatisation. He should reassess being a part of such a clapped-out bunch of no-hopers sitting in their hammocks, bludging off the taxpayer, refusing to do a day’s work, refusing to put out a policy, refusing to put out a plan, refusing to stand up for the Queensland economy. Their relentless campaign against the Queensland economy will stop at nothing. It will not even stop at the facts anymore. </Hansard-Body>

In reality, we need a government with a plan for the future that will deliver jobs, as we have in each one of the past 12 months--12 straight months of jobs growth, the last four months out in front, delivering jobs; not job cuts. We are delivering jobs, we are out in front, just like we said we would. </Hansard-Body>

Nanango, Alleged Assault</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is directed to the Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services. On 20 August there was a fist fight at a doctor’s surgery at Nanango. Staff subdued a drunken, abusive and violent man who had punched an elderly patient in the head. They called 000 for police assistance and were assured it was on its way. I table a letter faxed to the minister from the surgery yesterday, two weeks after the incident. The police force has waited two weeks and now has waited a day. When will someone finally respond to this report of a violent crime? </Hansard-Body>

 Letter, dated 31 August 2010, from Dr John Robinson, general practitioner at Nanango, to the police minister, the Hon. Roberts, regarding the police response to a matter reported on 20 August 2010 [<HypertextLink>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Can I have a look at the letter, please? I will obviously follow up that matter and get back to the member as to what police response has been given to that issue. Of course, the Police Service takes assaults or incidents of that nature seriously and if there has been some oversight there, obviously I would expect an explanation as to why an appropriate response has not been given. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016166"></A>
Let me just put into context the response of the Labor government to law and order issues as contrasted to the National Party. I have been in this parliament for a number of years and I have listened to the National Party talk tough about law and order issues--how they support the Police Service, how they support the emergency services workers. But let us have a look at the record of the National Party government: low police numbers, one police officer for every 507 people under the Nationals, one for around every 430 people under the Labor Party--a massive increase in the number of police resources out there responding to all types of incidents. There were mass break-outs and walk-outs from our Corrective Services. Forty-two people walked out of prison in their last year of government. Not one person has escaped from high-security prisons under Labor. Sex offenders roamed free when the member for Gregory, the member for Southern Downs and the member for Toowoomba South sat around the cabinet table. That is the record of this National Party government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016167"></A>
The Labor government has provided significant resources to the Police Service to enable it to respond to all types of offences. In terms of the crime rate, under Labor there has been a more than 20 per cent reduction since we came to office--over 20 per cent. One of the reasons for that is a massive increase in police resources. One of the glaring issues in the Fitzgerald report was the chronic underfunding of the Police Service under the National Party government. We have turned that around substantially so that people will get the responses that are required and those crime rate reductions are as a result of that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016168"></A>
Break and enters is another example of where Labor’s increased resources have significantly improved the crime response in Queensland. Compared to eight or nine years ago, there are over 30,000 fewer break and enters into Queensland homes and businesses than there were under the National Party. So the Labor Party has provided the resources for the Police Service. We have increased police numbers, we have lowered the crime rate and we are delivering the resources that the Police Service needs to respond to law and order issues in the community. </Hansard-Body>

You can imagine that if I said that the media would be all over it wanting to know exactly what I would be reassessing. So that shows how fair dinkum even the media in this state think the member is, because it does not even bother to question him on what is a very dramatic announcement for Queensland. It is a very dramatic announcement indeed of what he would do in government. </Hansard-Body>

 Notice the silence? No comment whatsoever. Just the usual banter and gibberish that is coming from over there. But, no, no backbone, no ticker to stand up and say, ‘The Sunshine Coast is going to have this delivered under Labor and we will match that.’ No, that has not been said. What have we heard? The weasel words saying, ‘We are going to reassess.’ What about the Police Academy project? That is about $450 million; a huge commitment by this government to the building industry. It is eagerly awaited out there by the building industry. All the big tier 1 builders in Queensland have got their eyes on that project. Is it one of the ones that will be reassessed? We see no transparency, no accountability, just the usual born-to-rule, silver spoon toff who could not care less about people who work with their hands, could not care less about working families who are working in the construction industry. He would not know a brick if it fell on him. The reality is that he is damned by his silence on this issue. I will not allow any one of the members who sit opposite to get away with it. I will be up and down the length and breadth of Queensland, at every one of our projects, talking to building workers and telling them that those opposite oppose privatisation which gives them jobs. The opposition says it is going to give more money in rebates. It says it is going to reassess projects. Tell us which projects will be reassessed.</Hansard-Body>

Mrs STUCKEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology. Speaking about weasels and weasel words, documents tabled in the parliament on 11 November 2009 state that the CMC had found systemic issues within the BSA’s corporate governance framework that required a detailed review and changes to be made by 19 April 2010. It is now September 2010 and this detailed report has not been delivered. I ask: where is this overdue report or, like the health payroll, is this another project where the deadline has been missed? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018514"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As far as I know that was implemented. The member for Burnett might recall that because he actually commented on it at the time and gave me a bit of a serve on it. He is a bit more alert than the shadow minister is. While I am on my feet talking about the BSA, I am happy to report that we have the review underway. Yesterday I met with the consultants who are conducting it. To date we have only 15 submissions from the broader public to that review. I urge every member of this parliament to ensure that people are having their say about this root-and-branch review of the BSA. I happen to think it is a great organisation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018515"></A>
While we are on the topic of building, I notice that the shadow minister is not going to get up and talk about the building program. The question I have for the shadow minister, as the minister who would be the building minister in this state, is: which projects are going to be reassessed? If I cannot get it from the shadow Treasurer then perhaps the would-be public works minister could tell me. I can tell the House what projects we are going to build. I have a great big list of them. It would take me from here to eternity to go through them. Let us have a bit of a go at it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018517"></A>
The Brisbane Supreme Court--5,000 jobs there. It finishes in March 2012, just in time for the election. Is that being reassessed? What about one of the Minister for Health’s projects, the Queensland Children’s Hospital? It will be completed in 2014. That one is lined up for the old silver spooner over here to have a bit of a gander at. Is that going to be one of those projects like the Rocky railway station was--the foundations still there 40 years after the tories got in in 1929? Will he stop that project? Is that one of the ones being reassessed? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018518"></A>
Perhaps the would-be public works minister can tell us that. She needs to do a bit of answering to her own constituents, because the biggest project in Australia today is on the Gold Coast. There are 600 blokes working there. There are 700 on the waiting list. That tells us that the people of the Gold Coast are very nervous about their jobs in the construction industry. They need to know what this lot stand for. Do they agree with the reassessment of that project? Let us hear from the Sunshine Coast and the Gold Coast members about those two great projects--one big project down at the Gold Coast and a state-of-the-art hospital. We say that we are going to build it; they say that they are going to reassess it. The project will have to be funded. Should they crawl or sleep their way into government, the way they are in their policy-free zone, they will have to fund it.</Hansard-Body>

South-East Queensland, Housing Affordability</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

 Housing affordability is an ongoing issue in South-East Queensland. Could the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning please update the House on what is being done to relieve housing stress in this fast-growing region?</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HINCHLIFFE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would like to thank the member for Morayfield for his question. In doing so, I recognise his dogged advocacy in favour of housing affordability in this state. As mentioned in my earlier ministerial statement, housing affordability is a key concern of this government. It is a key concern throughout Queensland, both in the regions and in the south-east. But our concerns in this matter have been followed with action. As the member for Morayfield pointed out, housing affordability is at its worst in the state’s south-east and this affordability issue is most problematic on the Sunshine Coast. Since 2000-01, land costs in that region have consistently been higher than the South-East Queensland average. Dwelling costs have also been consistently higher in the Sunshine Coast region for far too many years. I provided strong data in this vein from BankWest and the Sunshine Coast Regional Council in my comments to the House earlier today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1018525"></A>
To relieve pressure on the state’s south-east, the Bligh government’s South East Queensland Plan 2009-2031 has directed growth to the western corridor. But as mayors Abbot, Sutherland, Hobson and Clarke will well know, the attraction to our coastal regions is strong, with large numbers of people continuing to opt for a sea change. If we do not plan ahead we will see the poor housing and transport outcomes of the past perpetuated for future generations. That is where our commitment to an integrated regional transport plan is also fundamental to what we are doing around these issues of housing affordability. </Hansard-Body>

This report clearly identifies that sites such as Caloundra South are fundamental to providing relief to the housing affordability crisis over the short to medium term on the Sunshine Coast. It gives a comprehensive view of the housing affordability challenges facing the Sunshine Coast. The report clearly identifies that a real housing crisis exists and that those extra 22,000 dwellings in Caloundra South are required to meet demand. Caloundra South has that potential. I call on the Sunshine Coast Regional Council to complete the structure plan. I am keen. I am willing to stand up and work for housing affordability on the Sunshine Coast. We need to see progress on delivery of the South East Queensland Regional Plan. It is something that we are fundamentally committed to. There are question marks over the commitment of the opposition to the South East Queensland Regional Plan. We are committed to it foursquare. This element of delivery of housing affordability and jobs on the Sunshine Coast is part of that.</Hansard-Body>

But better than that, the investment in early and immediate interventional cardiology, and those sorts of projects that were never on the opposition’s horizon in terms of services on the Sunshine Coast, has in fact been brought forward far sooner than anyone had ever promised. That is because we talked to the doctors and the clinicians, and we are delivering. </Hansard-Body>

Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I can. The Integrated Regional Transport Plan has been well received by key informed stakeholders who understand the needs of transport in our future. Robert Dow from Rail Back on Track gave the plan nine out of 10 and was enormously excited that rail was at the heart of our plan for public transport over the next 20 years. Chris Brown from the Tourism and Transport Forum, the nation’s leading forum in this field, said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1020774"></A>

This plan, with its vision of doubling the use of public and active transport while reducing the need to get into your car, is on the right track.

So is this a consistent LNP position? It might seem that perhaps it is not, because the shadow spokesman for transport suggested that the plan confirms that the government had failed to deliver any real improvement to public transport since the last plan. Let us investigate the accuracy of Ms Simpson’s claim that there has been no improvement in public transport since the last plan came down in 1997. What exactly is it that the government has done in public transport in the last 12 years? </Hansard-Body>

In April 2001 the first busway, the South East Busway, was delivered all the way through to Eight Mile Plains. Not long after that, the Northern Busway began with the only underground bus system in the country running through to the King George Square bus station and on to Roma Street, where every day 570 trains meet 1,600 buses. We have started to build the Eastern Busway. We have extended the Northern Busway. Every day on busways 210,000 people are moved. </Hansard-Body>

We have started TransLink. We have introduced the best integrated ticketing system in the country. We have extended rail to Varsity Lakes. We have duplicated rail between Robina and Helensvale and we have duplicated rail on the Ferny Grove line. We have doubled public transport patronage since TransLink started just five years ago. We stand by our record of huge change since the last plan. </Hansard-Body>

Mr FOLEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Housing. In the light of the difficulty many people are experiencing meeting continual rises in household costs, and in particular impending electricity price rises, will the minister consider fitting solar hot water and solar power panels to public housing where tenants who wish to have it but cannot afford to install it themselves will be able to benefit from the advantages of having renewable energy? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020793"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms STRUTHERS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for a very sensible and important question. This government is asking people to do the bright thing. Our solar concessions and our solar hot water rebates are active promotions for people to do the bright thing and are a very important plank of our election commitments and our policy this year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020794"></A>
In public housing people are getting the best concessions available that anyone can experience. In fact, the average concession to people in public housing is worth $7,500. If you are in public housing, as I said before, you feel like you have won lotto. On top of that, you are not paying out for maintenance. You are getting another $1,200 or so by not having to pay out for maintenance. We are very active in terms of paying rebates and concessions across a whole range of areas, including the very important area of public housing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020795"></A>
A number of tenants around the state have asked about their eligibility for some of our rebates and for some of the federal programs as well, and generally they are eligible. We are working very cooperatively with the federal government in this regard. We are very keen to be doing the bright thing in our own housing, and that is what we are doing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020796"></A>
I commend the former minister for housing because he has led the charge on this. He has made sure that our public housing is as sustainable and green and as good as it can be in terms of rolling out hot-water pumps, effective and efficient systems and environmentally friendly systems. I give credit to Minister Schwarten. He got on the job early and made sure that that was happening. We are seeing thousands of effective and environmentally efficient units--hot-water systems, shower systems and all sorts of things--being rolled out in our public housing. I thank the member for the question. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020798"></A>
Members know I am passionate about housing. So, while I am on my feet, let me tell you something: we are rolling out more than 3,000 housing units this year alone. We have signed up more than 3,000 units with developers and others under the stimulus package. From our own Future Growth Fund, $500 million was committed by this government a couple of years ago. We are serious about public housing. We are serious about people in this state getting the concessions and rebates that they deserve. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020801"></A>
The other initiative we are rolling out is the Every Dollar Counts website. I urge members to have a look on that website because that is where they will get information about our solar rebate schemes. That is where they will get information about concessions. That is where they will get the information and that is where people can get the help that they need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020803"></A>
We know on this side of politics that every dollar counts. Labor governments are the ones that have increased pensions. Some of the members here in the debates this week have had a go at us about the cost imposts on seniors. What was one of the best concessions made to seniors? The federal Rudd Labor government’s initiative to increase the pension. John Howard had 11 years to do that. What did he do? Zip--zip for seniors, zip for pensioners. </Hansard-Body>

Mr PITT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport. I have been playing tennis since I was about six years old and I really appreciate the work this government is doing to support this great sport in our state. Will the minister please update the House on how the regional tennis program is progressing and how many jobs it is producing in regional Queensland?</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. Queensland has a proud history of producing tennis champions--from Rod Laver to Sam Stosur and do not forget Pat Rafter in between. The $17.68 million Regional Tennis Facilities Program includes $9 million from the Bligh government to establish a network of improved facilities in Townsville, Mount Isa, Cairns, Rockhampton, Toowoomba and many more regional areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029552"></A>
As a result of our construction in Cairns, we were able to get Tennis Australia to announce that the Davis Cup against Belgium will be played in Cairns between 17 and 19 September. The Bligh government knew that if we built it they would come, and there is no greater event than the Davis Cup. It will be great for Cairns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029553"></A>
What really is a concern is what those opposite will do when they reassess programs. It is not just about the facilities; it is about the jobs. This Regional Tennis Facilities Program will create more than 100 construction jobs. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (11.40 am): The opposition has an amendment to clause 37. This clause is to ensure that all family members involved in a group conference are aware of the procedure and how the outcome will be used. In our amendment, we are ensuring that parties must be informed of provisions contained in 51YA and 51YB. This is about inserting another section into the act. Page 36 of the <Hansard-Italic>
explanatory notes </Hansard-Italic>
talks about this clause which inserts 51YA, which is ‘Evidence of anything said or done at family group meetings’. The explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1029575"></A>
New section 51YA aims to ensure, that in the interests of the care and protection of their child, parents can hold open discussions at family group meetings without fear of what they say being used in any criminal proceedings before a court. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029576"></A>
The explanatory notes go on further about 51YB, which is ‘Evidence of anything recorded in a case plan’. So 51YA and 51YB are about what people say and what people record. The explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1029578"></A>
New section 51YB aims to ensure, that in the interests of the care and protection of their child, parents can hold open discussions at a family group meeting without fear of what is recorded in a case plan being used in any criminal proceedings before a court, other than with the consent of all persons mentioned in the case plan.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029607"></A>
I understand that in child safety matters we have to proceed very carefully and in a timely manner. The opposition seeks to insert new section 51YC, which states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1029612"></A>
51YC 	Relevant persons to be advised of operation of ss 51YA and 51YB</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1029613"></A>
(1)	The convenor of a family group meeting must advise each person participating in the meeting about the operation of section 51YA.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1029614"></A>
(2)	The chief executive must ensure each person mentioned in a case plan is advised of the operation of section 51YB.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029615"></A>
The effect of proposed section 51YB is that anything divulged in a session will not be taken and used against the person at a later date. The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee also shares my concern in relation to people’s rights and liberties on page 47 of the <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert</Hansard-Italic>
. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029616"></A>
The interview process is a very important aspect. It should be a time of openness and transparency. My concern is to ensure that when certain information is given within this process the rights of all involved are taken into account. In any other legal interview with any other department, the rights of both sides are taken into account. People are advised that the statements they make, the information they give and the items they provide may be used at a later date. We do not want to bring that type of scrutiny to a family planning session. However, for reasons of practicality, in my experience people form intentions, ideas and proposals for the next course of action in family group meetings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029617"></A>
A dysfunctional family attending a family meeting is very much at a disadvantage. I know that they can have an independent person--and sometimes that is a family member or a friend--come along with them. They are at a significant disadvantage as the department can churn through these meetings because they hold them on a daily basis. They know the process ahead of them; they know what is going to happen and which pointed questions to ask. Because of my 19 years in the police force, I know that they ask open-ended questions to draw out a certain answer. That is good, but I am concerned about how the perception and intent of the child safety officer and other people in the room comes together to decide the way in which Child Safety will go ahead in the next phase. So can the minister answer how his department deals with the possibility of accusations about independence within the family group meeting? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029618"></A>
Moving on from there, if something is said in that family group meeting that may relate to an indictable offence which may constitute some form of offending by the child or the parent, where does that information then go? When legislation sets out that ‘this and this will be done’ and that everything said in those circumstances is not open to be questioned, it takes away from the duty of care of the department to act in the best interests of the child if certain accusations are made in the meeting. That is why the opposition is moving this amendment to include proposed new section 51YC--to take into account the two sections above. This will ensure that people understand that a determination will be made based on what they say and also that they are advised of their rights. They must be advised of their rights. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029619"></A>
Currently, in the meetings that I have witnessed, people have been told a bit about what will happen in that meeting, but because of the sheer weight and not knowing the legal repercussions they are so open. We need to ensure we respect the rights of the child, the family and also the workers within Child Safety. They are the ones who make a determination at the end of that process based on the information that they are given. Whether we talk at a barbecue or in the street, all of us make a determination based on the information we receive. I am concerned to ensure that the rights of all people involved in family group meetings are taken into account. That is why we will move that amendment. I hope the minister is able to support that amendment, which states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1029621"></A>
(1)	The convenor of a family group meeting must advise each person participating in the meeting about the operation of section 51YA. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029623"></A>
The amendment seeks to put in place some basic guidelines to protect everybody’s liberties in that process so that child safety officers or families do not have to negate accusations later on in the process. </Hansard-Body>

 I think the issues that the member for Bundaberg was talking about being involved in would have been investigations when he was a police officer. We are talking about case planning here. I would hardly think that a police officer would be at the family group meeting. </Hansard-Body>

Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>

What I am saying is that a police officer would not be at a family group meeting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029651"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Dempsey:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Unless they are a family member. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029652"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will outline the reason for this provision. People have come along to family group meetings and kept their mouths shut because they were concerned that what they said could be used in other matters, not just child safety matters. They have been concerned that it could be used in Family Court matters or a range of other things. Do not forget that these family group meetings could become slanging matches. People were concerned about what they were saying. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029653"></A>
The reason for this provision is to make family group meetings open and to foster conversation. This provision will be explained to the parties at the family group meeting. The department’s family group meeting convener handbook sets out the responsibility of the convener. It will be updated before the commencement of these sections to include guidelines in relation to these new provisions. The provision is a procedural one and can be properly dealt with in the practice guidelines. The reality is that that is where it should be. It should be in the guidelines for the family group meeting convenor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029654"></A>
The purpose for making this change is to have open dialogue. The family group meeting convener will tell people that whatever they say cannot be used against them. If they report a criminal act then the officer involved would have to report that to the police, but the officer cannot use the recordings of the family group meeting in any other way. It makes sense that the convener tell people that whatever they say will not be used against them because they want dialogue, and that is the whole purpose of this provision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029655"></A>
I believe this provision makes the member’s amendment redundant. That procedure will be in the practice guidelines. The motivation for it being in there is that we want open discussion. I have another concern. The member talked about the evidence being used against them. If we were as prescriptive as the member seeks us to be we may have someone from a family group meeting saying, ‘I was not told X, Y, Z prior to the discussion.’ My belief is that the family group meeting conveners will openly tell people about this provision. It will be part of the guidelines. They want the dialogue. That is the whole purpose of family group meetings. That is why we will not be supporting the amendment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1039605"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 What price do we put on people’s rights and liberties? That is what we are talking about. The opposition and I, as the shadow spokesperson, agree with the minister about having open conversation during those family group meetings. We support that, but we cannot throw away people’s rights and liberties at the start of that conversation. There are simple procedures that we should put in place to ensure that people’s rights and liberties are adhered to. I talk of the rights and liberties of all parties involved in the process--from the child safety officers to the child and the family. We must ensure that along with openness the rights and liberties of people are respected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029657"></A>
The minister has said that there is going to be a handbook produced. Is that correct? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029658"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Reeves:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 There is one. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029659"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
Is that handed to everyone beforehand? My understanding is that this handbook will not be handed to everybody taking part in this process. We have to have guidelines to ensure consistency throughout the whole of the state. We should not be afraid to let people know about their rights and liberties. We are simply saying that we should tell people before the process starts that whatever they say is not going to be recorded and whatever evidence they give is not going to be used at a later date. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029660"></A>
What is the problem with advising people of their rights beforehand? By having more openness and transparency at the start of the process we can make sure that everybody talks. The minister said before that people go into these meetings with a fear of talking and a fear that the department is going to come at them. This amendment would actually relieve that fear and eliminate people’s doubts. Everyone around the table should understand what they can and cannot do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029661"></A>
My worry is that we will have disadvantaged persons going into these family group meetings not fully understanding the process. From my experience, there are people in the community who say that they understand but they do not really understand. This amendment would strengthen the two prior subsections. It would ensure respect for the rights of the people involved and it would ensure that they are advised of their rights. It would make it a ‘must’ to tell people of their rights; it would strengthen the provision. It would be better for everybody involved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029662"></A>
What we can see as a result of this provision is the impression that this is a kangaroo court before legal action is taken later. They are forming the intent of what they are going to do with those actions when they leave that family group meeting. The minister cannot tell people to sit in a room and be open and transparent and talk about the issues and then Child Safety will walk out and do nothing. That does not happen. They have to form an intent within that room of what their actions are going to be. That intent may lead to criminal proceedings later on. It may involve taking the child away from their parents. It may involve separating people within the room. When they form an intent they have to make sure that people’s rights and liberties are maintained in the process. If the minister has ever been in an interview he would know that if one gets these sorts of things sorted out beforehand it is much easier and a much more open process. </Hansard-Body>

Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Just hold on and listen to what I am saying. If we were doing that, I would agree with the member. However, we are saying that whatever is said in that meeting cannot be used. Talk about rights! We are opening up people’s rights in order to get the dialogue happening. It makes common sense for the family group convener to tell people that the deliberations should have an open dialogue and that they can say whatever they want because it cannot be used against them, because we want to get the best interests of the child going forward. Given the prescriptive nature of the amendment, it will create issues. The reality is that it is there in the handbook. As I said, if it was the complete opposite, I could understand the member’s point of view. The intent of this part of the bill is to open up the dialogue, not to take people’s rights away. In fact, it is expanding their rights.</Hansard-Body>

Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am saying that the family group meeting convener will convene the meeting, talk to all those involved and encourage open dialogue in order to find out what is the best course to go forward. They will talk about what education the child should be involved in and what, if any, reunification plans there might be in the future. It is all about the best interests of the child. So there will be open dialogue from child safety officers and parents. The convener ensures that everyone has an opportunity to express their opinion about what is in the best interests of the child, not what is in the best interests of a Family Court matter or whatever it may be. As I said, if we were doing the complete opposite of what the member is saying, I could understand his amendment. The amendment is far too prescriptive.</Hansard-Body>

Amendment No. 7 ensures that the court has full details as to why there was a previous contravention of an order before it can take into account a previous breach when deciding on an application. Amendment No. 8 is designed to ensure that the court makes its reasons for making orders very clear, particularly when there has been a disagreement in coming to the case plan. This will hold all people contributing to the case plan accountable for its construction. Proposed clause 41(2) states--</Hansard-Body>

Under amendment No. 7, proposed clause 42(2A) would be a new part that would say that, if the court has agreed, it should be provided with evidence of why the previous contravention occurred and the circumstances in which that occurred before it can be taken into consideration. That encourages openness and transparency and puts everybody on the same page together. Amendment No. 8 proposes that, if a court is to proceed with a protection order without the consent of all parties, the case plan must state the reasons why. As alluded to in the explanatory notes--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029727"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Proposed clause 41(2) of the bill proposes to insert new subsection 59(2) into section 59 of the Child Protection Act. Currently under section 105(1) of the act, the Children’s Court is not bound by the rules of evidence and may inform itself in any way it thinks appropriate. The paramount consideration of the court is the wellbeing, welfare and best interests of the child. The amendment to section 59 will make it clear that one of the things that the Children’s Court can take into consideration when deciding whether or not to make a child protection order is a contravention of the act or any order made under it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029732"></A>
I will give the House an example, and the member for Bundaberg might be interested to hear this example. A previous contravention may be considered by the court. For example, there may have been a previous child protection order made for a child that directs the child’s parents not to have contact with the child while the child is at school. If the school had made the department aware that the parents had attended the school on a number of occasions, the department may provide this evidence from the school about this. The amendment clarifies that the court may consider whether to make another child protection order for this child and, if so, what type of order and may take into account this previous contravention. For the court to take this contravention into consideration, evidence would need to be placed before the court that the contravention occurred.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029733"></A>
If the evidence before the court that the contravention had occurred is passed, the weight that the court places on this evidence in consideration of all of the information in evidence before it is a matter for the court in each individual case. If the information was not before the court about why the contravention occurred or in what circumstances it occurred, a court may choose to place little weight on the fact that there has been a contravention. However, in these circumstances a court should not be precluded from taking the contravention into consideration at all. The proposed amendment in clause 41 would in fact reduce the current capacity of the Children’s Court to inform itself in any way it thinks appropriate to make the orders in the best interests of the child.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029735"></A>
With regard to opposition amendment No. 8, section 59 currently requires the Children’s Court, before making a child protection order for a child, to be satisfied that the case plan has been developed or revised for the child and the case plan is appropriate to meet the child’s assessed protection and care needs. Clause 41 of the bill proposes to insert a new subsection to clarify that, when determining whether or not the case plan is appropriate, it is not relevant whether or not all of the people who have participated in the development or revision of the plan agree with the plan. The paramount consideration of the court remains the welfare, safety and best interests of the child.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029773"></A>
The current requirement of the act is for the court to be satisfied that the plan meets the child’s needs. The court will take into consideration all of the information and evidence before it about the child protection and care needs that are to be determined and whether or not the plan meets those needs. This information may include evidence from parties in proceedings that the case plan does not meet the child protection and care needs. It is a matter for the court to take this information into consideration and decide what weight should be placed on it when making its final decision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029774"></A>
The new subsection clarifies that the court can make a decision about whether the case plan is appropriate for the child’s needs and does not need to adjourn the proceedings and cause lengthy delays that may not be in the best interests of the child simply because not all of the participants agree with the plan. The Children’s Court is generally required as a court to record the reasons for its decision. Including specific requirements for the court to give reasons in relation to individual decisions could create uncertainty about the court’s general requirements and is not necessary. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029775"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is all good and well, but is it not then incumbent on the department to ensure that, by adding these clauses, all the evidence and decisions are given to the court to enable it to make whatever decision it will make? We are saying that the court must state the reasons. If there are reasons why people do not agree with the case plan, surely those reasons must be put forward to the magistrate, not just one side of the argument? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029776"></A>
By adding these two clauses we are strengthening what the department has in place already. What it has in place goes 90 per cent of the way, but by adding amendment No. 8 we are strengthening the resolve to ensure that all parties are involved in the process. It is not a quickening of the process to meet budgetary restrictions or to get people through the process. I believe that the courts should be availed of all of the information. All of the amendments are about ensuring openness and that everybody feels as though their rights are being protected. If not, I worry about the perception in the community; I worry that people will have an increased fear of Child Safety. We should not have a fear of Child Safety; Child Safety are there to help. The perception should be that their core business is the best interests of the child and to ensure that young people grow up as great citizens. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029777"></A>
By adopting these amendments we would be strengthening the resolve to have a more open department and a more open process that meets the needs of all of the people involved. These amendments also take away any perception or suggestion that the department is trying to hide anything. It would mean protection for the workers. It would strengthen their resolve. The inclusion of these amendments into the legislative framework would give Child Safety something to work with. We do not want to find ourselves in the situation where the legislation has to be amended in the future because we did not get it right in the first place.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029778"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would also like to speak in favour of these amendments. I think we have to make sure that the whole case is placed before the court so that the court is aware of all of the circumstances. I would particularly like to talk about case plans and the way the case plans are made by Child Safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029779"></A>
Case plans are made by Child Safety based on sometimes independent advice from report writers who are hired by Child Safety. I would ask the minister if he would like to explain this: if Child Safety asks independent report writers to write those reports, how much weight do those reports have with child safety officers? Say, for example, a Child Safety department is subcontracting, if you like, in layman’s terms, the report to a medical specialist and asks them to rewrite it. There is a particular recommendation. Are child safety officers expected to follow the recommendations of the independent report writers?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029780"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In relation to the point raised by the member for Bundaberg, I would refer him to clause 53. We have not got to it yet, but it states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1029782"></A>
When making a decision under this Act, the Childrens Court must state its reasons for the decision. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029783"></A>
So it is quite clear the that Children’s Court needs to make the decision. In regard to the member’s point about all parties, at the end of the day, for a range of reasons, not all parties may agree with the case plans. There could be some Family Court issues involved. I think the member for Bundaberg would realise that. So although it would be great if everyone agreed with the case plan, ultimately we have to justify to the court that the plans that are in place are correct. You could not guarantee that you are going to get 100 per cent agreement on all the case plans. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029784"></A>
In regard to the question asked by the member for Burnett, I have full faith in the professionalism of child safety officers. They would take into account both independent reports and other assessments. That is what their responsibility is. They could ask for a range of reports and they might get two or three different opinions--just like if you ask lawyers for an opinion you get two or three different opinions. You also have to take into account that the people who are assessing particular cases might be focusing on one clinical aspect. Child Safety Services staff look holistically at the child’s safety and wellbeing, and I have full confidence in their professionalism to do so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029786"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As the minister has just alluded to, the court will make a decision in relation to what it has before it. By including these amendments we are strengthening what the court has before it to make it a more open and transparent process. So the court can be assisted in its decisions and know that, at the end of day, even when the decision has been made everything has been made available to the court to make its decision. It is hard to put it into layman’s words, but the power of the department over the individual can be very daunting at times. We can say to that person, ‘Go out and get Legal Aid’ and so forth, but the reality is that it can be very daunting for a number of people. By adding these amendments, we are strengthening their rights. We are not about lengthening court procedures. The fact is that each individual case is assessed on its own. So is there any possibility of these amendments being adopted for the sake of openness and transparency?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029787"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Once again, I would like to support the shadow minister in his amendments. The minister might know that over the past few days I have been highly critical of some child safety officers. The amount of feedback that I have from different parts of the state from legal professionals suggests that there is a massive problem in this state with Child Safety. There is a massive problem relating to the legal advice that individual departments get, that they are not experienced legal professionals, that they run cases that are bogus, that they waste money and that if they had advice from professionals at the beginning they would not take the course of action that many times they have taken. It comes back to this: there is very little supervision and there is very little scrutiny of their decisions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029788"></A>
In making case plans, child safety officers have to take into account the opinion not only of the independent medical people whom they subcontract these reports out to but also the independent solicitor and the people whom the independent solicitor gets to provide a report on the child who is the subject of the protection order or other legal action by the department of child safety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029819"></A>
The point that I am making is that those child safety officers may have a preconceived idea of what should happen. In order to support their preconceived ideas they may fish around and continue subcontracting out reports until they get the report that they want. They have the ability to ignore reports that may suggest one course of action that the child safety officers do not believe should happen. They are not being totally independent, they are not being dispassionate and they are certainly not putting the best interests of the child before the court which is part of their policy. I believe that this fishing around for favourable reports does go on within Child Safety. I have had evidence of it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029820"></A>
I would like the minister to once again address this issue of first of all creating a case plan in a fair way, in a way that puts the best interests of the child first rather than putting the best interests and opinions of the child safety officers first. Once again I go back to the point that the shadow minister makes: these amendments will ensure that the full picture gets before the court. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029821"></A>
The other issue that springs to mind is the length of time it actually takes to bring these matters before court. I would really like to know if the minister has those statistics available. He should, because he is the minister. From the time that a child is taken into custody--I would appreciate knowing, and I am sure many parents and family members would like to know, this answer--what is the average length of time that it takes to get the case before the court and for judgements to be made, and if there should be criminal actions that come out of that what is the length of time? The evidence that I have seen and have had presented to me is that child safety officers under the current laws are able to manipulate the amount of time it takes to actually get before the court. They have unlimited resources behind them, whereas people who have serious accusations made against them do not have the resources that child safety officers have. This is a complaint that has been made to me by many legal professionals who see this time and time again: child safety officers, who have no idea about the law, making decisions that will not stand up in a court of law at all and yet using the legal process to drag matters out and effectively bankrupting people who are the subject of the allegations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029822"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In relation to the points raised by both members, I refer to clause 53 where it quite clearly states that the court needs to be satisfied with the amount of evidence presented. Obviously no decision would be made if there is not enough evidence presented. Child Safety is responsible for ensuring that there is enough evidence presented. We do have a legal services branch as part of the department that supports child safety officers in all legal matters. I have full confidence in that regard. </Hansard-Body>

This amendment is putting the responsibility back on the department. This amendment is basically about humanity. It is about providing a pathway. The scenario starts with a young person’s dysfunctionality. They then go through the department and are being cared for. They then reach the age of 18 and all of a sudden the pathway ends. What we are doing by bringing this amendment is saying that a transition order must be made in relation to a child and the chief executive must prepare a plan stating how the chief executive intends to provide the support and gradual transition. It also gives the young person information as to what other agencies there are to turn to for support. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1029840"></A>
The responsibility should not end with the court process. We talk about early intervention. We should not then be just leaving that child at the age of 18. Certain children may have disabilities. There are different maturity levels. The young girl from CREATE who is getting an award here today has done remarkably well through the whole process. I have heard her speak and it is a credit to her after what she has gone through. Young people such as her seem to be in the minority when they have gone through the department’s process. By saying that transition plans must be put in place, it gives them a pathway after they leave the department. It ensures that the department gives them basic information in relation to what other agencies are out there to help them in that transitional period. I know the department will give them a cash amount and other support, but that is determined by whom that person is involved with in the system. Everyone cannot be as loving and compassionate as the next person. By adopting this amendment, we are legislating compassion and understanding and also letting that person know that the love has not stopped; that we are going to care for them when they leave the system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033285"></A>
These are basic things. Some of these children have been in care for 18 years. We see this happen too many times. I will hear from the minister in a minute. But we cannot flick this legislation back to the court and then say that the court has made a decision so that is it. We have to ensure that the department has a role in this process for the benefit of that child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033289"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
Just to clarify, you mentioned 18-year-olds. Transition from care is a policy we have to work with young people from the age of 15. This part of the legislation is not about 18-year-olds. I gave an example in my speech in reply about a family who came to speak to me about an issue and had spoken to previous ministers. The court made an order for the child to go back to the parents and that happened straightaway. There was no ability to apply for a transition order to prepare a plan for reunifying with the family and which also took into account the carers. I will give an example. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033292"></A>
As a foster-parent, you might care for a child from birth to the age of 10, for example. Then a court rules on that day that that is it, so that child is transferred back to their family. Even though the department might have gone to court and said, ‘No, we think they should continue in care,’ the court has made a judgement on the evidence that was provided. We might not agree with that judgement. But the big issue is that the transfer happened that day and there was no transition. That is what this is about. It has nothing to do with transition from care. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033295"></A>
Transition from care is a policy in Child Safety Services. It is one that I strongly support and strongly emphasise when I talk to staff when appropriate. There are a lot of 15- to 18-year-olds who are in care who are not interested, but at the same time there are a lot in transition from care. They are like any 15- to 18-year-olds who are trying to work out where they want to go in the future. The department will continue to drive this policy. I put particular emphasis on the fact that I want to see it continue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033296"></A>
There are a number of young people who have been in long-term care with guardians, foster carers or kinship carers who often stay in care well past the age of 18. I can think of one whom I met just the other day with the member for Sandgate. They were great people--the carers and the young people themselves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033297"></A>
I will not be supporting this amendment. The proposed amendment cannot be fulfilled as, in the event a court does not grant a transition order, the child must immediately return to the parents as the authority of the chief executive has ceased. It should be noted that, under section 104 of the Child Protection Act 1999, in exercising its jurisdiction or powers the Children’s Court must regard the welfare and best interests of the child as paramount. Obviously when this bill is passed, the child’s safety will be included in that as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033298"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Even in the minister’s own words, that determination is made on that day. This amendment gives some flexibility. Far too often the department is about enforcement and restriction, and the resources go into those areas. Even for morale within the department, it would be better for them to be able to do some of the good stuff--the stuff that we do not see. The community perception of those transition from care orders would ensure that non-government agencies--we talk about early intervention--are seen to be continuing to care for these young people and that they do not just cut them off, that they continue the love for them into adulthood. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033299"></A>
I am sure every member in this House agrees that we cannot have a one-size-fits-all policy in relation to when a child finishes up with the department. I implore the minister. I know that our amendments will not be passed by the majority of parliament, but we need legislation put in place at the end of the day that ensures that these children live. Not every one of those children will have the same scenario in relation to how they will be dealt with by the department. There are different situations. I know some people where generations of children come back to those carers. But that is not always the case. We have to ensure that there is legislation in place to protect them and to protect everyone involved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033300"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I should be quite clear here. I think the member might be a bit confused. This has nothing to do with transition from care. This part of the clause has nothing to do with transition from care. The child protection order just finishes. If child safety officers are not going to apply for an extension of the child protection order--if they go into court and say, ‘Stop the order because the child is going to reunify with the parents’--they would have already done a huge amount of work transitioning that child ready for reunification, such as stayovers and whatever. So that work has already been done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033301"></A>
If we are going to apply for an extension of a child protection order or for a new child protection order and the court does not rule in our favour, we would then apply for a transition order so that we can prepare a plan. That makes the opposition’s amendment redundant because we already do the transition work in cases where we do not apply for an extension of a child protection order. In cases where we do apply for an extension of a child protection order but the court rules against it, we will now have the ability to apply for a transition order which we are not presently able to do under the current act. If the court then rules that it is not going to grant a transition order then the department has to fulfil the court’s orders. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033306"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (12.37 pm): Clause 54 refers to separate legal representation of a child. This provision does not require the separate legal representative to discharge themselves if they have previously represented the parties in court. It gets back to what we discussed before--everybody having the opportunity to access legal representation. As I said before, this happens in cases in regional Queensland. It does not allow for the best interests of the child to be met but rather the interests of one parent. How is the minister going to stop this practice? This is in relation to time as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033307"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In all proceedings in the Children’s Court a party to the proceedings has the right to be legally represented. This includes the parents of a child and the child. However, independent of this the Children’s Court may make an order that the child be separately represented by a lawyer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033310"></A>
Section 110 of the Child Protection Act 1999 provides that, in a proceeding on an application for an order for a child, the Children’s Court may order that the child be separately represented by a lawyer and make the other orders it considers necessary to secure the child’s separate legal representation. The Children’s Court may make such an order where it considers it is necessary in the child’s best interests for the child to be separately represented by a lawyer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033312"></A>
The provision also provides that the lawyer must act in the child’s best interests regardless of any instructions from the child and, as far as possible, represent the child’s views and wishes to the court. The provision also makes a note of those situations in particular where the court must consider making such an order for separate representation. Those situations include where the application for the order is contested by the child’s parents or the child opposes the application. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033341"></A>
To provide clarity around the role of the separate representative and to ensure that the separate representative is provided the same benefits and has the same obligations as a party to the proceeding, the bill amends section 110 of the Child Protection Act 1999 by inserting three new subsections. These new subsections are: firstly, clarify that the lawyer is not a party to the proceeding on the application but must do anything required to be done by a party and may do anything permitted to be done by a party; secondly, provide that the parties to the proceeding must act in relation to the proceeding as if the lawyer were a party; and, thirdly, provide that the lawyer’s role as the child’s separate legal representative ends when the application is decided or withdrawn or, if there is an appeal in relation to the application, when the appeal is decided or withdrawn. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033345"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, Minister, we all know about legal ramifications and how they apply, but the reality is what is happening on the ground throughout Queensland. As we have alluded to many times, and as the Deputy Premier said this morning, Queensland is six times the size of Victoria. We talk about distances and the hardship in relation to distances and then we think about other communities, whether they be in the cape or the gulf. How are people in those communities supposed to get proper legal representation when we are taking into account the best interests of the child and the time frames? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033347"></A>
A lot of these smaller towns, not just in the cape and the gulf but in other regional centres, may only have one legal representative. What practical measures are put into policies and procedures to ensure that time is cut down and that people are not rushed before the court but are provided proper legal representation? I know this is not in the minister’s portfolio but surely, if the legislation is changing the act, these people affected need to have due process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033349"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 There are two things. Wherever possible, the Children’s Court will ensure that the child is not present during the court proceedings, which you could understand. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033350"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Dempsey:</Hansard-Member-Down>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033352"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Secondly, if the Children’s Court makes a ruling that the child needs to be represented, I have full confidence that Legal Aid will ensure that occurs as quickly as possible. Obviously, once the court has made that ruling, it would not hear the case until the child was represented. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033353"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will deal with that really quickly. Not every average Queenslander has faith in Legal Aid. That is the reality. It is not because of the people in Legal Aid; it is because of the amount of funding and the services it is able to provide to its clientele. A lot of these clients are meeting with Legal Aid for a number of other legal reasons, so there is that conflict of interest and those budgetary restrictions. Even though that is another department, it still reflects on how the department of child safety can deliver the best outcomes for the child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033354"></A>
This legislation will not affect families living in the suburbs of Brisbane or in the major regional areas. We are talking about the whole of Queensland. We are talking about people in remote and isolated areas being able to have the same rights within the court process as their city counterparts here in Brisbane. Surely this legislation has to have some guidelines to ensure that the department makes sure that people are afforded their proper legal representation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033355"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would like to make a brief comment on this and hopefully the minister will note this. We are talking about the provision of Legal Aid to people in rural and regional areas. I know for a fact that in Bundaberg there are only four Legal Aid providers. If people have a falling out with one of those Legal Aid providers--and I have been privy to circumstances like this--then they are not able to access a Legal Aid provider in their own region. If they have legal action taken against them and their children, they then have to try to access a lawyer or a solicitor outside their region. That can lead to costs of tens of thousands of dollars--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>
(Mr Hoolihan): Order! Member for Burnett, I did not pull up the member for Bundaberg but I have to ask you and the member for Bundaberg what part of the clause refers to the provision of Legal Aid. The actual amendment to section 110 appears to me to be only declaratory of what the separate legal representative is. I can find nothing at all in the clause that relates to Legal Aid or the provision of Legal Aid anywhere in the state of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033358"></A>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take your point, but I refer to the reply from the minister where he mentioned the issue of Legal Aid and the difficulty of people getting representatives. I think the point the shadow minister was making was that whether it be a separate legal representative for the child or for the people who are subject to legal action--that is, the parents and other people--it is very difficult--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033363"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I appreciate that the minister mentioned it, but this clause relates to the amendment of section 110, ‘Separate legal representation of child’. ‘Child’ does not include those other persons who may be part of any legal action. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033364"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, what we are trying to relay to the minister is that the representative for the child--the solicitor or legal representative--might have a conflict of interest to do with other matters involving the child. That is why we went there, but I am happy to finish with that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033365"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Just in closing, I think I have made my point and I think the minister is aware of the fact that in rural and regional areas, as opposed to the capital city areas, there is a limited pool of legal representatives that people can draw from. For unknown and complex reasons, people may go through this legal process and not be properly represented at different stages of that process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1033366"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I have full confidence that this part of the act can be fulfilled. Obviously, if the court has ruled that a child needs to be represented by a lawyer, the court would not start hearing the application of the order or whatever it may be until that part was fulfilled. There has been no information given to me to show that, if a Children’s Court order has stated that a child needs to be legally represented, Legal Aid has failed to fulfil that duty. As I said, I am not aware of that and I have been told that it does not happen. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (12.48 pm): This clause relates to licensee obligations. I have raised the issue of continuing to support unlicensed providers who have been subject to substantiated matters of concern. This practice continues and some of these providers have since been licensed. However, I find it hard to believe that they will continue to provide a service within these centres if children have been re-abused. How is the minister ensuring the safety of children who are placed with not properly licensed providers? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036430"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This bill inserts a new section 129A into the Child Protection Act to place obligations on the licensee of a corporation that is licensed to provide a care service. Currently, section 130 of the act places all of the responsibility for the service provided by the licensee onto the nominees for the licence. That means that the nominee is the person liable. The effect of the amendment is to shift the responsibility and the liability to a licensed corporation. The licensee will be required to ensure that the care services provided under the licence will comply with the statement of standards under section 122 of the act. Section 122 lists a number of standards including that the child’s rights will be respected; that the child will be provided with adequate food, clothing, shelter, emotional care, education; and does not threaten the child in a way likely to cause emotional harm. The licensee will also be required to ensure that each person engaged to provide care services to children is a suitable person and the licensee will comply with the provisions of the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian in relation to blue cards and exemption notices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036434"></A>
Just because someone may be going through the application process of becoming a licensee does not mean that the checks are not conducted by the department. However, it is important that we find a safe place in which young people can be looked after. I have full confidence that if it is found that some licensees or even those in the application process do not give the support and provide the right services to the children and young people, then the department will act. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DEMPSEY</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (12.51 pm): This clause deals with the release of information for the purpose of research. I ask the minister: how much money has the department spent on research in child protection? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036439"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 With due respect, this is not about estimates; it is the debate on the details of the clauses. If the member for Bundaberg wants to put that question on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
, I would be quite willing to answer it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036440"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The question of funding for research goes directly to how much emphasis the department places on research and in what direction it is heading. We would like to know how much research is being conducted. I understand there is a research register, which was also brought up in estimates. If the minister does not want to advise the amount that is spent on that, he can explain how the rights of the children and their information are being protected in relation to research. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036441"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Research approval is required in all cases to ensure that sensitive information about clients is appropriately protected. Appointing researchers as honorary officers means that, although they are not actually employed by the department, they are deemed to be engaged by the department. As such, they can therefore be screened for criminal history under the Public Service Act to ensure their history does not indicate that they should not access sensitive child protection data or have contact with clients. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036443"></A>
The new section contains various safeguards including that the chief executive must be satisfied before authorising research that information will be collected in a way that could not reasonably be expected to identify any of the individuals it relates to. This new section also transfers the provision relating to appointment of honorary offices from the Family Services Act 1987 to the Child Protection Act 1999. The member had another 30 minutes to speak in the second reading debate. He could have asked the question during his speech and I could have then addressed it in my reply. To ask a question about a budgetary matter in the debate on the clauses is a bit cheeky. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036446"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The minister has provided no response in relation to one area, which is the research register. The minister will know of the concerns because we spent some time on them during estimates. The register lists the active research projects that are supported by the department. It is also available to child protection workers, researchers, academics and members of the public. The research register is an avenue for those interested in research on issues of child protection to liaise directly with researchers to seek information and to exchange ideas. I refer to DNA research on the register. I still have concerns--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1036451"></A>
The chief executive would get the information from the register.

The website states that its purpose is--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

To examine the application of DNA paternity testing in the context of child protection practice and the implications that this genetic information has for child protection practice in working with children and their families. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

 (Southern Downs--LNP) (Deputy Leader of the Opposition)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(2.30 pm): Twelve months yesterday the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 was introduced into this parliament--12 long months that have seen no action on dangerous sexual offenders. This delay is symbolic of how ineffective this Labor government has become in dealing with legislation in this parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041979"></A>
In the time that has passed since the bill was introduced, one of the most dangerous sex predators in Queensland’s history, Robert John Fardon, whom we were promised would be watched like a hawk by the former corrective services minister, was jailed for rape of an intellectually handicapped women. This sentence prompted the Attorney-General to do one of the most incredible backflips in recent times and announce that instead of limiting supervision orders to five years as proposed in this bill he would move amendments to make all supervision orders a minimum of five years. He is effectively saying that he cannot trust the courts to follow the lead that was implied in his original bill introduced into this parliament on 1 September 2009. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041980"></A>
The Fardon debacle tragically best demonstrates the failure of Queensland laws to protect women and children from predatory sex offenders who just cannot be rehabilitated. Indeed, the botched release of Robert John Fardon in 2007 was the precursor for these amendments. His impending release was one of the main motivators for the original act in 2003. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041981"></A>
For the information of this House, I will outline the history of this very unsavoury character, Robert John Fardon. He was born in 1948 and has an extensive criminal history, including stealing, disorderly behaviour and weapons offences. He pleaded guilty in 1967 in New South Wales to attempted carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 10 years. On 8 October 1980 he pleaded guilty to raping a 12-year-old girl and indecently dealing with her as well as unlawfully wounding her 15-year-old sister. He was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment for the rape and lesser concurrent terms of imprisonment for the other offences. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041982"></A>
The respondent was released on parole after serving eight years of that sentence and within 20 days had committed others offences for which he was sentenced on 30 June 1989. These included convictions for rape, sodomy and assault occasioning bodily harm on 30 June 1989 which saw him sentenced to 14 years imprisonment. The Attorney-General applied to the court for an interim detention order pursuant to division 3 of the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act on 17 June 2003. The application asked that the respondent Robert John Fardon be detained in custody for an indefinite term for control, care and treatment. The order for continuing detention was handed down in November 2003.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041984"></A>
In December 2006, after being the first offender in Queensland to be detained under the dangerous prisoner legislation, Fardon was released. In May 2007, only six months after his release, Fardon breached his supervised release order by attending a school. Instead of being returned to custody he remained in the community. Then on 11 July 2007, only two months later, Fardon commits another serious breach of his supervision order by aiding in the breach of a supervision order of a neighbour by driving him around Brisbane after dark whilst enjoying a night on the town. He was arrested on 12 July after leaving Labor and supervision officers red faced. This further heightened the debate over the GPS tracking of dangerous sex offenders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041985"></A>
The following day he was discharged from custody. That very day, Fardon packed up his bags and drove off again, leaving this government in the dark as to his whereabouts. Eleven days later, on 24 July, Fardon was arrested at Home Hill. On that day his supervision order was suspended and he was returned to custody. On 19 October Fardon was released again on an amended supervision order. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041986"></A>
It was during that hearing that Fardon’s placement in a residential location--outside the Wacol precinct--was granted. On 31 October the member for Sunnybank, the then minister, tried to blame the courts for giving in to the amended residential placement. That evening, Fardon’s release became a spectacle for all to see as he was run out of the streets in Ipswich where he was placed. The very next day the member for Sunnybank was forced into an embarrassing backdown and promised to watch him like a hawk. As part of that backdown we saw policy change which saw the government say, ‘Yes, it is possible to inform neighbours of the whereabouts of these particular people if they are located near them and if there is a concern that they might be a threat to young children or children in the area as long as those neighbours do not tell anyone.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041987"></A>
Six months later, in April 2008, Fardon was charged with the rape of an intellectually handicapped woman. It is important then to ask: given the assurances made by the member for Sunnybank, can the Attorney inform the House whether his government has since apologised to the victim in this case because of its failure to follow through on its promise to properly monitor Fardon? Keep in mind again, honourable members, that only a few months before this rape this government said that it would be watching this character like a hawk. In May 2010 Fardon was sentenced to 10 years jail, to be released after eight years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041988"></A>
I think it is very interesting to consider the history of this person. I want to reflect on this for a moment. If we go back to 2003 and even a little bit earlier when there was significant debate about the need to introduce legislation in Queensland to deal with these sorts of characters and these serial sex offenders who cannot be rehabilitated that this person was one of the people that kept being referred to as one of the eminently dangerous people who could be released in this state. Of course it was impossible and it would have been wrong for legislation to be passed which was specific to an offender. We saw this happen in New South Wales some years earlier. It was overturned by the High Court. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041989"></A>
Having said that, there is absolutely no doubt that this particular person was one of the precursors of the particular act which we are debating today by way of amendment. The other thing that should be of major concern is that, as this person actually progressed through the prison system and as he committed more and more crimes after his release, it is somewhat unbelievable that his latest sentence, which was handed down in May 2010, was less than the one handed down some 21 years earlier. When we look at the crimes, we find that the most recent crime was just as serious. He is probably only going to serve eight years in jail when previously he was sentenced to 14 years in jail and served the full time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042021"></A>
We have to blame that on the introduction of the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992, which basically threw away 100 years of case law in Queensland--100 years of case law out the window! Ever since that time, we have effectively seen the benchmarks being reset in this state and they have been reset to the disadvantage of people who have been affected by these types of recidivist paedophiles who, ironically, rather than being sentenced to longer and longer periods of jail time when they go back before the courts for committing similar offences--in this case at least--have been sentenced to less time. It is amazing that the court needed to look at this incident in isolation--the rape of this disabled girl--when it is quite clear that this offender has a problem and should be locked up with the keys thrown away.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042022"></A>
We also need to consider the case law which was thrown out--the precedents which had been thrown out which had existed in Queensland for the best part of a century--with the introduction of the Penalties and Sentences Act. Before the introduction of that act and earlier the state of Queensland had the capacity to lock those people up at Her Majesty’s pleasure and only allow them to be released by way of a Governor’s pardon. The former Attorney-General of Queensland, the member for Murrumba, can justifiably be proud of a lot of his achievements in this state, including the freedom of information laws and a range of other things. However, one thing that has been a fundamental mistake and has tied the hands of authorities in Queensland and has not met the expectations of the community has been the introduction of the Penalties and Sentences Act and the way that it has reset the benchmarks for sentencing in this state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042025"></A>
By way of example, in New South Wales there are similar very serious sex offenders. Offenders there are sentenced to much longer periods of time in jail, and indeed some time ago a rapist was sentenced to up to 40 to 50 years. For such a recidivist serial sex offender such as Fardon, I do not know how the Attorney can stand here and justify that 10 years maximum is appropriate. This person will probably serve eight years. We are talking about a person who pleaded guilty to his first offence in 1967 and who up until recently had received a longer and longer sentence for similar crimes in the courts of Queensland. The Attorney-General is continuously in denial in this place when he says that everything is absolutely hunky-dory when we have a situation where the government is now trying to close the door after the horse has bolted in terms of dealing with these sex offenders in Queensland. There is this continuing spectacle in Queensland of the Attorney-General having to go back through the courts to consider a supervision order or a continuing detention order because the original sentence, in many cases, has been manifestly inadequate and has not dealt with the situation--that is, that these people should have been incarcerated for a longer period of time. Yesterday I saw a media report detailing that the Attorney has been forced back into the courts to again appeal a sentence of only six years for a very serious multiple sex offender in Queensland. People in the community can justifiably ask: who is accountable for this ongoing debacle with regard to members of the community being put at risk as a consequence of the release of these people time and time and time and time again?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042030"></A>
A year after the bill before this House was introduced and after policy-on-the-run backflips, the Attorney has failed to withdraw the bill after identifying that his government got it wrong in trying to limit the length of supervision orders and he is now presenting newly redrafted amendments. So we are now being asked to vote for a deficient bill and then support amendments that go against the original bill. What sort of a piece of absolute rocket science genius was that from the ‘Boy Wonder’ Attorney in this place! Last year he came in here--a year and one day ago--and introduced legislation that said that a court cannot put a period of supervision on sexual offenders over five years and then--oh my goodness!--the community did not like it and there was ongoing debacle after debacle and now he has to come in here and say, ‘Support this legislation,’ which is obviously deficient, ‘but we’re going to change it and we’re going to fix it up in amendment.’ Fardon was the precursor of this legislation and what happened in 2007 was the precursor for the amendments that we are debating here again. Also, the court case which I mentioned has been the precursor to the amendments before they have even been passed through this parliament.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042033"></A>
This Labor government’s record of handling dangerous sex offenders has been questionable at best. We have heard excuse after excuse when this government’s hopeless laws surrounding the sentencing and management of dangerous sex offenders have failed. When these laws were first introduced, we were told that they would provide added security and protection for the community from these serious sex offenders, yet in the past three years more than double the number of supervision orders were made than continuing detention orders--meaning more and more of these offenders are still being released back into the community at the end of their sentence than those being held in custody.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042034"></A>
Between 2006 and 2009 there have been 56 supervision orders made compared to the 19 continuing detention orders made. That means that 56 dangerous sex offenders who were considered such a risk that a dangerous prisoner order had to be made against them have still been allowed to be released back into the community. As I indicated, many of the problems can be traced back to the introduction of a particular act in 1992, the whole debacle surrounding the manifestation of this act in 2003 and the fact that it has not lived up to its original expectation. There is extensive debate surrounding the overall threat that convicted sex offenders pose to the community and their rate of recidivism and overall ability to be rehabilitated. There is no doubt that there is a broad range of variations in the type of sexual offender--from rapist to child abuser or fixated paedophile. Sex offenders cause great social harm to their victims and the broader community. But let us not forget that between 2007 and 2008 more than 39 breaches of supervision orders were recorded, and that was at a time when only some 40 sex offenders were in the supervision program. It has been argued that sex offenders, particularly paedophiles and sadistic rapists, present the most danger as they are said not to want to be able to be rehabilitated, and the level of breaches made by sex offenders confirms many will never be properly reformed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1042036"></A>
In a paper prepared by Simon Petrie that made up part of the literature review for the Queensland Crime Commission’s Project Axis in 2000, Petrie states the overall definition and perception of paedophiles are shaped by types of harm and dangerousness. Petrie explains that with criminality a range of theories have been advanced to define and explain paedophilia. Importantly, Petrie points out that throughout the historical development of research into the paedophile offender there is little evidence to suggest a single all-encompassing model can account for all theories and be applied to all adult-child sexual contact. That is why it is important to define the type of offender. The focus on paedophilia as a subset of offending can be linked to the modern era.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1178555"></A>
I turn now to international research into the child sex offender or paedophile. Two researchers have had significant influence on the research into child sex offenders and paedophiles. Two studies conducted by Gene Abel sought to provide a comprehensive understanding of child molesters. The first study in the mid-1980s and second follow-up study in 2001 used two of the largest samples of child sex offenders. Abel’s studies were unique in that they relied on, as Smallbone and Wortley note, self-reported confidential data. The findings have had a significant impact on the understanding and treatment of child sex offenders. Finkelhor and Lewis in 1988 conducted a telephone interview survey that also concluded that current reporting of child sex offences and the known offender base is just the tip of the iceberg. With regard to the Australian perspective, the lead Australian researchers in the area of child sex offenders are Stephen Smallbone and Richard Wortley, with their 2001 study of the Queensland cohort of child sex offenders in the prison population.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045116"></A>
Prior to that, Professor Freda Briggs conducted studies into child sex offenders in New South Wales prisons. In 1993, Professor Briggs’s study looked at a cohort of child sex offenders and their childhood abuse. Kevin Wallis, in introducing Briggs’s book <Hansard-Italic>
From Victim to Offender</Hansard-Italic>
, notes that the research was only a glimpse into a small proportion of child sexual offenders. The research focused on paedophiles or fixated sexual preference for children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045121"></A>
In 2001, Smallbone and Wortley identified 323 potential participants in their study and, of those, 182 agreed to participate. This study identified four cohorts of suboffenders and it is part of this research that will be drawn on when examining the characteristics of the current literature review. Clearly, this cohort of offenders, even those who have served time in jail, pose an ongoing risk to the Queensland community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045122"></A>
Furthermore, a Canadian study reported that sex offenders’ cost to society and the danger that they present appear to be grossly underestimated using national statistics alone. This same study noted that the re-arrest rate is a more effective measure of recidivism than conviction rates. Many factors contribute to an offence not proceeding. Often with young child victims it is very difficult to secure a conviction. Smallbone and Wortley found that of extra-familial--that is extra-family--child sex offenders, or those sex offenders outside of the victim’s family unit, almost 50 per cent had a previous sexual or violent offence conviction. So almost 50 per cent of those offenders outside of the family had a previous sexual or violence offence conviction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045123"></A>
In Queensland, currently there are around 3,000 sex offenders in the state’s registration system. The exact figures are unknown, as the government continues to maintain a high level of secrecy in relation to its dealings with sex offenders. It was revealed in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 on 4 April 2008 that at the time there were 46 dangerous sex offenders subject to dangerous prisoner sexual offender orders. Thirty of these offenders are in the community; 16 are in custody. The Queensland Labor government has used the courts as a scapegoat when attempts to keep dangerous offenders detained have failed and the person has subsequently breached supervision orders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045124"></A>
The dangerous prisoners act has been amended six times since it was first introduced in 2003. That is on average about one set of amendments each year. Indeed, the original amendments, which we are debating here today, were introduced one year and one day ago and subsequently further amendments have been circulated to look at fixing up the botching of that amendment bill. Frankly, that is not acceptable. On each of those occasions that the act has been amended it has been to correct errors or in response to pressure from the public and the opposition. On the last occasion, the opposition questioned support of the government’s amendments on the basis that enough is enough. The act was not working and the government’s proposed amendments would further lessen the effectiveness and accountability of the act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045125"></A>
The act was flagged for amendment by the Queensland Labor Premier in late 2007 after what I have outlined already was an embarrassing series of blunders and stunts by the then corrective services minister, which saw a dangerous sex offender go missing and then relocate to a street where young children lived. As I said at the outset, it was during that same debacle that the government promised to watch that particular dangerous sex offender so closely that if they even put one step out of line, the sex offender would be brought back before the court. We know what happened with regard to that sex offender. As I have already alluded to, we have seen the tragic circumstance of a person being raped and that sex offender being put back behind bars. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045126"></A>
In recent years the focus on child sexual offenders has intensified. Distinguishing myth from fact is essential for any public office when detecting, investigating and understanding one of the most reviled offender types in modern times. I want to turn to some of the proposed amendments before the House today. Frankly, they wind back the intent of the legislation to provide community protection from some of the most dangerous offenders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045127"></A>
In speaking to the amendments put forward by the Attorney-General that sought to limit the use of supervision orders, a study from Canada examined sexual offence recidivism rate estimates for three distinct time periods--five years, 10 years and 15 years--for each of the subgroups examined. The overall recidivism rate was 14 per cent after five years, 20 per cent after 10 years and 24 per cent after 15 years, and those figures were similar for rapists with 14 per cent, 21 per cent and 24 per cent and the combined group of child molesters, which was 13 per cent, 18 per cent, and 23 per cent. There were, however, significant differences between the child molesters, with the highest rates observed among extra-familial--so I am talking about outside of family--boy victim child molesters of 35 per cent after 15 years and the lowest observed rates for incest offenders of 13 per cent after 15 years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045128"></A>
These figures show that the rate of recidivism gets worse over time--not better as the Attorney-General would have us believe and as his original amending bill, which we are debating here in parliament, would have us believe and that, after five years, basically, ‘It’s okay. You don’t have to worry as much about it.’ Frankly, this is a very naive approach and is flying in the face of the research that has been done when we look at the recidivism rates over the particular periods of time that I have mentioned of five years, 10 years and 15 years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045129"></A>
 Based on comments from departmental officers during the briefing, to think that the judiciary will read between the lines and say, ‘Oh, well, five years supervision is not enough. I will go for a continuing detention order,’ is again naive, particularly when that implication is nowhere in the amendments. If we support this bill in its current form, we will see one- and two-year supervision orders and then offenders being released freely back into the community, because we are talking about a bill that seeks to impose a maximum of five years and, yes, in the most exceptional circumstances you might be able to come back and look at getting another penalty, whereas at the moment it is up to the court’s’ discretion to decide whether it is going to make the penalty 10 years, five years, three years, 15 years or may be even longer--whatever the case may be. But to have a bill that seeks to say that a court in that instance cannot impose more than five years is absolutely ludicrous and it is ridiculous that we also then have to consider an amendment to the amending bill to seek to fix up what is a debacle in light of the Fardon shambles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045131"></A>
At this point it is important that the Attorney-General answers the question as to the exact dollar figure to manage one dangerous sex offender under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act. </Hansard-Body>

 Mr Deputy Speaker, I remember asking the Attorney-General any number of questions at the estimates process last year and even this year and the Attorney-General was refusing to answer the questions, skirting around the issues. I do not think this Attorney-General has ever actually answered a question. Indeed, last year I asked about the rate of complaints in relation to occupational health and safety breaches against government agencies by his department and he actually said--</Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It would be about making statements about his Premier’s campaign rather than what he would be doing to protect children in this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1045144"></A>
As I indicated, I believe that it is important for Queenslanders to know the cost of keeping these dangerous sexual offenders supervised in our community. If the Attorney-General wants to answer that, it is a matter for him. If he does not, it is also a matter for him. Not a lot is known about the behind-the-scenes processes that lead to an application being brought to the court for a dangerous prisoner order. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048460"></A>
Despite the act being in place since 2003, it took five years for this government to establish a centralised unit within Corrective Services to manage dangerous sex offenders released from custody and placed under supervision. As well as the establishment of the Sex Offender and Dangerous Offender Unit, the Serious Sexual Offenders Review Committee, or the Sexual Offender and Dangerous Offender Assessment Committee as it is now referred to, was established to identify and refer offenders in Corrective Services custody who may be suitable for an application under this act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048461"></A>
In preparing cases for SSORC, Corrective Services collates all relevant information, including copies of specialised sexual offender assessments, outcomes of any interventions and available psychological and psychiatric reports. Senior officers from the Department of Justice and Attorney-General, Queensland Corrective Services, Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Queensland Police Service meet monthly at the SSORC unit to consider all sexual offenders serving a sentence of more than two years who have 18 months remaining on their sentence. If they consider there is a high degree of probability that following release a sexual offender would pose a serious danger to the community, the case is referred to the Attorney-General for consideration under this act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048462"></A>
What this means is that before matters even reach court many sex offenders are screened out of being even considered for a dangerous prisoner order. Following referral by the SSORC, senior officers from Corrective Services meet with the Crown Solicitor and provide specialist advice and feedback on the key issues raised by the SSORC. The Crown Solicitor considers the merits of the case and makes a recommendation to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General then decides whether to proceed with an application for an order under this act in the Supreme Court. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048463"></A>
Between 2003 and 2006, according to Corrective Services, approximately 371 offenders were considered by the SSORC, of which 15.7 per cent have been referred to Crown Law to consider the merits of making an application under the act. Since October 2004, the Attorney-General has made an application under this act for all offenders who were referred by the committee, and as of 20 October 2006 five detention orders and 16 supervision orders have been issued. Most disturbing about this backroom process is that we, the opposition, asked the Corrective Services minister in 2007 for an updated figure on referrals to the committee. It was fobbed off with the not-my-portfolio response. I ask the Attorney-General now to provide in his summing-up, if he feels so inclined, how many referrals were made to the Serious Sexual Offenders Review Committee between 2007 and now, how many were not considered for dangerous prisoner orders and, of those, how many had not completed rehabilitation? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048464"></A>
It is the LNP’s very strong contention that we cannot trust Labor to properly manage these dangerous sex offenders. This slipshod attempt to backpedal on its go-soft policy is an insult to every Queenslander. The result of this parliament’s deliberations today will be a cobbled together amended mess which grew out of a panic three years ago, which was ill-conceived and which has gathered mould waiting to be debated for the last one year and one day. It will be amended in consideration in detail to try to fix its many flaws and also make it palatable to the community but it is our belief that it still will not effectively work. It should be withdrawn and rewritten, not patched up and botched up yet again. Most importantly, dangerous sex offenders who are declared as such should be held behind bars until they no longer pose a risk, which was the original intent of the legislation that was promised us in 2003 and thus far has not been delivered by the six sets of subsequent amendments. I doubt that we will see it delivered in any other amendments that this parliament will ever debate with regard to this flawed act.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.03 pm): I hope the Attorney took note of that fine contribution by the shadow Attorney. When we talk about this Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009--it should be 2010--we are talking about the protection of the most vulnerable citizens in our community, our children. This bill in its current form has already been identified by the Attorney as difficult. He stated in May this year that they would change what is wrong with no amendments. The Attorney-General has had 12 months to get this bill right. He has had the opportunity to withdraw the legislation, as the honourable shadow minister rightfully said, and have it rewritten to get it accurate and precise so that we can protect the community, whether it is the children or other people who are affected by this unfortunate element of society that is dealt with every day through the prison system, the Queensland Police Service and through the justice system. We are in the situation now where the government continues to endorse a policy where these despicable sex offenders are free to roam once they are released from prison because of the surveillance position. We hear every day how good the penalties are and how the surveillance is working in Queensland. I see this piece of legislation as another tax on already over-taxed Corrective Services officers who have the responsibility of monitoring these people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048467"></A>
I talk to many officers of the Queensland police, as I am sure do many other members of this parliament. They are absolutely fed up to the back teeth with this element of society whom they continually have to know where they are, have to monitor and most times apprehend and bring back again to the courts and process them once more because they have violated their terms and conditions in relation to parole. This afternoon we heard the shadow Attorney make reference to those 56 dangerous sex offenders who can be released back into the community. On a daily basis technology is changing and becoming more sophisticated. A couple of years ago we heard this Labor government say time and time again that we cannot introduce telephone interception powers in this state because the Howard government is stifling us from allowing that legislation to be passed here in Queensland. We now have those powers here in Queensland, but the funding is not sufficient to allow Queensland police--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048469"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will take that interjection from the former Attorney-General, a man who I have great respect for. I find that a somewhat negative comment coming from him. Members can say what they like about the former Howard government, but the former Howard government certainly had it right when it came to these sorts of issues. It was the Queensland government that dragged its feet on telephone interception powers. It is the Queensland government that continues to do that today. It wants to blame somebody else for its inadequacies. When it comes to the protection of the most vulnerable and most important people, the people who are not negotiable, the people who are most sacred in our society--our children--there are no ifs, no buts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1048470"></A>
After reflecting on what has happened over the last 12 months, I believe that this piece of legislation could go a lot further than the Attorney is letting it go. I made mention of issues such as the sophistication of technology today. Now there are issues such as Facebook. Many little ones are constantly on Facebook talking to their mates. Some of these lowlifes can now become friends of these young people and infiltrate their lives by way of befriending them through Facebook. This is a real opportunity for these paedophile rings and undesirables in our community to take advantage of our innocent young people without them knowing. Many times our children are innocent of what is going on around them.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051629"></A>
It is sad that some parents do not have any idea what their kids are doing when they are playing on the computer. The kids have their own passwords and codes to get into the computers and they do their own thing. The point I am making is that there are parents out there who are illiterate when it comes to the use of computers and they would not have a clue what is happening. We need to be more aware of what is happening. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051631"></A>
I was at a public meeting in Cairns only a few months ago and Ian Leavers, the General President of the Queensland Police Union, answered a question at that forum about this very issue. He answered that parent by saying that parents have to be more observant and monitor more closely what their children are doing on their computers, on Facebook et cetera. This is the scourge of our modern day society where the most vulnerable--our children--are at the mercy of these awful people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051633"></A>
I believe that the law has to be absolutely blunt. The surveillance has to be merciless in relation to making certain that we know where these people are. We know the numbers here in Queensland. There are some 3,000 of those types of people in here in Queensland who are closely monitored on a daily basis. The real issue is that the programs that we are talking about here--the rehabilitation programs run by the Corrective Services department--can only go so far. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051634"></A>
There are people who believe they have a right to interfere with children. I remember talking to the former minister for police and corrective services here in the chamber a few years ago. The Hon. Tony McGrady said to me that a lot of these people think that it is their God-given right to interfere with children. If they think that it is their God-given right to interfere with children, then, as Hetty Johnston--the great crusader of Bravehearts, the great crusader and protector of our young people in Queensland--says, ‘Two strikes and you’re out.’ Good on you, Hetty, and keep up the good work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051637"></A>
She is a woman who has the courage of her convictions and who has the guts to be out there highlighting to the public precisely what our children are subjected to on a daily basis--whether it is at night or during broad daylight. She is a person who is not going to give up on protecting these kids. On this side of the House, we adopt that agenda. As the shadow Attorney-General said, we have to be harder and more strict about this. We need to have strict surveillance of these people. If we are not sure about them, as the shadow Attorney-General said, they will stay in jail under an LNP government because then we will know where they are. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051640"></A>
I have visited many prisons. I visited a prison at Port Phillip in Victoria a few years ago and there was one area of the prison that was locked up and isolated. I asked the area general manager, ‘What is this all about?’ He said, ‘This is all the paedophiles in here.’ At that hour of the day--it was about 12 o’clock--they shut the prison down because they had to march them to where they were going to have their lunch. I asked, ‘Why are you shutting the prison down?’ He said, ‘We can’t trust the other prisoners with their safety because they would probably kill them before they got to their lunchroom.’ Other prisoners do not even condone the behaviour of this element of society. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051641"></A>
This is what we have to put up with in this world. But I am very fearful that we are going to once again overtax the responsibilities of our Corrective Services personnel and also our highly recommended Queensland police, the people who are going about their work to protect the wider community at all times. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051642"></A>
I know time is short, but there are issues that I want to touch on. The minister said in his second reading speech--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051645"></A>
The act enables the Supreme Court of Queensland to order the continuing detention or supervised release of serious sex offenders beyond the expiry date of their sentence. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051646"></A>
How many fall into this category? That is the question I ask the Attorney. I do not think anybody rightly knows how many fall into this category. The unfortunate circumstances are that when these sexual offenders are released they are so dubious and so devious. They are the most cunning of the cunning. They can outplay the Corrective Services people and the police. Our children are not going to have a hope with them. As the shadow Attorney-General said here this afternoon about the undesirable Fardon, we know what sort of a creep he is and his cohorts out there like him. The minister also said in his second reading speech--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1051650"></A>
The act states that the paramount consideration for the court in deciding whether to make a continuing detention order or supervision order must be the need to ensure the adequate protection of the community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051651"></A>
The Attorney is absolutely right. The most vulnerable in our community--our children--are the ones who should be protected. There will be an impost on an already overtaxed police system, but the courts have to take some responsibility and err on the side of caution. We know that in the past a lot of these people have not been through the rehabilitation programs and they think that they are free to go, free to do what they like, free to roam. But they are people who cannot be trusted. They cannot be trusted at all. Unfortunately, the number of them is growing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051652"></A>
I look around this chamber and there are many members here who have young children. They are mums and dads of young children. My children are grown up, but I have four little grandchildren. I know full well just how important it is that we protect the children of this state. We need to make absolutely certain that we are not here trying to score political brownie points by saying that our side is better or whatever. I believe that this is one of those situations where we should be looking to achieve the best outcome, whether it is the shadow Attorney who is putting up a policy that can address this issue or whether it is the Attorney-General himself. I do not believe that anybody gets everything right all of the time, but I think we can go a long way towards getting it right by making certain that we achieve the best outcome with concrete legislation to address this element of our society. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051655"></A>
The shadow Attorney has canvassed this legislation very well in his contribution here today. This is the scourge of our society where we see the infiltration of these undesirable people into the lives of our young children, knowing full well that there are many people out there who do not have a clue what is going on in their children’s lives. It is so very important that we give our police the tools and even enhance opportunities for further detection. We should take more note of what the police are saying in relation to the management of these people. If we are not sure about them, we should keep them incarcerated for the safety of the children of this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051657"></A>
I cannot say enough about Hetty Johnston--that great campaigner, that great crusader for the protection of young people. She is so right when she says, ‘Two strikes and you’re out.’ We will give everybody one chance, but the second time we will throw them into the bowels of the jail and leave them there to rot as far as I am concerned, because they do not deserve to be free and to have a presence in the lives of ordinary Queenslanders. If they want to rehabilitate themselves, fair enough. We will give them that opportunity. But there are many places in the world that would not give them that opportunity at all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051658"></A>
The most important thing is that we protect the rights of the most important natural resource we have, and that is our children--whether they are the children of today, the children of tomorrow or the children of 20 years time. We have a responsibility as legislators to make absolutely certain that we have the laws and the policies that will create an environment where our children can be safe, regardless of whether they live here in Brisbane or whether they live in Birdsville, Cairns, Townsville, Mount Isa or in any other country community. It is so very important. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1051659"></A>
I trust that the Attorney will make absolutely certain, as he progresses in his area of responsibility as the chief law officer of this state, that we see these laws amended accordingly and expeditiously if the occasion arises to address any anomalies so that we continue to provide that mantle of safety to our most important young people. With those few words, I will sign off. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr DICKSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Buderim--LNP) (3.19 pm): I rise to speak on a subject that strikes a feeling of absolute abhorrence into our hearts--the subject of sexual offenders. Legal dictionaries define ‘sexual offender’ as a generic term for all persons convicted of crimes involving sex, including rape, molestation, sexual harassment and pornography production or distribution. In most states, convicted sex offenders are supposed to report to local police authorities, but many do not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054924"></A>
During recent Queensland budget estimates hearings, we heard that eight sex offenders on the child protection register were missing, including one for more than nine months. As reported in the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 newspaper on 16 August 2010--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054926"></A>
Almost every week for the past two years, a sex offender known to authorities has committed further sexual offences. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054927"></A>
Ninety-nine dangerous sex offenders on the register have committed further sex crimes since being released back into the community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054928"></A>
And in 2009, the more than 3100 registered sex offenders have had more than 1000 prosecutions commenced against them for breaching the laws associated with their registration. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054929"></A>
On any given day, there are 840 sexual offenders in custody and about 600 sexual offenders on community supervision orders. The government introduced this bill to the parliament in 2009. The primary objectives of this Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 are to increase flexibility for the management of offenders under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003, the DPSOA, and to enhance the ability of the court to make indefinite sentence orders under part 10 of the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992, the PSA. Within the bill, one of the ‘Reasons for the Bill’ states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054931"></A>
In November 2007 the Government began a review of Queensland’s public protection legislation in the context of the community’s sustained and valid concerns about high risk sexual and violent offenders.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054932"></A>
Why wouldn’t the community have ‘sustained and valid concerns’ about sexual predators roaming around unsupervised in our community? Look at some of the pitiful sentences and release decisions handed out to these criminals by Queensland courts.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054933"></A>
In December 2006, rapist Robert John Fardon was released by the Queensland Court of Appeal back into the community under a supervision order. He was supposed to be closely monitored for the next 10 years. Fardon had spent almost 30 years in jail for serious sex offences against children and women. He was the first prisoner to be detained indefinitely under Queensland’s Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act introduced in 2003. Fardon was first jailed for raping and wounding a 12-year-old girl in 1978 after he lured her to his house to celebrate the birth of his son. Within months of his release in 1988 he had raped, sodomised and assaulted a woman in Townsville. Fardon was arrested, convicted and sentenced to 14 years jail. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054934"></A>
The Queensland Labor state government thought it had all the bases covered under the terms of Fardon’s release. He had to remain in Queensland, undertake regular counselling sessions and submit to regular drug and alcohol testing. Fardon was banned from working with children and visiting parks and public spaces without written permission. He was also banned from providing unsupervised child care or joining any clubs where children might be members. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054935"></A>
Just prior to Fardon’s release, a representative from the prison’s legal service told the media that Fardon had assured her that he would not reoffend. She said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054936"></A>
I have Robert’s assurance and I can give you Robert’s assurance that he does not want to go back to jail again. I know he wants to make a new life for himself.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054937"></A>
We all know what happened. Despite Fardon’s assurances, he raped again in 2008. Thankfully, though, he is back behind bars, but the weak 10-year sentence for this vile creature outraged child safety campaigners who correctly claim people like Fardon should never be released. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054939"></A>
The situation of Brisbane’s bikeway rapist, Luke James Colless, is another example of sex offenders getting off easy. In August last year, he pleaded guilty to 18 offences against 11 women between 2006 and July 2008. Colless was 32 years old and married with four children. Judge Marshall Irwin described Colless as ‘a sexual predator who showed callous disregard for women’ and ‘the attacks were premeditated and cowardly’. But then His Honour said ‘the case had not fallen into the worst category of its type and a life sentence was not appropriate’. Colless raped 11 women over a two-year period committing 18 violent offences. What does a rapist have to do to get a life sentence? Judge Irwin sentenced Colless to 25 years jail with a non-parole period of 15 years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054941"></A>
But the injustice of Queensland’s legal system does not stop there in relation to Luke Colless. In February this year, Colless appealed against his sentence. His lawyer argued in the Court of Appeal that a 25-year sentence was ‘excessive’. He said that Judge Irwin had not balanced the ‘objective circumstances of the offending’ with the ‘significant and compelling mitigating factors in Colless’s favour’. Colless’s lawyer further argued that too much weight was placed on the degree of violence Colless used to subdue some of his victims and that in his client’s favour was his extremely early plea of guilty, his own admissions to police and his remorse. I would suggest that his remorse was more for being caught than for his actions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054942"></A>
The three judges of the Court of Appeal noted the ‘substantial mitigating circumstances of the case’, ruling Judge Irwin failed to make ‘adequate allowance’ for them. So the Court of Appeal, being mindful of the offender’s rights, upheld the lawyer’s arguments and substituted a 16-year sentence instead. Colless will serve about 13 years in custody, little more than one year for each of his violent rapes. I think we need to remember that point. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054943"></A>
Within the bill, these amendments fail to address the issue of GPS monitoring of sex offenders or the issue of increased sanctions for breaches of supervision orders. In other parts of the world today, many parolees are fitted with a small, tamper-proof GPS tracking device worn as a bracelet or an anklet. The ankle device is in the shape of a rigid plastic ring accompanied by a small tracking box that can fit in a pocket. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054944"></A>
Monitoring systems are designed to track sex offenders, ensuring they do not commit any crimes, alert authorities if they enter certain locations--for example, schools or parks--and prevent them from leaving their homes, if that is prohibited. Tracking devices are a worthwhile tool in protecting our community members from convicted sexual predators. Within the bill, amendments to the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992 state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054946"></A>
Before imposing an indefinite sentence, the court is required by section 163(3) of the PSA to be satisfied: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1058403"></A>
“(b)	 that the offender is a <Hansard-Italic>
serious danger to the community </Hansard-Italic>
because of--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1058404"></A>
(i)	the offender’s antecedents, character, age, health or mental condition; and </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1058405"></A>
(ii)	the severity of the violent offence; and </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<A ID="pgfId-1054950"></A>
(iii)	any special circumstances.” </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent2>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054951"></A>
It is further provided ... that in determining whether the offender is a <Hansard-Italic>
serious danger to the community</Hansard-Italic>
, the court must have regard to a number of matters including whether the nature of the offence is exceptional and the offender’s antecedents, age and character. It is, however, unnecessary for the court to find the existence of all of these matters in order to make a finding that the threshold of <Hansard-Italic>
serious danger to the community </Hansard-Italic>
is met. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1054953"></A>
Once the threshold is met courts retain a wide discretion as to whether to impose an indefinite sentence ... The High Court has repeatedly stated that in exercising this discretion judges must have a clear appreciation of the exceptional nature of an indefinite sentence order. The power to impose an indefinite sentence is a discretion which is only exercised by courts in exceptional circumstances in view of the extraordinary departure from the fundamental sentencing principles of proportional punishment that this kind of sentence represents. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054954"></A>
So after all that build-up pointing towards this bill actually making it easier for judges to hand out a tougher sentence, we read the following within the bill: ‘The amendments to the Penalties and Sentences Act contained in the Bill are not intended to alter the existing threshold.’ I repeat: ‘are not intended to alter the existing threshold’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054955"></A>
As many have said here already today, I think this bill needs to be much better thought out. It needs to be taken back and written again because the government has an opportunity to make a difference in Queensland. As the last two speakers have said, we want to work with the government to deliver a bill that will stop these predators from attacking and having their way with our children, our grandchildren, our relatives. This will affect all the people of Queensland for a long time. Every child who is attacked by one of these predators will carry that as a stain on their lives forever. They will take it to their graves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054957"></A>
What about these people who rape these children? A sentence of one year imprisonment for each rape is not good enough. It is not good enough for the likes of Fardon to go to jail, get released, go to jail, get released and do it all again. We need to do better than that. We need to be united in a cause to stop these people attacking our children. I am very disappointed with this bill. I know that we can do better. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms GRACE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Brisbane Central--ALP) (3.29 pm): I rise to support the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. I note that this bill is the outcome of a comprehensive review of Queensland public protection legislation and amends the two primary acts that deal with the indefinite sentencing regime. The Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003 was at the time groundbreaking law in preventive detention legislation, and not only for Queensland. It was the model used by other states in Australia to introduce similar laws. So we were the first state in the country to enact laws that looked at how we can improve on the detention outcome for dangerous prisoners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054997"></A>
This bill makes amendments to largely meet two primary objectives: first, increase the flexibility for the management of serious sexual offenders; and, second, enhance the ability of a court to make indefinite sentence orders. These two prime objectives must be applauded and I welcome their introduction, particularly as paramount considerations of implementing these changes in the bill are the need to ensure the adequate protection of the community, whether the adequate protection of the community can be reasonably and practically managed by a supervision order to be managed by a corrective services officer, and how we are improving their ability to manage the supervision order. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054998"></A>
The bill enhances the ability of corrective services officers to monitor the compliance of released prisoners. How is this achieved? In the bill CSOs are given the power to issue binding directions to released prisoners on supervision orders. These can be things such as where they are to live, requirements for involvement in treatment or restrictions on consumption of alcohol and other substance use. So it gives them more powers to ensure sexual offenders or dangerous prisoners are much better monitored. It is giving power to these officers to do their jobs much better than they have been able to previously. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1054999"></A>
What is this all about? This is about the minimisation of risk to the community. We all know that these matters--where they are living and whether they are abusing substances or alcohol--are common problem areas. Giving CSOs the ability to implement these measures is most definitely a step in the right direction. Added to that is the fact that they can implement these measures without a need to return to the court. Clearly, these measures must be consistent with the existing order and be considered reasonably necessary by the CSO to ensure community safety and ongoing prisoner rehabilitation, care or treatment. So the balance, I believe, is very well struck. Offenders’ failure to comply with any CSO directives will allow the commencement of formal contravention processes under the act. This results in immediate detention and appearance before the Supreme Court. So the penalties for not abiding by the existing orders and the measures put in by CSOs are severe. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055000"></A>
The bill also amends the length of a CSO order--at the moment there is no limit--to a maximum of five years. There are good reasons for doing this. We understand that the highest risk period is during the first few years of release, so we need to concentrate our efforts on ensuring that that high-risk period is minimised. It is understood that five years should provide adequate protection to the community. At the same time, it reduces the workloads of CSOs where it is deemed unnecessary to continue with a supervision order. I think it strikes a good balance. Orders are made upfront, but if it is deemed that they are no longer necessary then there are no unnecessary workloads. The protection here is that the bill also allows for unlimited application where risk factors remain. So you can always go back and have unlimited time should the five-year period not be enough and it is deemed inadequate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055001"></A>
There is a change from a first annual review of the order to a first review of the order after two years with an annual review process for all future reviews. I agree that this is the right balance and that it covers all possible scenarios, including giving the offender adequate time to undertake any rehabilitation programs aimed at reducing their risk to society. Really, that is what it is all about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055002"></A>
The bill expands the range of offences for which an indefinite sentence may be imposed, particularly where the offender is deemed to pose a risk to the community due to their offence. The bill includes an extension of offences such as torture, indecent treatment of a child under 16, and maintaining a sexual relationship with a child. I believe that expanding the offences in relation to which an indefinite sentence may be imposed is also a very good step in the right direction. I support the expanded range of offences because I believe that it is about tightening the provisions in relation to which of these offenders can be released. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055003"></A>
The bill also contains provisions that at least five years of parole supervision must be achieved when someone is released from prison when an indefinite sentence is converted to a finite sentence. I believe there is an anomaly in the current legislation which is being corrected by the amendment in this bill. I believe that those changes provide the best protection of the community from the risk posed by high-risk sexual and violent offenders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055004"></A>
These areas are very difficult. This bill is all about ensuring that we protect the community as much as possible. I believe that the measures contained in this bill are great steps in the right direction. I commend the Attorney-General and his staff. This is all about ensuring that these dangerous offenders are supervised properly, risk is minimised and the community is protected in the best way possible. With those few words, I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs SULLIVAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Pumicestone--ALP) (3.37 pm): I rise to support the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. It was introduced in this House by the Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations, the Hon. Cameron Dick, on 1 September 2009. I acknowledge the presence of the minister in the chamber today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055008"></A>
I have supported similar legislation in this House in the past. I supported the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Bill in June 2003, which this bill today amends and which went a long way to alleviating the increasing growing concern in communities about the release from prison of convicted violent sex offenders and paedophiles. The 2003 bill provided for ongoing detention or supervised release for certain prisoners to ensure better protection of the community and to provide continued control, care or treatment of those prisoners to facilitate their rehabilitation. Changes debated today build on this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055010"></A>
I also supported the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Bill introduced here in 2004 which fulfilled the state’s component of the national child protection registration scheme and which required child sex offenders and other defined categories of serious offenders against children to keep police informed of certain personal details for a period of time after they are released into the community. These legislative changes were groundbreaking, very innovative and well received then by the community. In fact, even other jurisdictions copied us and since then have introduced similar legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055012"></A>
This bill is the result of a lengthy and detailed review of the state’s public protection legislation. I congratulate the Attorney and previous Labor Attorneys on their ongoing commitment to this process. Communities must feel safe, and these changes are more measures taken by the Labor government to protect the community from the danger posed by high-risk sexual and violent offenders. Consultation was undertaken with key department of justice and Queensland Corrective Services stakeholders on a consultation draft of the bill. Some broader consultation within other government departments was also undertaken. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1055013"></A>
The objectives of the bill are explicit. It will increase flexibility in the management of offenders under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003 and enhance the ability of the court to make indefinite sentence orders under part 10 of the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992. Currently, an indefinite sentence may only be imposed for Queensland Criminal Code offences delivering a maximum penalty of life imprisonment where the offence involves violence or is one of five specified sexual offences. I wholeheartedly support the changes and I commend the bill to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Mudgeeraba--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.39 pm): I rise this afternoon to contribute to the debate on the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. The main objectives of the bill are to increase the flexibility for the management of offenders under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003 and to enhance the ability of the court to make indefinite sentence orders under part 10 of the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058631"></A>
Once again, this is just another ploy by the Labor government to make it look like they are doing something when in reality they are not. This is just one more example of policy on the run--mind you, this policy has been on the run for 12 months. In November 2007, the government began a review of Queensland’s public protection legislation in the context of the community’s sustained and valid concerns about high-risk sexual and violent offenders--more money, more reviews and little progress into core issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058632"></A>
The Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act has been amended more than six times since it was first introduced in 2003. All these amendments came from increased and constant pressure from the opposition and the general public. Whilst the opposition did manage to push through some amendments that allowed for victim impact statements to be taken into consideration by the court when determining orders, this legislation is a far cry from the silent majority in our communities who want to see zero tolerance in relation to many crimes and sentences dished out by the judiciary. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058633"></A>
We on this side of the House are listening and have been listening to the concerns of residents in our electorates. We are the party that attempts to bring some balance and community consultation and input into the process because we are the voice that does stand up for the silent majority, unlike the soft on crime Labor lefties opposite who kowtow to the vocal minority, fringe dweller, loopies and bleeding hearts in the community who make up the minority but who, due to successful lobbying efforts in both the media and the parliament, ensure that their voice is the one that is heard the most.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058634"></A>
The only reason that this act is revisited by the Labor Party is in response to embarrassing examples of complete idiocy and incompetence by their own ministers. In late October 2007, the then corrective services minister oversaw the relocation of a dangerous sex offender to a street where families with young children lived. Did the then minister not think that putting a paedophile in the midst of an area with young children might be like candy to a baby in the resulting mayhem that occurred in this area? Did the then minister think that every mother and father in that area would not be incensed, concerned and feel abhorrence at this ridiculous relocation of a known offender? Did the then minister take the community there for fools?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058635"></A>
This is the same government that spent more money on the protection of this criminal than it did on worrying about protection of the innocent. This is yet another example of this Labor government’s reactive approach to legislation. And let us add insult to injury. Surely the then minister was not too surprised, when the government had promised to watch another dangerous sex offender closely and had threatened to jail him again if he reoffended, to find that this particular offender is alleged to have since committed further sex offences, even whilst under supervision? It is not rocket science, people. It is no wonder the community shake their heads at this government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058636"></A>
In Queensland there are around 3,000 sex offenders currently on the state registration system. Of course, no-one but those opposite know the true figures with the high level of secrecy which shrouds information about these offenders. Queenslanders are spending so much money protecting these criminals. I am sure if we asked the average Joe Blows on the street for an answer, their answers would range from locking them up for life to castration. I doubt very much if anyone would advocate for a softly, softly approach where even the most dangerous of offender does not have to comply with any rehabilitation program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058637"></A>
No resident I have spoken to in my electorate would be at all comfortable with having a released sex offender living next door to them. Yet this Labor government seeks to allow chemical castration as a get-out-of-jail-free card. Under these new provisions introduced by the government this scenario could be inserted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058638"></A>
I find it appalling that, as reported in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 on 4 April 2008, at that time there were 46 dangerous sex offenders subject to dangerous sex offender orders who were walking the streets in the general community. Every Queenslander would be totally appalled to know this was the case--if, indeed, these are the correct figures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058639"></A>
This is the same Labor government that uses the courts as the scapegoat when attempts to keep dangerous sex offenders detained fail or when a person breaches their supervision order. I think the best article I have read regarding Labor’s soft-on-crime attitude comes from Sophie Mirabella’s article in <Hansard-Italic>
Punch</Hansard-Italic>
 titled, ‘Tough on crime is an empty slogan for ALP’. She stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1058641"></A>
When it comes to being “tough on crime”, Labor’s own policy platform also betrays them.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1058642"></A>
Labor will promote the principles of restorative justice as a just and effective way to be tough on crime.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1058643"></A>
Restorative justice? What exactly is that? A core principle in restorative justice is to “balance offender needs, victim needs and the needs of the community as well” ... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1058644"></A>
Note the “offenders needs” are pretty high up on that list. And that’s the sticking point.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1058645"></A>
At its best, restorative justice gives victims of crime a voice. That’s a good thing. For first offences and petty crimes it is a method of dispute resolution that can be effective if both parties enter into the process with good will.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1058646"></A>
But more and more often the principle is being applied to serious criminal behaviour. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1058647"></A>
For judges who philosophically support restorative justice that often means keeping an offender out of jail wherever possible ... the theory being that they are unable to “make amends” if confined in prison.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1058648"></A>
This is an approach pretty much at odds with the “do the crime, do the time” deterrent to criminal behaviour which has long underpinned the system and reflects the sentiment of most of the Australian community.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1058649"></A>
But leniency and the philosophical belief that “offender needs” must be considered in sentencing mean we continue to see many cases where the time simply does not fit the crime. Nor does it reflect community standards and expectations.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1058650"></A>
Many Judges, like the Labor Party itself, see the principles of restorative justice as the most “just and effective” approach ... one thing restorative justice couldn’t be described as is “tough”.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1058651"></A>
So how can Labor claim to be tough on crime when their party platform says the opposite? Moreover, and perhaps more significantly given our proud history of judicial independence, Labor are appointing more and more judges who conveniently share Labor’s “go soft” beliefs.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058652"></A>
The Labor government has gone down the road of its approach of being soft on crime time and time again. On this side of the House we hold the stance, and will continue to do so, that the only answer to this and other crime related problems is to be tough on offenders. The LNP supports the call for a two strikes and you are out system. In fact, I would like to see a two strikes and you are in system. We also support the move for mandatory sentencing for sex offenders and a multitude of other offences.</Hansard-Body>

The review report titled <Hansard-Italic>
A new public protection model for the management of high risk sexual and violent offenders</Hansard-Italic>
 was publicly released in 2008. Some two years later we see some changes being tabled by the government. Two years is a very long time but Queenslanders have grown to expect this type of inaction from the Bligh Labor government. This legislation itself has laid on the table for 12 months. This is another example of Labor fast-tracking important policy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058654"></A>
Let us look at some of the private members’ bills that this government has voted down since 2007-08--which is before I got here. They include the Criminal Code (Truth in Parliament) Bill; the Criminal Code (Protecting School Students and Members of Staff from Assaults) Amendment Bill; the Criminal Code (Assault Against Police and Others) Amendment Bill; the Criminal Code and Other Acts (Graffiti Clean-up) Bill; the Criminal Code (Assault Causing Death) Amendment Bill; the Criminal Code (Gate crashing) Amendment Bill; the Criminal Code (Organised Criminal Groups) Amendment Bill; and the Civil Liability (Good Samaritan) Amendment Bill. All of those bills were voted down. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058656"></A>
Each and every one of the members on the other side of this House voted against these bills. They voted to be soft on crime, to put criminals ahead of victims and yet they have the audacity to attempt to dupe Queenslanders into thinking that they are the caped crusaders of crime in this place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058657"></A>
Let us go to all of the other private members’ bills that the Labor government has voted down since I have been here--that is, in 2009 and 2010. They include the Commissions of Inquiry (Corruption, Cronyism and Unethical Behaviour) Amendment Bill; the Criminal Code (Honesty and Integrity in Parliament) Amendment Bill; the Disability Services (Criminal History) Amendment Bill; the Juvenile Justice (Sentencing Principles) Amendment Bill; the Transport Operations (Road Use Management--Interlocks) Amendment Bill; and the Criminal Code (Serious Assaults on Police and Particular Other Persons) Amendment Bill. They were all voted down by those opposite. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058659"></A>
I will ensure, as I did in the 2009 state election campaign, that every resident in the electorate of Mudgeeraba is aware just how soft on crime this government is. I will ensure that my police consultative committees in Robina, Nerang and Mudgeeraba are aware of how soft on crime those opposite are. I will ensure that my seven Neighbourhood Watch groups are aware and my P&amp;Cs and P&amp;Fs of my 16 schools know so that they can get the message out to all of the parents in the electorate of Mudgeeraba that what Labor says and what Labor does are two very different scenarios. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1058660"></A>
Only the other day I was speaking to a criminal lawyer. We were having a conversation about prisons. He said to me that prisons are not very nice places. My reply was that prisoners and criminals are not very nice people otherwise they would not be in prison. The opposition will not be supporting this bill. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr BLEIJIE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kawana--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.48 pm): I rise this afternoon to speak on the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment 2009 introduced by the honourable Attorney-General. May I say that this may well and truly be the last bill that is introduced by the honourable Attorney-General as the Attorney-General before he moves on to bigger and better things in the Premier’s office. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058701"></A>
The Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act, which this bill amends, has been altered some six times in its seven-year life span which illustrates the Beattie and Bligh Labor government’s attitude towards dangerous crimes committed in this state. What this says to the community is that there is no certainty--no clear message--that if one is considering committing a heinous act the appropriate punishment will be the ultimate deterrent. But I say to members on this side of the House that, given some six amendments in its seven-year life, God knows what it is going to be like now that the government has admitted that it is going to start listening to Queenslanders. No doubt before the next state election this legislation will be amended many more times over now that the ears of the government members are open and listening, because they have admitted that for the past 12 years they have been closed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058703"></A>
The bill before the House is as a result of a review instigated by the Bligh government in November 2007 of its own laws relating to public protection. The stated primary objective of the bill is to increase flexibility for the management of offenders under the act and enhance the ability of the court to make indefinite sentence orders under part 10 of the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992. The review came on the back of growing concerns about the high risk of sick and vile sexual and violent offenders roaming freely in our community. The amendments to the act over recent years have been as a result of the persistence from certain lobby groups, the stance by the opposition and general pressure from the broader community. It was the opposition that managed to pass amendments to the act that would allow victim impact statements to be tendered to the court when deciding orders. This continues our approach to a justice system in this state which puts the focus back on the rights of the victims as opposed to the rights of the alleged offenders, and it is about time that offenders took responsibility for their actions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058707"></A>
However, I feel that the balance in the criminal justice system is still skewed towards the offender and does not have the appropriate balance of punishing criminal acts and protecting the victims of crime as opposed to the slap-on-the-wrist approach of consecutive Labor governments. When I say that, what would one expect from Labor governments when the future deputy leader of the Labor Party, the member for Brisbane Central, debating a bill last night said that it could serve as a mitigating defence if a person is ‘slightly intoxicated’ when they seriously assault a police officer? The treatment of sex offenders is an issue that always stirs up great debate in the community. While I am not for vigilante justice as in the rule of a mob over our judicial system, there is--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058708"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Shine:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 You sure?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058709"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am definitely sure. There is an underlying feeling that has crept into society because the community has a general mistrust of our court system, particularly when it comes to crimes committed by sex offenders. The simple, harsh reality is that when governments are dealing with dangerous sex offenders they have to remember that they are a continual risk to the community and need to be dealt with in an appropriate manner with this fact in mind. Anyone who has committed a heinous act always, in my opinion, bears the risk of reoffending and the safety of the community needs to be placed ahead of the interests of the offender.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058711"></A>
The bill before the House has several flaws which even the Attorney-General has realised, with the foreshadowing of several amendments. I support the statements outlined by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow Attorney-General in terms of the supervision order and the length of time a court could impose a supervision order on dangerous sex offenders of no longer than five years after the offender’s release date from prison. As stated in the explanatory notes, the highest risk period for offenders is the first few years after their release from custody. However, this is not a predetermined time period and each offender is different from the next. It is always important to err on the side of caution, particularly when these offenders have a history of violent criminal behaviour.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058714"></A>
I believe that judicial discretion is fundamentally paramount to each individual case and should be the overriding precursor to any such decision on the term of a supervision order that is imposed. This policy-on-the-run backflip by the Labor leader-in-waiting, the Attorney-General, is capricious at best and just further illustrates the Labor state government’s attitude towards protecting the community from violent sexual predators. It could not do it in 2007 when the corrective services minister relocated a dangerous sex offender to a street where children lived, as the honourable member for Mudgeeraba indicated. It cannot even do it in 2010. That stupidity initiated the review which this amendment legislation came from, and that is the approach by the Bligh Labor government towards the relocation of sex offenders back into the community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058716"></A>
The problem with this government is that it always, as I have said in this place before, wants to appear to be tough on crime but does not want to allocate any additional funding or resources. So it tinkers around the edges as if to give the impression that it is initiating great reform. But--as usual--it is more talk, it is more spin; there is no substance and there is no real action. In the various community forums, meetings and in discussions with constituents in my electorate, the same theme and the same points are continually raised in relation to the Queensland justice system. People have had enough of the slap-on-the-wrist approach and softly, softly approach of Labor governments. They are calling out for a criminal justice system that punishes those who commit crimes and restores protective measures for people who do the right thing and not those who are doing the wrong thing. The bill before the House in its current form does nothing to restore any of the public’s faith in the system and continues this Labor government’s approach to policy which is made on the run and shows no leadership whatsoever. But, in conclusion, what would one expect from the real Premier and the real Labor Party?<Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gladstone--Ind) (3.55 pm): I rise to support the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. Many previous speakers in this debate have rightly reflected the community’s perspective, particularly in relation to offences against children and also in relation to sex offences against women and even men. Sex offences against children in particular are not acceptable to anyone in the community, other than perhaps those who would also commit that offence. Therefore, there is an expectation from members within not only my community but also the broader community that offenders, once they are proven guilty, will be dealt with very severely.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058720"></A>
The member for Gregory in particular spoke very strongly in favour of and in support of Hetty Johnston and the Bravehearts organisation and her value set of two strikes and you are out, and there is a lot of sense in that, particularly in relation to offences against children. The first offence cannot be justified. However, after that first offence, given the repercussions, I would hope that the custodial sentence should very much be in the forefront of the mind of the offender, as should the severity of the offence. So the second offence by that same offender should carry a significant penalty.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058723"></A>
However, we do have a balanced justice system and one that attempts to rehabilitate offenders. I believe that there are some sex offenders who cannot be rehabilitated, and people from either side can argue the point with me on that. I hold very strongly the view that there are some who just cannot control themselves in relation to sex offences. Those people should have continuing orders. They should be held in secure facilities and should not be allowed access to the community where they can reoffend, and there are a handful of those people in the community now that members in my community and beyond would like to see permanently incarcerated or permanently held in a secure facility. I do not think there is any argument by people who hold a similar point of view.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058724"></A>
The amendments in this bill are an attempt to improve the processes for indefinite incarceration for offenders and also to address changes to supervision orders on their release. I have written to the Attorney-General on occasion in relation to the sentencing of offenders on behalf of people in my community. There has been outrage in the community, including on the part of the Attorney-General, when certain offenders have been inadequately sentenced, and the community expects that. It happened when the member for Toowoomba North was the Attorney-General where there were appeals against the severity of sentences that were patently inadequate, and in many instances the courts upheld those appeals and the sentences were increased. As I said, when it comes to sex offences, particularly sex offences against children but against anyone, there is a particular abhorrence in the community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058754"></A>
The other matter that was dealt with by members of the coalition was the rehousing of offenders. It is a sensitive issue in the community. We have seen that with one or two very notorious offenders who have had their locations changed on a number of occasions simply because the neighbourhood in which they were placed, maybe with the best of intentions of the authorities, went into uproar when it was known that they were there and they had to be relocated. I do not think there will be an answer to this issue until people who have committed these heinous offences, particularly repeat offenders, can be housed in a designated area with secure or semisecure facilities, because that is the only way that people in the community are going to feel that the justice system has adequately responded to the need for the community and for our children in the community to have safety. I am under no illusions that this is an easy balance to achieve. It is a difficult challenge to achieve because, as I think the member for Gregory said in his own colourful way, repeat offenders should be put somewhere--I think he said down in the bowels of the prison with the key thrown away, or something like that. To his credit, he reflects the sentiment of many in our community--were it that easy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058755"></A>
I want also a clarification from the minister in relation to the supervision orders. He is now putting a limit of five years on a supervision order, with the first review at two years, not one year. That is explained as allowing the prisoner time to finalise rehabilitation programs and also time to prove to the authorities that the person is genuinely attempting to change their ways. I would like confirmation that, at the last review prior to the five-year limit being reached, issues like the risk factors that remain, the probability of that person reoffending, the nature of that person’s reoffending or offending will be taken into account prior to the expiration of the five-year supervision order and that it will either be extended or a further supervision order will be put in place. I want to know that it will not be a five-year supervision order, the five years expires and the person drops back into the community unsupervised without all of the risk factors of that person being properly reassessed before that five-year order finally ceases. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058756"></A>
The other issue that I wanted to canvass is the need for government in particular and decision makers like this parliament and like the justice system to better reflect the impact of offences against the victims. A couple of speakers have made accusations that the Labor Party is more interested in the offenders than it is in the victims. I do not believe that is true, but it could be that victims feel that they are left and cut loose to go back to their lives, if you like, and that the concentration of attention is on the offender. The impact of a sexual offence on a victim can never be understated, no matter the age of the person, no matter the gender of the person. There are some victims who want to know what the offender is doing. They want to be kept in the loop to know that the person who harmed them is safely incarcerated. They want to know if that person is about to be released.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058757"></A>
I think that process has improved in terms of victim support--I think there is a long way that we can go on that--and also in keeping victims informed if they wish. There are other victims who want to know nothing about the person who harmed them and it is important that their wishes also are respected. Ultimately, the point I am making is that victims should know that, in the incident, in the aftermath, they are the people who are of primary importance and value; that the system has to deal with the offender, that the offender will be dealt with firmly, appropriately, and for as long as possible if it is a serious offence, but the victims should know that they are valued and looked after. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058758"></A>
The whole issue of sentencing and dealing with sexual offenders is a difficult one. I think it is difficult to get a balance. As the member for Gregory said, for many in the community the only way to deal with them would be to lock them up and throw away the key. Unfortunately, it is not that simple. I hope that these changes go towards achieving a better balance, but if they do not--if there are faults in the system--I hope this parliament will be big enough to come back and make the necessary changes to improve the result for victims and to improve the sense of safety for the community. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms STONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Springwood--ALP) (4.05 pm): I rise to speak in support of the bill before the House. The public’s concern regarding the release from prison of convicted sex offenders is understandable and legitimate. It was this concern that led to the Beattie Labor government introducing the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Bill 2003. It was introduced in response to the need to protect the community against high-risk sex offenders who have often refused to participate in rehabilitation programs in prison and who remain an unacceptable risk of reoffending upon release. The Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act allows the Supreme Court to order the continuing detention or supervised release of a serious sex offender beyond the expiry date of their sentence if the court considers that prisoner to be an unacceptable risk of committing a further sexual offence if released from custody without a supervision order being made. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058762"></A>
The primary objectives of the bill before the House today are to increase flexibility for the management of offenders under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003 and enhance the ability of the court to make indefinite sentence orders under part 10 of the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992. The bill expands the range of offences for which an indefinite sentence may be imposed. A specific schedule of offences carrying maximum penalties ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment is inserted into the Penalties and Sentences Act where a severe risk is likely to be posed by the offender to the community. The new offences include torture, maintaining a sexual relationship with a child and indecent treatment of a child under the age of 16. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058764"></A>
I now turn my attention to the improved victim provisions. The bill inserts a new section 49A into the act which will make it clear that, for the purpose of Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act hearings, it is not mandatory for a victim to provide the chief executive of the Department of Community Safety details of the harm caused to them by the crime. The new provision makes it clear that, where details of harm caused to a victim by the crime are absent at the hearing, that does not imply that the crime has caused little or no harm to the victim or that the victim has no interest in the outcome.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058767"></A>
Currently, victims are required to be notified of all contravention proceedings. Upon receiving this notice, distress can be caused to the victim. It becomes a reminder of the crime and sometimes, because of the frequency of the offenders being in breach of their orders, it can become a regular reminder to the victim of the horrific time they endured and adds much more stress to the victim. So I am very pleased to see this provision being brought in. The bill allows victims to opt out of receiving notification of the contravention hearings for dangerous prisoners--sex offenders--on supervision orders or interim supervision orders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058768"></A>
The community expects governments to provide protection against serious crime and, in particular, against further offending by convicted sex offenders. Queensland already has the toughest legislation in the country regarding sex offenders and this bill is strengthening community safety and improving provisions for victims. It is important that we as a government reduce the risk of future harm to society and ensure appropriate protection for society. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058769"></A>
However, protection for our society, and especially children, is not just a government responsibility. I have spoken before in this House about the need for parental supervision of children using the internet. Parents do not allow their children to visit a friend’s house without having some knowledge of that household. Yet more and more paedophiles are using the internet, in particular chat rooms, to groom children. Parents need to treat their children accessing chat rooms like they would treat their children physically visiting another person’s place. Today, once again, I would like to reiterate my concern to members about the need for more protection for children using the internet and especially the need for public information campaigns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1058771"></A>
I have visited the members of Task Force Argos and I have observed detectives undertaking covert operations policing internet chat rooms and what I saw was extremely disturbing. During that chat room interaction it was made very clear that the person was in their early teens. This, however, did not reflect the nature of the conversation in the chat room. It was absolutely horrific. I know that there were several other members with me who found it horrifying. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062585"></A>
Most of the conversations were very clearly inappropriate and of a sexual nature. Exposure to sexual acts through webcams was readily available. Any parent would be horrified to think that that could be their child sitting there being subjected to these images. Parents, guardians, family members and friends need to be vigilant in watching and monitoring their children’s internet usage. I congratulate Task Force Argos members for their hard work--their very, very stressful work--in gathering intelligence and sharing it with international law enforcement agencies. In fact, their hard work is internationally recognised. They have had many successful operations and taken many paedophiles off our streets. What is so shameful is that no matter how hard they work, how successful they are, there will always be these vile people who perform these vile acts on innocent and powerless children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062586"></A>
I recently attended Rochedale South Slacks Creek 9 Neighbourhood Watch and I thank them for their very interesting and frank discussion on internet filtering and the work of Task Force Argos. After this Neighbourhood Watch meeting I attended a St Edward’s P&amp;F meeting where we spoke of the work of Task Force Argos. The school is now very interested in setting up a parent and community forum on this subject. I have written to the Minister for Police requesting his assistance for this forum and I look forward to being there on the night. Perhaps the Attorney-General would like to join me on that night.</Hansard-Body>

 If you can fit it in, I know. The diary is very, very busy. We should never forget the trauma and distress that the victims of sex crimes and their families suffer and it should never be forgotten that those victims and their families carry this distress throughout their life. Members of the community want the risk of future serious harm to be minimised and they want high public safety and protection. Today we see this government once again continuing to do whatever it takes to ensure that the legislation works effectively to provide the strongest possible protection for the Queensland community. I commend the bill to the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.11 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. I take this opportunity to commend the Attorney-General for the work that he has done on it and commend, in particular, his ministerial staff and the department staff. In June 2008 the government released its report, <Hansard-Italic>
A new public protection model for the management of high risk violent and sexual offenders.</Hansard-Italic>
 This bill broadly implements the recommendations of that report. In addition to the amendments made to the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003, the bill also amends the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992 to enhance the ability of the court to make indefinite sentence orders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062591"></A>
Indefinite sentence orders are a significant departure from established sentencing principles of proportional punishment. For this reason the High Court has said that courts must, before imposing such a sentence, have a clear understanding of the exceptional nature of an indefinite sentence. Courts can only impose an indefinite sentence if they are satisfied that the offender is a serious danger to the community. The things that the court can take into consideration when making this determination are the offender’s antecedents, including their age, character, health or mental condition, the severity of the violent offence and any special circumstances. There is no change to be made to this threshold test. The government recognises that the nature of indefinite sentencing is such that safeguards need to be in place to ensure this power is not used inappropriately. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062592"></A>
The bill does, however, expand the category of offences for which an indefinite sentence might be imposed. At present it is restricted to life offences where the offence involves violence or is one of several specified sexual offences. A schedule containing a range of offences carrying a maximum penalty of between 10 years and life has been inserted into the act. The offences in the schedule reflect the risk the offender poses to the community. This is a type of preventative sentence regime which should be used in conjunction with the preventative detention regime under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act to provide a framework of protection for the community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062593"></A>
At present the courts can and do have regard to the fact that the Attorney-General can make the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act application once the offender is scheduled for release when considering whether an indefinite sentence should be imposed. In this bill clause 41 amends the Penalties and Sentences Act to provide that a court cannot take into account the availability of the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act order when considering whether to impose an indefinite sentence. This is because many of these sentences are long in duration and there is no guarantee that the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act legislation will still be in existence at the expiration of the sentence. This means there might be no other method to continue to detain a person who continues to pose a danger to the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062594"></A>
There are various matters that the court may consider when deciding whether to impose an indefinite sentence. Different reports are included in this. However, there is currently no provision allowing the court to order, or be provided with, an assessment of the offender. This amendment provides that a court must receive a report from the Department of Community Safety in relation to the offender before an indefinite sentence can be imposed. It will still, as in all other matters, be a question for the court as to the weight it places on the evidence. This amendment does not seek to restrict in any way the matters that can be put before the court. However, it brings the sentencing process into line with the review process for people who are already serving an indefinite sentence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062595"></A>
One of the greatest assets in management of released prisoners in Queensland is, indeed, the use of parole orders to continue to provide supervision once an offender has been released from prison. Particularly for violent offenders, the treatment programs and counselling that is available helps provide for greater protection of the community and enhance rehabilitation of the offender. For those serving an indefinite sentence, once it has been converted to a finite sentence, if they apply for and are released on parole, the parole period extends for five years regardless of how much time is left to serve on their sentence. These amendments will extend the five-year parole period to those who do not apply for or are not granted parole and serve the full term of their sentence. This post-release supervision assists the offender to reintegrate into the community and access support services to ensure smoother transition. This is in the best interests of rehabilitating the offender, but also, I believe, provides a greater protection for the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062596"></A>
This amendment bill is an important part of the armoury of the Queensland government in providing greater protection for Queenslanders from violent and sexual offenders. Our preventative detention regime is, in fact, the toughest in the country. These amendments are part of this government’s commitment to continue reviewing the legislation to make sure it provides the greatest possible protection for Queenslanders. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.17 pm): This bill represents the not quite complete about-face that Labor has done in the management of dangerous prisoners--in this case sex offenders. The Attorney-General says that it is in response to a comprehensive review of Queensland’s public protection legislation. He was not a member of the previous Labor administration that constantly failed to address this serious problem in our community. Today it could be said that he fails that test, too. Sadly, for many years here in Queensland the public endured a situation where these types of offenders were granted more equity than their victims. As usual, the majority of these offenders refused to engage in legitimate treatment programs. They were released and not only did they engage in recidivist behaviour but often the consequences were more violent and tragic. Even with the notoriety and headlines created by the crimes, these serious criminal offenders were treated very lightly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1062599"></A>
It appears that someone has turned on the lights--but they have only found a 40-watt bulb. The reality is that it is more likely that the Labor administration sees that its electoral fortunes may well swing on how it responds to questions such as: does Labor put a sex offender’s rights ahead of their victims? What is a reasonable amount of legal aid to be provided to serious offenders to enable them to appeal their shocking crimes?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066162"></A>
I have 20 years of experience in corrective services and have dealt with these offenders over many years. They are not only dangerous but calculating, often homicidal psychopaths who, far from showing any remorse, are incessantly planning their next offence. </Hansard-Body>

Dr DOUGLAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The member for Toowoomba North should just wait and hear me out. Valmae Beck, Leonard Fraser, Geoffrey Dobbs and Ray Garland--these names may not be household names to you, but I have dealt with these people. They are serious offenders and they are some of Australia’s most notorious sex offenders. Their crimes and sex offences are so horrible, so barbaric, that even the briefest of descriptions of their offences makes people physically ill. What is not widely known is that these offenders were well known to the system far in advance of the worst of their crimes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066169"></A>
The criminal system, the criminal support systems and human naivety all successfully combine to ensure that these people and others continue to seriously sexually offend. Weak governments and weak laws ensured that they were kept well away from a custodial sentence. Even the most kindly supporters were not immune to their offending behaviour, particularly in the case of Ray Garland. These offenders are male, often serial offenders, often violent, often educated--sometimes well educated--often working in groups with support or sometimes alone, previously in custody and sadly often used by police as informants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066172"></A>
This bill is said to be the result of the report <Hansard-Italic>
A new public protection model for the management of high risk sexual and violent offenders</Hansard-Italic>
 and amends the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003 and provisions of the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992 that deal with the indefinite sentencing regime. The Attorney-General has described the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003 as a groundbreaking piece of preventative detention legislation. What he did not say was that preceding it were years of shocking crimes by serial offenders including the former state Labor leader and the former member for Woodridge, Bill D’Arcy, who had the dubious honour of having the most major sexual offences ever recorded. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066178"></A>
I suspect that it was the groundbreaking investigation of the serious criminal sexual offender Darren Osbourne and his attack on Shari Davies that really led to this, albeit it took 10 years of difficult publicity for the Davies family to ensure that change did occur. Interestingly, it was Shari’s father, Ian, who had a major role in the victims of crime legislation and in ensuring a role for victims when sentencing of offenders occurs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066182"></A>
The act of 2003 enables the Supreme Court of Queensland to order the continuing detention or the supervised release of serious sexual offenders beyond the expiry date of their sentence. It goes without saying that the test is the need to ensure the adequate protection of the community. This bill amends this test to also ensure that adequate community protection can be reasonably and practically managed by a supervision order. It also adds that this can be similarly managed reasonably and practically by Corrective Services officers. The Attorney-General falsely believes that this will enhance the ability of Corrective Services officers to monitor the compliance of released prisoners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066184"></A>
The Attorney-General further states that the bill will allow Corrective Services officers or custodial services officers to have the power to issue binding directions to release prisoners or supervision orders relating to matters as to where they will live or if they are to engage in treatment and restrictions in relation to alcohol and substance abuse. These changes are welcome. Such offenders will always tend to drift back to their old haunts. The only thing preventing this has been the publication of where they are living under new laws. As difficult as it has been for offenders, it meets community expectations, and only a few major offenders have had trouble finding reasonable accommodation or supervision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066185"></A>
There is not enough widespread use of bracelets and electronic tag devices, and community corrections funding is abysmal at best and culpable at worst. It is one thing to set a law in place; it is quite another to implement and monitor it. It is quite impossible to watch people constantly other than in a custodial environment. There are aspects of this bill that seem to indicate that there are people in the department who are beginning to understand but, boy oh boy, hasn’t it taken a long, long time? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066186"></A>
This relates to part 10 of the Penalties and Sentences Act where there is an amendment relating to indefinite sentencing. The change expands the test of a very specific group of serious sexual offences to a considerably larger list. I choose not to list them, but notably the new additions include torture and serious offences against children and minors. This is again appropriate since recent information demonstrates that, whilst these offences have been occurring for a long time historically, they have not been grouped with other serious sexual offences. One has to wonder whether this was an oversight, lazy administration or deliberate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066187"></A>
It is blatantly obvious that until the recent major investigations by Queensland police into child pornography and exploitation, as has been detailed, under Task Force Argos, the Queensland government has been laggard in confronting serious paedophile sexual offenders. Far too many have escaped both prosecution and an appropriate sentence for the few convicted. Indefinite sentences really put some bite into these laws. I struggle to understand why it has taken so long when report after report, conference after conference and scientific evidence have all shown that these serious sexual offenders, by and large, cannot be rehabilitated. Their behaviour is so cold-blooded, deviant and repetitive that little short of continuous incarceration is the answer. Most deny culpability and many wish harm to their victims long after they have survived the ordeal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066189"></A>
For those apologists who feel that there is not enough mercy for these murderous offenders, in many cases, these are a few facts that might make them sleep a little easier. Overwhelmingly, those who are in custody are in protection and well provided for. They routinely refuse rehab programs. They often get good prison jobs ahead of other prisoners. Most never make any compensatory payment nor contrition statements to their victims. Forty per cent of all appeals to the state’s Court of Appeal involve these or other major criminal offenders. The cost and waste of this to us all and the legal system is immeasurable. To have the finest legal minds continuously fed this kind of absolute drivel is a national disgrace. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066190"></A>
Irrespective of those who believe that serious criminal offenders were incorrectly charged and sentenced, overwhelmingly the test of beyond reasonable doubt, juries and prolonged time between trial and offence will in many cases lead to an acquittal rather than a conviction. A conviction is an essential part of the contrition and rehabilitation of an offender. The evidence is compelling. One will never correct offending behaviour without the offender clearly being made aware of what is it that they have done. And remember that we pay $50,000 per person for every year that they are actually held in custody, and that is increasing with CPI. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066191"></A>
It is rather fitting that the inconsistency of dealing with offenders who serve the full time of their nominal sentence are not subject to any parole upon release. This bill ensures that, where parole is not granted before the end of those sentences under section 173(1)(b), the offender at the end of their term of imprisonment will be under the authority of the Queensland Parole Board and the supervision of authorised custodial services officers for five years. This is not good enough. The LNP does not support five years even as a minimum, as the Attorney-General now says. One would hope that the next amendment is one that says that detention extends for at-risk offenders until they are no longer at risk. Then and only then can they be released on supervision. Detention must continue until deemed unnecessary by Corrective Services officers. I say why not do that now? The management of offenders over the next few years will determine whether that suggested amendment has then been effective. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066193"></A>
I worry that Labor cannot manage sex offenders. I believe Labor underestimates them. The dangerous serious sex offender in Sydney is no doubt Fred Many, and his behaviour is well documented; ours is Geoffrey Dobbs. Clearly these types of offenders and their offences require lifelong supervision long after the end of their sentencing. We do have a few others in this league, and I have mentioned some of those. These types of statements are not meant to shock members, but members really need to understand the seriousness of these changes to the law and how small amendments can save lives.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066196"></A>
Dangerous sex offenders should be locked up until they are no longer a risk to the community. If only Darren Osbourne had not been paroled the previous week after serving just 4 years for the rape of a woman at Kangaroo Point, Shari Davies would never have had to endure such terrible crimes, which many have probably long forgotten. The crimes occurred eight years ago now. Thankfully, her magnificent family--in particular her father, Ian--have given a functioning victims of crime mechanism to us all as their legacy. It is the victims for whom we must direct all our reparative and preventative efforts, for the dangerous sexual offenders deserve little more than indefinite custody. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066198"></A>
I take up the point that was made by the member for Gladstone, who said these people do realise that they want something done for these people in the longer term. They want to know what is going on because remember that these people do harbour extreme malice towards their victims long after the offence. I think the Attorney-General has taken a minimalist approach both presenting the bill and offering victims justice. No doubt there are groups who would say that some of the provisions we are demanding are draconian and too far reaching and others who would say that they are too little too late. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066200"></A>
There are not many of these types of offenders, but they are a seriously dangerous group who must not ever be taken lightly. Small changes to laws to restrict them and maintain them in custody are beneficial to society as a whole. Their removal from society in general makes our communities safer and better places to live. Anyone who supports this bill in its current form is supporting the limiting of supervision orders for dangerous sex offenders. Therefore, the bill needs complete redrafting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066201"></A>
For someone to behave in such a way as to lead to laws like this is not reflective of the failure of community standards; it more likely reflects the fragility of humans as a race and what can happen when the balance in those people’s lives is missing. In other eras, they were promptly removed, usually by capital punishment. Fittingly, in this era, they are given time to reflect on their crimes. Their removal from society and the benefits that come from that in part are a fair trade-off for the crime. There are strong issues about the trade-off being covered in our Constitution. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066202"></A>
One must hope there is a method in time where we can identify these offenders early and do something to prevent them from offending. Prevention must be the answer in the longer term. It is sad that this bill has taken so long to come forward and that it underdelivers. For a minority, adaptation is impossible. We need to plan for that. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms DAVIS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Aspley--LNP) (4.30 pm): I rise to add to the debate on the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. The bill seeks to increase flexibility for the management of offenders under the act and to enhance the ability of the court to make indefinite sentence orders under part 10 of the Penalties and Sentences Act. The community supports any measures that ensure dangerous sexual offenders are monitored so as not to place further risk to society. Indeed, if they are a risk to the community, then their release back into the community should not occur. Put simply, they should remain locked up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066241"></A>
Given the subject matter of this bill, I spent some time speaking with professionals who have experience with these sorts of matters and who have dealt with these types of offenders. The first part of the bill I wish to comment on is that which requires the Attorney-General to produce a report prepared by the chief executive of Corrective Services to the court that is considering the questions of whether the prisoner should be further detained or released under supervision. That report is to propose further or special conditions to those contained in the 2003 act and will indicate the extent to which those requirements can reasonably and practically be managed by Corrective Services officers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066243"></A>
It is important to note that, while the amendment does not explicitly refer to the ‘dangerousness’ of the prisoner, the terms in two subsections make it implicit that ‘dangerousness’ is central to the court’s considerations. It is my understanding from speaking to those who have worked in the corrections and legal systems that the psychiatric prediction of an offender’s ‘dangerousness’ is at best problematical and usually fraught with difficulty. This is supported by a considerable body of sociological and psychiatric literature. As I understand it, diagnosis of mental illness lacks reliability, and psychiatry is generally unable to predict ‘dangerousness’ with any precision.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066244"></A>
In this connection, I note that the material to be considered by the court in an application in the act is at least on the psychiatrist’s report on the prisoner. In order that the court can undertake the consideration that is to be required, it must in my view judge the ‘dangerousness’ of the prisoner or the degree of risk to the community that it would face should the prisoner be released under supervision on the terms contained in the order. I am told that the handful of appellate court decisions on the question of ‘dangerousness’ as a basis for preventative detention of prisoners shows that even courts face problems in predicting ‘dangerousness’ in sentencing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066245"></A>
The next comments I have are in regard to the proposed insertion of the new section 13A. In this section, it is proposed that the period of the supervision order must be stated and must not extend beyond a period of five years. The logic behind the amendment must be that these prisoners pose the greatest risk of reoffending within five years of release. In my view, that logic is flawed and does not properly take account of the nature of the sociopathic or personality disorders that these individuals may exhibit. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066246"></A>
There is much evidence that this category of offender has little, if any, insight into their own thought processes or they are in complete denial about their thoughts, urges and feelings. They have little, if any, conscience or sense of responsibility for their actions or appreciation of the consequences of their actions on others, especially their victims. They are, therefore, particularly resistant to change in their attitudes and behaviour and will only give a token effort to a course for treatment, if they involve themselves at all. The consistent response is that there is nothing wrong with them and therefore there is nothing to correct. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066247"></A>
As a result, these offenders are very likely to pose just as great a danger to the community at the end of five years as they did at the date of their release. As these people have such little insight and appreciation about their mental state, it is unlikely that they will be able to properly state how they feel or, worse, they are more likely to tell their supervisor what they think they want to hear, and we will not know the truth about the risk until it is too late. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066248"></A>
I would like to speak to the amendment that allows the Attorney-General to make an application for a further supervision order in respect of a prisoner who has been released under a division 3 supervision order. As the division’s heading states, such an application, if approved by the court, will have the effect of extending the supervision order for a further period of up to five years. While this provision addresses to some extent the shortcomings of the amendments I raised earlier, it is worthy of some comment--in particular, the new provision which refers back to a psychiatric assessment prior to a prisoner’s release. It is assumed there would be a fresh assessment undertaken for the purposes of the Attorney’s further application, but it is not at all clear what grounds would trigger such an application to be made. In my view, the basis for a further application should be more explicit in the legislation so that the community is assured and the prisoner is aware of the basis for that extension. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066250"></A>
The Attorney should be obliged to bring a further application for an extension of supervised release where there is any reasonable doubt about the prisoner’s present and future ability to remain unsupervised in the community without posing a risk of further offending. There should be a positive onus placed on the Attorney to be reasonably satisfied that the prisoner no longer poses a serious threat to the community, and if he cannot so be satisfied he ought to be compelled under the act to bring an application for extended supervision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066251"></A>
Further, the amendments clearly state that the application may be made within the last six months of the current order. It appears that, were the prisoner to complete the supervision order before the Attorney made a further application to extend that supervision, he would have no power to bring the application and the court may not have the power to entertain the application and make any such order. Clearly, that apparent anomaly needs to be clarified, and it is just another indication that this legislation should be redrafted. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms NELSON-CARR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mundingburra--ALP) (4.36 pm): I too rise in support of the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. The preventative detention regime created in Queensland by the groundbreaking Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003 formed the basis for legislation of this type across the nation. There has long been a struggle between the right of prisoners who have served their full term of imprisonment to be released back into the community with the right of the community to be protected against people who are at high risk of reoffending, particularly when acts of violence and sexual offences are committed against children. Queenslanders expect that people should not be released from prison unless they have reduced their risk to the community. Because this is a departure from normal concepts of the punishment fitting the crime, it is natural that the courts would jealously guard these rights and ensure that such drastic measures are only adopted in appropriate circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066254"></A>
Other jurisdictions have previously attempted to hold prisoners after their sentence expired, and those jurisdictions had their legislation struck down by the High Court as unconstitutional. Queensland’s legislation was the first of its type to be upheld by the High Court as valid. Since that time, the government has looked at ways of incrementally strengthening the legislation to ensure that it not only protects Queenslanders but also remains within the range of constitutional validity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066255"></A>
The amendments contained in this bill seek to further strengthen the regime while still remaining within that fine line of constitutionality. As part 2 of the bill amends the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003, clause 4 allows the Attorney-General to produce a report prepared by the Department of Community Safety to the court that sets out the conditions that they consider are necessary on a supervision order to adequately protect the community. This might include electronic monitoring, curfews, abstention from alcohol, restrictions on employment and residence. The report will also outline the capacity of Corrective Services officers to reasonably and practically manage such conditions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066258"></A>
I will speak to a couple more amendments which are a really vital part of protecting Queenslanders from serious sexual offenders. Clause 7 amends the act to require the court to have regard to this report in determining whether to impose a continuing detention or supervision order. Such an amendment is important because, for a supervision order to provide protection to the community, it must be capable of being properly managed by the people charged with that responsibility. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066259"></A>
There are also some amendments in the bill relating to victims of these horrific crimes. The Attorney-General will no longer give notification of hearings to the victims; this task will be performed by the chief executive of the Department of Community Safety. This is appropriate because this department maintains the victims register. The act currently allows the victim to provide a statement to the court about the impact that the offence has had on them and their views on any proposed order. The amendments provide that, if a victim fails to make such a statement, the court cannot make any inference about a lack of effect on the victim or that the victim has no interest in the outcome of the hearing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066294"></A>
The government made an amendment in 2007 requiring that victims be provided with notice of all hearings--for example, initial applications or contravention hearings. Being mindful of the fact that receiving notice may be distressing for some victims, the bill contains an amendment that victims may notify the chief executive that they do not wish to receive these notices and they will be ceased. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066296"></A>
Orders under DP(SO)A are currently not for any specific term. The judge, when imposing the order, must make an assessment of how long they feel the prisoner will remain a risk to the community. Once that term has expired there is no capacity to apply to have the period extended, even if there is compelling evidence that the released prisoner requires further supervision. Similarly, if the prisoner is no longer any risk to the community, because of a medical condition for example, the supervision order remains in place for its duration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066297"></A>
Supervision orders must be made for an initial minimum period of five years. However, they can be for a maximum of 20 years under the act. Once this term expires, if the prisoner still poses a risk to the community, a further application can be made to the court to extend the period of supervision. This ensures that supervision orders are better suited to the individual offender and are flexible enough to continue in operation for as long as they are needed. These protective measures are to be commended and therefore I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr SHINE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (4.40 pm): First of all, I congratulate the Attorney and indeed the Minister for Police in terms of implementing the outcomes of the review that was carried out a few years ago. It is always a difficult thing to reach agreement in relation to these matters which concern serious issues, and often there is a natural tension that exists between different interests in the community which are reflected often within government as well. So I congratulate them both for reaching agreement and bringing this legislation to the House today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066300"></A>
Having said that, I indicate my disappointment at the contribution made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Southern Downs. It is sad that the opposition does not regard the position of Attorney-General as important enough to appoint one of the several lawyers who adorn their benches to the position of shadow Attorney-General. It is, I would have thought, a prerequisite to have legal knowledge. Then again, of course it would be more sad, having heard the honourable member for Kawana, if he were appointed as shadow. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066304"></A>
The shadow minister, the member for Southern Downs, cast aspersions on the Penalties and Sentences Act. He said that on its passage in 1992 it wiped away or destroyed centuries of legal precedents, particularly as it related to the penalties that should be imposed by the court. Of course, any lawyer would realise and knows that, by and large, the sentences applicable to offences are contained in fact in the Criminal Code, not in the Penalties and Sentences Act, and the decisions with respect to penalties imposed made by the courts under the provisions of the code remained. They remained as precedents after the passage of the Penalties and Sentences Act, so the proposition that the Penalties and Sentences Act swept away centuries of precedents is simply not legally correct. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066306"></A>
What the Penalties and Sentences Act did, of course, was to largely codify and summarise the principles that the courts themselves had developed over indeed centuries. It set out in part 2 the sentencing guidelines that courts are to apply and the matters that the court must have regard to with respect to arriving at an appropriate sentence--a just sentence that is required in all of the circumstances. There are many points set out in part 2 of the Penalties and Sentences Act. I commend a reading of the act to the shadow Attorney, the member for Kawana and anybody else in the opposition. It would be a novelty for them to find out what the law of Queensland really is in this regard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066307"></A>
As I said earlier, it is not unusual for tensions to exist in terms of what appropriate laws should be enforced in Queensland with respect to these areas. On the one hand, there are civil rights aspects to be taken into account. When it comes to the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act, we are dealing with people who have done the crime--often serious and terrible crimes--but who have served the time. So their civil liberties, as people who have paid their debt to society, are now in jeopardy. On the other hand, of course, we have the safety of the community at large as the conflicting aspect to take into account. Queensland has, I think, an excellent record in terms of how it attacks and deals with this very vexed question. Reference has been made in the course of the debate to the outcome in Fardon’s case in 2004. It is always important to realise that the provisions which we pass here will be invalid if the enactment will in some fashion render the Supreme Court of Queensland, as well as any inferior court to the Supreme Court, an unsuitable repository of federal judicial power, in accordance with the principles that were set out in Fardon’s case. So we have to comply with those principles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066309"></A>
Often it has been argued that it is legally offensive to restrict the liberty of individuals when they have not in fact committed a crime--they have paid their penalty but they have not committed a subsequent crime--and the argument runs that it is bad law to bring in provisions restricting a person’s liberty in anticipation of possible future criminal behaviour. However, the Commonwealth and indeed the states have successfully brought in law, which I think has been challenged with respect to antiterrorism legislation in the past, whereby provisions restricting civil liberties--the imposition of a curfew, the need to report to police, the giving of fingerprints, restraint on where people live and so on--have been introduced and have been upheld as being acceptable to the court. That is so particularly in Fardon’s case, where those sorts of restrictions were dealt with. For many years--centuries--the courts have upheld the imposition of sureties for the keeping of the peace where there is no question that a crime had already been committed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066310"></A>
In summary, bearing in mind the time, as I understand it the law which was enunciated in Fardon’s case by Gleeson, the Chief Justice, in particular, still applies in terms of what care must be taken when we pass this type of legislation. He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1066313"></A>
It authorises and empowers the Supreme Court to act in a manner which is consistent with its judicial character. It does not confer functions which are incompatible with the proper discharge of judicial responsibilities or with the exercise of judicial power. It confers a substantial discretion as to whether an order should be made, and if so, the type of order. If an order is made, it might involve either detention or release under supervision. The onus of proof is on the Attorney-General. The rules of evidence apply. The discretion is to be exercised by reference to the criterion of serious danger to the community. The Court is obliged ... to have regard to a list of matters that are all relevant to the criterion. There is a right of appeal. Hearings are conducted in public, and in accordance with the ordinary judicial process. There is nothing to suggest that the Supreme Court is to act as a mere instrument of government policy. The outcome of each case is to be determined on its merit. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1066315"></A>
These are the matters that the Attorney has to take into account when framing amendments to this legislation. It is no good going along with the outcry that we hear time and time again from the opposition as to what should be done or what should not be done to these people. It is important to realise that there is no point in this parliament passing laws that will be thrown out by the High Court in next to no time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070380"></A>
That is the challenge that the Attorney has in drafting legislation. That is what this House has to be conscious of when it deals with legislation. I believe it is the duty of all members of parliament to be cautious and careful not only in what we do here but also in how we explain legislation of this nature to the public at large. As leaders in the community we have a responsibility to ensure that the community is aware of what we do and why we do it. That is responsible behaviour that each and every member of parliament should display. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070381"></A>
I commend the Attorney for the further reforms and changes that are contained in this legislation. The government is always conscious of the preservation of the safety of the community but is also conscious of the need to pass legislation that will be upheld as valid by the High Court in due course. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Indooroopilly--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.50 pm): With around 3,000 convicted sex offenders living in Queensland, many of us will know someone who has been a victim of these predators. These victims can be anyone--male or female, a child, a teenage, an adult or an elderly person. The one thing they all have in common is the nightmare of having to live with painful memories every day for the rest of their lives--memories that can continue to cause irreparable damage. We cannot erase these memories. We cannot change the fact that they have been a victim of a heinous and indecent crime. We can, however, protect these victims and the rest of our community from having it happen again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070384"></A>
As we debate today the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, it is important to remind ourselves of exactly why we have this legislation. We know that many sex offenders will reoffend. Some of them will never break the cycle. For instance, Graeme Hancock, already on release under a supervision order, faced court in June last year charged with using a mobile phone to photograph a naked five-year-old girl at South Bank Parklands. He had even said to police that he could not control himself and if he saw a young girl wearing a skirt he would have to try to look up it. Psychiatrists rated him a moderate to high chance of reoffending. Yet the then Attorney-General did not oppose his release. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070388"></A>
Mark Foy, in April of last year, was caught swimming with a 13-year-old boy at a waterhole at Chuwar. This was the fourth time he had broken his supervision order. Desmond Buckby was released in May 2007 against recommendations from psychiatrists. Less than five months later police found five children watching a DVD at his house and he was arrested for breaching his supervision order. Raymond Perkins has been convicted three times--the most recent for molesting a 12-year-old boy. These are just a few examples of those who commit these disgraceful crimes again and again. Every time they reoffend they do not just take a person’s TV or car, they condemn their victims to a life of reliving these nightmarish memories. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070392"></A>
Many of these offenders do not want to change. Others want to, but they cannot because the rehabilitation programs are not easily accessible to them. At some jails there is a wait of at least six months for prisoners to start the sex offenders course and it takes nine months to complete. Sex offenders are being released into our community without ever taking part in the rehabilitation course. Raymond Perkins has thus far failed to take part in the program. Desmond Buckby refused to take part. We know that in 2006-07 some 215 of the 299 sex offenders released did not complete the rehabilitation programs. In 2007-08 some 186 unrehabilitated offenders were released. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070393"></A>
The government releases these offenders into the community and then it loses track of them. In July last year it was revealed that eight registered sex offenders were missing. The government had not heard from them in 12 months. In an attempt to allay our fears it said that it is better than the 70 who went missing the year before. The Police Commissioner cannot guarantee these offenders will not reoffend. Every minute these offenders are loose in our community is another minute that the people we know and love are at risk of becoming their next victim. Yet the government repeatedly refuses to upgrade its tracking technology. It relies on inferior electronic bracelets from the 1990s when GPS technology is readily available and far more reliable. Graeme Hancock was wearing one of these devices when he reoffended. In July a convicted paedophile was wearing a radio signal based anklet when he allegedly tried to abduct a boy from a skate park at Camira. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070395"></A>
This bill winds back some essential provisions despite community protection not being strong enough. The government is admitting that it cannot keep our community safe. It cannot fund or properly staff the existing monitoring and supervisory sections within Corrective Services. There are even reports of complaints in the ranks of Corrective Services about the high cost of the soon to be 100 offenders subject to orders made under the current legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070396"></A>
So here we are amending this legislation yet again and the government has not even got it right this time. As I mentioned before, there are a number of offenders who breach supervision orders. This bill fails to propose an increased sanction for them. Sex offenders are missing in our community yet this bill fails to provide the GPS monitoring to more effectively implement supervision orders. What this bill does is require the court to consider whether a supervision order could even be implemented by Corrective Services. This is a direct admission of failure by this government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070397"></A>
When this bill was introduced last year, the clear intention was to limit the maximum period of supervision orders to five years. To justify this the Attorney-General said in his second reading speech that the highest risk period for offenders is the first few years after their release from custody. What this one-size-fits-all approach suggests is that all sex offenders will be rehabilitated within five years from their release date. Yet their victims are affected for the rest of their lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070398"></A>
Sex offenders commit a variety of offences with differing degrees of severity and differing frequencies. A one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate. The Attorney-General now appears to have undergone some sort of conversion. What we see once again is this government shirking its responsibility by trying to decrease the number of supervision orders being implemented. It should be up to the courts to decide on a case-by-case basis what terms of the supervision order are appropriate. They have heard all of the facts, they have heard expert opinions and they understand the issues before them in each case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070399"></A>
The Attorney-General says that if a sex offender is not rehabilitated after five years one can simply apply to have an order extended. These applications are unlimited. But every time a supervision order draws to a close there needs to be another court application. This not only ties up our court system but is a costly exercise as new expert evidence has to be called, departmental reports have to be drawn up and new legal counsel has to be employed. There is also the frightening prospect that the application may fail. Even more frightening is the government’s record in failing to oppose the release of offenders likely to reoffend.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070400"></A>
This bill also extends the initial review period for a continuing detention order. This is done so that any offender has time to complete a sex offenders rehabilitation program. This amendment is clearly designed to make up for the failure to deliver rehabilitation programs promptly. What this bill does not do is make such rehabilitation programs compulsory. We have already seen the alarming figures of just how many sex offenders get released into our community without completing these programs. We also know that many of these sex offenders will reoffend. The explanatory notes to this bill state that the bill continues the government’s commitment to ensuring the ongoing efficacy of Queensland’s public protection legislation. Yet this bill fails to deliver on so many points and winds back key provisions to protect Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070401"></A>
Some amendments this bill proposes are welcome. They do allow a more effective implementation of the legislation and resolve some issues that have been identified throughout the operation of the legislation. However, we have not got this legislation right if this bill goes unamended. There is still a significant threat posed to the community by sex offenders. Our duty is to ensure protection of the community is paramount here, not the government’s unwillingness to admit that it has not lived up to expectations. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.58 pm): I rise to contribute to the debate on the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, which was introduced a year ago, on 1 September 2009, by the Hon. Cameron Dick, the Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations. These amendments are a continuation from changes made to the legislation in 2007 and in response to a report entitled <Hansard-Italic>
A new public protection model for the management of high risk sexual and violent offenders</Hansard-Italic>
 which was released in 2008. The government realised that its amendments in 2007 did not go far enough to protect the community from these predators and began a review of the Queensland public’s protective legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070443"></A>
It would have been more beneficial to the community and surely more cost effective to have performed this review of the 2003 legislation before releasing the 2007 amendments which we, on this side of the House, argued at the time should have been more comprehensive and better reflect the seriousness of crimes perpetrated by sex offenders. As honourable members have already heard from the shadow Attorney and honourable member for Southern Downs, we on this side of the House have reservations with certain aspects of the proposed amendments and the manner in which the Attorney has intimated via a media statement that he will be backflipping on key elements within the legislation as it now stands. In addition, the timelag of 12 months and one day since the introduction of this bill into the Queensland parliament is a clear indication of how little importance this Labor government places on tightening laws relating to dangerous sex offenders and the threat they place on society if left unchecked.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070446"></A>
The primary objectives of this bill are intended to increase the flexibility of management of offenders released on a supervision order under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003 and to enhance the ability of the court to make indefinite sentence orders by widening the schedule of offences it applies in the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992. Other provisions in this bill include placing a maximum limit on a supervision order, increasing the powers of corrective services officers to alter types of supervision, increasing the first annual review of a continuing detention order to two years, and altering parole conditions for those who have served their full sentence.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070450"></A>
The Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act currently imposes no restrictions on the length of a supervision order placed on a released sex offender. These amendments, however, propose to limit the maximum period of supervision orders to five years. According to the second reading speech of the Attorney-General, this government believes that by limiting the length of supervision orders to five years released prisoners will be more effectively supervised and will in turn provide more adequate protection to the community. Just how this more effective supervision will occur remains to be seen. But now we hear that the Attorney might have had a sudden change of heart and intends to alter the amendment to make it a five-year minimum. Currently, there are released prisoners on 15- and 20-year supervision orders. These lengthy supervision orders have been placed by the courts because these prisoners are notorious criminals who are deemed to present ongoing serious threats to the community. Under these amendments, the Attorney-General would have to apply to the court at the expiry of the five-year period if they believe a further supervision order is required.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070454"></A>
The explanatory notes tell us that the government’s rationale for introducing a maximum supervision period is that offenders pose the most risk to the community during their ‘first few years after release from custody’. However, research undertaken in 2007 by Dr Karen Gelb, senior criminologist of the Sentencing Advisory Council of Victoria, shows that the opposite is true and sexual recidivism across time actually increases. According to Dr Gelb’s study, rates of recidivism for sex offenders after five years is 14 per cent, after 10 years is 20 per cent and after 15 years is 24 per cent. How can this government justify its reasoning regarding a five-year maximum when these figures are considered--figures from an experienced senior criminologist? I would ask the Attorney if he was aware of these alarming statistics when the legislation was touted as policy and, if he was, then why did he discard them in favour of left-wing socialist ideology--ideology that is not supported by fact. Surely going down the path he has taken is placing the general public at risk while pandering to the rights of criminals. Violent offenders such as those the act is specifically designed to cover need prolonged supervision after their prison term. These amendments, by restricting the length of the order to five years, could in fact result in more violent individuals reoffending years down the line, incurring further incarceration or--far worse--slipping under the radar and not getting caught at all.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070460"></A>
The current legislation requires that any amendments made to a supervision order can only be made by the courts. The provisions contained within this bill will allow corrective services officers to make additions to the type of supervision, including their housing, rehabilitation and treatment programs, and restrictions in relation to alcohol. While the amendments in this bill do place restrictions on the alterations that can be made to supervision orders, we are talking about serious violent offenders whose orders have been set by a Supreme Court judge for reasons possibly unknown by the corrective services officer. It is understandable that this will ease demands that are choking our court system, but in turn it puts more responsibility on a public servant and their department who may not have the adequate experience to make the best decision in the interests of the wider community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070462"></A>
The bill also proposes to increase the first review of a continuing detention order from one year to two years from the date the order is made. The government’s reasoning for extending the review period is to allow the offender enough time to undertake rehabilitation if they had not done so while in custody. Only 92 of 208 convicted paedophiles and rapists released in the 2008-09 financial year had completed rehabilitation programs prior to being released. In the 2007-08 financial year, 93 of 178 sex offenders were released without completing programs. This equates to over 200 sex offenders in the past two years being released back into society without undertaking any form of rehabilitation. That is less than 50 per cent, which is an abysmal rate--a miserable failure by any measure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070463"></A>
Currently, participation in rehabilitation programs is voluntary. According to the 2008 report <Hansard-Italic>
A new public protection model for the management of high risk sexual and violent offenders</Hansard-Italic>
 prepared by the Queensland government, a coercive approach to rehabilitation can result in disruptive participants and participants claiming to have successfully completed programs without intending to comply with program concepts on release. It sounds more like an excuse for the Labor government to avoid committing to funding to provide effective and result-driven rehabilitation programs for Queensland. This government should be doing everything in its power to lower the rate of sexual offender recidivism by combining compulsory, effective rehabilitation programs with intensive supervision upon release. However, this legislation before us today is set on appeasing criminals and putting cost factors ahead of community safety.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070465"></A>
Releasing sex offenders back into society before they are deemed to be low risk is typical of a government that has a soft on crime track record in this state. The system is failing innocent Queenslanders and we are seeing sex offenders being released back into society, albeit under a supervision order, when psychiatrist reports are telling the courts that there is a high risk of the person reoffending and they should not be freed from custody. Unfortunately, their expert opinions are too often correct and all too often ignored. As my colleague the shadow minister for police and corrective services uncovered by questioning the government between January 2008 to March 2010, 99 out of 3,423 registered sex offenders were charged with further sex offences after release back into the community. Almost every week for the past two years a man, woman or child has been sexually assaulted as a result of this incompetent Labor government. Reports in the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 in May revealed some of the sickening acts these supposedly supervised individuals have been caught doing. The number of further sexual offences committed under supervision orders is unacceptable and the police minister’s comments waving reoffending off as part and parcel of the game are absolutely shameful.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070467"></A>
Sex abuse scars an individual, and in some instances their families and loved ones, for life. Untreated, it can lead to a lack of self-esteem, depression, substance abuse and even suicide. Many victims are incapable of forming intimate relationships and require intensive counselling and support. The price on society, both physical and financial, is massive. Townsville paedophile Desmond George Buckby is behind bars indefinitely after reoffending while on parole. The original psychiatric reports, which revealed there was a high chance he would reoffend, were initially ignored by the courts. One psychiatrist went so far as to say he believed that Buckby was incapable of learning, but this government did not heed the warning.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070470"></A>
Tales of residents angry to learn they have a serious sex offender living in their midst pepper our media outlets each time it is revealed that one such offender has been placed in their neighbourhood. Outrage surrounding the release of convicted paedophile Dennis Ferguson in Queensland in 2008 filtered into countless Australian households. Ferguson is a repeat offender who continues to engender fear and hatred in the community, no matter where he is located. A concerned resident in my electorate recently wrote to me detailing a case of a convicted paedophile allowed to live four doors down from a local kindergarten. This constituent was a strong advocate for legislation to provide for special residential accommodation for serious sex offenders, believing that by keeping them far away from schools and children perverse temptations will be limited.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074272"></A>
This would not only enable the community to feel safe but also be a place where notorious convicted paedophiles would be in a better position to avoid retribution from negative community attitudes. Breaches of reporting obligations by registered sex offenders have soared 3,000 per cent since 2005, hitting a peak in 2007, when there were 70 registered sex offenders whose whereabouts were unknown to the Queensland government. This appalling record forced the government to launch Operation Breach, which was tasked with locating these dangerous criminals. In 2009, there were eight missing, with one missing for more than nine months. Our police did a great job. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074274"></A>
Two types of control measures used in Queensland for violent sex offenders are electronic bracelet monitoring and chemical castration. While this Labor government trumpets their effectiveness at every turn, both of these methods create a false sense of security in the community. The electronic bracelet is outdated and ineffective and does not keep track of a person 24 hours a day, as first stated by the government when released in 2007. The LNP is of the opinion that a global positioning system--or GPS--could be more effective for monitoring particularly dangerous sexual offenders. However, the Bligh government is slow on the uptake here, instead finding excuses not to implement this modern technology. The government’s argument is that the scheme is not cost-effective and that it will cost $52,000 per year. However, the US can keep track of prisoners for as little as $8 a day.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074275"></A>
GPS is widely used in military operations, search and rescue, police surveillance and private sector vehicle tracking. Detention with GPS is achieved by monitoring the person to ensure curfew hours are kept. Location restrictions are in force through an alarm that is triggered when offenders enter a restricted area and GPS would limit offenders going missing while on supervision orders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074276"></A>
Chemical castration involves the offender taking a series of medication that is meant to reduce libido and sexual deviant behaviour. The founder of Bravehearts, Hetty Johnston, has concerns that prisoners are using this process as a bargaining chip to obtain parole and says that it should not be trusted. The medication reduces testosterone and has been shown to reduce sexual drive, but does not stop individuals from being able to have sexual intercourse. Notably, sexual intercourse is not the only form of sexual abuse. Other instruments can and have been used by perpetrators on their victims. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074279"></A>
It is worth mentioning here that assaults by sex offenders are not commonly triggered by sexual urges but by power, violence and humiliation of their victims. Additional research into the minds of serious sexual offenders may help us to understand more effective ways to treat them. The application of knowledge from epigenetics may even identify those with a predisposition towards committing these serious offences before they commit these heinous acts and offer up new treatments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074280"></A>
Relapse prevention can be an effective rehabilitation treatment and involves cognitive behavioural treatment programs that aim to provide offenders with ways of combating the risks and temptations they are faced with when placed back into society. Research by the Australian Centre for the Study of Sexual Assault shows that an offender’s chance of relapsing increases when they place themselves in a high-risk situation. Cognitive therapy programs aim to provide a relapse framework and help the offender to identify their patterns of behaviour and to assist in maintaining the gains that they have made in therapy. This program appears to be the most effective of the psychological approaches to date based on evaluative research, but does not consider a chemical imbalance, which I hope will be considered more deeply in the future, as part of an individual’s tendency to sexually abuse. In order for any of these programs to have maximum success, adequate funding and emphasis on the importance of therapy must be provided to engage prisoners in these programs prior to their release. More critically, though, is the need for political will to implement these proven programs as policy rather than to let outdated and fruitless procedures reign. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074282"></A>
Alarmingly, there has been a sharp increase in the number of juvenile sexual offenders. A lack of early education coupled with social issues may be the catalyst for these worrying figures. As my colleague the shadow Attorney-General mentioned in his speech on juvenile justice reform last September, this Labor government continues to give lip-service to getting involved in early intervention, yet little seems to happen. Crime rates among juvenile offenders speak for themselves as to the effectiveness of this government’s agenda on crime. Reports in the past couple of years of children as young as seven perpetrating sexual acts upon others of similar or younger ages must be taken more seriously. This is not normal play and indicates that a child has most likely been exposed to sexual activity or, worse, been abused themselves. Youngsters deserve our protection. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074283"></A>
It would appear that this government has once again missed an opportunity to make our communities safe by implementing legislation that is limp-wristed and poorly drafted. As I have stated already, while the opposition can see some merit in parts of this bill, it has considerable issues with the proposed limit of five years for supervision orders and Labor’s reluctance to take a strong stance against crime in Queensland. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (5.15 pm): On Tuesday, during the debate on the Child Protection and Other Acts Amendment Bill, I spoke about walking a fine line regarding conflicting rights. Today, we are confronted again with the same challenges by the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. This time that fine line is being played out in full view of the broader population through a media that is captivated by what we term dangerous prisoners, our state’s sexual offenders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074287"></A>
I start by referring to a <Hansard-Italic>

 article penned by Marissa Calligeros on 28 April this year titled ‘Ignore the United Nations, says child protection advocate’. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Ignore the United Nations. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1074291"></A>
That’s the message from a prominent child protection advocate to the Queensland Government after the UN ruled laws keeping high-risk sex offenders behind bars breached their human rights. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1074292"></A>
The United Nations Human Rights Committee last week ruled Queensland’s Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act, which is designed to keep sexual offenders in prison for rehabilitation after they have served their sentences, breached the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1074293"></A>
The UN committee ruled Australia had an international obligation to release convicted criminals--including sex offenders--from prison once they had fully served their sentence. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The UN’s own Rights of the Child states we should place the interest and safety of our children first and foremost. The detention of high-risk sex offenders does this. Are we here to protect the rights of our children or the rights of criminals? </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074300"></A>
This is one of those conundrums that those advocating for a bill of rights must address. What happens when one right conflicts with another? Does one right have precedence over another? Is there a hierarchy of rights? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074301"></A>
In many instances I would agree and side with the United Nations and its International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights but, primarily because I am a father, this is one of those cases where I disagree, side with Hetty Johnston and consider that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to be dominant. If we look at the two sides of the debate a bit further, I will explain why. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074306"></A>
Greg Barns, a criminal lawyer and a director of the Australian Lawyers Alliance, and Wendy Northey, a forensic psychologist who practises in the criminal justice system in Victoria, wrote this article for <Hansard-Italic>
Crikey</Hansard-Italic>
 in September last year--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1074309"></A>
The general community response towards sexual offending is predictably and rightfully censorious: Sexual abuse has the well-demonstrated potential to wreak havoc with bodies, minds and lives. However, the panicked community and media mindset to this most complex form of criminal offending is counter-productive in terms of the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074310"></A>
Barns and Northey go on to suggest that there is a need for a nationally coordinated approach to dealing with child sex offenders and in educating the community. So what might the core elements of such an approach be? Barns and Northey suggest that it needs to start with a coordinated medical management plan that includes a thorough and expert sexual risk assessment of the offender, that it should include ongoing rehabilitation and that it should include a safety plan. Barns and Northey go on to state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1074312"></A>
Governments and community leaders, including the media, need to work to ensure that the community response to a released offender is characterised by empathy, a desire for understanding and a willingness to provide support and engagement. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<A ID="pgfId-1074313"></A>
...</Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1074315"></A>
If we want to seriously reduce the opportunity for child sex offences, then our political leaders need to show much greater leadership than they have to date. A national scheme that addresses the triggers for reoffending while educating the community would be a good start in turning the corner. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074316"></A>
I agree with that last statement, but until we have all the pieces of that puzzle in place, what do we do with those individuals who would repeatedly fail a thorough and expert sexual risk assessment? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078406"></A>
This again is where I struggle to dismiss my feelings as a father. Until we get that mix right, I am not comfortable with what is being proposed in elements of this bill. Specifically, I cannot support a decision to impose a maximum of five years for supervision orders, especially when courts currently impose such orders for 10, 15, even 25 years. That brings me to the other side of the debate. Queensland does not have a strong record when it comes to monitoring sexual offenders on supervision orders. Again I refer to a <Hansard-Italic>
Brisbane Times</Hansard-Italic>
 article, this time from July 2009. It is titled ‘Sex offenders missing: Minister’, and it states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1078407"></A>
Queensland Police and Corrective Services Minister has admitted his department does not know the whereabouts of eight registered child sex offenders missing in the state. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1078408"></A>
Minister Neil Roberts told the parliamentary budget estimates last night a number of registered sex offenders under judicial supervision orders had failed to report their movements to police in the past 12 months and police were now looking for them. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1078409"></A>
Hetty Johnston, of child protection lobby group Bravehearts, laid blame squarely on the state’s inadequate judicial system, which released serious sex offenders back on the streets. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

And then this quote from Hetty--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr PITT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mulgrave--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.20 pm): There are two major functions that the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill performs. The first is to enhance the capacity of the courts to impose indefinite sentences on offenders who pose a significant risk to the community. The second is to increase flexibility in the management of offenders who are subject to continuing detention or supervision orders after their sentence has expired under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003. This is the aspect of the bill that I will focus on today.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078415"></A>
One of the important features of this amendment bill is the capacity to tailor supervision orders to the individual offender to better ensure the protection of the community. Currently under the legislation the court must determine, at the time of the making of the order, exactly how long the prisoner will require the strict supervision provided by a supervision order. If the court gets it wrong, at present there is no capacity for the Attorney-General to come back when the order is due to expire and ask for it to be extended. Similarly, if the order is made for a lengthy period, and the offender has totally rehabilitated or his health or other circumstances make it unnecessary for an order to continue in existence, there is no capacity to end the order and significant resources are wasted in supervising someone who no longer needs supervision. The resources of Corrective Services could be put to much better use. That is why these amendments make provision for an order to be made initially for a minimum of five years and then, as circumstances require, the order can be extended once more. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078416"></A>
One of the basic elements of the legislation is the threshold test, where the court determines whether an order of some type, either continuing detention or supervision, should be made. The court must be satisfied that there is an unacceptable risk that if the prisoner were released from custody without an order they would commit a serious sexual offence. Under the amendment contained in clause 4 of the bill, the Attorney-General will produce a report prepared by the Department of Community Safety. This report sets out the necessary requirements to be included in a supervision order to ensure the adequate protection of the community if the prisoner were to be released. The report must also outline the capacity of corrective services officers to reasonably and practically manage the proposed requirements. Under Clause 7(2) of the bill, the court must take into account the report produced by the Attorney-General and must have regard to the capacity of corrective services officers to manage a proposed supervision order.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078417"></A>
The bill also makes provision for corrective services officers to impose binding obligations on prisoners subject to a supervision order. There may be certain risk factors that develop after a prisoner has been released which were not considered at the time the order was made. Currently it is necessary to bring the matter back to court to have the supervision order amended. Under this amendment, the corrective services officers can impose the conditions. Because this is a significant power and the consequences of breaching the conditions are serious, including being returned to prison, there are a number of safeguards on the exercise of this power. The direction given by the officer must not be inconsistent with an existing condition of the supervision order and it must be considered reasonably necessary, either for the adequate protection of the community or for the prisoner’s rehabilitation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078418"></A>
Another procedural amendment is contained in clause 21 of the bill. Currently when a person is detained under a continuing detention order they are subject to annual review by the Supreme Court. In most cases a person will be detained because they have not completed a sex offender treatment program and therefore continue to pose a significant threat of reoffending. This amendment extends the period for the first review to two years, giving adequate time to complete the necessary treatment programs or otherwise demonstrate that they have reduced their risk to the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078419"></A>
A significant issue for members of the community has been the issue of a convicted sex offender being able to change their name. There currently exists a prohibition on prisoners on a continuing detention order from registering a change of name with Births, Deaths and Marriages. This amendment extends this prohibition to prisoners who are subject to a supervision order as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078420"></A>
There are also some amendments contained in this bill relating to victims. This government is committed to ensuring just and equitable outcomes for victims of crime. The Victims of Crime Assistance Act 2009 was a significant improvement in services for victims of crime. Presently, a victim is entitled to provide a statement outlining the harm caused to them by the crime. These amendments make it clear that there is no compulsion on a victim to do so and the failure to provide a statement cannot be construed by the court to mean that there was little or no harm to the victim in the commission of the offence. Currently victims are also entitled to receive notice of all upcoming Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act hearings. This may cause distress to some victims who would rather not receive any notification relating to the offender. This amendment makes it clear that a victim may choose to forego these notices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078421"></A>
These are significant amendments to the act and will enhance the capacity of corrective services officers to provide a regime that gives the greatest protection to the community. Queensland already has the toughest sex offender legislation in the country. This government has continued to look for ways to further strengthen this legislation and is committed to an ongoing review into the future. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--Ind)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.26 pm): I rise to speak to the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. ‘He is a bad man. Stay away from him.’ This simple sentence is one of the best shields that we can give to our children to help protect them from an assault from the 300-odd known and officially deemed dangerous sex offenders--although I am led to believe that there may be 89 or so. That is one of the issues that I would like the minister and Attorney-General to clarify. This government will not let Queensland families have the information to identify known repeat child rapists and dangerous sex offenders. It is stopping our constituents from saying to our children, ‘He is a bad man. Stay away from him.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078424"></A>
I would like to share with the House a study that completely changed my thinking on the way we manage dangerous sex offenders. It is from the <Hansard-Italic>
International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology</Hansard-Italic>
. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1078425"></A>
Second, self-report research on sex offenders indicated a high rate of previously undetected offending. For example, Gene Abel and his colleagues (1987) carried out research on nonincarcerated paraphiliacs with a confidentiality certificate guaranteeing that the information obtained could not be used to charge the participants. The 89 rapists in his sample reported an average of 7.5 victims; the 232 child molesters in his sample reported an average of 75.8 victims. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078426"></A>
In simple terms, this research showed that if a person was a rapist of, for want of a better word--and I am sure there is a better word--nonchild, there were on average about 7.5 victims that they raped before they were caught and convicted. Out of that sample group of child molesters--and many of our dangerous sex offenders are in that group--on average they get away with 75.8 victims before they are caught and convicted and held accountable for their crimes. I have thought about those statistics long and hard. For every child that we see in court who is the victim of a dangerous sex offender, I often wonder how many victims do not have their day in court; how many victims are there beneath that pyramid?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078464"></A>
Consequently, that information has driven the way I think about the whole philosophy of managing dangerous sex offenders which is very, very different from those in the government. The government insists that convicted repeat child rapists and dangerous sex offenders have the right to be released in secret into Queensland family neighbourhoods, without telling local families where that person is living. This legislation continues this principle of releasing dangerous sex offenders back into the community in secret. For that reason, I cannot support this legislation. I will explain why further. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078465"></A>
If there was ever an example of a glaring imbalance in our justice system, it is the imbalance between the way our laws treat repeat child rapists and their civil liberties--I am referring to the dangerous sex offenders who belong to a special category of sex offenders; they are the worst of the worst; they have committed the most heinous crimes--and the civil liberties of their victims and their future victims. I know that the member for Toowoomba North likes to predict the future about what will happen in the High Court should a challenge go through with tougher laws. I would like him to consider also what would happen to future victims. If only he could be as certain about what will happen to future victims as he is about what will happen in the High Court. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078468"></A>
This is an imbalance that offends me and anyone who cares to examine the laws we have in place for dealing with repeat child rapists and dangerous sexual criminals. The imbalance has been brought about because of this government’s slavish devotion to a socialist, political ideology. This imbalance has been brought about because of Labor’s fixation on the civil rights of repeat child rapists and dangerous sex offenders while completely ignoring the civil rights of victims and future victims. If there was ever a social issue that highlights the cultural difference between the two sides of politics that we have in Queensland--socialism and, for want of a better word, liberalism--it is the issue of how a state and a community manages violent repeat child rapists and other officially classified dangerous sex offenders. This legislation before the parliament is proof that the Labor Party of Queensland has failed to protect children and women and other people from repeat child rapists and other officially classified dangerous sex offenders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078470"></A>
As other speakers have noted, this is the sixth time this legislation has been amended since it was first introduced in 2003. Each time the government has introduced amendments to this legislation it is, quite frankly, part of a large, very sophisticated public relations damage control exercise. The way this happens is an all too familiar story. The way it unfolds is that the government releases a dangerous sex offender back into the community in secret. That release then places women and children in danger. The media discovers the identity and location of the dangerous sex offender, breaks the news and naturally the mums and dads react with anger. They ask the question: how is it possible for a dangerous sex offender to be released in secret into our community, placing our children in danger? Surely it is not legal or moral for the government to be able to do that. That leads us back to the reason this bill is before the House--this expensive public relations exercise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078471"></A>
Many members have spoken about the provisions in this bill which allow exemptions to indefinite sentences. I ask this very important question: why do we have any exemptions from indefinite sentences for dangerous sex offenders? They are dangerous sex offenders--repeat child rapists who have committed heinous acts. There should not be any exemptions. There are checks and balances within the indefinite sentencing provisions to ensure that the right people are locked up indefinitely. For example, the court has to be satisfied that chapter 7, part 6 of the Mental Health Act does not apply. There are checks and balances there. However, the provision which states that the prosecution bears the onus of proving that the offender--already a dangerous sex offender--is a serious danger is completely wrong. That provision should be reversed. The dangerous sex offender should have to prove that he or she is not a danger to the community or to society. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078472"></A>
I know that many members opposite, especially the solicitors--there are many on the other side--will immediately say, ‘That is a reversal of the onus of proof. That impinges on someone’s basic civil liberty.’ I have two responses to that. What about the civil liberties of the future victims? What about the civil liberties of the people who have been impacted by these people’s behaviours? I also remind government members that they have already set a precedent of reversing the onus of proof--for example, people having to prove to the state that they are innocent when they are charged with a crime. We find that provision in our vegetation management laws. The landowners have to prove that they are not guilty of clearing trees when accused of that crime. If it is good enough for this state to force farmers to prove that they are innocent, then it is good enough for this state to force dangerous sex offenders to prove that they are not dangerous and thereby do not qualify for an indefinite sentence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Speakers have also talked about the monitoring of dangerous sex offenders. We talk about the concept of GPS monitoring versus electronic monitoring. The term ‘electronic monitoring’ is probably the biggest con that the government has ever perpetrated on the people of Queensland. The government uses this lovely term ‘electronic monitoring’ and says, ‘Don’t worry about those dangerous sex offenders. They are electronically monitored.’ Everyone goes, ‘Oh, I can breathe a sigh of relief. They are electronically monitored.’ Let us have a closer look at what electronic monitoring means in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078475"></A>
Electronic monitoring in Queensland is a bracelet worn by the offender. When an offender walks into their designated address or the place where they are supposed to stay, the bracelet sends a message through the telephone network to the powers that be that says, ‘I’m at home.’ Then when the sex offender leaves their residence and walks out, the bracelet sends a message back to the powers that be that are monitoring the sex offender that says, ‘I’m not at home.’ That is the extent of the electronic monitoring in Queensland--a device that effectively says, ‘I’m at home,’ or ‘I’m not at home.’ If we are going to get serious about tracking and monitoring dangerous sex offenders, whom this government allows into the community--we have already heard that there are a number of dangerous sex offenders who have disappeared; they have completely disappeared off the radar--then let us monitor and track them with state-of-the-art technology, which of course is GPS monitoring. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078476"></A>
I have a GPS monitor on me now. It is a called a telephone. This government loves GPS tracking when it comes to flying foxes, dolphins, turtles. All sorts of animals and weird and wonderful creatures are tracked using GPS monitoring. It is very accurate. But when it comes to dangerous sex offenders, they seem to be a protected species from GPS monitoring. The government needs to explain to the people of Queensland why it does not want to monitor these people with GPS. The government will come up with a whole heap of technical explanations. But, when you peel away the onion and get to the core, it comes down to the fact that this government wants to protect the civil liberties of dangerous sex offenders, because it is too much of an intrusion on their civil liberties for the dangerous sex offenders to be wearing GPS monitoring. It is not a matter of price. It is not a matter of technology. It purely comes down to a matter of political ideology. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078477"></A>
Many people would be shocked if they knew this. I ask this question and I hope the Attorney-General can answer it: why are dangerous sex offenders allowed access to motor vehicles? Why are they allowed to drive when they are allowed out of jail? I have personally seen them. Prison officers have taken photos and video footage of them that has been on TV to embarrass this government. How can they afford their registration when it is so expensive? How do they get licences? Why are they allowed to drive? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082592"></A>
Maybe the policy has been shut off, but certainly two or three years ago there were dangerous sex offenders driving around in motor vehicles. For most dangerous sex offenders, a motor vehicle is an opportunity to recommit the crimes that classified them as a dangerous sex offender in the first place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082594"></A>
We have heard about Hetty Johnston and other great advocates for children. I would like to bring to the attention of this House another great advocate. She is an advocate for Megan’s law and an advocate for the rights of children and protecting them from these sorts of people. Her name is Heather Steinberg and she has been following this debate. She used to be a police officer; in fact, she risked her job in the police force by running in the state election while she was still in the job as a police officer to stand up against these people and the laws protecting them. At a Carbrook rally, she handed a petition over with signatures wanting sex offender Dennis Ferguson out of her community to safeguard the children. She asked why the police are paid to protect sex offenders instead of safeguarding children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082598"></A>
Heather gave options whereby sex offenders could reside in communities where there is limited access to children and where everyone knows who they are so the people there are able to better monitor their children. Of course, she is talking about a Megan’s law provision--a provision that 200 million people in America seem to be able to live with. Heather asked why these sex offenders could not be housed on grounds at Wacol prison. The police minister at the time told her that she had looked into it but it could not be done, yet the police minister this year made that an option. Heather put to the then minister for police the fact that they could have created legislation before Ferguson was released from custody to avoid the Carbrook rally situation, but the former police minister was more concerned with the legislation being challenged on appeal to the High Court than with protecting children.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082599"></A>
During the election campaign Heather attended a public meeting held by her at Victoria Point, where it was suggested to her that all children from prep to year 12 could be educated while at school about sex offenders, how they target children and the protective behaviours. We have heard from other members about how we see practical examples of those children being targeted on chat sites and websites. The response from the police minister at the time was that she did not want her children to know about that, yet in studies done with sex offenders they have admitted that they target children who are vulnerable and easy to target. If we educate children on the issue, it makes them less vulnerable and a harder target for sex offenders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082602"></A>
But no-one in the government wants to look at education first and at trying to prevent the offence from occurring in the first place. The whole focus is on after the offence has been committed. Heather said that we should be working on educating our children against these offenders and reduce offences that way rather than always concentrating on what to do after the horse has bolted. We should have preventative measures rather than reactive measures because reactive measures do not help. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082603"></A>
In my opinion, sex offenders should be banned from living a minimum of 20 to 50 kilometres from schools, playgrounds and sport grounds. I also believe that Ferguson should never have been released and that Labor had the opportunity before he was released to create legislation that would have prevented his release but, in Judy Spence’s words, it would have been challenged in the High Court. We say that the challenge should have been brought on. What is more important--a legal challenge or children? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082604"></A>
The member for Toowoomba North’s argument is also along similar veins--that tougher laws, a Megan’s law, would be struck down in the High Court. He is certain that we would be wasting our time. The member for Toowoomba North is certain that our High Court would reject a Megan’s law and tougher sentencing for dangerous sex offenders, but I am just as certain that dangerous sex offenders, given the chance in our community, will reoffend and that we will not be wasting our time if we take a Megan’s law to the High Court. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082606"></A>
One of the first press releases I put out when I became an Independent was to say that the first legislation I would introduce into this place would be a Megan’s law. I reiterate that call and remind the House of that today. I believe that ordinary Queenslanders have the right to know whether a dangerous sex offender has been released from jail and has been allowed to live in their community in secret. We do not have that right now. We need to return that right. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082607"></A>
I asked the police minister a question. I wanted to know the number of dangerous sex offenders who have been allowed to relocate to the Burnett and Bundaberg region. His reply was--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1082610"></A>
I am advised it would not be appropriate to publicly disclose, even by region, the locations of these offenders. The Commissioner has determined that to do so would not be in the interest of the proper management of Reportable Offenders in accordance with the requirements of the Act. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082611"></A>
That is a wonderful reply! What about the parents who need the right to say, as I said at the beginning of my speech, ‘He’s a bad man. Stay away from him’? I remember the example of a mother whose children were being groomed by sex offenders at the Wacol train station. When she was informed that they were sex offenders--and dangerous sex offenders--she said, ‘All I wanted to be able to do was to tell my children to stay away from them.’ That is the best defence that parents have against these people. By introducing this legislation, the government is trying to make out that it is being tough on sex offenders; instead, it is misleading the people of Queensland and preventing parents from saying to their children, ‘He’s a bad man. Stay away from him.’ <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr DOWLING </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Redlands--LNP) (5.46 pm): Today I rise to contribute to the debate on the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. What an amazing piece of legislation! This legislation has been amended more than six times in seven years and it still demonstrates that Labor is soft on crime. It is still a flawed piece of legislation, with amendments still to come. The government should not have had six chops at such a fundamental piece of legislation. It should not have taken six chops at the legislation to provide sufficient flexibility to manage offenders or to provide the courts with the ability and the power to sentence appropriately and to make sure these offenders do not come out. Sexual offenders are the most despised creatures in our society. The paedophiles and the rapists revolt and sicken our community--every single member of the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082614"></A>
Those opposite will remember that my electorate was made quite famous, or infamous, by the actions of this government when it dropped a repeat serial paedophile into my community, into Carbrook. That paedophile was Dennis Ferguson. The community spoke long and loud at that rally. I have never seen such outrage in a community before or since. That is the passion that this issue and this type of criminal brings out in society, and quite rightly. It should not be allowed to continue. My community spoke out long and loud, as did residents of a number of other communities, as Dennis Ferguson was drummed out of community after community after community. Other Queensland towns felt threatened by the presence in their town of that particular creature.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082616"></A>
Queenslanders expect the government to protect them from predators like this, as they should. Queenslanders need to know that our authorities are empowered to take appropriate steps to protect our community. There are thousands of sex offenders unsupervised in our communities and they are poorly managed. That is one thing I took from that public rally which made my blood run cold. When a senior police officer was trying to calm the crowd’s concerns, she said, ‘You don’t need to worry about Dennis Ferguson. We’ve got about 50 officers guarding him so we know exactly where he is. It’s the other thousand in the community you don’t know about who you should be worried about.’ When that is the fallback position, something is fundamentally wrong, something is flawed. It ain’t working. No matter how we try to sugar-coat it and we stand here and posture and take a position one way or the other, clearly the government has let the community down. The government has let the state down. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082617"></A>
We talk about treatment, we talk about counselling, we talk about mediation and medication, we talk about castration, monitoring and GPS. They are all buzz words which are made and designed specifically so that this government can feel like it has actually done something or is doing something. They are designed to pacify the community so we actually think that something is being done when clearly things are not working.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082655"></A>
The background briefing prepared for this piece of legislation states that the bill ‘provides for the continued detention and supervision of certain serious sex offenders identified as posing an unacceptably high risk of committing further sex offences beyond the end of their term of imprisonment’. I would like to see the definition of ‘unacceptably high’. I would like to see the government of the day stand up and look into the eyes of someone who has been violated or a child whose innocence has been stolen and explain to them what is an acceptable risk. When does the risk become high enough to deserve intervention by the government? There is clearly no line in the sand that can be drawn in terms of acceptable risk. It is just a flawed strategy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082657"></A>
This piece of legislation has sat on the table here for one year and one day. One would think that the Attorney-General would have withdrawn the bill, redrafted it, got it right and put it back before us so that we could consider something that can actually be effective, can work and has all the bugs removed rather than think things up, go through the media cycle, get the spin but not think it through. That is clearly what is wrong here. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082659"></A>
For a change, the overriding principle needs to be that if there is a risk to the community from a dangerous sex offender then they should not be released. We need to actually side with the victim in this. We need to side with the people who are going to be the victims if and when it is gotten wrong. And it has been gotten wrong so many times. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082660"></A>
The minister’s second reading speech talks about extending detention beyond the sentence period and about imposing onerous conditions upon sex offenders. Clearly, those things do not work. They have not worked so far. What wondrous device does the Attorney-General have in mind this time that will see the slightest improvement? As at 25 June 2010 there were 79 released prisoners on supervision orders, 18 of whom had to be returned to custody for breaches of orders. That is a 25 per cent fail rate. That is tragic. </Hansard-Body>

Mr DOWLING:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection. That small handful has been caught. The other 75 per cent are still out there offending. And were they caught on the first offence? No, they were not. Seven offences is the strike rate before they get caught, as we heard from the member for Burnett and as was echoed by others in this chamber. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082664"></A>
These people are a subculture. They surrender all of the rights that are enjoyed by other people in our community when they prey on those most vulnerable--the children and the women who have been raped. Members of this House should look into the tear-filled eyes of a victim, listen to their heartfelt stories and understand the scarring that they live with, not just for the duration of the sentence but forever. They will take that scarring to their graves. There is nothing we can do to heal that. Nothing we can do or say will take that pain away. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082665"></A>
We have heard example after example of offenders who have reoffended. They have gotten through this ‘foolproof’ net that this government has presided over for most of the last 22 years. These offenders have gone unchecked. These offences continue. To hell with the offenders! We need to remember the voiceless victims--the children who have had their innocence stolen. They are the people we need to be standing up for. They are the people I represent and I am speaking for tonight. They are the ones whom every member of this House should be standing up for--those most vulnerable, not the offender. To hell with the offender!</Hansard-Body>

 Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank you for your protection. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082673"></A>
This type of offender does not show remorse. They are a very different creature. They have a habit, a pattern, an instinct. They continue to offend and they show no remorse whatsoever. They show an incredibly high rate of repeat offending. That kind of creature needs to be taken away from our law-abiding citizens. While I note that the orders can be extended beyond the five years, it is little and late. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082674"></A>
The perception in the community is that these offenders are out there. And do members know why there is that perception? It is because it is reality; they are out there. There are thousands and thousands of them and there are even more that go unreported. There are families who live with secrets that will never see the light of day. Let us consider the treatment they receive when they decide to step up and confront their demons and try to bring a case. They become victims again through the processes governments put in place through the court system. So they get done over completely and there is absolutely no support for them. It is all for the offender and precious little for the victim. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082677"></A>
I echo the comments of Bravehearts founder Hetty Johnston. She is reported as saying that the courts are inclined to release such offenders even if a psychiatric report assesses them as being at medium to high risk of reoffending. In letting out a paedophile to interfere with a child or a rapist to rape a woman, what level of risk is acceptable? I certainly do not find it acceptable that my daughter, my wife, any lady friend or any child or family that I know has to run that risk. It is unacceptable. But the courts continue to let these offenders out. It is a pattern of soft sentencing. It cannot be allowed to continue. </Hansard-Body>

 Thank you. The members for Gympie and Gaven gave an insightful address. It is just a shame that those opposite choose not to hear. It is a bit like the Premier’s listening tour, where she is out listening but not hearing. They are not hearing the community and understanding the community expectation. They have been listening but not hearing. Labor cannot deal with sex offenders. It really cannot. We actually need to get it right. We need to remember the victims in this--those victims who so often feel so powerless. They turn to self-harm because they feel worthless. They turn to crime and more often than not prostitution, again because they feel worthless. They turn to drugs.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1086912"></A>

Mr FOLEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maryborough--Ind) (6.02 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. It is something that I have thought about long and hard. Ultimately what we are talking about here is the level of punishment versus the level of liberty that must be allowed in our society. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086927"></A>
In traditional society punishment was simply the art form of obtaining retribution, rehabilitation, incapacitation and deterrence of those who have had or would forgo the set boundaries of social cohesion. As such, it sets out the minimum standard of morality that is expected and paves the way for future developments. Ideally, retribution exists around the notion that those who commit crime should experience some form of suffering for their negative actions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086928"></A>
In countries such as the United States, retribution has become the primary objective of the punishment whilst rehabilitation has become almost completely extinct. Even though it is listed as one of the purposes of sentencing within Australian legislation, research has questioned the ability of rehabilitation to achieve its goals. On the other hand, incapacitation can be contrasted to the likes of retribution as the severest form of punishment and at the same time protects the community by minimising the possibility of relapse on the criminal’s behalf for a specified period of time. There has been much debate about that specified period of time for rehabilitation in this House today when debating this bill. Deterrence exists in two different forms and is brought about by a combination of the aforementioned objectives of punishment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086929"></A>
In a number of Australian jurisdictions the concept of people getting their just deserts seems one of the governing purposes of punishment or indeed the primary principle of that punishment. This principle centres around the concept that punishment should be the consequence of criminal activity extracting justice, not so much as rehabilitation. The Australian Law Reform Commission, in an attempt to clarify the concept of just deserts, suggested that such factors as intent, premeditation, planning and methods be considered, inevitably setting sentence guidelines. The legislation in the ACT alone makes relevant the degree to which an offence was the result of provocation, duress and entrapment. We have seen some very high-profile cases about that in recent years in the media. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086931"></A>
Other factors that are taken into account when passing sentence include the degree of participation, the breach of trust, consequences and, of course, the impact on the victim and our society as a whole, youthfulness, vulnerability and the possibility that there existed unforeseeable circumstances. In cases where there exists prior convictions the courts will generally punish the offender more severely if the previous matter is of relevance to the current case. In Victoria, if the accused is of supposed good character and had contributed moderately to society in the past, the penalties imposed on them will be generally less severe unless the crime is one of common occurrence or they have been convicted on charges of drug trafficking. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086933"></A>
In cases involving the action of young offenders aged under 21, common law is explicit as to their sentencing being of a reformatory nature. The rationale for this principle is that the public interest is better served by seeking to avoid the damaging effect of imprisonment. The only instances in which a minor should be treated as an adult would be in cases of repeated offences or in areas where it is considered to be grave in nature such as murder, violence and rape. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086934"></A>
I say that to give some sort of background to a debate like this. I particularly want to focus my attention on the question of mental illness and when it is appropriate to release prisoners. When an individual’s state of mental health is in question the statutory guidelines specify that this should be considered as a relevant factor in sentencing as well as age and character because of the individual’s inability to fully comprehend neither their actions nor their responsibilities to others. In cases such as this, the factor of deterrence proves to be ineffective and simplistic because we cannot scare mentally ill individuals into compliance because they cannot comprehend it. Therefore, sentencing should only aspire to control the accused and not be wasted on anything more. As to the severity of the punishment, it is often a degree more lenient in these instances because of the lack of comprehension factor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

I believe when looking at these very significant issues that so often the people who perpetrate these heinous and hideous crimes are in some respects victims of their own circumstance. Perhaps it is mental illness. I will look at one mental illness which is called antisocial personality disorder. It is a type of chronic mental illness in which one’s ways of thinking, perceiving situations and relating to others are dysfunctional. When one has antisocial personality disorder--and this is the bit I want to really focus on--one typically has no regard for right or wrong. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1086938"></A>
For moderate and reasonable members of society we might say, ‘Boy, people should realise that that is just wrong.’ But to a person who is suffering from a psychiatric disorder, such as antisocial personality disorder, the lines are completely blurred and the normal way of thinking just does not exist. A person like that may often violate the law and rights of others, landing themselves in frequent trouble or conflict. They may lie, behave violently, have drug and alcohol problems and not be able to fulfil their responsibilities in society. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086941"></A>
Antisocial personality disorder is sometimes know as sociopathic personality disorder. This is the Mayo Clinic’s definition. It is sometimes referred to as psychopathy. Most researchers believe that antisocial personality disorder and sociopathic personality are different conditions. Some of the symptoms may include a complete disregard for right and wrong, persistent lying or deceit, or using charm or wit to manipulate others. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086974"></A>
Some members have mentioned Task Force Argos, and it could be said that it is using those same types of tactics to charm or manipulate paedophiles into making connections that inevitably see them incarcerated. These people have recurring difficulties with the law. They repeatedly violate the rights of others. They are often involved in child abuse or child neglect and intimidation of others. I could go on for a long time, because this is really talking about the whole concept of nature versus nurture. Are these criminals repeat offenders because of inherited tendencies or genetic predispositions, or are these people serial offenders who need to be locked up because of environment or life situations? I would tend to say that it is probably a combination of the two.</Hansard-Body>

When it comes to sentencing in Australia, politics and the separation of powers between the judiciary and the parliament is a very interesting and much talked about proposition. At the Judicial Conference of Australia in Adelaide in 2004, Justice Murray Gleeson talking about political criticism said this--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086979"></A>
Political criticism of sentencing is almost always aimed at suggested inadequacy. Criticising sentencing judges for being soft on crime is popular. I can think of only one case recently in which politicians across the political spectrum criticised a sentence for its severity. <Hansard-Italic>
Mirabile dictu</Hansard-Italic>
, the sentence was imposed--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1086981"></A>
ironically--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086982"></A>
on a politician who had been convicted of an electoral offence. The conviction was quashed on appeal, so the sentence was never the subject of appellant review.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086983"></A>
What would need to be taken seriously would be a plausible charge that there is a systemic failure of sentencing principles and practice to reflect community attitudes to crime and punishment. No one believes that judges should decide cases--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1086984"></A>
and I say this very clearly--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086985"></A>
by responding to the roar of the crowd ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1086987"></A>
Because the roar of the crowd can sometimes end up being a complete lynch mob mentality and lack any cogent thinking. He continues--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086989"></A>
Even so, the ultimate discretion, and therefore the ultimate responsibility, is usually with the judiciary.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1086990"></A>
I have to say that I would hate to be a judge. I would hate to sit in judgement because of the multilayered and complex nature of sentencing.</Hansard-Body-Continued>

<A ID="pgfId-1086991"></A>
It is my personal belief that a change in human behaviour will only come about with a change of heart--a person who has a transformative experience and starts to understand what they have done. Hetty Johnston has been talked about a lot in this chamber, and I admire her work with Bravehearts. It is very understandable why Hetty Johnston and other people in our community are advocates of the whole two strikes and you are out principle. Community expectations are that significant sentences need to be handed down when there are significant crimes. The housing of a dangerous prisoner and then releasing them into the community is something that is an issue for me because of the closeness of the Maryborough Correctional Centre. We need an increased use of technology, and I applaud any use of technology that makes the job easier and more thorough because the community at large has a right to expect safety when its members are going about their everyday business.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086995"></A>
A person who has been brutalised by one of these sometimes less than human perpetrators receives a life sentence that is not of their own making. As a father of four daughters and two sons, I just cannot imagine how I would feel if one of my girls or one of my boys was brutalised by a criminal in that way. That is something that is never forgotten. It is a life sentence that is, again, not of their own making. I believe the internet is somewhat to blame, because if as parents we allow unfettered use of the internet in our homes we are courting disaster. After talking to my own teenagers, some of the things that are looked at and said and done by some of our young people are very alarming. I had a very involved discussion with my teenagers last weekend about the concept of sexting--that is, where young boys might coerce girls to take a photo of themselves naked or seminaked and send it to them. More often than not, that then gets passed around to all of the other blokes and the girl has to live with the embarrassment of that for the rest of her life. It then finds its way to the internet and goes viral and causes all of those sorts of problems.</Hansard-Body>

When I was a kid there was just nothing available like that. We did not have mobile phones. We did not have computers where you could shut the door of your bedroom and look at all sorts of hideousness that just seems to be getting worse and worse. Maybe I live in an ivory tower, but some of the things that I am told exist on the internet are just absolutely astounding. I do not understand why anyone would look, for instance, at bestiality or sites like that. The nature of that sexual perversion is that the more they feed it--it is like throwing petrol on a fire--the hotter the issue becomes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087004"></A>
Task Force Argos does a magnificent job. There are civil libertarians who might whinge that Task Force Argos is simply using entrapment and therefore it is not a relevant thing. But I have to tell you: if there are paedophiles out there who are trawling the internet trying to set up sexual relationships with kids, we should throw the book at them. I absolutely 100 per cent support Task Force Argos and the work it is doing, because if we can identify especially the early paedophile behaviour and get people treated and seen to then hopefully that might save some terribly traumatic events for people in society. The member for Gaven talked about Ray Garland. I remember the first time I ever read Ray Garland’s hideous menu of crimes that he has committed. My first sense was a sense of disbelief. It was almost like I was reading something that was just a made-up story. In terms of the number and the nature of crimes that he committed, there is a sense of disbelief that a person--one human being--could inflict that kind of evil and violence on another person.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087010"></A>
Sometimes the dangerous prisoners themselves are quite open about the fact that if they are released they will reoffend. They know it too well. I have had conversations with the Attorney-General, Cameron Dick, about the supervisory period--one area that seems to be a sticking point with this bill. That is now extended to a minimum of five years with no maximum, and the Attorney-General has told me that he can make further application at the cessation of that supervisory period to extend the supervisory period again. Anything that strengthens the hand of keeping these dangerous prisoners off the streets is something that I would applaud. I have to say that, technically, I have not looked at the whole bill but have had a bit of a look through things as they are.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1087013"></A>
The perpetrators are not only perpetrators but also victims--victims of inadequate parenting and victims of violence inflicted on them as a child, some with genetic predisposition. Either way, they exist in a world of altered reality. I must say that as a person I would like to have some compassion. I feel very sorry for these people who have been so damaged by life that they have turned into almost inhumane monsters, but let me say clearly that I feel more sorry for their victims. No-one in our society should ever have to go through the trauma of being raped or brutalised by someone who has no concept of right and wrong, and I have to say that I am always deeply troubled when I hear about sexual offenders who do not complete any therapy program and who are released back on the streets.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091394"></A>
I would like to see--and I know that there are problems constitutionally with this--dangerous prisoners who do not complete rehabilitation stay locked up. If they complete a suitable rehabilitation program and are deemed to be safe to be released back into the community by a psychiatrist, then if they are released and they reoffend they should be locked up indefinitely. People should have the right to walk the streets confident that ‘rehabilitated’ prisoners are not going to exact violence on anyone else.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091395"></A>
May I humbly suggest to the House that the reason a sexual offender fails to complete their rehabilitation program is that they will often believe that they have not done anything wrong. For instance, a person with a severe personality disorder has such an altered sense of reality in their life that they simply have no concept of right and wrong. That is a strong philosophical position that I take, but it is also a position that then leaves me wondering, ‘What is appropriate? Do we ever let that person back out on the streets?’ I think we need to address that question more than any other question. We cannot have extreme sympathy for the perpetrators that is greater than our extreme sympathy for the victims. My heart breaks when I think of some of the things that people have been through to land them in the situation where they have exacted that level of violence on other people. But as I have said before, my absolute heartfelt sympathy goes out to the people who have been victims of such vicious crimes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091396"></A>
I have said before that I would hate to be a member of the judiciary. I would also hate to be an Attorney-General and have to bring in legislation such as this, which some would feel does not go far enough and others would feel goes too far. At the end of the day, I think that unless dangerous prisoners complete rehabilitation, they should not be allowed out to ply their trade on innocent victims. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (6.21 pm): I wish to say a few words in support of this bill. Firstly, I will provide a little bit of background information to the House and then talk about some of the provisions that are contained in the bill. Then, finally, I will respond to some of the tripe, some of the absolutely rubbish, that has been spoken by a number of members opposite during this debate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091399"></A>
The first important point to note is that it was the Labor government that introduced what was seen as landmark dangerous prisoner legislation for sexual offenders in this state in 2003. As has been pointed out here, for the first time that legislation provided the opportunity for the court to keep those high-risk offenders in jail and, for those who were deemed able to be released into the community, for the courts to impose significant supervision orders on them with a number of conditions. Those orders, in effect, make these people virtual prisoners in the community. I will talk a little bit more about that in a moment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091400"></A>
Since the enactment of the act, to date 97 offenders have had supervision orders made against them. Currently, 39 offenders are in prison on continuing detention orders and 58 are supervised in the community. I point out to members that I have looked at many of the lists of conditions that have been imposed by the courts. Some of them have 40 or 50 conditions. They are very stringent as to what these people can or cannot do in the community. Some of the typical conditions are curfews; electronic monitoring to obviously monitor those curfews; restrictions on where they can go in terms of parks, schools, shopping centres et cetera; who they can associate with; what accommodation they can live in; where they live; workplaces et cetera; drug and alcohol restrictions; the need to advise of any relationships that are formed; employment that is proposed; the need to attend counselling and rehabilitation programs, and on it goes. As I have indicated, these conditions are very stringent and, in a sense, make these people virtually prisoners in the community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091402"></A>
Queensland Corrective Services takes its responsibility very seriously. Some of the activities that QCS engages in are, obviously, the application of electronic monitoring and following up whenever there is a breach, random visits to homes and workplaces, drug and alcohol testing, the requirement for offenders to report to officers regularly and the surveillance that takes place. A number of members have spoken about the disclosure of information about offenders. Queensland Corrective Services undertake targeted disclosure in appropriate circumstances to neighbours, to employers, and if an individual is seen to have formed a relationship with a person who might have children, for example, that information can be proactively released to those people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091404"></A>
The Queensland Corrective Services High Risk Offender Management Unit has the core responsibility of oversighting the management of DPSOA offenders. They are a very professional and dedicated team who are absolutely committed to this exceptionally important task. I have met with these people on a number of occasions. They take their responsibilities very seriously and they do an excellent job. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091406"></A>
Since 2003, Queensland Corrective Services has undertaken a range of activities. For example, it has undertaken more than 11,000 drug and alcohol tests on DPSOA offenders, more than 19,950 office and home visits, more than 16,400 collateral checks on what those offenders are up to and more than 8,500 telephone checks. So, hopefully, the information that I am providing demonstrates that this is a matter that is taken exceptionally seriously by Queensland Corrective Services and it puts in the resources to monitor these offenders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091408"></A>
Some of the key provisions in the bill have been outlined by a number of speakers, so I will not go into a lot of the detail of them. But the important amendments that are coming through today include a minimum of a five-year supervision order. The amendments recognise that the first five years out from a prisoner’s release from detention is the highest risk. That is why the majority of resources can be focused in that particular area. Previously, the minimum length of an order was at the court’s discretion. Under the proposed amendments there is a minimum of five years and there is no maximum limit. So the courts still have the option to impose a longer term if required. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091409"></A>
The bill enables the Attorney-General to apply for a further period of supervision. That would apply particularly to those offenders who fail to comply or demonstrate high-risk behaviours. As I have indicated, if an order has been given there is an ability to re-apply beyond that for a five-year period or longer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091410"></A>
The bill makes specific provision for Queensland Corrective Services to submit information about the suitability of a person for supervision into the court. That will ensure that the court is properly informed about the suitability of those offenders or the practicality of QCS providing that supervision. The bill requires the court to give proper weight to that capacity. There are provisions there regarding indefinite sentencing and I think that has been covered quite significantly as well. The bill also gives Queensland Corrective Services officers additional powers to give supervised offenders directions about their accommodation, rehabilitation programs and drugs and alcohol. Offenders who fail to comply with those directions risk being returned to jail for breaching their order. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091411"></A>
One of the key issues about these laws is their constitutionality. The member for Maryborough raised this issue and I think other members raised it. The important point to note is that these laws have already been challenged in the High Court, because they are at the edge of constitutionality. They are right up there at the limit of what courts, and indeed governments, can impose on offenders. The challenge was successfully defended and we stand by the strength of these laws. One of the important factors that governments, and indeed anyone who proposes amendments to these laws, need to take into account is that if you take it too far, they will be struck down. So we are trying to strike a very fine balance here where we are right up against the limits of constitutionality and we look wherever we can to strengthen them, but the day that we step over that line and they are struck down in the courts will be a tragic day for these laws not only in Queensland but also in other parts of the country. Once they are struck down, we are back to the days of the National Party when it was in government and you could not do anything about keeping these high-risk offenders in jail. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091412"></A>
Recently, the United Nations criticised these laws. I stand by the laws that we have in place. They have been criticised because they breach United Nations conventions. The United Nations believe that they are too tough. We stand by these laws and, as I have indicated, we will look for opportunities to strengthen them at every opportunity. We make no apology for the tough approach that we take to managing sex offenders in the community. </Hansard-Body>

Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Prior to the break I was talking about quite a significant issue in relation to these laws. I talked about the issue of constitutionality and the fact that the laws as they currently stand take the constitutionality issue right up to the limit. Therefore it is important, whenever we look at opportunities to strengthen them, that we bear that in mind. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095739"></A>
Going at this issue like a bull at a gate, as have the members of the opposition, is placing these laws in jeopardy. I think that is a key point that needs to be recognised here in this debate. If anyone wants to have a sensible debate about these issues they have to talk about the risk that would be placed on these laws should the opposition ever get its way and put in place some of the ludicrous amendments that they have proposed. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Some of the issues that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been proposing in the community, such as locking people up and throwing away the keys. We would all like to do that but we have courts in this country that make judgements about when people should be released from jail. That is the way the system works and it has worked for a long time. There is a simple fact that we have to put on the record: the members for Southern Downs, Warrego and Toowoomba South sat around the cabinet table while sex offenders walked free. There was no supervision or monitoring. They were able to join whatever clubs they wanted to and to work wherever they wanted to. They were able to associate with children freely. This was the legacy left by the members for Southern Downs and Toowoomba South and their colleagues when they were in government. They did nothing about this issue that they stand up and thump their chest about now. They did nothing when they had the opportunity. They talk tough about crime, as they do all the time, and they did nothing when they were sitting around the cabinet table and they had the opportunity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095742"></A>
As I and many other speakers on this side of the House have outlined, we have broken new ground here. We do keep the high-risk offenders in jail. The Attorney-General argues to keep them in jail. Where the court determines that they can be released, they will be released under very tough supervision. The Labor government implemented national laws for other child sex offenders who do not fit into the category--they are all dangerous, but those who are not caught by the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act--to report regularly to the police on a range of matters. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095743"></A>
I particularly listened to the contribution of the member for Southern Downs on this matter. I listened to a few of the others, but particularly that of the member for Southern Downs as the shadow Attorney-General. He was taking the high moral ground about what should and should not happen with respect to these sex offenders. I have a simple message for the member for Southern Downs: you are a two-faced hypocrite on this issue.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The member for Southern Downs is a Johnny-come-lately to this issue. He is thumping his chest now about what should and should not happen to sex offenders. He and his colleagues--let us go through the list: the members for Gregory, Toowoomba South, Warrego, backed up by the shadow ministers now, Mirani and Maroochydore; about a third of the National Party cabinet who sit across those benches now--sat on their hands and did nothing about sex offenders. They now claim the high moral high. They had an opportunity when they were in government and they did absolutely nothing. About a third of them are still in this parliament. They have the hide to stand up here and claim the high moral ground on an issue where they let offenders go free and join the clubs that they wanted to, the scout groups and the local gym clubs. That is the record of those opposite. That is the legacy that they left the Labor government and we have had to fix up. They talk tough about what they would like to do now. We know that if some of the proposals that they are talking about in the community were put into place these laws would be struck down by the High Court and we would have nothing. That is the record of this government. Those opposite talk tough but as usual never deliver through actions. As we have talked about many times in this chamber, they are all talk and no action when it comes to law and order issues, particularly this issue relating to dangerous sex offenders.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (7.35 pm), in reply: At the outset I want to thank all honourable members for their contributions on this important bill, the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. I thank my colleagues on the government benches for their support. This bill is the outcome of a thorough review of Queensland’s public protection legislation involving the indefinite sentencing regime within the Penalties and Sentences Act, and the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act. These two regimes are a vital part of the suite of Queensland legislation aimed at protecting the community from dangerous sexual and violent offenders. The bill amends the Penalties and Sentences Act and the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act to further enhance the effectiveness of these regimes. The Penalties and Sentences Act is amended to greatly expand the range of offences for which an indefinite jail sentence can be imposed by Queensland courts. The amendments enable judges to impose indefinite sentences for many more crimes, including torture, incest, maintaining a sexual relationship with a child and indecent treatment of a child under 16 years of age. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095748"></A>
Currently, indefinite sentences can only be imposed for certain violent and sex offences that carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Not one member of the opposition spoke on the expansion of the protective regime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177676"></A>
Further, the amendments ensure that where an offender has the indefinite sentence converted to a finite sentence by the court at the mandatory review, such an offender will be under the authority of the Queensland Parole Board and the supervision of an authorised corrective services officer for at least five years upon their release from prison, even when released at the end of their sentence expiry date. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095749"></A>
The Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act is significantly amended to require the court, when considering whether to impose a supervision order, to consider not only the need to ensure the adequate protection of the community but also whether the adequate protection of the community can be reasonably and practicably managed by a supervision order, and whether any appropriate conditions of the supervision order can be reasonably and practicably managed by corrective services officers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1178832"></A>
The bill also provides corrective services officers with the power to issue binding directions to released prisoners in relation to where they are to live, the requirement to engage in treatment and restrictions in relation to alcohol and other substance abuse. This enhances the ability of Corrective Services to supervise released prisoners without necessitating a return to court for an application to amend the conditions of a released prisoner’s supervision order. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1178833"></A>
Having circulated a number of proposed amendments, members would be aware of my intention to move a number of amendments to the bill during its consideration in detail. Most of these amendments are drafting amendments that are aimed at ensuring that all provisions of the bill are free from ambiguity. However, I will be moving an amendment to the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act to recognise that the first five years of a prisoner’s release from detention is the highest risk period in terms of re-offending. I will speak to the evidence in support of that later in my address to the parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095752"></A>
I propose to omit the provision in the bill which imposes a five-year cap on supervision orders and in lieu insert a provision which imposes a minimum mandatory period of five years for supervision orders. The rationale behind the five-year cap is that the absence of a limit on the length of supervision orders may encourage the release of high-risk sex offenders on the basis that they will be monitored for very lengthy periods. The amendment to limit the length of a supervision order to five years was intended to signal to the judiciary that where a five-year supervision order is not sufficient to address the risk proposed by an offender, a detention order should be considered as the preferred option. Research suggests that the first five years of a prisoner’s release from prison is the highest risk period. However, a review of supervision orders imposed over the last 12 months since the introduction of the bill reveals that the court is not imposing the very lengthy periods that were imposed in the early years of the operation of the act and are generally imposed for a period of 10 years. However, I am still concerned to ensure that the community is protected from dangerous sex offenders, something that has been a hallmark of Labor governments, particularly in the first five years of an offender’s release. Therefore, I will move an amendment to the bill to omit the clause which caps supervision at five years and in its place provide a mandatory minimum period of five years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095753"></A>
Consequential to this I will also move an amendment to the provisions in the bill that provide for the making of further supervision orders so that a released prisoner is liable to only one further supervision order in relation to a current supervision order. This is again an expansion of the regime that currently exists in Queensland. The amendments that I shall move in consideration in detail ensure that further supervision can be applied for in the circumstances where a released prisoner is nearing the expiry of their supervision order and still poses a serious danger to the community. The court is unfettered in setting the period of any such order. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099997"></A>
I now turn to issues raised during the course of the debate. The member for Southern Downs indulged himself in an unsurprisingly confused dissertation that only occasionally addressed either history, reality or the bill itself. Among the most amazing sentiments expressed by the honourable member was his dismissal of the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992, blaming it for any and all issues he perceives as being wrong in the criminal justice system. He ignored, of course, that this was an act that he and the rest of the Nationals and Liberals supported in 1992. But the courts, the legal profession and the Queensland public should now be on notice that the LNP have it on the reassessment list. It is another thing they will be ‘reassessing’. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099998"></A>
What is their form? They talk long and hard about law and order. We have heard the Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services skewer those opposite in relation to their hypocrisy. We know that five years after the introduction of that bill, they sat on the government benches, and did nothing of any substance to reform the Penalties and Sentences Act. Nor did they do anything to protect the community against dangerous and recidivist sexual offenders. Their history speaks loud and large about what they would do if they were ever returned to government.</Hansard-Body>

The member for Southern Downs expressed his disdain for the established principles of sentencing, in detail. Then he raised the bar a further notch, with the member saying that he would put offenders in prison and ‘throw away the key’. This is the challenge I make today. They speak long and hard in relation to criminal punishment as distinct from a protective regime that exists under the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act. In relation to criminal punishment, I ask them firstly: what constitutional advice do they have from a Queen’s Counsel or a Senior Counsel anywhere in this nation that says such a sentencing principle is valid under the Constitution? Have they sought legal advice? The sound from the opposition benches is deafening. I challenge them to table the legal advice they have that says indefinite sentencing is lawful in this state and lawful in this nation in relation to criminal punishment. I challenge them to come into this parliament and table the constitutional advice they have. They purport to be an alternative government. They have to act within the laws of this nation. </Hansard-Body>

We know historically that the Constitution of the Commonwealth, the High Court of Australia, the Queensland Supreme Court and other judicial bodies have meant very little to the National Party. We know that. But we ask them to come into this place and explain their public policy which is, in the words of the member for Gregory, that people are to be thrown into the bowels of jails and kept there and, in the words of the member for Southern Downs, they are to be put in jail and the key thrown away. I want to know, as do all members on this side of the House and all right-thinking Queenslanders, what is the basis for their public policy at law? He is the shadow Attorney-General of this state. It is incumbent upon him to demonstrate the lawfulness of their policy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100008"></A>
For a man who asserts to be the alternative Attorney-General of Queensland, this is an extraordinary statement, to say that people should be sent to prison and ‘the key thrown away’. I can appreciate statements made in the heat of the moment but, as the Attorney-General of Queensland, I would suggest that there are principles of justice and principles of law that need to be adhered to. The DPSOA legislation operates at the limits of constitutionality. We know that. It has been tried and tested before the highest court of this nation, the High Court of Australia. It offers the community the highest level of protection possible within the scope of constitutional and legislative boundaries available in this nation. But the LNP would throw that all out and throw it all away. As I have said, the Constitution of the Commonwealth, the High Court of Australia, the Queensland Supreme Court and other judicial bodies have historically meant very little to the National Party. </Hansard-Body>

 I take the interjection. What has that got to do with anything in relation to the protection of Queenslanders? We know that when they were last in power in the mid-1990s they let dangerous sexual predators roam the streets free in our state. They did nothing to protect the community, and they come into this House and presume to lecture us, presume to lecture the government, about how our system has failed to protect Queenslanders. Under the Liberal National Party these laws would be destroyed. They would be destroyed by the Liberal National Party in their craven pursuit of populist measures. </Hansard-Body>

The honourable member for Southern Downs was not finished. He did not stop there. He kept going. He then attempted to verbal the Labor government and suggested that we do not trust the courts and that is why we needed the dangerous prisoners legislation. The breadth of his hypocrisy in saying that we do not trust the courts is frankly disgraceful. These are statements from the LNP, a party that would excise the jurisdiction of the courts from the criminal justice system. This from a member and a side of politics that never had the courage, the integrity nor the policy rigor to address serious sexual offending during their time government. They support the legislation on the one hand when they are out in public or when they need something to fall back on and then carp and complain that we spend too much time paying attention to it, amending it and making sure that it is strong and protecting Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100020"></A>
The audacity of the member for Southern Downs, the member for Burnett and others in suggesting that the amendments that have been made to this legislation over time are somehow representative of it being deficient is simply ridiculous and breathtaking.

Law reform is the business of this House. Legislative change is the nature of this chamber. Let us look at the Criminal Code of Queensland. It has been amended and reprinted more than 60 times since 1993. Is this evidence of the collapse of criminal law in Queensland? Is this evidence of the failure of the Criminal Code in Queensland? Of course it is not. It is evidence of a responsive government, refining and reforming the law, ensuring the law remains modern, dynamic and in touch with the community. </Hansard-Body>

We make no apologies for doing all of these things because at the heart of this legislation, at the heart of the amendments and at the heart of the Bligh government’s approach to law and order is a commitment to community safety. </Hansard-Body>

The member for Southern Downs, the member for Buderim and others opposite all criticised the fact that this bill has been on the <Hansard-Italic>

 for a year--a year in which the LNP has proposed not a single policy on dangerous sexual offenders legislation; a year in which the LNP voted with bikies, voted with organised criminal gangs, to try to defeat the Criminal Organisation Bill when it came into this House--</Hansard-Body>

Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Exactly. I take the interjection from the member for Toowoomba North. We know who the friends of the opposition are. A year after which the LNP now refuses to support amendments to strengthen the dangerous prisoners legislation in Queensland. In short, it has been a typical year under the LNP. What we have said with our Criminal Organisation Act is that bikies and organised criminals are not welcome in this state. We do not put out the welcome mat to them. That legislative measure is a very strong measure to send the signal to organised crime and to bikies that they are not welcome in Queensland. What did we hear from the member for Gaven last night in his speech supporting mandatory sentencing in Queensland? He talked at length about the number of bikies and organised criminal bikie gangs in his electorate. Yet he voted against the Criminal Organisation Act. So in 24 hours their position changes--typical of the LNP. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100029"></A>
The member for Mudgeeraba sought to continue the LNP misapprehension that Labor governments are somehow soft on crime, despite the glaring evidence to the contrary. For the assistance of the honourable member and all members opposite, I will provide her and other members with some information on law and order under the Bligh government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177679"></A>
Police to population numbers are now above the national average and crime rates have dropped significantly in the past 10 years. The Queensland ratio is one police officer for every 430 people. The national average is one police officer for 440 people. So Queensland is better than the national average. In the past 10 years under Labor, the crime rate has dropped by 21.5 per cent, property offences are down by 42.5 per cent, and offences against the person are down by 18.7 per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100030"></A>
When the LNP was last in power, the number of police in Queensland was 6,833. Under Labor today, we have 10,400 serving police officers in our state and rising--another 200 or more were allocated in budgetary funding this year. The Labor government is tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime. That is why we seek to attack the most closed, dangerous criminal organisations in Queensland including outlaw bikie gangs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104475"></A>
Queensland courts handle more criminal cases than any other jurisdiction in the country. We also send people to prison at a higher rate than the national average and higher than the world average, but these facts are never mentioned by the LNP members because it does not fit the myth they wish to perpetuate in the community that Labor is soft on crime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104476"></A>
Let us look at one fact. Victoria has about one million more people living in it than Queensland, yet we have more people in Queensland jails. We have the third highest rate of imprisonment for serious crime in the nation behind New South Wales and the Northern Territory, but will we hear that from LNP members? No, they would rather continue the misperception about crime and frighten and disturb Queenslanders because that fits into their modus operandi. That is how they wish to sneak back into the government, and we know that is their target. We know that is what they want to do--sneak back into government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104477"></A>
We are going to hold them to the light. We are going to let Queenslanders know where they stand on law and order and community safety. I ask honourable members this question: are all of these studies and all of this information, data and research wrong, or is it that the member for Mudgeeraba and all the other members of the LNP are simply trying to perpetuate a plain and simple untruth? I think the answer is clear. That is precisely what they are trying to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104479"></A>
In his contribution, the member for Kawana once again stood resolute as an example of the inability of the LNP to maintain a principled position for more than 24 hours. Only last night, the LNP attempted to fetter judicial discretion and introduce a mandatory sentencing regime, but is that his attitude today? No, of course it is not. We have a different bill, a different debate, a different belief, a different position. It only took 24 hours for him to change. Today, the member for Kawana has done an LNP backflip of extraordinary proportions and stated 24 hours after supporting mandatory sentencing that ‘each offender is different to the next’ and that ‘judicial discretion is paramount’. What a display. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104481"></A>
The member for Mudgeeraba was not satisfied with that view of the judiciary either and on behalf of the LNP proceeded to assault the judiciary as being comprised of judges who are political appointments and soft on crime. That is what the member for Mudgeeraba did today when she came into the parliament and spoke on this bill. Does the LNP have an example of those judges? That is what I want to know. It is easy to come into this place and cast aspersions on people who do not serve in this parliament, on people outside in the community. It is easy to say one thing but it is very difficult to follow it up. I want to know whether the LNP members will publicly state which judges they believe are soft on crime. Will they have the strength of their convictions to follow up on that slur on the judiciary in Queensland? Will they do that? They do not have the courage of their convictions. They will not have the courage to do that. I challenge the LNP members to stand by their views as stated by the member for Mudgeeraba and name which judges they believe are not serving the public, which judges they disagree with and what they are going to do about it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104484"></A>
This was a shameful attack upon the judiciary. It is entirely typical of the desire of LNP members to remove judges from the decision-making process, as demonstrated last night by their bill to introduce mandatory sentencing in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177681"></A>
I would like to place on the record my support for the hardworking judicial officers who serve our state each and every day in courts sitting in many and varied places around our state. These are men and women who hear difficult cases and make difficult decisions. There are decisions from time to time with which I disagree, but those cases are for the appeals process to determine and not for politicians to use the comfort of this chamber to make unsubstantiated and unfounded remarks upon. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104487"></A>
The member for Southern Downs raised concerns about the number of breaches of supervision. I can inform the House that since the introduction of the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003 a total of 44 offenders have been returned to the Supreme Court for formal contravention proceedings. As a result of Queensland Corrective Services returning an offender to the Supreme Court for contravening their order conditions, the supervision orders have been cancelled with the offenders held in custody on continuing detention orders or supervision orders have been strengthened with additional tough conditions. We heard the member for Redlands talking about that. We heard the member for Redlands talking about breaches, but he did not talk about the nature of breaches, he did not talk about the consequence of breaches, he did not talk about what occurred after the breaches. Again, this was another distortion of the facts.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104491"></A>
It should be noted that, while no contravention is dismissed, the most common types of contravention committed while under a supervision order, in order of frequency, are drug and alcohol use or related breaches--so if there is a breach of the order, they are back before the Supreme Court, back in the system--followed by tampering with electronic monitoring and curfew breaches. These are strict supervision orders and the community expects those individuals under supervision to comply with them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104492"></A>
But it is not as though these individuals are carrying out criminal acts while on supervision. We know the most likely reason for breaches are: firstly, drug and alcohol use, which for many is a trigger for criminal behaviour; secondly, tampering with electronic monitoring; and, thirdly, not obeying a curfew. This is a system that is working. When people are breaching these supervision orders, they are being caught and they are being brought back into the system and put before the court again. Since 2003, six offenders have been charged with further sexual offences, one offender was acquitted and the remaining five offenders are still detained in custody. But we did not hear that from the LNP. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104493"></A>
The member for Buderim said that he was ‘disappointed’ with the bill and said that we could do better, but of course he had no policy suggestions, no ideas and nothing of substance to contribute to improve the system of protecting Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1177680"></A>
I want to thank the member for Gladstone for her thoughtful contribution on the bill. The member for Gladstone questioned why there was a limit of five years on a supervision order. This will not be the case when the amendments are moved when we are in consideration in detail. The amendments to the bill clearly state that the court must in fact impose a minimum order of five years supervision, and there is no limit on the length of time this order can be made for. There is a further ability to renew the order if, at the expiration of the order, the person requires further supervision. The member for Gladstone further asked why the review period was changed from one year to two years. I can inform the honourable member that this change only applies to prisoners on continuing detention orders and not to supervision order prisoners. Prisoners on continuing detention are in custody and their first review will be after two years, with all subsequent reviews to be on an annual basis.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104494"></A>
The member for Aspley sought to use the statistics reported by the Victorian Sentencing Advisory Council in its 2007 research paper into recidivism. While statistics are useful, it is more useful to read them correctly and report them in context. I know this is difficult for the LNP. At page 28 of the paper, there is a report into sexual recidivism rates across time--namely five, 10 and 15 years. The aggregate average recidivism rates reported are 14 per cent, 20 per cent and 24 per cent respectively. The member for Aspley seemed to seek to use these figures to demonstrate that a minimum of five years was too low and that the high risk period was in fact at 15 years, where a higher proportion of offenders had reoffended. Such a submission to the parliament, such a contention, misrepresents the data in the report. The figures are cumulative, and thus the data shows that within the first five years an average of 14 per cent of offenders studied reoffended. In the next five years, a further six per cent reoffended, while in the next five years only a further four per cent reoffended. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104495"></A>
For the assistance of the member, I can inform the House that the validation study for what is regarded as being the best sexual reoffending risk assessment tool--known as the Static-99--showed that on average, for all sexual offenders, most sexual reoffending occurred in the first five years, with 18 per cent of offenders sexually reoffending in that period. An additional four per cent of offenders--making a total of 22 per cent--reoffended in the next five years. By 15 years, a further four per cent of offenders had sexually reoffended. So the reality is that it is the first five years where the rate of sexual reoffending is most likely to occur. That is why this government is moving through the parliament a minimum period of five years for a supervision order. That is very important to ensure we protect the community. As I said, the period in which the highest level of reoffending takes place is within the first five years, and that is the period that requires the highest level of supervision.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104496"></A>
In some ways, the debate tonight was not particularly edifying, regrettably. The opposition did not engage with the substance of the bill. This is a strong measure to continue our reform of the law to protect the Queensland community. This is legislation that has been upheld by the High Court. It is a Labor initiative. It is a strong legislative measure that the Labor government has moved and continues to amend to ensure that it remains the strongest and most effective protection regime in the nation. </Hansard-Body>

In conclusion, I would like to thank the hardworking staff of the Department of Justice and Attorney-General for their diligence in seeing this project through to completion. I would like to thank Louise Shepherd, one of the excellent policy officers who we have working in the Department of Justice and Attorney-General and who does terrific work in the area of criminal law reform, and Jo Hughes. I would also like to thank Amanda Dulvarie and Chris Roney, formerly of the Department of Corrective Services, who provided a wealth of information on the management of sexual offenders. I also thank Kathryn Allan from the Department of Premier and Cabinet for her work. Workers in the Office of the Queensland Parliamentary Counsel have done an excellent job drafting the bill. I thank them also. I commend the bill to the parliament. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104553"></A>
Before proceeding, I want to say a few things about the amendments in toto. The amendments I will be moving are mainly drafting amendments aimed to ensure clarity of the operation of the provisions which allow offenders sentenced to an indefinite sentence which is later converted to a finite sentence to be granted parole by the Queensland Parole Board. The amendments will ensure that the bill achieves its objective that all such offenders must be under the authority of the Queensland Parole Board and the supervision of an authorised corrective services officer for at least five years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104555"></A>
I will also move amendments to the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act to recognise that the first five years of a prisoner’s release from detention is the highest risk period in terms of reoffending. The provision in the bill which imposes a five-year cap on supervision orders is omitted and in lieu a provision which imposes a minimum mandatory period of five years for supervision orders is inserted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104556"></A>
Consequential to this I will also move an amendment to the provisions of the bill that provide for the making of further supervision orders so that a released prisoner is liable to only one further supervision order in relation to a current supervision order. The amendments I will move also make a number of drafting amendments to other clauses in the bill, again to ensure the provisions are clear from any possible ambiguity. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It has been absolutely breathtaking to listen to the Attorney, in summary, basically standing up there and saying that it is not unusual to make amendments to legislation introduced into this parliament. That is the case, but the original amendment bill which was brought into the parliament on 1 September last year--it has sat on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper </Hansard-Italic>
for one year and one day--contained 47 clauses, yet today the Attorney seeks to move 30 amendments to those 47 clauses. It just goes to show what a cobbled-together, ramshackle piece of amending legislation we had in the first place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104558"></A>
There is no consistency of principles whatsoever between the bill that was introduced on 1 September last year and what we are debating here today. There is a similarity in that the bills seek to amend the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act, but there are some significant departures from there on out. Let us look at one of the major amendments that will be moved today which I think demonstrates the absolute confusion of this government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104559"></A>
When the Attorney introduced the bill to this parliament on 1 September last year, he actually proposed that a court not be able to impose a period of supervision of more than five years. There was to be a maximum period of supervision of five years but in the most exceptional of circumstances you could go back after five years and seek an additional order or an extension of the order. So it set a finite period of time. In the bill as we are debating it now, the time is completely up to the court, based on the circumstances that the court actually sees. Do I believe that the court actually gets it right on all occasions? Absolutely not! If the court got it right on all occasions, we would not see the number of people being released into the community who are still a risk to society and we would not need to come back into this place and make these amendments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104560"></A>
I have no problem whatsoever with this parliament, as a sovereign parliament, actually laying down a set of directions for the court to follow in making these decisions. We are a sovereign parliament. It is our right to do that. The courts then simply administer or interpret the laws which have been passed by this parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1104561"></A>
Indeed, once again we had the Attorney stand up tonight, in his absolute confusion, talking about this abomination of some sort of mandatory approach in our courts because it sought to in some way eliminate the discretion of the courts. So it was wrong to have any mandatory direction over the courts. Yet by the amendments which he will move, particularly to clause 8, he seeks to impose a mandatory period of community supervision of at least five years. Oh, my goodness! A mandatory period of supervision! Does that seek to restrain the courts in the carrying out of their duty and their discretion? Absolutely. And so it should. But again, we have this absolute confusion in the way that this government goes about enacting laws. As the minister spoke about all of the amendments that will be moved together, I intend to make my contribution as such. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109153"></A>
We have heard what we should be doing with these offenders. Absolutely nowhere in the amendments which have been moved by the Attorney and in the bill itself do we see that a prisoner should compulsorily undertake and successfully complete a sex offenders rehabilitation course. Indeed, only about 10 per cent of sex offenders do such a course. Some 80 to 90 per cent of them do not undertake a course or are not offered that opportunity. So we have them going back out into the community without doing that. Is there any wonder that there now needs to be this mandatory minimum period--</Hansard-Body>

Once again, rewind and come back to this parliament on 1 September last year when the Attorney-General introduced a bill to the House which said that the period of community supervision could be no longer than five years. Something has actually changed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109156"></A>
Was it Robert John Fardon and the actions of that person which motivated this bill in the first place and the panic amendments which were suggested came as a consequence of a review process in 2007 and his subsequent imprisonment for raping a disabled women whilst under a period of community supervision? The fundamental difference between us and the government when it comes to dealing with this is that this is not actually testing the bounds of constitutionality with the so-called safety net which has been put on the other end of a person’s finite sentence--as we have seen here with a sentence being imposed by the courts--where the government is now being forced to actually test the bounds of constitutionality. We have seen that happen with regard to the Kable case in New South Wales. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109158"></A>
We have to make sure that at the front end of the process a recidivist offender is given a head sentence which is actually commensurate with the nature of the particular crime. This is what happened a number of years ago in Queensland with the prisoner Murdoch, otherwise known as the Black Stallion, who went out and committed other sexual offences after he was released. He was taken back to court and then held at Her Majesty’s pleasure. He is still in the prison a generation down the track. Those sorts of people should actually be held in prison--as should the likes of Fardon--until they are no longer a danger to society. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109159"></A>
We had a situation earlier this year where a penalty was imposed under the Criminal Code, as directed by the Penalties and Sentences Act, which saw a person who has now had a string of offences being sentenced to probably their lightest sentence since their criminal history began in 1967. He was sentenced to 10 years. He might serve eight years imprisonment for the rape of an intellectually disabled woman. In 1989 a person who raped somebody was actually sentenced to 14 years imprisonment and served that time. Was that enough? Probably not, but it is a lot more than they get today even though they have a far longer criminal history to refer back to. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109160"></A>
That is what we need our sentencing courts to do. We need the principles of the bill and the principles of legislation to change to ensure that those people who actually commit these crimes are dealt with--two strikes and they are in. That is, they are sentenced by the court to never be released. That is basically the situation we are dealing with. I think it is arguable whether they deserve the amount of discretion that we see in the first sentencing instance. One would imagine that if somebody has such a history of recidivist sexual criminal activity they cannot be rehabilitated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109161"></A>
What we have here is a real hotchpotch. This government has now been forced to test the bounds of constitutionality. I do not disagree with what the police minister said earlier on or what the Attorney-General said earlier on. This parliament is going to take the approach of trying to put a bandaid on the problem rather than actually deal upfront with the issue of directions to sentencing courts. What we saw in New South Wales with regard to serious sexual offenders is that only a couple of years ago some notorious rapists, first time offenders, were actually sentenced for periods of in excess of 40 years. The answer for the Attorney lies in that particular case study. There is no problem with a parliament being able to pass laws that direct a sentencing court with regard to how prisoners should be originally sentenced. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1109163"></A>
If we have a situation where the parliament seeks to try to deal with a prisoner who is given a finite term of imprisonment and expand that sentence or expand that period of incarceration either by continuing detention in small increments or by community supervision then of course that impinges on a whole range of rights and liberties issues which have been upheld by our courts, particularly the High Court. We have no argument with regard to this being on the bounds of the constitutional frontier. Our concern is that we should not be in this position. The government has been completely inconsistent. It is now being forced to amend that which it said was good enough and safe enough for the community and introduced into this place on 1 September last year. We cannot have a situation where a 47 clause bill has 30 amendments. </Hansard-Body>

 The only thing that the parliamentary record will show is that the LNP voted in this parliament against strong measures to protect Queenslanders. That is what the record will show. The record will show that today and in the future. Honourable members opposite should be ashamed that they are not standing up to protect the most vulnerable Queenslanders and to protect the people whom they say they want to protect--children, disabled people and vulnerable people. They voted against it. That is what the record will reveal--a shameful day in the history of the LNP. For the sake of completeness, I table the explanatory notes to the amendments that I should have tabled earlier.</Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 For somebody who rallied against verballing at times past in Queensland, the Attorney is an absolute expert on it. What we voted against in the second reading debate is a repugnant provision in a piece of legislation which this Attorney introduced into this parliament on 1 September last year which sought to place a maximum five-year period of community supervision on serious sex offenders--dangerous sex offenders--who were being released back into the community. If that bill had passed this parliament tonight without the amendment which we are now supporting, that would have endangered Queensland’s most vulnerable. It would have endangered the disabled. It would have endangered women. It would have endangered children who no longer would have been subjected to the protection of an ongoing community supervision order for those dangerous prisoners, because the Attorney-General by his own admission said that there is a risk that these people will reoffend after five years. He argues that it is a diminished risk after five years, but nevertheless he was going to take away that community supervision after five years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113731"></A>
I would even argue against some of the research that the Attorney has put before this place tonight about a diminishing risk after five years because, as I pointed out, the Canadian experience shows that after 10 and 15 years with certain categories of sex offenders, particularly those with a non-family relationship, the risk actually increases. Let the record of this parliament show that the LNP actually voted against the government’s bill which was introduced into this parliament on 1 September last year which sought to put in place a maximum period of community supervision of five years. The Attorney now stands in this place and seeks to cobble together a group of amendments to amend his own debacle which says, ‘No, it will now be a minimum period of five years.’ I do not know if honourable members in this parliament consider there is much of a difference in that. I think there is a huge difference in principle between a maximum of five years and a minimum of five years. They are totally different in intent. We will be prepared to support that because, at the very least, we need those protections in the community. We will also support the Attorney’s other amendments, because they have made somewhat better a very deficient bill which was brought into this parliament.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113732"></A>
These amendments have now been forced out of the Attorney because he went into the community after he introduced his bill last year and said, ‘Whoopsie! I don’t like the way that this is now being perceived in the community. I need to amend it.’ Certainly, we do need to amend the original bill. It was just an indication of how absolutely unclear the Attorney was last year when he introduced the original amending bill into this House. Again I say do not let the record of this place be distorted by the Attorney’s utterances. Did we vote against the second reading of this bill because it sought to curtail a period of time for which a dangerous sex offender could be supervised? Yes, we did. We felt that five years was inadequate. We felt that was repugnant and so in principle could not support that. But we can certainly support an amendment which makes it a minimum period of time and allows it to go much longer than that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113733"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Let the record show that tonight in the parliament of Queensland the Liberal National Party voted against the following amendments in the bill. This is what it voted against. It voted against amending the act to greatly expand the range of offences for which an indefinite jail sentence can be imposed in Queensland courts. It voted against amendments enabling judges to impose indefinite sentences for many more crimes. It voted against amending the legislation to ensure that indefinite sentences could be imposed in relation to offenders who commit torture, incest, maintain sexual relationships with a child and indecent treatment of a child under 16 years. That is what the Liberal National Party did in the parliament of Queensland tonight.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113737"></A>
Furthermore, the Liberal National Party by voting against the second reading of this bill voted against amendments to ensure that where an offender has their indefinite sentence converted to a finite sentence by a court at a mandatory review, such an offender will be under the authority of the Queensland Parole Board and the supervision of an authorised corrective services officer for at least five years after their release from prison, even when released at the end of their sentence expiry date. It voted against that. It also voted against amending the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act in a significant way such that to require a court when considering whether to impose a supervision order to consider not only the need to ensure the adequate protection of the community but also whether the adequate protections of the community can be reasonably and practically managed by a supervision order and whether any appropriate conditions of the supervision order can be reasonable and practically managed by a corrective services officer.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113739"></A>
We have given the power in this bill to corrective services officers to make a decision about whether they can reasonably and practicably manage a dangerous prisoner in the community, and those opposite voted against it. They voted against it tonight. They also voted in the second reading stage against enabling corrective services officers and empowering corrective services officers to issue binding directions to released prisoners. They do not want corrective services officers providing binding directions to dangerous prisoners. They do not want that. They do not want corrective services officers to have the power to direct dangerous sex prisoners in our Queensland community where they can live. They do not want them to have the power to require dangerous sex offenders to engage in treatment, to restrict their access to alcohol and other substance abuse.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113741"></A>
Regrettably, there are some members of the Independents who also voted against those important measures--those important measures to empower corrective services officers who deal with these people each and every day. They know their behaviour. They know what they are capable of, and that is what the Liberal National Party voted against. It voted against enhancing the ability of corrective services officers to supervise released prisoners without requiring those corrective services officers to go back to court. It voted against that. It voted against giving the power to corrective services officers to be able to appropriately and powerfully supervise dangerous sex offenders in the community without having them go through the hoops of going back to court. That is what it did. The LNP wants corrective services officers to have to make an application to court to better supervise dangerous sex offenders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113743"></A>
That is what the record will show tonight about the LNP. It will demonstrate that that is what the member for Burnett did. The member for Burnett spoke long and large about the need to protect people in the community, and yet he voted against empowering corrective services officers who deal with these individuals to set appropriate frameworks around how dangerous prisoners should be dealt with in the Queensland community. It is a shame. I said it was shameful, and I stand by that comment.</Hansard-Body>

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>
(Mr Wendt): Order! Minister, it would be helpful if we could hear the member for Southern Downs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113747"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am not sure who has been caught out here, but I think the honourable member opposite whom I am currently looking at is probably the one who has been caught out, because the honourable member opposite--the Attorney-General--introduced into this parliament last year a piece of legislation which sought specifically in clause 8 to fundamentally change the way that supervision orders were being directed and were being dealt with and were being ordered by the courts in Queensland. Courts in Queensland, up until the Attorney brought his intended legislation into this parliament, had the capacity to be able to put in place a supervision order ad infinitum--whatever particular period of time they wanted in terms of that supervision order. There was not any intention to impose a minimum period of time; it was a maximum period of time.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1113749"></A>
So regardless of other parts of the bill which may be superficially attractive, something which sought to actually restrict the capacity of the courts to be able to impose a supervision order beyond five years absolutely contaminated this legislation to its very core. The reason that it contaminated this legislation to its very core is that it sought to place the community at risk. Whether that was a deliberate motivation by the Attorney or whether it was some sort of administrative political incompetence is a matter for this parliament to judge, and only the Attorney will ultimately know. If this legislation was as good as the Attorney said it was when he introduced it with its principle preamble in parliament on 1 September last year, then the 37 clauses of proposed amendments would not need to be amended today by another 30 proposed amendments. The Attorney simply got it wrong. It was so fundamentally contaminated to the core that the original bill could not be supported. The real judge of this Attorney-General and the real judge of the intent of this parliament will be when this bill passes through the third reading stage tonight and whether it has the support of all of the members of this parliament.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118309"></A>
As I have indicated tonight on behalf of the LNP, if that repugnant clause that so reduces the protection to Queensland’s most vulnerable citizens--women, children and the disabled--because the courts no longer have the capacity to order the supervision of these offenders beyond five years was taken out, was amended then, of course, we can support it. We believe that there may be a better way of doing this and that is making sure that through changes to our criminal law and other ways that people who are obviously dangerous sexual offenders, and recidivists in particular, should be contained for a longer period of time. That is obviously a difference of opinion. That is obviously a difference of process between the LNP and the government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118310"></A>
But I can assure the Attorney-General of our support for his amendments, which will fix up this bill and which will make it somewhat compatible. So he need not fret about the LNP’s intentions. He need not fret about whether the LNP will support those other aspects that are more palatable and provide that greater degree of flexibility for corrective services officers in Queensland. Of course, we will support that part of a bill, which is fixed up, which will make sure that the courts have a minimum period of supervision that they must impose and that that period of supervision could be indefinite if need be. That is the real test of our commitment to this legislation, not the distortion by the Attorney-General about a vote on the second reading, which is principally around the repugnant element of this legislation that is so fundamentally contaminated to its core as to make it completely unsupportable by the LNP and also a majority of the Independent members in this House.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118311"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I was not going to speak to this clause, but because the Attorney-General verballed me I thought I would rise to speak to this clause. I, too, agree with the LNP that this particular clause is repugnant by stating that the period cannot end later than five years after the prisoner’s release. It is obviously a mistake. It has to be changed. I understand it is being changed and I am glad that it is being changed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118312"></A>
However, there is one other reason I said no and voted against this legislation and that is that this legislation entrenches the government’s right to release dangerous sex offenders back into the community in secret. This whole legislation--and I talked about the philosophy of it--allows this government to release in secret dangerous sex offenders back into my community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118313"></A>
I have asked the police minister in a question on notice to tell me how many dangerous sex offenders have been released back into the Burnett-Bundaberg region so that parents would be able to access a public register to view where these people are living and what they look like. This legislation allows them to go back in secret. As the government has done before, they have released the Fardons, they have released the Buckbys, they have released the dangerous sex offenders who repeatedly rape our children back into people’s streets without warning them. That cannot continue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118317"></A>
In America, they have a law called Megan’s Law, which I support wholeheartedly and I am working towards the day when I am can come into this chamber and present the first private member’s bill for a Queensland Megan’s Law. I do not know whether it will be called that. I will think of an appropriate name. But I use the terminology Megan’s Law because most people understand what it means. It means that we will have legislation in this parliament guaranteeing the right of families to be able to protect their children. What I mean by protecting their children is not vigilante action. The Megan’s Law that I will present will have stringent penalties against, as they do in America, vigilante action. It will simply allow mums and dads to be able to say to their children, ‘See that man’--and it usually is a man--‘He is a bad man. Stay away from him.’ It works in a country of 200 million people or more. Why should it not work for a state with 4.2 million people? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118318"></A>
As I said before, that is the basic philosophical difference between that side of this place--I am not even sure whether the LNP would support a Megan’s Law. As a former LNP member, I know with the inside information that I have that it would be a very difficult debate. I know there are members within the LNP who would not support a Megan’s Law. But we are going to come to that day in due course in this parliament when I will present a private member’ s bill--a Megan’s Law--and then the LNP will have to decide whether it is going to support it. But for tonight, I stand by my guns, I stand for the people of Burnett and Bundaberg--the families of Burnett and Bundaberg--who demand the right to know when the government puts repeat child rapists back onto their streets in secret. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (8.36 pm): I pose a question to the Attorney-General. I will give him a little bit of time to think about it and I hope that he has the courtesy to address this question. It is quite an interesting question and quite a simple question. Who is responsible for the harm that a dangerous sex offender causes when he reoffends after being released into the community in secret by this government? I will repeat that. Who is responsible for the harm that a dangerous sex offender causes when he reoffends after being released into the community by this government? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118324"></A>
We know that there have been dangerous sex offenders who have reoffended after they have been released into the community. There are numerous cases and I am not going to go over that again. But the way I read the bill--and I have looked at clause 11--there is not one clause, including clause 11 titled ‘Requirements for supervised release’, that says, ‘As a part of the requirement for supervised release the name of the offender and the picture of the offender goes on a website so that ordinary families in Queensland can access that website and see where the dangerous sex offender is living.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118326"></A>
Today, we have heard from the police minister that there are 97 dangerous sex offenders and at the moment 39 are in jail. So that means that there are 58 dangerous sex offenders living in our communities in secret. The police minister also told us that he has this great team of police officers who are protecting the community, who are watching over these dangerous sex offenders to make sure, on behalf of the state, that these known repeat child rapists do not reoffend and that they continue to obey the requirements of their supervised release. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1118327"></A>
But what happens when that team of highly motivated and trained police officers fail to do their job properly for whatever reason--whether they are not paid enough, whether they are overworked, which we know police officers are--and the repeat child rapist rapes again while on release? For example, when the repeat child rapist goes to a park down the end of the street where they are living, no-one knows that they are a dangerous sex offender because that is a secret. The police may be on a shift changeover and the repeat child rapist selects a child and then rapes that child. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122975"></A>
Quite obviously the state of Queensland has failed to protect that child from a known rapist. The state of Queensland has broken the implicit agreement that it has entered into with the parents of Queensland children. That implicit promise to Queensland families is contained in this legislation. That basically says to the families, ‘We are going to release in secret, without you knowing about it, these very dangerous people into your neighbourhood, but don’t worry, it’s okay, we will protect you and your children from them because we have got highly motivated and trained police that are watching these people; the offenders are wearing electronic bracelets that tell when they are at home or are not at home, and we have got these wonderful requirements for supervised release.’</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122976"></A>
If the state of Queensland fails to protect families, if it gets it wrong and a child is raped, then what? Who is held to account? Who is responsible if that child is harmed? I put to the Attorney-General that it is indeed the state of Queensland that is responsible for that harm. That is the very reason why they ended up with Megan’s Law in America. If that information is not provided to the families in the street then the state is implicitly responsible for the harm that is caused by those dangerous sex offenders when they are released. If this matter is not addressed then I suggest it is opening up a Pandora’s box of legal actions against the state by people who have harm caused to them by the repeat offending of dangerous sex offenders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122977"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Anyone who breaches the criminal law in Queensland is responsible for their actions and the harm that they cause. Courts exercising criminal jurisdiction in the state will hold an individual criminally responsible for any breach of the law and will deal with them and punish them accordingly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122978"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am surprised that a learned man with so much legal training is able to mount a very minimal argument that it is going to be the dangerous sex offender who is completely responsible. We are talking here about a known dangerous sex offender whose history is known to the state. The state has had umpteen dozen psychological exams and the ability to monitor this person. I am sure that in the future there will be a very clever lawyer who will say that the state itself--indeed, the Attorney-General and the politicians in this place--is responsible for laws that deny families the right to have basic information. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122979"></A>
I will give a practical example of this. The Attorney-General was not here when this happened. This was probably about two or three years ago in the last sitting of parliament. There was a lady who ran a corner store near Wacol train station. At the time that is where the dangerous sex offenders were located in a secure compound--they still are. These dangerous sex offenders would come down and catch the train. They were unsupervised. They were not wearing bracelets. I saw pictures and video of them driving cars and watching mothers as they changed their babies’ nappies. While they were doing this they were grooming this mother’s children who were with her in the store. Under this legislation I think we were breaking the law by informing the mother that her children were being groomed by these dangerous sexual offenders. The mother was informed that her child was being groomed and this mother was absolutely shocked that this was happening. I still remember the statement that she made. All she wanted to be able to do, and which would fix the problem, was to say, ‘Children, they are bad men. Stay away from them. Don’t talk to them.’ It is the old saying, ‘forewarned is forearmed.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122980"></A>
I will go back to my original argument. The state is responsible for any harm that is caused to people and children if dangerous sexual offenders are released in secret back into the community. It is like throwing a loaded gun with no safety on it out in the middle of the street. Of course the person who did that is going to be responsible. It is going to go off at some stage or other. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122981"></A>
Clause 11 subclause (3) amends section 16 in relation to ‘judicial authority’. The Attorney-General talked about that and I think complained about some members opposite talking about the judiciary and the light sentences that the judiciary was handing down. If the Attorney-General really wanted to protect the judiciary from allegations of going soft on crime and being aligned to the softy leftist view of the world, then he would support a system of appointing judges that is removed from politicians; he would support a system of appointing the judiciary other than by politicians as is the case now. There should be a recognised independent body that is able to appoint judges. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr CRIPPS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Hinchinbrook--LNP) (8.53 pm): I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Disaster Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. My electorate of Hinchinbrook has historically experienced, and continues to experience, its fair share of natural disasters and emergencies. My electorate is one of the wettest in Australia. The communities I represent regularly experience very significant flood events during the wet season. North Queensland communities regularly endure serious tropical storm events during the monsoon season, and North Queenslanders periodically have to deal with the impact of tropical cyclones. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128283"></A>
I would like to acknowledge the very significant contribution made to local communities in my electorate of Hinchinbrook by the many local SES volunteers that make up the active units in Innisfail, Mena Creek, Silkwood, Mission Beach, Tully, Cardwell, Halifax, Ingham, Mount Spec/Paluma, Rollingstone and Bluewater. We should always remember that the SES is made up of volunteers. When things get difficult in North Queensland, be it in the face of a flood or a storm or a cyclone, SES volunteers leave their own families to do their duty. They head out into the elements to do the hard jobs that no-one else wants to do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128295"></A>
I also want to mention a group of people who often get left out when we talk about the responses to disaster events, and that is the employees of local councils. Council staff make a largely unheralded contribution to the coordination of disaster recovery efforts in local communities. Council is often left to operate with a skeleton crew, yet they are usually able to maintain remarkable levels of service to the public in very difficult circumstances. Today I would like to discuss a number of issues relating to the response by government agencies to recent emergency events and natural disasters in my electorate of Hinchinbrook, as they relate to the provisions of this bill concerning disaster management. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128298"></A>
In 2006 Cyclone Larry caused extensive damage to public and private property in Far North Queensland including to agricultural crops and business premises. Communities in the northern end of my electorate of Hinchinbrook between Tully and Innisfail were seriously affected indeed. The state and federal governments provided generous financial support to affected farmers and small businesses, which was administered by the Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority. Farmers and small businesses became eligible for that assistance by virtue of being physically located within the area declared as a disaster--in this case, Cyclone Larry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128303"></A>
Disaster areas are declared according to where the physical consequences of a disaster are evident to the degree that declaring a disaster is necessary. Declarations are dealt with in clause 26 and in clause 30 of this bill. I want to raise an issue that I have raised previously in this place with the Minister for Primary Industries, who is responsible for the Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority. The case that I refer to involves constituents of mine in my electorate and it has exposed a limitation in the guidelines that govern the eligibility of access to disaster assistance that assists with the recovery process, which is covered in clause 4 of this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128307"></A>
Mr Ian and Mrs Leah Thomson of Mystic Sands near Rollingstone lodged an application to QRAA for support under the NDRRA Tropical Cyclone Larry program. The Thomsons were the operators of a refrigerated transport company which, although based in Rollingstone, primarily depended on businesses from the Tully, Innisfail and Mareeba districts for their southbound freight in the form of bananas, a crop that was devastated by the cyclone. The Thomsons made application for NDRRA assistance in the wake of Cyclone Larry as their business had been seriously affected.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128308"></A>
QRAA advised that their application had been declined as their business was not located in the defined disaster area. While Cyclone Larry did not cause any physical damage to the Rollingstone area, the majority of the Thomson’s business was generated from the cyclone affected area. Previously, the Minister for Primary Industries had advised me to make an argument to QRAA that the Thomsons may be able to access support along similar lines to what were then recent changes to exceptional circumstances guidelines for businesses affected by drought, whereby, if 70 per cent of someone’s income was derived from a business in a drought affected area, they would be deemed eligible for assistance, even if they were domiciled in another area.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128309"></A>
Notwithstanding that advice from the Minister for Primary Industries and the argument that I subsequently mounted on their behalf through representations directly to him, to the CEO of QRAA and in this parliament, QRAA would not accept the argument. The Thomsons were placed in a very precarious financial situation as a result, and they have really struggled since 2006. I truly believe that they were treated unfairly. This family business fell through the cracks of the government’s response to Cyclone Larry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128310"></A>
Unfortunately, I cannot see amendments in this bill that move to address the problem of narrow and inflexible criteria provided to QRAA for the distribution of disaster assistance to those Queenslanders who have been directly affected by a disaster. Substantial effort must be put into defining the criteria for assistance in these circumstances, in addition to the amount of assistance and the nature of that assistance. Such careful consideration of these matters can be critical to providing much needed assistance to those struggling in difficult circumstances like the Thomsons.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1128311"></A>
Another issue that arose from the experience of my electorate with Cyclone Larry, which is not immediately clear from the provisions of the bill, is the involvement of the defence forces, and this is an issue about which the minister might like to make some clarifying statements during his summing-up. Immediately in the wake of Cyclone Larry, many communities in the northern end of my electorate were completely isolated from one another, not only by floodwaters but by huge volumes of fallen vegetation, by large amounts of debris and by fallen power poles and powerlines. The contribution of the defence forces immediately after Cyclone Larry was very significant indeed. The sheer volume of material, mostly debris and fallen vegetation that needed to be dealt with, was extraordinary. Many government agencies, many local organisations and many individuals made huge contributions to the removal of that material. However, the coordinated manpower that was brought into the former Johnstone and Cardwell shires by the defence forces made an enormous difference, for which the residents of the Cassowary Coast were very grateful. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133985"></A>
I mention the role of the defence forces during the debate on this bill in respect of disaster management and response efforts because the defence forces played a significant role in the process of cleaning up hundreds of tonnes of material that restored connectivity between the local communities in my electorate after Cyclone Larry. The defence forces have responded to other distress calls from around Queensland from time to time and they will no doubt do so again in the future, yet this bill, from what I can see, is silent on how the defence forces fit into disaster recovery efforts, notwithstanding that the bill purports to clarify a number of roles associated with the disaster management.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133989"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Roberts:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 There are well established protocols to engage the defence forces. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133990"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CRIPPS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Sure, and that engagement happens on a number of occasions. But in terms of the fact that this bill takes the opportunity to clarify a number of relationships, the bill still does not have any provisions, from what I can see, to include reference to the defence forces. I just raise that matter and the minister might like to clarify it at the end.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133992"></A>
I turn now to issues concerning the record flood that affected the Herbert River district in my electorate in early 2009. These flood events were the largest flood events in the Herbert River district since 1977. The Bureau of Meteorology rainfall totals for the first nine days of February for locations in the Hinchinbrook shire range from a low of 440 millimetres at Upper Stone, which is just under half a metre, to 1,318 millimetres, or 1.3 metres, at Hawkins Creek. Gauges in Ingham recorded between 900 and 1,000 millimetres for the same period. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133997"></A>
The flood event was caused by very high rainfall associated with Tropical Cyclone Ellie and an active monsoon trough in North Queensland falling simultaneously throughout the Hinchinbrook shire and in the upper catchment areas of the Herbert River, causing it to peak on 3 and 4 February at 12.25 metres. Regrettably, following further significant rainfall in the Herbert Valley and upper catchment areas, floodwaters in the Herbert River peaked for a second time at 12.25 metres on 7 February 2009.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1133998"></A>
When the Premier visited the Hinchinbrook shire on 6 February, I indicated to her that I had been speaking to local stakeholders about what our community required to recover from this major flood event and enhance the capacity of the Herbert River district to better respond to this type of situation in the future, which is why these issues are relevant to today’s debate about disaster management. I wrote to the Premier on 10 February 2009 outlining a comprehensive list of initiatives and projects that I believed could go a long way to achieving that objective and I sought a whole-of-government response from the Queensland government committing to these requests. I was grateful for a very prompt response from the Premier to those representations. I want to discuss the progress of a number of those issues I raised on behalf of my constituents in the Herbert River district, since clause 4 of this bill canvasses matters concerning recovery processes following natural disasters.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134000"></A>
The Ingham Fire and Rescue Service station in McIlwraith Street is the subject of severe flooding during a flood event in the Herbert River district. This is totally unacceptable and, unfortunately, nothing has been done to address this issue to date. The QFRS simply cannot operate effectively during a flood event when its station is under water. During the flooding in February 2009, the Ingham QFRS and the visiting swift water rescue team operated out of the dining room in Lees Hotel in Lannercost Street, which is the main street of Ingham. The Bligh government cannot pretend that this is an acceptable situation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134003"></A>
In contrast, I am grateful that the state government has acted on its commitment to seal the access to the SES facility in Ingham. A full metre of rain and two full weeks worth of heavy vehicle operations around the SES headquarters in Ingham saw the hard stand area around the building disintegrate into a very muddy and unusable area. We had to lay crusher dust as a temporary measure to keep vehicles from getting bogged. That area has subsequently been sealed and it is much improved. The helicopter landing pad has also been sealed and that is also very welcome. I acknowledge the state government has acted to address that particular concern.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134004"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Malone:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 The building needs expanding as well.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134005"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CRIPPS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Indeed, the building does need expanding but I acknowledge that the government did seal the hard stand area around the building and the helipad itself.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134006"></A>
However, I remain somewhat concerned about the response by the government to an issue raised in correspondence with the Premier last year about flood-free access over Palm Creek. The Bligh government is ignoring the fact that the flooding of Palm Creek, which runs through the middle of Ingham and divides the town during flood events, causes significant logistical problems for emergency services, including the ambulance, the Fire and Rescue Service and the Police Service, which is being required through the provisions of this bill to take a lead role in responding to natural disasters. All of those emergency services literally need to divide their manpower and their resources between the two sides of Palm Creek during a major flood event in the Herbert River district. If that does not cause serious logistical problems for a coordinated response to a natural disaster, I do not know what does.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134007"></A>
I have also been disappointed with the Bligh government’s rejection of an application by the Herbert River Improvement Trust for additional allocations to undertake repair work on seriously damaged sections of the Herbert River that occurred during the record flood events in February 2009. Many landowners have been seriously affected by extensive erosion to the banks of the Herbert River adjacent to their properties. Assessments of this damage were done by the Herbert River Improvement Trust and even by officers of the Department of Environment and Resource Management that supported the case for funding to be provided to repair the damage caused by the flood.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134008"></A>
The restoration of the natural environment is covered in this bill under clause 4. In normal circumstances, river trusts can apply for NDRRA assistance to repair existing trust assets that are damaged during a natural disaster. The proposition that was advanced by the Herbert River Improvement Trust, which was supported by reports and assessments from DERM officers, was that this was not a set of normal circumstances and that the extent of the damage to the banks of the Herbert River as a result of the extreme flood event in February 2009 justified the allocation of funding for repair work to be undertaken on newly damaged sections of the river bank.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134009"></A>
I also raised with the Premier the absence of a dedicated emergency accommodation and evacuation centre in Ingham. During the flood event in February 2009, approximately 50 people were housed in the library at Ingham State High School which was utilised as an emergency accommodation centre for local residents evacuated from their homes and travellers caught by floodwaters. It is totally unsatisfactory that the Hinchinbrook shire does not have a dedicated emergency accommodation or evacuation centre, given that North Queensland regularly experiences major flood events, severe tropical storms and cyclones.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1134011"></A>
I sought a commitment from the Premier that, in conjunction with the Hinchinbrook Shire Council, she would provide a dedicated emergency accommodation and evacuation centre with appropriate facilities. When the Premier replied to my representations in respect of this matter, she stated that she would be taking the matter up personally with the then Prime Minister to ensure that funding available through the economic stimulus package for multipurpose school facilities could be used to establish evacuation centres within education facilities to be used in the event of a natural disaster and would be built to a cyclone standard. That undertaking has not gone anywhere at this time, and Ingham still has no dedicated emergency accommodation or evacuation centre.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139582"></A>
Lastly, following the significant flood event in the Herbert River district in February 2009 a Special Disaster Flood Assistance scheme was established by the Commonwealth and Queensland governments and administered on their behalf by QRAA. Once again I refer to clause 4 of the bill, which relates to the taking of appropriate measures to recover from various aspects of a natural disaster in support of disaster affected communities, including economic recovery. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139587"></A>
I made representations to QRAA on behalf of a constituent of mine, Mr Stephen Seri. Mr Seri had applied for assistance through the program I mentioned previously. Mr Seri sought and applied for assistance prior to the program closing. Mr Seri provided quotes that he had secured for repair work by a local contractor to his business premises that was damaged by the flood. The contractors provided the quote in September 2009 but also advised that, due to the extraordinary amount of work they currently had in front of them, they would be unable to undertake the repairs to Mr Seri’s property until the following year. Ironically, much of the work on properties in the Herbert River district that the contractors would have been involved in would have involved claims under QRAA’s Special Disaster Flood Assistance scheme. However, because the contractors were ultimately unable to undertake the repair work to Mr Seri’s business premises before the program closed in November 2009 his claim was ultimately refused by QRAA. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139588"></A>
This decision displayed a total lack of understanding of the circumstances facing people and businesses on the ground in the Herbert River district following the February 2009 flood event. Just like the Thomsons that I spoke about earlier, this is another example of how government disaster assistance packages have not had enough flexibility in the interpretation of their guidelines to provide for the circumstances that face people on the ground who have suffered as a result of a natural disaster. It is an isolated example where someone has fallen through the cracks of this disaster assistance package notwithstanding that, generally speaking, they were generous and they were well received by the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139590"></A>
In general, in terms of both Cyclone Larry and the significant floods in the Herbert River district in 2009, it is safe to say that the response by governments was swift and generous. I should compliment both the federal and the state governments for the work that they did on those occasions. However, I hope that the matters I have submitted tonight may give an insight into some of the practical on-the-ground issues faced by communities that are frequently affected by natural disasters in Queensland. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr RICKUSS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lockyer--LNP) (9.12 pm): I rise to make a brief contribution to the Disaster Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. I would like to congratulate the SES workers in my area. They do a wonderful job during flood events, at road accidents and so on. The major disasters in my area have been floods and fires. In late October or early November 2009 we had quite a major storm event in the Lockyer Valley. It went over to Rosewood and Grandchester. We had over 12 inches in a storm one night and it did create enormous chaos. It washed away fences, flooded houses that had never been flooded before and washed away a bridge. A couple of Telstra workers ended up upside down off a bridge when they were out inspecting lines. It really was a disaster area. Admittedly, the government did act fairly quickly. We had a visit from the Premier and the then Leader of the Opposition, Lawrence Springborg.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139596"></A>
The Disaster Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is an important piece of legislation. In 2003 or 2004 we had a major fire event in the Lockyer Valley when the escarpment up at Toowoomba burned and it burned down to Helidon. The fire at Helidon was caused by some electrical wires lighting. A bit of chaos reigned at that stage because the police in Toowoomba were in control of the event. Unfortunately, they did not realise there were explosive magazines at Helidon. The water trucks had been organised from Ipswich to come up and support the local firies from Helidon, to just make sure the explosive magazines never caught fire, but the police superintendent in Toowoomba sent them back because, as far as he was concerned, Toowoomba was safe as the escarpment had burnt out. The personnel who are organising disaster management have to know the local area. It is no use having someone of higher rank from outside the area tell local councils or local police what they should be doing when they do not know the local area. It really is a recipe for disaster. </Hansard-Body>

Mr RICKUSS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is right. That was the problem. I do not think the police in Toowoomba quite realised the significance of those magazines in Helidon which carry virtually hundreds of tonnes of explosives at any time. There are two manufacturing works there as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139600"></A>
The SES, the rural firies, the police, the local council workers and even Main Roads do a wonderful job when these sorts of situations arise and there are major events. I have been out after fires and have seen council workers out there who have worked nearly all night and into early in the morning to make sure trees do not fall on the Warrego Highway and so on. With the RAAF base at Amberley, which is on the edge of my electorate, we have the assistance of the armed forces. There is also a fairly significant stand of Army personnel beside the RAAF base at Amberley. That is needed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139602"></A>
I support the member for Hinchinbrook and say that the QRAA guidelines do have to be revisited if people are missing out. It is unfortunate. I have had the same sort of thing happen in my area. Some people qualify for assistance yet their neighbour in very similar circumstances misses out. It does make it difficult at times. I think flexibility and common sense have to be used in those sorts of situations. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr CRANDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Coomera--LNP) (9.17 pm): I rise to contribute to the debate on the Disaster Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. I note that the bill refers to the functions of the chief executive. The chief executive is required to ensure that persons performing functions under the act in relation to disaster operations are appropriately trained. The Volunteer Marine Rescue Association of Queensland and the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard need to get support in this crucial area. Both of those organisations are required to work in conjunction with the Queensland Police Service, the Queensland Ambulance Service, the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service, Maritime Safety Queensland and the State Emergency Service. They provide an emergency first-response service and also provide a safety radio network. Furthermore, they are part of the disaster operations as defined in the act where activated by EMQ. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139609"></A>
The issue of training is crucial to these organisations. Recently some funding has been made available for some training for each of these worthy groups. I believe it is around $135,000 each for the coming year. They need a new funding model to ensure their ongoing viability. This really is the important point. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145249"></A>
These organisations are constantly struggling to find the finances to go on and struggling to attract new members to their organisation so they can continue their good work as volunteer organisations. People quite often enjoy the time they spend out on the boats doing safety work and getting people off sand banks and so on, but they are constantly reminded that it is an extremely costly organisation to run and an extremely costly organisation to provide training for. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145252"></A>
It is so important to ensure that these organisations which operate according to the counterdisaster management plan have appropriate training and are able to bring their people up to speed so that they are ready, willing and able to act if there is a disaster. We are talking about all sorts of disasters. We might be talking about bushfires or cyclone activity up and down the coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145253"></A>
I am talking here about two organisations, one of which comprises 25 groups and the other which comprises 22 groups. We are talking about 47 groups. On average there are something like 100 volunteers in each group. We are talking about a big proportion of the volunteer groups in our country. They take care of the coastline for us. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145254"></A>
If we look at what happened along the coastline last year, we see that it was a terrible year for deaths and injury. We had the highest number of deaths on the water ever recorded. In 2009 we lost 20 people to drownings or incidents that occurred on the sea. We are not talking about the high seas. Sometimes things happen out in the big seas but quite often we are talking about people who just went out to do a bit of boating for the weekend and had an accident and someone died. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145255"></A>
We can compare that with the number of people who die on our roads every year. There are thousands of people involved in accidents who suffer injury. We can relate that situation to our waters as well. If 20 people have died on the seas we can only imagine that many more were seriously injured. Members of the Volunteer Marine Rescue Association and the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard are out there in all weather and all conditions. We are not talking about them just being out there in the sunshine. We are talking about them being out there in the cold weather and in the middle of the night. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145258"></A>
I remember being told the story of a fellow who tried to jump between two boats. He missed the second boat and bumped his head. The next thing he was in the water and died. He lost his life last year. He was one of the 20 I spoke of. These guys are out there doing their job in the middle of the night at times. They are first responders. They are out there providing first aid in the first instance to those in the boating fraternity. This is all about their training. It is all about preparing them for a major disaster that might occur anywhere along the Queensland coast or indeed inland. They can be called on at any time to assist with an inland disaster situation. They can be called on at any time to do their share on behalf of the Volunteer Marine Rescue Association.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145259"></A>
I have looked at the VMR models in other parts of Australia. I went to Perth to do this. I was very impressed with the funding model for Western Australia. I spent some time there. I thank the people there for the effort they put in. I visited two of their--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145260"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Bleijie:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 They’re good people.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145261"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CRANDON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 They are terrific people. I take that interjection. They put in a big effort to run me through their processes and their boat replacement program. They were very impressive. There is a few million dollars involved. But let us make a comparison with here. Over there we are talking about $6.4 million in funding. For the two organisations on this side of Australia we are talking about a couple of million dollars in funding. There is a vast difference in funding between the two states. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145262"></A>
Under the model in Western Australian they are fully trained. They are up to the mark as far as their training is concerned. I make the point again that training is extremely important because they operate under the counterdisaster management plan. Funding is essential to ensure that on an ongoing basis we not only train the people who are there but also attract new members. When we attract those new members it is not a matter of just bringing them on and making them the big promise of going out and spending some time on the boats. It is extremely important that we ensure that they have the training they need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145263"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Rickuss:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 We should support our volunteers </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145264"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CRANDON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection from the member for Lockyer. We have to support our volunteers. I note that there are 34,000 members of the rural fire brigade. The training of those folk is essential to ensure that they are safe and properly trained when they go out to fight a fire or get involved in rescue operations. Their work is not just about fighting fires; they are out on the sides of our roads assisting people at car accident scenes. Quite often they are first responders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1145265"></A>
In this case we are not talking about disaster management on a big scale. We are not talking about an organisation that is out trying to assist people in a cyclone situation or in a major bushfire situation. Nevertheless, we are talking about situations where people have suffered serious injury or died. Coming back to the VMR and the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard, those people are in exactly the same situation. Let me give the House a little bit of information. I have looked at the VMR, as I have said, but I have gone a bit deeper into where they are coming under pressure. We have 240,000 registered boats in Queensland. To put that in perspective, that is more boats than in any other state of Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150903"></A>
Some 662,000 Queenslanders hold a recreational licence. Let me put that in perspective: that is 117,000 more licences than just five years ago. Some 662,000 Queenslanders hold recreational licences, up 117,000. That sort of growth in the number of licences is simply putting more and more pressure on the Australian Coast Guard and VMR in this state. Therefore, it is so important that we ensure that the funding is there so that they are ready, willing and able to be part of that counterdisaster management plan if and when it comes to their shores. I urge the government to fully review the funding model for VMR and Australian Coast Guard and indeed consider bringing both groups into the same legislative framework as the SES. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms DAVIS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Aspley--LNP) (9.31 pm): Residents in Carseldine are once again being treated with contempt by this Labor government. Not only were they not informed about the loss of community green space to make way for the ULDA’s inappropriate and unwanted high-rise development on the now abandoned QUT Carseldine campus; they are now being told that they are getting an Energex substation, slated to be built in a quiet cul-de-sac without consultation with locals. Had I not been contacted by concerned residents in McCallum Street querying land buy-ups in their street, we would still have been totally ambushed by Energex when the signs eventually went up. We only learned when I made representations to the energy distributor that it had committed to building a significant substation in amongst residential housing but would only now undertake consultation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150926"></A>
It is clear that Energex was not going to advertise this until September before undertaking what is clearly a fake consultation process. My communications prompted Energex to rush out notices in local letterboxes at the same time as I received a registered post response to my please explain letter. This phoney consultation process was clearly rushed in order for Energex to regain the initiative, but the residents in Carseldine did not come down in the last shower. They know fake consultation when they see it. Sadly, they have become used to it under this arrogant Labor government. We now know that Energex had three other options. While it says it is committed to statutory consultation, we also know that it has finalised the sale and committed to proceed.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1150928"></A>
Not only do I not accept that McCallum Street is a suitable location, but I totally reject that this is anything like real consultation. Consultation means consultation--not just discussing the colour of the paint job or the style of fence. This is another example of the bad culture in some parts of the public sector which starts at the Premier’s office and permeates through departments and public authorities that suggest you can make the decision first and then pretend that informing people after the decision is consultation. That is simply not good enough. In this case it is impacting on people’s homes and their biggest life investment. There are other locations that should be back on the table for genuine consultation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150929"></A>
I support local residents 100 per cent who are worried about the impact this will have on their properties and amenity. One resident has only recently invested around $50,000 on improvements to his property and is rightly angry that he was not advised prior to making that capital investment. People do not buy in cul-de-sacs in order to have substations dumped upon them. It is time these bureaucrats realised that the public pays their salaries through taxes and out-of-control power bills and we deserve more respect. If I have any say, Energex will be back to the drawing board. Frankly, I do not care that it has already bought the land. That is its problem! The residents in Carseldine deserve better.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (9.34 pm): Tonight I want to take the time of the House to welcome a new resident to the electorate of Greenslopes. Vision Australia, a not-for-profit organisation that provides great support for people in our communities who are blind or have low vision, has opened its new Queensland headquarters in the Greenslopes electorate on Old Cleveland Road at Coorparoo. I have been a guest of the Vision Australia team twice in the past week, and I want to thank CEO, Gerard Menses, and regional manager, Karen Knight, for their kind invitations. My first visit was last week when I joined the Treasurer, Andrew Fraser, for the official opening of the new Queensland headquarters. The state government contributed $10 million to this new building, which is a state-of-the-art facility for Queenslanders who have blindness or low vision. It will be home to some 47 staff and more than 50 volunteers who will provide various services such as a low-vision clinic, a kitchen for life skills training, and a seeing eye dog run.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150938"></A>
At the opening I had the privilege of presenting an award to Duncan Collard, who has given more than 50 years of service to Vision Australia and its predecessor organisations. I returned to Vision Australia this week to officially open Texpo 2010--Queensland’s inaugural technology expo for people who are blind or have low vision. This two-day event was held on Tuesday and Wednesday this week and attracted hundreds of visitors who were able to find out more about the technology available to improve their lives at home, in the community and in the workplace. While at Texpo I had a look at numerous displays and was given a demonstration of a modern Braille machine by Karen Knight and Luisa Ferronato. I also had the privilege of presenting awards to some of Vision Australia’s local heroes--the staff and volunteers who help deliver services to more than 4,000 Queenslanders every year. Among them were Colin Ingram, who has notched up 35 years of service, and Ann O’Connell, who has dedicated 25 years to the organisation. Other recipients of awards were Olivia Lam, Greg Bond, Debbie Warner, Michael Bor, Matt Keliher and Paul McKenna. Between them, they have accrued a combined total of more than 140 years of service to Vision Australia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150950"></A>
Vision Australia works hard to establish collaborative relationships within the communities it serves. It also welcomes the input of community-minded volunteers who are willing to lend a hand. For example, Vision Australia is always looking for puppy carers--volunteers who are willing to care for a puppy in their home until the dogs are old enough to go on and become fully trained seeing eye dogs. Vision Australia also has opportunities for volunteers in Queensland to help out as drivers to take seniors with sight issues to one of its four low-vision clinics across the state at Coorparoo, Southport, Maroochydore and Cairns. It also wants people to visit homes to help read the mail and newspapers to people with impaired vision. Anyone who would like to offer their support for Vision Australia can phone 1300847466 and ask to speak to the Brisbane office or visit the website--www.visionaustralia.org.au--and fill out an expression of interest to volunteer form.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Hinchinbrook--LNP) (9.37 pm): I table a non-conforming petition signed by 486 people who have serious concerns about the loss of doctors from the Bluewater Medical Practice in my electorate of Hinchinbrook.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1150956"></A>
The Bluewater Medical Practice operates from two locations on the northern beaches of Townsville at Purono Park and at Bushland Beach. The Bluewater Medical Practice has already lost the services of Dr Olga Gonzalez and Dr Aileen Sarito after they were deregistered by the Queensland Medical Board and there is a real concern that Dr Prashanta Mitra and Dr Victor Mamawal will soon be deregistered by the Medical Board of Australia if something is not done urgently.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150965"></A>
As of 1 July 2010, the responsibilities of the QMB in respect of registrations were transferred to the MBA. One of the criteria used by the QMB until 30 June 2010, and now by the MBA, to process applications by overseas trained doctors to extend their registration is the successful completion of what is known as a pre-employment structured clinical interview. I understand that this involves the OTD appearing before a panel of three GPs and being required to answer scenario based questions for 1 hours. I understand this process does not even involve a representative of the MBA observing the OTD in the work environment to observe their clinical skills.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150973"></A>
Dr Gonzalez and Dr Sarito were deregistered by the QMB following this process. These deregistrations have left the Bluewater Medical Practice short-staffed. Dr Mitra and Dr Mamawal are at serious risk of being deregistered by the MBA in the same way. If these two additional deregistrations occur, the practice will be desperately short-staffed, and this has implications for the ongoing health care and medical attention of the local community. This is a real concern for my constituents on the northern beaches of Townsville. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1150979"></A>
The Bluewater Medical Practice previously treated about 800 patients a week with a full complement of doctors. Following the deregistrations of Dr Gonzalez and Dr Sarito, it has been unable to meet the significant demand for appointments. This inevitably results in a heavier load on the emergency department at Townsville Hospital--a public health facility already frequently unable to cope with demand. If Dr Mitra and Dr Mamawal are deregistered in the near future, it will certainly cripple the Bluewater Medical Practice.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156987"></A>
I strongly support robust testing and close scrutiny of the competence and qualifications of OTDs who seek to practise in Australia. However, something has gone terribly wrong with the process of testing OTDs that has resulted in the deregistration of doctors and the possible deregistration of more doctors in my electorate of Hinchinbrook for reasons that have nothing to do with malpractice or incompetence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156993"></A>
The current policies of the MBA in respect of PESCIs are having a serious impact on the health care of my constituents. How can a scenario based question and answer session, in isolation and without any observation of the doctor’s clinical skills in the workplace, be a robust test of an OTD’s qualifications and competence to practise in Australia? I have made representations at both state and federal levels calling on those agencies responsible for the registration of doctors to give consideration to devising alternative processes for testing OTDs to address this serious issue.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. DM WELLS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Murrumba--ALP) (9.40 pm): The area that I represent includes the Mango Hill-North Lakes region--the fastest growing area of Queensland and one of the fastest growing areas of Australia. It is a dynamic area where new infrastructure is being put in all the time. New transport infrastructure is important. Recently, the honourable Minister for Transport visited my electorate to open a new bus station. New schools are being built and new buildings are being added to those schools. North Lakes State College is the largest school in the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156998"></A>
The most important and exciting infrastructure that is being announced is, of course, the Petrie-Kippa Ring rail link--a rail link that has been envisaged for over 100 years. I take the opportunity to invite the honourable members opposite to recommit to that historic agreement. At the time of the federal election both the government and the then opposition committed to the completion of the Petrie-Kippa Ring rail link. I think it would be very timely for the honourable members opposite to give us an assurance on behalf of their federal colleagues that, in the unfortunate event that the Liberal Party attains government in Canberra, they will keep the undertaking that they made prior to the election and complete that rail link. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1156999"></A>
The state government keeps its undertakings--those that it can complete within its own purview. On 26 June 2009, we purchased land for a new ambulance station at 54 Gregor Street West in North Lakes. It is a well-placed piece of land that is close to Anzac Avenue and, therefore, close to areas outside of North Lakes. It is also close to the shopping centre and the other infrastructure of North Lakes. The total budget for the construction of that ambulance station is $3.5 million. It is going to be an ambulance station that is big enough to run counterdisaster operations. There is going to be space for enough ambulances and enough materiel to deal with any disaster. Contract and tendering is going to be done by March 2011 and it is going to be completed in the first half of 2012. One of the interesting things about this ambulance station is that it is going to be built on a sustainable design. It is going to have a 50,000 litre in-ground rainwater tank, solar hot water, motion-sensor lighting and skylights. It is going to be an environmentally sound building. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157001"></A>
This is only part of the infrastructure that my electorate needs and for the other part my electorate depends on other levels of government. The local council and the state government have played their part as far as the railway line is concerned and we are sure that a Julia Gillard Labor government will play its part too. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr RICKUSS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lockyer--LNP) (9.43 pm): I rise to highlight a couple of issues. One relates to some temporary barriers that have been put on Haigslea-Amberley Road. I have raised this issue with the Minister for Main Roads and the minister for energy should take notice of this issue, too. I cannot believe that the department has hired plastic barriers for over two years for the upgrade of Haigslea Road after it had just moved some light poles. The application was approved for the placement of the light poles. They are rather large poles. They are the big steel ones that have been put in place and they have been put beside the road. Then the department has upgraded the road and decided that the light poles are in the wrong place. Almost $100,000 has been spent on these temporary barriers around the place and now the department is saying that it is going to have to move the light poles again, which will cost many thousands of dollars. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157006"></A>
I think this is a total waste of money. The road is eventually going to be closed off as it will become part of the Amberley air base expansion. Surely this is just a total waste of hundreds of thousands of dollars because of a demarcation between two departments--Energex and the main roads department. Surely this matter should be worked out. I call on both ministers to look at this situation and resolve it. It is just a total waste of money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157008"></A>
The other issue that I want to raise is the southern freight rail corridor. This corridor still has no real prospect of ever getting built. It is a short stretch of railway line of approximately 60 or 70 kilometres from Bromelton to Toowoomba. It is just totally nonviable. It will never, ever get built. Everald Compton, who has been working for a number of years on the Sydney to Melbourne railway line, says in his latest newsletter--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1157011"></A>
... it is economically and socially unviable from Toowoomba to Brisbane, where two massive tunnels must be built and hundreds of houses destroyed to build a track. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157012"></A>
This is just a totally non-viable, nonsensical line. The government has now run out of money and it cannot assist the people who are in the line’s path. From what I have heard, the government has stopped offering payments to landholders who are in the path of the track. It will never be built. Any rail link under 400 kilometres long can never be viable. We spend an enormous amount of money subsidising rail now. If we are going to have a decanting centre, surely any major freight centre should be up at Toowoomba and be decanted from there for the south-east corner. The idea of a line ever being built from Toowoomba to Bromelton is just a fantasy. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms GRACE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Brisbane Central--ALP) (9.46 pm): When it comes to holding fetes in Queensland, no-one does it better than the schools in the Brisbane Central electorate and the Windsor State School fair, held on Saturday, 28 August was no exception. The school was celebrating its 145th birthday and it had a fantastic tent where past students could go to enjoy reminiscing about the good times they had at the school. Present at the fete were the president, Mark Brooke, the principal, Peter Cooper, the deputy principal, Matt Kweon, and they were all very proud of what was achieved at the fete on Saturday. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157020"></A>
However, the fete did not happen on its own. The fair convenors, Sabina Conicanin and Glenys Kerr, did a fantastic job in ensuring that the fete--or the fair--was a fantastic success. But they, too, did not do it alone. They had an additional 150 parent volunteers who pulled together to make sure that the fair was an amazing success. They raised approximately $65,000 to $75,000 on the day and these are much needed funds that will go towards the building of a new multipurpose sports court for the school. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157022"></A>
The new hall and classrooms were a great success, built with combined federal BER funds and state funds. A total of about $5 million was spent on these fantastic buildings. Children use the hall for entertaining the public and the class art auction was held there, where Mark was able to raise thousands of dollars for the school. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157023"></A>
It was a pleasure to open the fair, which looked like a mini RNA, by the traditional way of sounding the old World War II siren which had survived and was in the school’s possession. It is a unique and interesting way of declaring the fair open. All of the school community had a wonderful day and the children looked like they were enjoying themselves immensely and having a fantastic time. Congratulations to all involved, and I am very happy to have been the highest bidder on two items at the silent auction. I look forward to picking up my winnings very soon. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157024"></A>
The next day, on Sunday, Michael and I participated in the enormously popular Bridge to Brisbane in the five-kilometre walk. We were joined by thousands of other walkers and runners and it was great to see the minister as well. The Bligh government’s $50,000 sponsorship of this event continues its involvement in what is a great community fun run as getting active is one of the best ways to improve our quality of life, both physically and socially. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157025"></A>
 I remember launching the 2010 Bridge to Brisbane on behalf of the minister on 31 May. I could not believe how quickly the actual day came around. From humble beginnings in 1997, when only 4,500 people participated to well over 40,000 entrants this year, the Bridge to Brisbane has become the biggest community sporting event in Queensland. This event accords well with the government’s goal to get more and more Queenslanders out exercising for at least 30 minutes a day. My husband and I look forward to participating in next year’s event. It was great. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.49 pm): Honourable members, DERM and Queensland Health seem to have a major problem clearing their desks of easy straight-forward cases. We have two problems in the Gaven electorate where they both need to get cracking--the Carrara Health Centre in relation to parking for the staff and residents and the Coomera River at Clagiraba.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162969"></A>
Carrara residents and Carrara Health Centre staff have a big problem with car parking. The centre currently has none. It is a very significant step-down facility from the Gold Coast Hospital. These car parking spaces cannot be accessed. Currently in the basement of the centre there is room for 40 vehicles under cover and probably the same outside. The only thing missing is the access driveway. The council has already granted the land to the government for this purpose and done all the paperwork. DERM and Queensland Health have done nothing for nine months. Contrary to the health minister’s promise back in February that the project would be completed by mid-2010, work has not even begun. One hundred metres of bitumen pavement with basic drainage is all that is required to get cars off roads, footpaths and local driveways to ensure the safety of staff and sanity of residents. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162970"></A>
Locals are asking how hard can this be? Queensland Health must be asleep at the wheel. It claims that the delays are due to the planning process. Neither department has any excuse for such a simple project taking so long. Both departments and the minister must be following a script from the TV classic <Hansard-Italic>
Yes, Minister</Hansard-Italic>
. I have had no response to my last question on 2 August 2010, which is the third in a series over the last nine months. In addition, a new school located 200 metres from the centre has opened exacerbating the car parking nightmare. Why are Carrara residents less deserving than those of other Labor electorates? Why has the health minister abandoned his own staff’s safety? Staff and residents rightfully demand that the Labor state government builds the driveway to access the car park without delay.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162971"></A>
In Clagiraba, DERM cannot seem to get its head around sawing through trees at their bases to stabilise the gravel that is potentially a major cause of river flow obstruction. This obstruction led to major floods along the Coomera River earlier this year and last--not to mention that no geomorphic study has been done. Young people lost their lives on this river in a previous serious flood. After a spectacular 24-hour downpour in February this year, the Coomera River broke its banks and destroyed the livelihoods and properties of residents right along the river to Upper Coomera. Property owners are fearful of the consequences of what might follow the higher than average rainfall period we are moving into. We have just had the wettest August on record. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162972"></A>
DERM disregarded the downpour in February stating it was merely natural and there was little they could do. Well, this is not the case and locals are asking for a few trees to be cut back and funding from DERM to assist in undertaking a geomorphic audit of the river. Then, accordingly, DERM and the state government must address the problems outlined in the audit. Locals need this short-sighted Labor government to get on board with long-term solutions as this will continue to be a long-term problem if not addressed properly now. These are not significant changes. These are trees in the river blocking river flow and people’s homes and lives are in danger. Please, something should be done. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(9.52 pm): I have spoken before in this place about how proud I am to represent the people of the Morayfield state electorate in the Queensland parliament. My pride was reinforced last weekend at two events. As members may be aware, last week was Keep Australia Beautiful Week. Keep Australia Beautiful Week is held at the end of August each year and seeks to remind people about the simple things they can do in their daily lives to reduce their impact on the environment and encourage action.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1162976"></A>
The theme for this year’s Keep Australia Beautiful Week was focused on encouraging public place recycling and reducing litter on our streets. So, along with local Neighbourhood Watch groups, I hosted a Keep Australia Beautiful clean-up event at Platypus Creek Environmental Park last Saturday. Not only did this clean-up event present a good way for our local community to celebrate Keep Australia Beautiful Week, but also it gave us the opportunity to do something constructive for our local area. The Morayfield state electorate is a great place to live and work and by keeping our area clean and tidy we are helping to make this place an even better place to live. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Irene, Geoff, Peter, Mico, Frances, Dulcie, Marilyn, Anne, Neda and Del and all the residents of Caboolture South for supporting the clean-up of Platypus Creek Environmental Park. By keeping our area clean and tidy we are doing our bit to help keep Australia Beautiful.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1162978"></A>
Not only does Freak Morice come from the Morayfield state electorate, but its band members attended local schools and have been heavily involved in the local community. The impressive thing about this band’s members is that they are all from the one family and they are all young people. The band is led by singer, guitarist and songwriter Kahlia. Kahlia is 17 and is an amazing talent. Alongside Kahlia are her siblings--Daniel, who is 15 and is the lead guitarist; Joel, who is 14 and is the band’s drummer; Nathan, who is 12 and plays the bass guitar; and Shani, who is 11 and is on the keyboard. Together they are Freak Morice and they are not only great examples of the wonderfully talented people who live in the Morayfield state electorate but they are great role models for young people. I am so proud of their achievements to date and I know that they will do great things into the future. As a sign of things to come, Freak Morice will next perform at the Caloundra Music Festival with Powderfinger and Jet. Good on you, Freak Morice<Hansard-Italic>

The Beaudesert Show opens tomorrow night and I will be at the rodeo at 6.30 pm wearing my Akubra, jeans and RM Williams belt to blend in with the community. I am looking forward to 3 and 4 September. The Beaudesert Show is always a fantastic way to bring the community together. I congratulate the committee on the many months of work leading up to this. </Hansard-Body>

I have been lobbying the Minister for Police for a PCYC for the Beaudesert district. There is some land for sale right next to the Beaudesert High School. This would be an opportune time to purchase, given that there are 1,500 or more students at the school. The closest PCYCs are some distance away from the Beaudesert region which has a growing youth population. The closest ones are in Beenleigh and at Logan. </Hansard-Body>

An overpass on the Mount Lindesay Highway is needed to join Johannes Street and Tamborine. There is a pedestrian crossing for the school on a highway which is completely inconvenient, unsafe and impractical. I would urge that the minister looks at the safety around there. </Hansard-Body>

I also opened the Art and Soul Gallery in Boonah last Saturday. I congratulate Valerie and Cameron on such a wonderful display of talented artists such as Tabitha and Leanne Walker. </Hansard-Body>

I have been recently contacted by Scenic Rim Regional Councillor Virginia West to say that unfortunately council officers cannot deal with domestic animals and livestock on state controlled roads. I would urge the minister to look at this local law because it is completely impractical and presents a very real danger to those motorists and wandering animals. Under state controlled roads council officers do not have those powers. They have made representations to the DTMR with respect to addressing this issue urgently. However, they have been unable to achieve a satisfactory resolution on this matter. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr PITT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mulgrave--ALP) (9.58 pm): Last week I was pleased to join with the Yarrabah community and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships, Minister Desley Boyle, to unveil a new sign recognising one of Queensland’s Indigenous heroes--Reverend James Noble. Reverend Noble was Australia’s first Indigenous Anglican clergyman and played a very important role in Reverend Ernest Gribble’s efforts to establish the Yarrabah mission--often standing up for other community members who were unable to stand up for themselves.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163035"></A>
Reverend Noble was born on the Statton River near Kowanyama, studied at Scone in New South Wales and worked as a stockman in his distinguished and varied career. He moved to Far North Queensland at the end of the 19th century. He was a licensed lay reader in St John’s parish in Cairns, and with his wife, Angelina, he performed religious duties, performed missionary work and helped Indigenous people resettle at Yarrabah, as many families were forcibly relocated to the mission. He spoke more than 15 dialects which helped him with his negotiation work between local Indigenous people and other parties, and he was often used as a tracker and interpreter.</Hansard-Body>

The Bligh government has provided $3,000 towards a new sign for the complex--fulfilling a promise made at the Yarrabah community cabinet in July 2007 to replace the original sign, which was blown away in a cyclone. Local residents quite rightly would not let us forget this commitment. I thank the minister for hearing my representations over many months and for ensuring that this project was followed through.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

I also want to take this opportunity to thank the Yarrabah Aboriginal Shire Council for their assistance with this project. The Reverend James Noble Sports Complex--established in the 1990s as a drop-in community centre--is now home to one of the leading PCYCs in Queensland. Activities include after-school and vacation care, a gym, fitness classes, local events like ‘dive in movie nights’, as well as hosting local celebrations such as Youth Week.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1163040"></A>
The PCYC recently received $27,272 through the Gambling Community Benefit Fund for the purchase of sports equipment and resources to continue this great work. However, the PCYC is but the service that is currently provided at this facility. Because services may come and go, it is important that the centre should herein be referred to by its proper title--the Reverend James Noble Sports Complex.</Hansard-Body>

On the day of the sign unveiling, many family and community members paid tribute to Reverend Noble, including former Yarrabah mayor Vincent Mundraby. The reverend’s great-grandson Hilton Noble said his family was very proud of Reverend Noble’s achievements. He said his ‘great-grandfather was a Kokoberra man and the first Aboriginal manager, supervisor and caretaker of Yarrabah’.</Hansard-Body>

Reverend James Noble played an invaluable role in the history of our region. The complex that is named in his honour will, I hope, ensure that his legacy lives on and that his work will never be forgotten. <Hansard-Speech-End>
